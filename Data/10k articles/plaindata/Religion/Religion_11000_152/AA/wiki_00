It uses artistically talented formal members of Adidam with some professional help. \n\nThe central theme, meaning and script content of \"The Mummery Book\" and its theatrical impact appear to be related (most closely) to this definition of mummery: \"a ridiculous, hypocritical, or pretentious ceremony or performance.\"\n"}

The tribal society of central India used to have its own hierarchy, with clans ranging from priestly class, warriors to service or menial class. The tribal society had special respect for its warriors and martial clans. Bhar is one such clan, which in the medieval period had its own small principalities in various parts of North India. The Bhar formed small kingdoms in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh region, until they were disposed by invading Rajput and Muslim groups in the later Middle Ages. The last Bhar raja was killed by Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, the Sultan of Jaunpur.\n\nInfluenced by the Arya Samaj movement, as were members of other lowly castes, Baijnath Prasad Adhyapak published \"Rajbhar Jati ka Itihas\" in 1940. This book attempted to prove that the Rajbhar were formerly rulers who were related to the ancient Bhar tribe.\n\nThe Bhar are primarily a community of small cultivators who supplement their income by wage labour. Landholdings are small, and many Bhar work on fields owned land. The Bhar are a Hindu community, and have customs similar to other Hindu communities of the Awadh region. They speak Awadhi and Bhojpuri. The community are found in the districts of Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Mau, Varanasi, Ambedkar Nagar and Faizabad.\n\nCommunities that are related to the Bhar by occupation in Uttar Pradesh include the Batham, Bind, Dhimar, Dhinwar, Dhewar, Gariya, Gaur, Godia, Gond, Guria, Jhimar, Jhir, Jhinwar, Jhiwar, Kahar, Kashyap, Keot, Kewat, Kharwar, Khairwar, Kumhar, Machua, Majhi, Majhwar, Mallah, Nishad, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Riakwar, Tura, Turah, Turaha, Tureha and Turaiha. There were proposals in 2013 that some or all of these communities in the state should be reclassified as Scheduled Castes under India's system of positive discrimination; this would have involved declassifying them from the Other Backwards Class (OBC) category. Whether or not this would happen was a significant issue in the campaign for the 2014 Indian general election.\n\nThey are among 17 OBC communities that were again proposed for Scheduled Caste status by the Samajwadi Party-controlled Government of Uttar Pradesh. However, this proposal, which relates to votebank politics, has been stayed by the courts; the prior attempt had been rejected by the Government of India.\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}

Many of the earliest translators of Buddhist literature into Chinese were from Parthia and other kingdoms linked with present-day Iran.\n\nBuddhists were persecuted during the Sasanid rule in the vast territory they ruled, as they made Zoroastrianism the state religion in 224 AD, and thereafter burned many Buddhist sites in the regions where it was practised, namely Central Asia. Surviving Buddhist sites in the easternmost Sassanian territories comprising modern day Central Asia were later raided in the 5th century by the White Huns.\n\nAt the time of the Arab conquests in the mid-7th century, much of the eastern Iranian world was mainly Buddhist. Afghanistan is rich in Buddhist sites; others have been found in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and within Iran itself. The Arab conquests brought the final demise of Buddhism in Eastern Iran and Afghanistan, although in some sites like Bamiyan and Hadda it survived until the 8th or 9th century.\n\nMongol ruler Ghazan, who received Buddhist education in his youth, converted to Islam in 1295 AD and made it the state religion of the Ilkhanate. He also prohibited the practice of Buddhism, but allowed monks to go into exile into neighboring Buddhist regions.\n\nIn recent years, as part of the post-revolution period, Buddhist ideas and practice, as part of a broader reemergence of various faiths in Iran, has experienced an upsurge of interest among Iranians.

{"id": "54578117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54578117", "title": "Chullakalinga", "text": "Chullakalinga\n\nChullakalinga (Odia: ଚୁଳକଳିଙ୍ଗ) was an ancient prince of Kalinga (Odisha) who has been mentioned clearly in the Chullakalinga Jataka and Kalingabodhi Jataka Buddhist records. Both the Jatakas mention the tale of Chullakalinga in the light that the events happened in the lifetime of a Bodhisttva who might have been visited by Buddha himself later in the period of Kalinga II who was also Chullakalinga's descendant. Chullakalinga existed before the birth of Buddha and his timeline could be cautiously placed around the 6th century B.C.E but this since the records about him are obtained from the narrations of Buddha himself, it is difficult to place the exact date which could vary immensely to the time before Buddha's era.\n\nChullakalinga and his elder brother Mahakalinga were born to Kalinga I, the king of Kalinga who might have been a vassal of Dandakarnya forest kingdom known as Dandaka whose ruler was known as Dandaki. The Jatakas speak of the fall and partition of Dandaka into Kalinga, Assaka and Vidarbha kingdoms which were opponents to each other. On the birth of Chullakalinga, fortune tellers prophesied that his elder brother Mahakalinga would become a Chakravatii and he would become an ascetic. Being aware of this prophecy, Chullakalinga became jealous, arrogant and notorious. On becoming the king, Mahakalinga ordered the arrest of Chullakalinga due to his improper behavior. After being informed by a courtier (Kalinga Bahardvaja), Chullakalinga escaped arrest and ran away in the Himalayan forest kingdom of Himavat and lived in the disguise of an ascetic. Before leaving he had showed a ring with a seal, coverlet and sword to the courtier as a token so that he could identify later his son when he returns to claim the throne one day.\n\nThe King and Queen of the kingdom of Madda (Madra) had run away from their city of Sagala with their daughter. According to the Jatakas, the fortune tellers had predicted that the their daughter would give birth to a Chakravartii in future and this prophecy led to a situation when every possible king or prince wanting to produce a powerful heir to their throne in future approached the king for his daughter's hand in marriage. Due to this unfavorable disturbance and interference by multiple powerful kings, the king and queen of Madda ran into the forest for the safety of their daughter.\n\nWhile taking bath in the river Ganga one day, Chullakalinga encountered the princess in the forest singing and collecting flowers. One of the flowers got stuck in the hair of Chullakalinga and being attracted to her, he followed the princess to her parents. After taking the approval from the convinced King and the Queen, Chullakalinga married the princess. A son with auspicious signs of good luck and virtue was born to both of them who was named as Kalinga (later to be known as Kalinga II).\n\nKalinga II grew up by learning all the necessary arts of a future king from his father and maternal grandfather. On the death of Mahakalinga in Dantapura, Chullakalinga asked his son to go to the kingdom and claim their ancestral throne. Kalinga II carried the three tokens of his father and met up with Kalinga Bhardvaja who helped him to be crowned as the king. Kalinga Bharadvaja taught the king ten rituals which a universal monarch or Chakravartii had to perform.\n\nChullakalinga's tale along with that of his son Kalinga II was narrated by Buddha himself as stated in the Jatakas. One of the Jatakas itself is named after him as \"Chullakalinga Jataka\". Chullakalinga never managed to become a king due to threat from his elder brother and his own unruly behavior as a youth, although he did show the way to his son Kalinga II to become a powerful monarch in the state of Kalinga in the ancient times.\n"}
{"id": "9721898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9721898", "title": "Church of Aphrodite", "text": "Church of Aphrodite\n\nThe Church of Aphrodite is a Neopagan religious group founded in 1938 by Gleb Botkin (1900–1969), a Russian émigré to the United States. Monotheistic in structure, the Church believes in a singular female Goddess, who is named after the ancient Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite.\n\nHaving grown up in the Russian Imperial court, Botkin fought in the Russian civil war on the side of the counter-revolutionary forces after his father, a physician to the royal Romanov monarchy, was executed by the Bolshevik government. Fleeing to Long Island in the United States, he began writing novels and non-fiction books, mostly set in his Russian homeland, before coming to believe in a female divinity and founding the Church of Aphrodite. He won the right to register it as a religious charter in the New York State Supreme Court.\n\nThe only known printed source concerning the doctrine of the Church of Aphrodite is the treatise \"In Search of Reality\" written and published by Gleb Botkin in the 1960s\".\" The treatise opens with the opinion that \"prevalent religious beliefs and standards of morality . . . are based chiefly on . . . fantasies . . . of primitive people of an ancient past”, and he “to develop morally and intellectually, as well as enable us to lead happier lives.”\n\nThe central concept in Botkin's metaphysics is Love, which he defines not as an emotion but \"energy\", which engenders all being. The only “inexhaustible Generator of Love—its Prime Source and Ultimate Object—is the Supreme Deity and Creator.” According to Botkin, the Deity is Creator by the very reason it radiates love, which creates the cosmos. The process of this emanation is “an organic one,” and therefore “the cosmos must be regarded as a fruit of the Divine Organism—not an arbitrarily created artifact.” This is why the Supreme Deity should be visualized “not as a Father God, but the Mother Goddess,” since “it is only the feminine organism which is capable of bearing fruit.” Since Botkin considered love an eternal flow, he based the hopes for the immortality of human beings with the fact that they were consciously capable of love towards each other and the Deity. \"The Beyond\" or \"Paradise\" is a place where evil - the antithesis of Love and its concomitants Beauty and Harmony - is absent. \n\nThe relationship between the Goddess Aphrodite and the visible world may be illustrated by that between a mother and her child. Having given birth to a child organically, a mother proceeds to take care of it with both her body and her mind. So the Goddess in Her relation with our world is both the Universal Cause and the Universal Mind.\n\nAs it espouses a monotheistic, syncretic faith, its beliefs were not consistent with the modern reconstructionist Hellenic religion of Hellenism but closer to that of [Dianic] Wicca.\n\nAs Neopagan scholar Chas S. Clifton noted, \"Botkin's own writings anticipated by a generation the sort of Goddess religion found later in the pages of Green Egg and elsewhere,\" and which were propagated by Neopagan groups such as Dianic Wicca in the 1960s onward during the Second Wave feminist movement.\n\nGleb Botkin was born in 1900, the son of Eugene Botkin, who was the physician to the Romanovs, the Russian royal family of the time, and as such Gleb grew up in a wealthy background within the imperial household. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, when the Bolshevik Party, a group of Marxists who wished to implement socialist reforms, took power, the monarchy was entirely abolished. A subsequent civil war broke out between those forces that supported the revolutionary government, the \"Reds\", and those that opposed them, the \"Whites.\" The Bolsheviks subsequently ordered the execution of the Romanovs, fearing that the Whites would reinstate them, and so, in July 1918, the family, along with several of their closest aides, including Evgeny Botkin, were shot dead in the basement of the Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg. His son, Gleb Botkin, retreated eastwards with the Whites, but following their defeat, fled via Japan to the United States.\n\nSubsequently gaining employment as a commercial illustrator, Botkin began writing a series of books, both fiction and non-fiction, including an account of his memories of the Romanovs entitled \"The Real Romanovs, as Revealed by the Late Czar's Physician and His Son\" (1931). Many of his fictional stories also drew from his experience and involvement with the Russian aristocracy: \"Her Wanton Majesty\" (1934) was a fictionalised biography of Catherine I, the wife of Tsar Peter the Great, which portrayed her as a particularly lustful figure, whilst \"Immortal Woman\" (1933) dealt with the story of fictional Russian composer Nikolai Dirin, who after being persecuted by the Bolsheviks flees to the United States where he settles in Long Island, the very place that Botkin himself had settled into. \"Immortal Woman\" shows that Botkin was beginning to have ideas about a monotheistic goddess, for instance containing a quote in which the Russian Orthodox priest Father Aristarch states that \"the Supreme Deity must be a woman\" whilst at another point Dirin enters a church and began \"to pray fervently to Aphrodite - his beautiful and kind Goddess whom the Christian Church decried as the White She-Devil, whose worshipers the heads of the Christian Church have repeatedly anathematized.\"\n\nBotkin later moved the church to Charlottesville, Virginia. He self-published a book arguing that Aphrodite was the supreme deity and the creation of the world was like a woman giving birth. The church was one of the earliest of its kind in the neopaganism movement in the United States. Botkin's church is mentioned in \"Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America,\" by Chas S. Clifton.\n\n"}
{"id": "22539785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22539785", "title": "Citizens for Public Justice", "text": "Citizens for Public Justice\n\nCitizens for Public Justice (CPJ) is an ecumenical, non-profit organization that promotes justice in Canadian public policy through research and analysis focused on poverty reduction, ecological justice, and refugee rights.\n\nCPJ defines public justice as the political dimension of loving one's neighbour, caring for creation, and achieving the common good. CPJ's mission statement is \"to promote public justice in Canada by shaping key public policy debates through research and analysis, publishing, and public dialogue. CPJ encourages citizens, leaders in society, and governments to support policies and practices which reflect God's call for love, justice, and the flourishing of Creation.\"\n\nCPJ is a registered charity in Canada whose work is funded through donations from private individuals and members, as well as from churches and foundational grants. Its board of directors is made up of 13 representatives from all regions of Canada. Directors can sit a maximum of two three-year terms. In 2013, CPJ celebrated its 50th anniversary. CPJ is an affiliate member of the Canadian Council of Churches (CCC).\n\nCPJ was founded in Toronto in 1963 as the Committee for Justice and Liberty (CJL Foundation) by Gerald Vandezande. In 1971, it merged with the Alberta-based Christian Action Foundation, led by John Olthuis who joined Vandezande in Toronto.\n\nIn the 1970s, the CJL Foundation campaigned against the proposed Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, which would have been built through the traditional land of the Dene people in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories in order to send fossil fuels from the Beaufort Sea to American consumers. Appearing before the Berger Inquiry, the CJL Foundation called for a 10-year moratorium on the projects. This was reiterated by John Olthuis, Hugh McCullum, and Karmel McCullum in their book \"Moratorium\" and later become a major recommendation of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry by Justice Thomas R. Berger. Tommy Douglas, leader of the NDP, asked to buy hundreds of copies of the book to distribute on Parliament Hill. Eventually, Pierre Elliott Trudeau's government declared a moratorium. This achievement is generally considered to be one of CPJ's biggest impacts, and an early victory for the group.\n\nIn 1982, the CJL Foundation's focus shifted to federal public policy. It officially changed its name to Citizens for Public Justice (CPJ) and drafted \"Guidelines for Christian Political Service\" and \"The Charter of Social Rights and Responsibilities\".\n\nThroughout the early 1980s, CPJ opened regional offices in Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver, while its national office stayed in Toronto. Kathy Vandergrift, a staffer in the Edmonton office, was named Edmonton's Citizen of the Year for proposing what turned into the Blue Box Recycling Program. CPJ was very involved in the push to get that program implemented, conducting workshops in schools & churches, distributing brochures, and forming the Edmonton Recycling Society, who would run the first recycling centre.\n\nIn 1980, Olthuis began representing the Grassy Narrows First Nation whose homeland had been contaminated with mercury. In 1985, a compensation settlement was reached.\n\nDuring this time, CPJ proposed a national Social Development and Job Creation fund. Then, in 1986, CPJ introduced the idea of a government tithe, whereby the government would use 10% of its budget to help the poor. The Toronto Star gave the idea front page coverage, and it was covered by other secular and Christian media as it had received support from Christian leaders.\n\nIn 1988, Harry Kits became CPJ's Executive Director.\n\nIn 1991, CPJ closed its regional offices and moved all of its operations back to Toronto. In doing this they also changed their work to focus on a few key issues in order to get more in depth with each one. This led to more attention being put on research and education around refugee rights and poverty in Canada.\n\nIn the 1990s, CPJ focused on aboriginal rights, poverty, and refugee rights. It was vocal in its support of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Later in the early 2000s, CPJ opposed the widely criticized British Columbia aboriginal treaty referendum around First Nations treaty rights.\n\nIn 1998, CPJ and Campaign 2000 launched \"Let's Invest in Canada's Children,\" a campaign to end child poverty in Canada. CPJ, The Canadian Islamic Congress, and the Canadian Council for Reform Judaism appeared jointly in front of the House of Commons Finance Committee to emphasize the inter-faith support for anti-poverty measures.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, CPJ spoke out against the so-called \"head tax,\" the Right of Landing fee of $975 charged to Convention refugees upon arrival. This fee was removed in the 2000 federal budget. They had also been working on the student loans for refugees issue, and saw a victory on that in the early 2000s.\n\nThe new millennium marked many changes for CPJ. In August 22, 2001, Vandezande received the Order of Canada. CPJ was recognized with a certificate of appreciation from the Somali Canadian Advocacy Network for their refugee work, which continued throughout the decade. CPJ also began its anti-poverty work, educating the public and conducting research. This all led up to the launch of the Dignity for All campaign in 2009.\n\nCPJ moved its headquarters from Toronto to Ottawa in 2007. One of the main reasons behind the move was that CPJ felt that, since they focused mainly on federal issues, being closer to Parliament could help their cause. Their announcement explained that \"public justice calls us to be where the conversations are happening and to bring our more than 40 years of insight, analysis and tested positions. CPJ has a vision of Canada that embraces pluralism, that asks who benefits from policies, and that puts forward helpful alternatives. A national office in Ottawa will let us advance that vision more effectively.\"\n\nThe move was accompanied by staff changes, and in 2008 Joe Gunn became the Executive Director of CPJ. In 2012, Joe Gunn was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal for his work in bringing faith communities together behind the \"Interfaith Call for Leadership and Action on Climate Change.\"\n\nCPJ's founder Gerald Vandezande died in 2011 at the age of 77, but his legacy continues through the work of CPJ.\n\nIn 2009, Citizens for Public Justice and Canada Without Poverty founded Dignity for All, a non-partisan campaign which calls for a national anti-poverty plan for Canada. Every year on October 17, the Dignity for All campaign marks the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty with events across Canada.\n\nThe campaign has been endorsed by many MPs and Senators, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, Green Party leader Elizabeth May; Senators Art Eggleton and Janis Johnson; Ministers Marc Garneau, Scott Brison, Carolyn Bennett, John McCallum, and Kirsty Duncan; and MPs Scott Armstrong, Gerry Byrne, Nathan Cullen, Joyce Murray, Niki Ashton, and Charlie Angus. As well, over 600 organizations and 11,000 individuals have signed the Dignity for All call to action.\n\nCPJ assisted in establishing the All-Party Anti-Poverty Caucus. The group, made up of MPs and Senators of all parties, meets regularly to discuss concrete policy proposals that will end poverty in Canada. In 2011, CPJ helped to gather interfaith leaders in Ottawa to sign the Interfaith Declaration on Poverty in Canada. Signatories included the Canadian Council of Churches, The Canadian Interfaith Delegation – World Religions Summit 2010, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, and the Dignity for All campaign.\n\nIn Spring 2015, CPJ organized \"Justice Tour 2015,\" a delegation of national church leaders who traveled to eight cities to engage people of faith in conversations about poverty in Canada and climate change. Following the tour, CPJ helped to coordinate \"On Promoting Climate Justice and Ending Poverty in Canada,\" an inter-faith declaration from Canadian faith leaders. This was the first such declaration in four years and was endorsed by over 65 signatories.\n\nThe Dignity for All campaign released its model National Anti-Poverty Plan for Canada in 2015. The day after this release, MPs passed a nearly-unanimous motion calling on the government \"to eradicate child poverty in Canada by developing a national poverty reduction plan.\" In 2015, the federal government announced plans to develop a plan. The campaign was active during the federal government's 2017 consultation regarding its forth-coming national anti-poverty plan.\n\nEvery October, CPJ releases a report on poverty in Canada. In 2017, CPJ released \"Poverty Trends 2017.\" The report shows the unequal impact of poverty on certain groups, such as new immigrants, families led by single mothers, un-attached adults, youth, and Aboriginal people. It also presents poverty rates for each province and territory as well as many big cities and small communities across Canada.\n\nBuilding on its history of environmental engagement – including the successful call for a moratorium on the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline in the 1970s and the introduction of municipal recycling programs in the 1980s - CPJ supports effective action to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CPJ is a member of Climate Action Network Canada and the Green Economy Network.\n\nIn 2011, CPJ and the Canadian Council of Churches developed the Canadian Interfaith Call for Leadership and Action on Climate Change, an ecumenical statement endorsed by over 60 faith institutions in Canada. CPJ's Executive Director, Joe Gunn, contributed a chapter entitled \"Taxes and Ecological Justice?\" to the book, The Great Revenue Robbery from Canadians for Tax Fairness. In 2012, the Pembina Institute recognized CPJ's executive director, Joe Gunn as a \"Clean Energy Champion.\"\n\nIn 2014, CPJ published Living Faithfully into a New Climate, a series of faith and climate resources linked to the UN Climate Summit in New York. Later the same year, CPJ coordinated an interfaith prayer vigil to mark COP20 in Lima. In 2015, CPJ coordinated an interfaith, cross-Canada prayer chain throughout the two weeks of international climate negotiations at COP21 in Paris. This was followed in 2016 by a series of actions through which CPJ mobilized Canadians and called for a Canadian climate action plan that establishes a new emissions reduction target and contributes towards meeting Canada's commitment in the Paris Agreement.\n\nCPJ launched a new campaign in 2017 called \"Give it up for the Earth!\" During Lent, Christian across Canada made personal pledges to reduce their carbon footprint. The campaign also included a postcard calling on the Canadian government to pursuing policy changes to fight climate change and meet the Paris Agreement.\n\nCPJ has spoken out against policies that disregard refugee rights in Canada including cuts to the Interim Federal Health program, the Safe Third Country Agreement, and long wait times for privately-sponsored refugees.\n\nIn 2013, CPJ joined the Canadian Council for Refugees' Proud to Protect Refugees campaign. CPJ was also involved in getting church leaders to sign onto the 2013 Human Rights Day Statement which included 47 prominent signatories. CPJ welcomed the Canadian government's plan to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees in Canada. CPJ joined many faith groups in releasing the \"Inter-faith Statement on Syrian Refugees\" in 2014, affirming and insisting that discriminating by religion is unacceptable when resettling Syrian refugees.\n\nIn April 2017, CPJ released \"A Half Welcome,\" a report on private sponsorship issues in Canada highlights refugee sponsorship agreements holders' (SAHs) top concerns with federal government policy, including long wait times, long wait times for non-Syrian applications, allocations limits, and travel loans.\n\nCPJ also comments on other issues such as:\n\nCPJ's publishes \"the Catalyst\" three times per year. The first edition was published in 1978. It includes feature articles on faith and Canadian public policy as well as current activities and events at CPJ. The Catalyst regularly wins awards at the Canadian Church Press annual award ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been identified as Zranka/Zarin, the capital of the satrapy of Zranka/Drangiana.\nThe archeological site known as Dahan-e Gholaman or Dahaneh-e Gholaman (\"Gateway of the Slaves\") is located some 30 km southeast of the modern city of Zabol on a neck of land separating two of the modern Chah Nimeh reservoirs, about 8.5 km from the nearest point on the Iran-Afghanistan border.\n\nDahan-e Gholaman is the largest Achaemenid site in all of eastern Iran. Some 27 structures aligned roughly in a straight line running SW to NE along the northern edge of the site were excavated by the Italian archeologist U. Scerrato in 1962-1965 and by the Iranian archeologist S. M. S. Sajjadi in 2000-2005. Further geophysical and surface exploration in 2007-2011 revealed the outline of another monumental building situated 2 km south of the northern complex of buildings. Several of the larger structures excavated or detected at Dahan-e Gholaman have regular rectangular or square plans and bear comparison with the palatial buildings and audience halls of the Achaemenid royal residences at Pasargadae and Persepolis, as well as Dasht-e Gohar. One of the structures has been identified as a religious building, its three altars possibly dedicated to the leading Persian gods Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra.\n\nThe size of the site, unparalleled in eastern Iran, and the characteristic layout of its public structures indicate that it served as a significant Achaemenid administrative center. Consequently, Dahan-e Gholaman has been identified as the capital of the Achaemenid province of Zranka/Drangiana. As such, the site's ancient name was also probably Zranka or, a variation, Zarin. The site's features exhibit parallels to those attested in the reign of Darius I (522-486 BC), which would match the expected overall time-frame for its construction.\n\nThe absence of stratigraphy at the site suggests a relatively short period of urban habitation, and it probably did not survive much beyond the Achaemenid period (c. 550-330 BC). In particular, if the identification with the capital of Zranka/Drangiana is correct, the site would have been visited by Alexander the Great during his pursuit of the usurper Bessos and his conquest of the region in the winter of 330-329 BC. After the decline and abandonment of Dahan-e Gholaman, the administrative center of the region was transferred 31 km to the northeast, to Nād-i `Alī in what is now Afghanistan, which was called Zaranj (or Zarang) in the Middle Ages. The name has since been transferred, yet again, to the modern city of Zaranj in Afghanistan, located 4.4 km south of medieval Zaranj (Nād-i `Alī) and 28 km northeast of ancient Zranka (Dahan-e Gholaman).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2990836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2990836", "title": "De Brevitate Vitae (Seneca)", "text": "De Brevitate Vitae (Seneca)\n\nDe Brevitate Vitae () is a moral essay written by Seneca the Younger, a Roman Stoic philosopher, sometime around the year 49 AD, to his father-in-law Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many Stoic principles on the nature of time, namely that people waste much of it in meaningless pursuits. According to the essay, nature gives people enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time is best used by living in the present moment in pursuit of the intentional, purposeful life.\n\nSimilar ideas can be found in Seneca's treatise \"De Otio\" (\"On Leisure\") and discussion of these themes can often be found in his \"Letters to Lucilius\" (letter 49, 101, etc.).\n\nThe work is addressed to a man called Paulinus—probably Pompeius Paulinus, a knight of Arelate—and is usually dated to around 49 AD. It is clear from chapters 18 and 19 of \"De Brevitate Vitae\" that Paulinus was \"praefectus annonae\", the official who superintended the grain supply of Rome, and was, therefore, a man of importance. He was likely a near relative of Seneca's wife, Pompeia Paulina, and quite plausibly her father. He is also thought to be the father of another Pompeius Paulinus, who held high public posts under Nero (Pliny, \"Nat. Hist.\" xxxiii. 143; Tacitus, \"Annals\", xiii. 53. 2; xv. 18. 4).\n\nAs for the date of composition, it must have been after the death of Caligula (41 AD), which Seneca mentions in §18.5. Furthermore, there are two known periods when Paulinus could have served as \"praefectus annonae\", 48–55 and 62–71 AD, and scholars prefer the earlier period. A date of 49 AD has previously been suggested because Seneca writes in §13.8 \"that Sulla was the last of the Romans who extended the \"pomerium\"\" (the boundary of Rome). Since Claudius extended this in 49/50 AD, it would have been written before this. However Miriam Griffin has argued that Seneca is quoting a pedant who is asserting that Claudius' extension was illegal, which would mean that Seneca was writing after this date. Griffin has suggested that Seneca wrote \"De Brevitate Vitae\" as an excuse for Paulinus to retire early in 55 AD.\n\nIn chapter 1 Seneca counters the complaint that life is too short with the view that life is long enough if well-managed. Chapters 2 to 9 survey the many ways in which life is squandered and time frittered away by those people (\"occupati\") engrossed in pointless pursuits. Chapters 10 to 17 contrast the philosophical approach to leisure (\"otium\") with the deluded common approach. This culminates in chapters 18 to 20 showing the emancipation of the wise, who can soar above the lives of others mired in endless preoccupation.\n\nAfter the introduction (§1), Seneca reviews (§2–3) the distractions which make life seem short, and explains that people are great wasters of time. He then offers (§4–6) three examples of famous Romans (Augustus, Cicero and Livius Drusus) who, in various ways, were victims of the engrossed life. He explains (§7–8) that the engrossed do not know how to live or have awareness, and that they waste time because they do not know its value. One should purposefully live for the moment (§9), because tomorrow will be too late. In contrast (§10) the lives of the engrossed seem so short to them because they are constrained to the fleeting present, and recollect the past in pain. They desperately cling on to life (§11) because they haven't lived, unlike the wise, who are always ready to leave life behind. The engrossed include those who live in leisure and luxury (§12), and Seneca explains (§13) that even those who devote themselves to scholarship are wasting their time if their efforts are directed to no end. Accordingly, (§14–15) only those who dedicate their time properly truly live, becoming equal with the great minds of the past, allowing the mind of the sage to even transcend time, like a god. The engrossed, on the other hand, (§16–17) are prey to fidgety and contradictory moods, and their joys and pleasures are bitter with the sense of precariousness. Finally (§18–19) Seneca exhorts Paulinus to abandon public occupations and adopt the contemplative life of the wise, free from the passions. This is contrasted (§20) with the suffering of the engrossed: they die without having ever lived.\n\nIn the treatise Seneca argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life.\n\nSeneca urges his readers to live in the present, and adapt themselves to a purposeful life in agreement with Nature. Only by doing so, can one then truly unlock both past and future. The completeness of each present moment allows one's awareness to expand to the equal of that of the universe, and achieve true virtue and happiness.\n\nThe statements which urge Paulinus to retire from public life are in notable contrast to Seneca's advice in his \"De Tranquillitate Animi\" (to his friend Annaeus Serenus) to seek public employments in order to render life attractive. However, in his related treatise, \"De Otio\", Seneca makes the point that there is no inconsistency, and that one can serve the greater community in either or both roles.\n\n\n"}

Several ancient burial sites for dogs have been discovered in Mexico. Xolotl, an Aztec god of death, was depicted as a dog-headed monster.\n\nThe dog is one of the 12 animals honored in Chinese astrology. The second day of the Chinese New Year is considered to be the birthday of all dogs and Chinese people often take care to be kind to dogs on that day.\n\nPanhu is a dragon-dog who transformed into a man and married a princess.\n\nA dog is mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, faithfully accompanying Tobias, Tobit's son and the angel Raphael on their journeys.\n\nJesus told the story of the poor man Lazarus, whose sores were licked by street dogs. This has traditionally been seen as showing Lazarus's wretched situation.\n\nThe Catholic Church recognizes Saint Roch (also called Saint Rocco), who lived in the early 14th century in France, as the patron saint of dogs. It is said that he caught the plague while doing charitable work and went into the forest, expecting to die. There he was befriended by a dog which licked his sores and brought him food, and he was able to recover. The feast day of Saint Roch, August 16, is celebrated in Bolivia as the \"birthday of all dogs.\"\n\nSaint Guinefort was the name given to a dog who received local veneration as a saint at a French shrine from the 13th to the 20th centuries.\n\nA black and white dog is sometimes used as an informal symbol of the Dominican order of friars, religious sisters and nuns. This stems from a Latin pun: though the order's name is actually the Friars Preachers (\"Ordus Praedicatorum\" - order of preachers), it is generally called the Dominicans (after St. Dominic, their founder): \"Domini canes\" in Latin means \"the dogs/hounds of the Lord.\"\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians are often more associated with cats in the form of Bastet, yet here too, dogs are found to have a sacred role and figure as an important symbol in religious iconography.\n\nDogs were associated with Anubis, the jackal headed god of the underworld. At times throughout its period of being in use the Anubieion catacombs at Saqqara saw the burial of dogs.\n\nDogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. Dogs were sacred to Artemis and Ares. Cerberus was the three-faced guard dog of the Underworld. Laelaps was a dog in Greek mythology. When Zeus was a baby, a dog, known only as the “golden hound” was charged with protecting the future King of Gods. \n\nThe dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day Tihar festival that falls roughly in November every year. \nThe dog (\"Shvan\") is also the vahana or mount of the Hindu god Bhairava. Yudhishthira had approached heaven with his dog, therefore among many Hindus, the common belief exists that caring for or adopting dogs can also pave way to heaven.\n\nThe majority of both Sunni and Shi'a Muslim jurists consider dogs to be ritually unclean. It is uncommon for practising Muslims to have dogs as pets. They are viewed as scavengers. \n\nIn Britain, police sniffer dogs are carefully used, and are not permitted to contact passengers, only their luggage. They are required to wear leather dog booties when searching mosques or Muslim homes.\n\nThere are a number of traditions concerning Muhammad's attitude towards dogs. He said that the company of dogs, except as helpers in hunting, herding, and home protection, voided a portion of a Muslim's good deeds. On the other hand, he advocated kindness to dogs and other animals. Abu Huraira narrated that the prophet said:\n\"While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.' So, he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him.\" The people asked ``O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?\" He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).\"\n\nIn Judaism, Jewish law does not ban the action of keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves, and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them. The Book of Exodus (22:31) includes the exhortation \"And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs\" which implies that dogs have an accepted role in Hebrew society, and that God does not expect them to observe the dietary restrictions imposed on their human masters. The name of the Biblical character Caleb is written the same way as \"keleb\" (), meaning \"dog\" - written Hebrew having no vowels. The Bible was written down centuries before Hebrew diacritics were introduced, and there is thus no certain knowledge of how the name was pronounced during the man's own lifetime - leaving open the possibility that at that time it was no dishonor for a major tribal leader to be named \"Dog\".\n\nThere is a temple in Isin, Mesopotamia, named é-ur-gi7-ra which translates as “dog house” Enlilbani, a king from the Old Babylonian First Dynasty of Isin, commemorated the temple to the goddess Ninisina. Although there is a small amount of detail known about it, there is enough information to confirm that a dog cult did exist in this area. Usually, dogs were only associated with the Gula cult, but there is some information, like Enlilbani’s commemoration, to suggest that dogs were also important to the cult of Ninisina, as Gula was another goddess who was closely associated to Ninisina. More than 30 dog burials, numerous dog sculptures, and dog drawings were discovered when the area around this Ninisina temple was excavated. In the Gula cult, the dog was used in oaths and was sometimes referred to as a divinity.\n\nAt archaeological diggings at the Philistine city of Ashkelon, a very large dog cemetery was discovered in the layer dating from when the city was part of the Persian Empire. It is believed the dogs may have had a sacred role - however, evidence for this is not conclusive.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, the dog is regarded as an especially beneficent, clean and righteous creature, which must be fed and taken care of. The dog is praised for the useful work it performs in the household, but it is also seen as having special spiritual virtues. A dog's gaze is considered to be purifying and to drive off daevas (demons). It is also believed to have a special connection with the afterlife: the Chinwad Bridge to Heaven is said to be guarded by dogs in Zoroastrian scripture, and dogs are traditionally fed in commemoration of the dead. \"Ihtiram-i sag\", \"respect for the dog\", is a common injunction among Iranian Zoroastrian villagers.\n\nDetailed prescriptions for the appropriate treatment of dogs are found in the Vendidad (a subdivision of the Zoroastrian holy scripture Avesta), especially in chapters 13, 14 and 15, where harsh punishments are imposed for harm inflicted upon a dog and the faithful are required to assist dogs, both domestic and stray, in various ways; often, help or harm to a dog is equated with help and harm to a human. The killing of a dog (\"a shepherd's dog, or a house-dog, or a Vohunazga [i.e. stray] dog, or a trained dog\") is considered to lead to damnation in the afterlife. A homeowner is required to take care of a pregnant dog that lies near his home at least until the puppies are born (and in some cases until the puppies are old enough to take care of themselves, namely six months). If the homeowner does not help the dog and the puppies come to harm as a result, \"he shall pay for it the penalty for wilful murder\", because \"Atar (Fire), the son of Ahura Mazda, watches as well (over a pregnant dog) as he does over a woman\". It is also a major sin if a man harms a dog by giving it bones that are too hard and become stuck in its throat, or food that is too hot, so that it burns its throat. Giving bad food to a dog is as bad as serving bad food to a human. The believers are required to take care of a dog with a damaged sense of smell, to try to heal it \"in the same manner as they would do for one of the faithful\" and, if they fail, to tie it lest it should fall into a hole or a body of water and be harmed.\n\nBoth according to the Vendidad and in traditional Zoroastrian practice, dogs are allotted some funerary ceremonies analogous to those of humans. In the Vendidad, it is stated that the spirits of a thousand deceased dogs are reincarnated in a single otter (\"water dog\"), hence the killing of an otter is a terrible crime that brings drought and famine upon the land and must be atoned either by the death of the killer or by the killer performing a very long list of deeds considered pious, including the healing of dogs, raising of puppies, paying of fines to priests, as well as killing of animals considered noxious and unholy (cats, rats, mice and various species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects).\n\n\"Sagdid\" is a funeral ceremony in which a dog is brought into the room where the body is lying so that it can look on it. “Sagdid” means “dog sight” in the Middle Persian language of Zoroastrian theological works. There are various spiritual benefits thought to be obtained by the ceremony. It is believed that the original purpose was to make certain that the person was really dead, since the dog’s more acute senses would be able to detect signs of life that a human might miss. A “four-eyed” dog, that is one with two spots on its forehead, is preferred for sagdid.\n\nThe traditional rites involving dogs have been under attack by reformist Zoroastrians since the mid-19th century, and they had abandoned them completely by the late 20th century. Even traditionalist Zoroastrians tend to restrict such rites to a significant extent nowadays (late 20th - early 21st century).\n\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher and critic of social mores Diogenes of Sinope was recorded as living with many dogs, seeing their freedom from self-consciousness and sincere enjoyment of simple physical pleasure to be admirable role models.\n\nIn an article in the \"New York Times Magazine\" atheist Natalie Angier quoted Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University:\n\nIn 1808 the English poet Lord Byron expressed similar thoughts in his famous poem \"Epitaph to a Dog\":\n"}
{"id": "145905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145905", "title": "Ebionites", "text": "Ebionites\n\nEbionites (, \"Ebionaioi\", derived from Hebrew \"ebyonim\", \"ebionim\", meaning \"the poor\" or \"poor ones\") is a patristic term referring to a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era. They regarded Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and\nhis virgin birth and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They used only one of the Jewish–Christian gospels, the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter three; revered James, the brother of Jesus (James the Just); and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty. Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect at Qumran who sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple. Many believe that the Qumran sectarians were Essenes.\n\nSince historical records by the Ebionites are scarce, fragmentary and disputed, much of what is known or conjectured about the Ebionites derives from the Church Fathers who wrote polemics against the Ebionites, who they deemed heretical Judaizers. Consequently, very little about the Ebionite sect or sects is known with certainty, and most, if not all, statements about them are conjectural.\n\nAt least one scholar distinguishes the Ebionites from other Jewish Christian groups, such as the Nazarenes. Other scholars, like the Church Fathers themselves from the first centuries after Jesus, consider the Ebionites identical with the Nazarenes.<ref name=\"Nazarene/Ebionite\">Jeffrey Butz, \"The Secret Legacy of Jesus\", , \"In fact, the Ebionites and the Nazarenes are one and the same.\" pg 124; \"Following the devastation of the Jewish War, the Nazarenes took refuge in Pella, a community in exile, where they lay in anxious wait with their fellow Jews. From this point on it is preferable to call them the Ebionites. There was no clear demarcation or formal transition from Nazarene to Ebionite; there was no sudden change of theology or Christology.\", pg 137; \"While the writings of later church fathers speak of Nazarenes and Ebionites as if they were different Jewish Christian groups, they are mistaken in that assessment. The Nazarenes and the Ebionites were one and the same group, but for clarity we will refer to the pre-70 group in Jerusalem as Nazarenes, and the post-70 group in Pella and elsewhere as Ebionites.\", pg 137;</ref>\n\nThe term \"Ebionites\" derives from the common adjective for \"poor\" in Hebrew (singular: \"ev·yōn\", plural: \"ev·yōn·im\"), which occurs fifteen times in the Psalms and was the self-given term of some pious Jewish circles (e.g. Psalm 69:33 (\"For the LORD heareth the poor\") and 1 QpHab XII, 3.6.10). The term \"Ebionim\" was also a self description given by the people who were living in Qumran, as shown in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The term \"the poor\" was at first a common designation for all Christians, a reference to their material and voluntary poverty.\n\nThe hellenized Hebrew term \"Ebionite\" (\"Ebionai\") was first applied by Irenaeus in the second century without making mention of Nazarenes (c.180 CE). Origen wrote \"for Ebion signifies 'poor' among the Jews, and those Jews who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites.\" Tertullian was the first to write against a heresiarch called Ebion; scholars believe he derived this name from a literal reading of \"Ebionaioi\" as \"followers of Ebion\", a derivation now considered mistaken for lack of any more substantial references to such a figure. The term \"the poor\" (Greek \"ptōkhoí\") was still used in its original, more general sense. Modern Hebrew still uses the Biblical Hebrew term \"the needy\" both in histories of Christianity for \"Ebionites\" () and for almsgiving to the needy at Purim.\n\nThe earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in Justin Martyr's \"Dialogue with Trypho\" (c. 140). Justin distinguishes between Jewish Christians who observe the Law of Moses but do not require its observance upon others and those who believe the Mosaic Law to be obligatory on all. Irenaeus (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term \"Ebionites\" to describe a heretical judaizing sect, which he regarded as stubbornly clinging to the Law. Origen (c. 212) remarks that the name derives from the Hebrew word \"evyon,\" meaning \"poor.\" Epiphanius of Salamis in the fourth century gives the questionable but also most complete account in his heresiology called \"Panarion\", denouncing eighty heretical sects, among them the Ebionites. Epiphanius mostly gives general descriptions of their religious beliefs and includes quotations from their gospels, which have not survived. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica (2011), the Ebionite movement may have arisen about the time of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem (AD 70).\n\nPaul talks of his collection for the \"poor among the saints\" in the Jerusalem church, but this is generally taken as meaning the poorer members of the church rather than a schismatic group.\n\nThe actual number of groups described as Ebionites is difficult to ascertain, as the contradictory patristic accounts in their attempt to distinguish various sects sometimes confuse them with each other. Other groups mentioned are the Carpocratians, the Cerinthians, the Elcesaites, the fourth century Nazarenes and the Sampsaeans, most of whom were Jewish Christian sects who held gnostic or other views rejected by the Ebionites. Epiphanius, however, mentions that a group of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name.\n\nAs the Ebionites are first mentioned as such in the second century, their earlier history and any relation to the first Jerusalem church remains obscure and a matter of contention. There is no evidence linking the origin of the later sect of the Ebionites with the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–70 CE or with the Jerusalem church led by James. Eusebius relates a tradition, probably based on Aristo of Pella, that the early Christians left Jerusalem just prior to the war and fled to Pella beyond the Jordan River, but does not connect this with Ebionites. They were led by Simeon of Jerusalem (d. 107) and during the Second Jewish-Roman War of 115–117, they were persecuted by the Jewish followers of Bar Kochba for refusing to recognize his messianic claims.\nAccording to Harnack, the influence of Elchasaites places some Ebionites in the context of the gnostic movements widespread in Syria and the lands to the east.\n\nAfter the end of the First Jewish–Roman War, the importance of the Jerusalem church began to fade. Jewish Christianity became dispersed throughout the Jewish diaspora in the Levant, where it was slowly eclipsed by gentile Christianity, which then spread throughout the Roman Empire without competition from \"judaizing\" Christian groups. Once the Jerusalem church was eliminated during the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, the Ebionites gradually lost influence and followers. According to Hyam Maccoby (1987), their decline was due to marginalization and \"persecution\" by both Jews and Christians. Following the defeat of the rebellion and the expulsion of all Jews from Judea, Jerusalem became the Gentile city of Aelia Capitolina. Many of the Jewish Christians residing at Pella renounced their Jewish practices at this time and joined to the mainstream Christian church. Those who remained at Pella and continued in obedience to the Law were deemed heretics. In 375, Epiphanius records the settlement of Ebionites on Cyprus, but by the fifth century, Theodoret of Cyrrhus reported that they were no longer present in the region.\n\nSome scholars argue that the Ebionites survived much longer and identify them with a sect encountered by the historian Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad around the year 1000.\n\nThere is another possible reference to Ebionite communities existing around the 11th century in northwestern Arabia in \"Sefer Ha'masaot,\" the \"Book of the Travels\" of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, a rabbi from Spain. These communities were located in two cities, Tayma and \"Tilmas\", possibly Sa`dah in Yemen.\n\nThe 12th century Muslim historian Muhammad al-Shahrastani mentions Jews living in nearby Medina and Hejaz who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream Christian views. Some scholars argue that they contributed to the development of the Islamic view of Jesus due to exchanges of Ebionite remnants with the first Muslims.\n\nMost patristic sources portray the Ebionites as traditional Jews who zealously followed the Law of Moses, revered Jerusalem as the holiest city and restricted table fellowship only to Gentiles who converted to Judaism.\n\nSome Church Fathers describe some Ebionites as departing from traditional Jewish principles of faith and practice. For example, Epiphanius of Salamis stated that the Ebionites engaged in excessive ritual bathing, possessed an angelology which claimed that the Christ is a great archangel who was incarnated in Jesus and adopted as the son of God, opposed animal sacrifice, denied parts or most of the Law, practiced Jewish vegetarianism and celebrated a commemorative meal annually on or around Passover with unleavened bread and water only, in contrast to the daily Christian Eucharist.\n\nThe reliability of Epiphanius' account of the Ebionites is questioned by some scholars. Shlomo Pines, for example, argues that the heterodox views and practices he ascribes to some Ebionites originated in Gnostic Christianity rather than Jewish Christianity and are characteristics of the Elcesaite sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites.\n\nAnother Church Father who described the Ebionites as departing from Christian Orthodoxy was Methodius of Olympus, who stated that the Ebionites believed that the prophets spoke only by their own power and not by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWhile mainstream biblical scholars do suppose some Essene influence on the nascent Jewish-Christian Church in some organizational, administrative and cultic respects, some scholars go beyond that assumption.\n\nRegarding the Ebionites specifically, a number of scholars have different theories on how the Ebionites may have developed from an Essene Jewish messianic sect. Hans-Joachim Schoeps argues that the conversion of some Essenes to Jewish Christianity after the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE may be the source of some Ebionites adopting Essene views and practices, while some conclude that the Essenes did not become Jewish Christians, but still had an influence on the Ebionites.\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis, in his book Panarion, 30:17:5, said, \"But I already showed above that Ebion did not know these things, but later, his followers that associated with Elchasai had the circumcision, the Sabbath and the customs of Ebion, but the imagination of Elchasai.\" Epiphanius made it clear that the original Ebionites were different from those heterodox Ebionites that he described. \n\nIn the \"Gospel of the Ebionites\", as quoted by Epiphanius, John the Baptist and Jesus are portrayed as vegetarians. Epiphanius states that the Ebionites had amended \"locusts\" (Greek \"akris\") to \"honey cake\" (Greek \"ekris\"). This emendation is not found in any other New Testament manuscript or translation, though a different vegetarian reading is found in a late Slavonic version of Josephus' \"War of the Jews\". Pines (1966) and others propose that the Ebionites were projecting their own vegetarianism onto John the Baptist.\n\nRobert Eisenman suggests that the Ebonim followed the Nazirite Oath that was associated with \"James the brother of Jesus\"\n\nThe majority of Church Fathers agree that the Ebionites rejected many of the precepts central to Nicene orthodoxy, such as Jesus' pre-existence, divinity, virgin birth, atoning death and physical resurrection.\nOn the other hand, an Ebionite story has Jesus eating bread with his brother, Jacob (\"James the Just\"), after the resurrection, which indicates that the Ebionites, or at least the ones who accepted this version of the Gospel of the Hebrews, believed in a physical resurrection of Jesus.\nThe Ebionites are described as emphasizing the oneness of God and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of Mary and Joseph, who by virtue of his righteousness was chosen by God to be the messianic \"prophet like Moses\" (foretold in \"Deuteronomy\" 18:14–22) when he was anointed with the Holy Spirit at his baptism. Origen (\"Contra Celsum\" 5.61) and Eusebius (\"Historia Ecclesiastica\" 3.27.3) recognize some variation in the Christology of Ebionite groups; for example, that while all Ebionites denied Jesus' pre-existence, there was a sub-group which did not deny the virgin birth. Theodoret, while dependent on earlier writers, draws the conclusion that the two sub-groups would have used different Gospels.\n\nOf the books of the New Testament, the Ebionites are said to have accepted only a Hebrew (or Aramaic) version of the Gospel of Matthew, referred to as the Gospel of the Hebrews, as additional scripture to the Hebrew Bible. This version of Matthew, Irenaeus reports, omitted the first two chapters (on the nativity of Jesus) and started with the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist.\n\nThe Ebionites believed that all Jews and Gentiles must observe the commandments in the Law of Moses in order to become righteous and seek communion with God.\n\nOne of the popular primary connections of the Ebionites to James is that noted by William Whiston in his edition of Josephus (1794), where he notes regarding the murder of James, the brother of Jesus, \"we must remember what we learn from the Ebionite fragments of Hegesippus, that these Ebionites interpreted a prophecy of Isaiah as foretelling this very murder.\" That Hegesippus made this connection from Isaiah is undisputed; however, Whiston's identification of Hegesippus as an Ebionite, while common in 18th and 19th century scholarship, is debatable.\n\nThe other popularly proposed connection is that the \"Ascents of James\" in the Pseudo-Clementine literature are related to the Ebionites.\n\nThe Book of Acts begins by showing Peter as leader of the Jerusalem church, the only church in existence immediately after the ascension, though several years later, Paul lists James prior to \"Cephas\" (Peter) and John as those considered \"pillars\" (Greek \"styloi\") of the Jerusalem Church. Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem, but Eusebius also subjects James to the authority of all the apostles. Peter baptised Cornelius the Centurion, introducing uncircumcised Gentiles into the church in Judea. Paul, \"Apostle to the Gentiles\", established many churches and developed a Christian theology (see Pauline Christianity). At the Council of Jerusalem (\"c\" 49), Paul argued to abrogate Mosaic observances for non-Jewish converts. When Paul recounted the events to the Galatians (), he referred only to the remembrance of the poor rather than conveying the four points of the Council of Jerusalem (). James Dunn notes the conciliatory role of James as depicted in Acts in the tension between Paul and those urging the Law of Moses upon Gentiles.\n\nAccording to Eusebius, the Jerusalem church fled to Pella, Jordan after the death of James to escape the siege of the future Emperor Titus. After the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Jerusalem church was permitted to remain in the renamed Aelia Capitolina, but notably from this point onward all bishops of Jerusalem bear Greek rather than evidently Jewish names.\n\nScholars such as Pierre-Antoine Bernheim, Robert Eisenman, Will Durant, Michael Goulder, Gerd Ludemann, John Painter and James Tabor argue for some form of continuity of the Jewish Jerusalem church into the second and third centuries and that the Ebionites regarded James, the brother of Jesus, as their leader.\n\nScholars, including Richard Bauckham, distinguish the high Christology practiced by the Jerusalem church under James with the low Christology later adopted by the Ebionites. Tabor argues that the Ebionites claimed a dynastic apostolic succession for the relatives of Jesus. Epiphanius relates that the Ebionites opposed the Apostle Paul, who they saw as responsible for the idea that gentile Christians did not have to be circumcised or follow the Law of Moses, and named him an apostate. Epiphanius further relates that some Ebionites alleged that Paul was a Greek who converted to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of a high priest of Israel, but apostatized when she rejected him.\n\nAs an alternative to the traditional view of Eusebius that the Jerusalem church simply became integrated with the Gentile church, other scholars, such as Richard Bauckham, suggest immediate successors to the Jerusalem church under James and the relatives of Jesus were the Nazoraeans who accepted Paul, while the Ebionites were a later offshoot of the early second century.\n\nFew writings of the Ebionites have survived and they are in uncertain form. The \"Recognitions of Clement\" and the \"Clementine Homilies\", two third century Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely Jewish Christian in origin and reflect Jewish Christian beliefs. The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but Epiphanius's description of some Ebionites in \"Panarion\" 30 bears a striking similarity to the ideas in the \"Recognitions\" and \"Homilies\". Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the \"Homilies\" as a source document. Some scholars also speculate that the core of the \"Gospel of Barnabas\", beneath a polemical medieval Muslim overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document. The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars.\n\nJohn Arendzen (Catholic Encyclopedia article \"Ebionites\" 1909) classifies the Ebionite writings into four groups.\n\nIrenaeus stated that the Ebionites used Matthew's Gospel exclusively. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that they used only the Gospel of the Hebrews. From this, the minority view of James R. Edwards (2009) and Bodley's Librarian Edward Nicholson (1879) claim that there was only one Hebrew gospel in circulation, Matthew's \"Gospel of the Hebrews\". They also note that the title \"Gospel of the Ebionites\" was never used by anyone in the early Church. Epiphanius contended that the gospel the Ebionites used was written by Matthew and called the \"Gospel of the Hebrews\". Because Epiphanius said that it was \"not wholly complete, but falsified and mutilated\", writers such as Walter Richard Cassels (1877) and Pierson Parker (1940) consider it a different \"edition\" of Matthew's Hebrew Gospel; however, internal evidence from the quotations in \"Panarion\" 30.13.4 and 30.13.7 suggest that the text was a Gospel harmony originally composed in Greek.\n\nMainstream scholarly texts, such as the standard edition of the New Testament Apocrypha edited by Wilhelm Schneemelcher, generally refer to the text Jerome cites as used by the Ebionites as the \"Gospel of the Ebionites\", though this is not a term current in the Early Church.\n\nThe collection of New Testament apocrypha known as the Clementine literature included three works known in antiquity as the \"Circuits of Peter\", the \"Acts of the Apostles\" and a work usually titled the \"Ascents of James\". They are specifically referenced by Epiphanius in his polemic against the Ebionites. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement's \"Compendium of Peter's itinerary sermons\" and in the \"Recognitions\" attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, such as the primacy of James, the brother of Jesus; their connection with the episcopal see of Rome; and their antagonism to Simon Magus, as well as gnostic doctrines. Scholar Robert E. Van Voorst opines of the \"Ascents of James\" (R 1.33–71), \"There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain\". Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin.\n\nSymmachus produced a translation of the Hebrew Bible in Koine Greek, which was used by Jerome and is still extant in fragments, and his lost \"Hypomnemata\", written to counter the canonical Gospel of Matthew. Although lost, the Hypomnemata is probably identical to \"De distinctione præceptorum\" mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, \"Bibl. Or.\", III, 1). The identity of Symmachus as an Ebionite has been questioned in recent scholarship.\n\nHippolytus of Rome (c.230) reported that a Jewish Christian, Alcibiades of Apamea, appeared in Rome teaching from a book which he claimed to be the revelation which a righteous man, Elkesai, had received from an angel, though Hippolytus suspected that Alcibiades was himself the author. Shortly afterwards, Origen recorded a group, the Elkesaites, with the same beliefs. Epiphanius claimed the Ebionites also used this book as a source for some of their beliefs and practices (\"Panarion\" 30.17). Epiphanius explains the origin of the name Elkesai to be Aramaic \"El Ksai\", meaning \"hidden power\" (\"Panarion\" 19.2.1). Scholar Petri Luomanen believes the book to have been written originally in Aramaic as a Jewish apocalypse, probably in Babylonia in 116-117.\n\nThe mainstream Christian view of the Ebionites is partly based on interpretation of the polemical views of the Church Fathers who portrayed them as heretics for rejecting many of the central Christian views of Jesus and allegedly having an improper fixation on the Law of Moses at the expense of the grace of God. In this view, the Ebionites may have been the descendants of a Jewish Christian sect within the early Jerusalem church which broke away from its mainstream theology.\n\nThe counter-missionary group Jews for Judaism favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that \"Messianic Judaism\", as promoted by missionary groups such as Jews for Jesus, is Pauline Christianity misrepresenting itself as Judaism. Some Messianic groups have expressed concern over leaders in Israel who deny Jesus' divinity and the possible collapse of the Messianic movement due to a resurgence of Ebionitism. In a 2007 polemic, a Messianic writer asked whether Christians should imitate the Torah observance and acceptance of rabbinic understanding of \"neo-Ebionites\", who are defined as those who accept Jesus as Messiah, reject Paul and claim Moses as the only guide for Christians.\n\nIslam charges Christianity with having distorted the pure monotheism of Jesus through the doctrines of the Trinity and through the veneration of icons. Paul Addae and Tim Bowes (1998) write that the Ebionites were faithful to the original teachings of Jesus and thus shared Islamic views about Jesus' humanity and also rejected the redemptive death, though the Islamic view of Jesus may conflict with the view of some Ebionites regarding the virgin birth, respectively denying and affirming, according to Epiphanius. One of the first men to believe in the prophethood of Muhammad was possibly an Ebionite (sometimes argued to be Nestorian) monk named Waraqah ibn Nawfal, the cousin of Mohammed's wife Khadija, who Muslims honor as a pious man with deep knowledge of the Christian scriptures.\n\nHans Joachim Schoeps observes that the Christianity Muhammad was likely to have encountered on the Arabian peninsula \"was not the state religion of Byzantium but a schismatic Christianity characterized by Ebionite and Monophysite views.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Formerly an Evangelical Christian, he joined the Eastern Orthodox Church in 2017. He is an outspoken figure within the Christian countercult movement where he has established a reputation for his criticisms of non-Christian religions, new religious movements and cults, as well as heresy in Christianity. He is also an apologist on doctrinal and cultural issues.\n\nPrior to becoming a leading figure in the Christian countercult movement, Hanegraaff was closely affiliated with the ministry of D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Florida. During his association with Kennedy in the 1980s, he applied memory-based techniques (such as acrostic mnemonics) to summarise strategies, methods and techniques in Christian evangelism. His work bears resemblances to memory dynamics techniques developed in speed-reading courses and in memory training programs used in some executive business courses.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Hanegraaff became associated with Walter Martin at the Christian Research Institute (CRI), the conservative Protestant countercult and apologetic ministry which Martin founded in 1960.\n\nAfter Martin's death from heart failure in June 1989, Hanegraaff became president of CRI. As part of his role as ministry president, Hanegraaff assumed the role from Martin of anchorman on the radio program \"The Bible Answer Man\". Hanegraaff became a conference speaker and itinerant preacher in churches, where he pursued the general ministry charter of CRI. Shortly after the release of Dan Brown's novel, he co-authored \"The DaVinci Code: Fact or Fiction?\" with Lutheran apologist Paul Maier. His most recent publication is \"Has God Spoken?\", from Thomas Nelson in 2011.\n\nThe content of The Bible Answer Man show includes answering questions about Christian doctrine, biblical interpretation, and denominational particularities, as well as special focuses on particular issues when a notable figure is a guest, such as frequent shows focused on Mormonism when former Mormons appear in studio as guests to speak from their experiences.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Hanegraaff engaged in dialogue with Joseph Tkach, Jr. and other leaders of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), now known as Grace Communion International (GCI). The WCG was founded in the 1930s by Herbert W. Armstrong, and had long been regarded as a cult by evangelicals, primarily for its denial of the Trinity and other traditional Christian doctrines. Following Armstrong's death in 1986, the group re-evaluated many of its teachings, including the British Israel doctrine and various eschatological predictions. Hanegraaff was one of a handful of evangelical apologists, including Ruth A. Tucker, who assisted in the reforms. The biggest changes to ensure their acceptance among evangelicals were in accepting the doctrine of the Trinity and salvation by grace through faith.\n\nHanegraaff sued longtime critic William Alnor for alleging that Hanegraaff's fundraising was under investigation for mail fraud. The allegation was based on an incident of misdirected mail which was followed by a January, 2005 CRI fundraising letter saying the error may have caused \"perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in donations to be lost. The defamation lawsuit was thrown out based on California's anti-SLAPP statute. The court found that although Alnor’s statements regarding a mail fraud investigation were false, Hanegraaff was unlikely to prove \"actual malice.\"\n\nAnswers in Genesis, a Christian ministry that insists on a literal, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible starting from Genesis, accused Hanegraaff of unorthodox beliefs. One of the creation science movement's main spokesmen, Ken Ham, wrote in an article titled \"Hank Hanegraaff’s Abuse of Biblical Truth\", \"it [is] evident that Hanegraaff does not hold to a literal Genesis...as he was unwilling to understand Genesis in its most natural form—historical narrative...it actually gets worse: Hanegraaff also denies there was a literal serpent in the Garden of Eden that audibly spoke to Eve...Christians like Hanegraaff wholeheartedly accept many secular humanistic ideas like long-age geology and the big bang. When they accept these competing (anti-biblical) claims and mix them with their Christianity, something always has to give. Most people give up what the Bible plainly says...\"\n\nIn his 1993 book \"Christianity in Crisis\", Hanegraaff charged the Word of Faith movement with heretical teachings, saying that many of the Word of Faith groups were cults, and that those who knowingly accepted the movement's theology were \"clearly embracing a different gospel, which is in reality no gospel at all.\"\n\nHanegraaff revisited some of the same issues in his 1997 book \"Counterfeit Revival\", in which he rejected the claims of many charismatic teachers such as Rodney Howard Browne concerning what became known as the Toronto Blessing. The Toronto Blessing was associated with the Vineyard church located near the Toronto Airport, and was marked by spontaneous and sustained outbursts of bodily phenomena such as laughter, shaking, bouncing, and \"resting in the Spirit.\" A different set of phenomena and claims subsequently emanated from churches in Brownsville, Pensacola, Florida, and became known as the Brownsville Revival.\n\nOne of the book's primary arguments is that many ostensible \"manifestations of the Spirit\" in charismatic, Pentecostal, and third wave affiliated churches are caused by psychological manipulation of parishioners, and that many of the \"signs and wonders\" claimed by these churches are fraudulent or result from manipulation, peer pressure, subtle suggestions, altered states of consciousness from repetitive chanting or singing, and expectations of supernatural events. Hanegraaff argues that many of the practices within these movements are not biblically sanctioned or appropriate, but have underlying aspects of scripture which are misinterpreted. He notes these movements rely too much on subjective experiences or feelings.\n\nJames A. Beverley, professor of theology and ethics at Tyndale Seminary (formerly Ontario Theological Seminary) in Toronto, Canada, reviewed \"Counterfeit Revival\" in \"Christianity Today\", and wrote that while the book \"exposes some real excesses and imbalances in the current charismatic renewal movements\", it is a \"misleading, simplistic, and harmful book, marred by faulty logic, outdated and limited research\".\n\nHanegraaff responded on Equip.org by arguing that Beverley had received funding from Vineyard in the past and that he was aligned with them generally. Hanegraaff intimated that Beverley had been compensated to author the \"hit piece\" for Christianity Today.\n\nIn 2013, Hanegraaff published the book \"Afterlife: What You Need To Know About Heaven, The Hereafter & Near-Death Experiences\" where he addresses questions that were raised during his radio show regarding heaven and eternal life.\n\nHanegraaff was born in the Netherlands and raised in the United States since childhood. He and his wife Kathy have twelve children. They lived in Southern California but are now living in Charlotte, North Carolina. On Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, Hanegraaff, together with his wife Kathy and two of his sons, were chrismated into the Eastern Orthodox Church at St. Nektarios Greek Orthodox Church in Charlotte, NC (a parish that is part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America).\n\nIn 2017 Hanegraaff revealed that he has mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its members, known as Elevationists, claim that the use of cannabis helps elevate people to a higher understanding of self.\n\nThe chapel headquarters, a converted old church painted by contemporary artists, opened its doors on April 20, 2017. An amendment banning cannabis consumption in churches was submitted to the Colorado House of Representatives on the same day and rejected as an unconstitutional restriction on religion.\n\nSince smoking cannabis in public is banned in Colorado, no cannabis consumption is allowed during the hours when the church is open to the public. A celebration of the \"sacrament of cannabis,\" held only for members every Friday, is the only regular service in the church.\n\nMembers of the International Church of Cannabis are known as Elevationists. They ritually use cannabis, which they call \"the sacred flower,\" to accelerate and deepen self-discovery. A member is considered awakened when their cannabis experience becomes transcendental in nature. Elevationism claims no divine law and no unquestionable doctrine, while following the Golden Rule.\n\nSince 420 is a significant number for cannabis culture, the church opened its doors to the public on April 20 and its members light cannabis at 4:20 p.m. This celebration of the \"sacrament of cannabis,\" held every Friday, is the only regular service in the church. The symbol of the church is a set of interlocking triangles.\n\nBy itself, ritual use of cannabis is not a modern invention, as it appeared in several world religions over a period of 3,000 years. Also, the International Church of Cannabis is just one of several modern religious organizations that consider cannabis a sacrament.\n\nIn May 2017, the church announced that it would begin offering wedding services in a \"cannabis-friendly\" environment.\n\nMembers of any religion can become Elevationists without the need to convert, since Elevationism is seen as a supplement rather than a replacement to existing faith. The only restriction is that persons under 21 years of age are not allowed into the church when cannabis is being burned. The church does not have a formal hierarchy.\n\nThe church’s membership increased to 200 people from around 50 on the opening week after increased media attention. It allegedly rose to 500 in the next two weeks.\n\nElevation Ministries, the religious nonprofit organization behind the church, was formally established in Colorado in September 2016.\n\nColorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but it is currently still illegal to smoke in Denver’s public spaces. All ritual cannabis use at the church is by invitation only. The church also does not sell marijuana. On the federal level, Elevationism is protected by constitutional religious freedom as long as it is considered an authentic religious belief.\n\nDan Pabon, a Democrat in the Colorado House of Representatives, proposed an amendment banning cannabis consumption in churches on 20 April 2017, the same day the church opened. He confirmed that his move was inspired by the International Church of Cannabis. However, members of both parties in the House concluded it would be an unconstitutional restriction on religion. They rejected his proposal and the amendment was not formally introduced.\n\nThe church is housed in a 113-year-old structure in Denver’s Washington Park neighborhood. It is a converted Lutheran church, which used to be called Mount Calvary Apostolic Church. The church property was purchased in July 2015 by a company co-owned by church co-founder Steve Berke and his parents with the intention to turn it into apartments. However, Berke's colleagues and friends, who later became co-founding members of the church, convinced him, and eventually the company, to establish a new church in lieu of converting the building into condos.\n\nAn Indiegogo campaign to fund repairs on the building raised $40,000. Renovations began July 2016.\n\nThe colorful surrealist interior paintings, with geometric neon colors and images of animals, were done by Spanish artist Okuda San Miguel, who had already painted abandoned churches in Spain and Morocco.

According to ancient Egyptian beliefs, Isfet and Ma'at built a complementary and also paradoxical dualism: one could not exist without its counterpart. Isfet and Ma'at balanced each other. Ma'at was to overcome isfet, \"that which is difficult,\" \"evil,\" \"difficult,\" \"disharmonious,\" and \"troublesome.\" Isfet was to be overcome by good and to replace disunity with unity and disorder with order. An Egyptian king (pharaoh) was appointed to “achieve” Ma'at, which means that he had to keep and protect justice and harmony by destroying Isfet. A responsible kingship meant that Egypt would remain in prosperity and at peace of Ma'at. However, if Isfet were to rise, humanity would decay and return to a primordial state. Decay was unacceptable as a natural course of events, which meant that the world was separated from the cosmos and away from order. The universe was cyclical meaning it had repeated sequences: the daily sunsetting and its rising, annual seasons and flooding of the Nile. On the other hand, when Ma'at was absent, and Isfet unleashed then the Nile flood failed and the country fell into famine. Therefore, Ancient Egyptians believed through their rituals of the cosmic order it would bring forth prosperity to the gods and goddesses who controlled the cosmos.The principles of the contrariness between Isfet and Ma'at are exemplified in a popular tale from the Middle Kingdom, called \"the moaning of the Bedouin\":\n\nIn the eyes of the Egyptians the world was always ambiguous; the actions and judgments of a king were thought to simplify these principles in order to keep Ma'at by separating order from chaos or good from evil. Coffin Text 335a asserts the necessity of the dead being cleansed of Isfet in order to be reborn in the Duat.\n\nIsfet is thought to be the product of an individual's free will rather than a primordial state of chaos. In mythology, this is represented by Apep being born from Ra's umbilical cord relatively late.\n\nIt was also believed that the physical representation of Isfet was through the god, Seth.\n\nWhen the king made public appearances he was surrounded by images of foreigners which emphasized his role as protector of Ma'at and the enemy of Isfet which were foreign enemies of Ancient Egypt. As such, the king is mainly shown 'smiting' foreigners to maintain Ma'at.\n\nThe king also maintained the Temple Cult to prevent Isfet from spreading by ensuring the cults were performed at defined intervals which were necessary in preserving the balance of Ma'at against the threatening forces of Isfet.\n\n"}
{"id": "7164805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7164805", "title": "Islam in Malawi", "text": "Islam in Malawi\n\nIslam is the second largest religion in Malawi after Christianity. Nearly all of Malawi's Muslims adhere to Sunni Islam. Though difficult to assess, according to the CIA Factbook, in 2008 about 12.8% of the country's population was Muslim; such a lower figure is rejected by Muslim organisations in the country, who claim a figure of 30-35% (which is described as \"wishful thinking\" by Christian missionaries). According to the Malawi Religion Project run by the University of Pennsylvania, in 2010 approximately 25% of the population was Muslim, concentrated mostly in the Southern Region.\n\nIslam arrived in Malawi with the Arab and Swahili traders who traded in ivory, gold and later on slaves beginning from 16th century to the 19th century. It is also argued that Islam first arrived in Malawi through traders from the Kilwa Sultanate. Two Muslim teachers, Shayhks Abdallah Mkwanda and Sabiti Ngaunje, also played an important role in the spread of Islam. According to UNESCO, the first mosque was built by Swahili-Arab ivory traders.\n\nDuring the colonial era, the authorities in the country feared that Islam posed the greatest threat, as an ideology of resistance, to their rule. This view was shared by Christian missionaries, who greatly feared that Islam could unite Africans in hostilities and uprisings against colonial rule. \n\nThe 1970s witnessed the start of an Islamic revival among Muslims in Malawi, as well as among Muslims across the globe. Recently, Muslim groups have engaged in missionary work in Malawi. Much of this is performed by the African Muslim Agency, based in Kuwait. The Kuwait-sponsored AMA has translated the Qur'an into Chichewa (Cinyanja), one of the official languages of Malawi, and has engaged in other missionary work in the country. There are thought to be about 800 jumu'ah mosques in the country, with at least one or two to be found in nearly every town. There are also several Islamic schools and a broadcasting station called Radio Islam. A major Muslim center of learning exists in Mpemba, outside of Blantyre, funded mainly by money from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n\nA large number of Muslims in Malawi come from the Yao people, who are described as \"the most important source of Islam in the country\". Even before their conversion to Islam, many Yao chiefs used Swahili Muslims as scribes and advisers.

Līlāśuka probably at King Kulaśekhara’s court (c.900 A.D.) wrote this popular lyric on Krishna as the sexually precocious infant loved by all women but interpreted as symbolising God attracting all souls, thus an early example of Vaishnava devotional kāvya. This work exists in two recensions, the southern and the western and is the canonical text of the Gaudiya Vaishnavas.\n\"Kṛśṇa-karaṇāmṛta\" is a devotional anthology of mediaeval lyric and passionate stanzas in \"śārdūlavikrīdita\" metre in honour of Krishna. It is a favourite and authoritative eulogistic work, familiar among gesture-dancers. The earliest firm date of this work is about 1367 in Gangādevi’s \"Madhurā-vijaya\", but the date of the author is uncertain. The Sanskrit poetry of Lilasuka and Jayadeva (author of \"Gita Govinda)\", created a new aesthetics of \"bhakti\", based on a revaluation of the literary category of \"rasa\" by elaborating the vocabulary of \"kama\" and \"prema\" creatively mingling erotic love and devotion. There is deep mysticism in the poem.\n\nLilasuka probably hailed from a southern part of India as is indicated by the metre used by him, but it is not established whether this poem was written by Bilavamangala, the noted grammarian of the 12th or 13th century, or by Bilavamangala who lived in the 9th century. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu obtained only the authentic first canto out of the three that existed. The very surname Lilasuka of the poet, is an evidence of the Bhagavata cult introduced by Madhvacharya in the West Coast, which identifies the poet with the second Bilavamangala. It is said that Lilasuka was born in Kerala near Parur in the late 13th or14th century, and lived for eighty years; that his mellifluous Sanskrit mingled with the ecstatic love for Krishna invests his songs with a quality so rare that when sung they are nectar to the ears, and that he left a life of sensuous infatuation with a courtesan named Chintāmani for intense devotion to God.\n"}

{"id": "84089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84089", "title": "Mandala", "text": "Mandala\n\nA mandala (emphasis on first syllable; Sanskrit मण्डल, maṇḍala – literally \"circle\") is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. In common use, \"mandala\" has become a generic term for any diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically; a microcosm of the universe.\n\nThe basic form of most mandalas is a square with four gates containing a circle with a center point. Each gate is in the general shape of a T. Mandalas often have radial balance.\n\nThe term appears in the Rigveda as the name of the sections of the work, and Vedic rituals use mandalas such as the Navagraha mandala to this day. Mandalas are also used in Buddhism.\n\nIn various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction.\n\nA \"yantra\" is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette. It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in \"sadhanas\", puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a mantra into its design. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each \"yantra\" is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, \"Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience\"\n\nMany situate \"yantras\" as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. \"Yantras\" are not representations, but are lived, experiential, nondual realities. As Khanna describes:\n\nDespite its cosmic meanings a \"yantra\" is a reality lived. Because of the relationship that exists in the Tantras between the outer world (the macrocosm) and man's inner world (the microcosm), every symbol in a \"yantra\" is ambivalently resonant in inner–outer synthesis, and is associated with the subtle body and aspects of human consciousness.\n\nThe \"Rajamandala\" (or \"Raja-mandala\"; circle of states) was formulated by the Indian author Kautilya in his work on politics, the \"Arthashastra\" (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.\n\nIn historical, social and political sense, the term \"mandala\" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration. Empires such as Bagan, Ayutthaya, Champa, Khmer, Srivijaya and Majapahit are known as \"mandala\" in this sense.\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into sandpainting. They are also a key part of Anuttarayoga Tantra meditation practices.\n\nThe mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the Vajrayana teachings. The mind is \"a microcosm representing various divine powers at work in the universe.\" The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.\n\nAn example of this type of mandala is \"Vajrabhairava mandala\" a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.\n\nA mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with Mount Meru as the axis mundi in the center, surrounded by the continents. One example is the \"Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru\", a silk tapestry from the Yuan dynasty that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.\n\nIn the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom. The ring of eight charnel grounds represents the Buddhist exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which \"samsara\" is suffused: \"such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life\". Described elsewhere: \"within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of dorjes, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life\". Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and Buddhas.\n\nOne well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the \"Five Buddhas\", archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment. Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of Buddhism, and even the specific purpose of the mandala. A common mandala of this type is that of the Five Wisdom Buddhas (a.k.a. Five \"Jinas\"), the Buddhas Vairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha and Amoghasiddhi. When paired with another mandala depicting the Five Wisdom Kings, this forms the Mandala of the Two Realms.\n\nMandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.\n\nThe mandala is \"a support for the meditating person\", something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image. With every mandala comes what Tucci calls \"its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as tantras\", instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the mantras to be recited during its ritual use.\n\nBy visualizing \"pure lands\", one learns to understand experience \"itself\" as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment. The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion. In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by \"the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the vajra circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle\". The ring of \"vajras\" forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.\n\nAs a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of Buddhism), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a sand mandala, the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.\n\nKværne in his extended discussion of sahaja, discusses the relationship of sadhana interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus:\nA \"mandala offering\" in Tibetan Buddhism is a symbolic offering of the entire universe. Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.\n\nWhereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe. This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one's teacher. Within Vajrayana practice, 1,000,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices. This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the \"Abhidharma-kośa\", with Mount Meru at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc.\n\nOne Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism—Shingon Buddhism—makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ. When Shingon's founder, Kukai, returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the Mandala of the Womb Realm and the Mandala of the Diamond Realm.\n\nThese two mandalas are engaged in the \"abhiseka\" initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the \"Kechien Kanjō\" (結縁灌頂). A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala. Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which tutelary deity the initiate should follow.\n\nSand mandalas, as found in Tibetan Buddhism, are not practiced in Shingon Buddhism.\n\nThe mandala in Nichiren Buddhism is called a \"moji-mandala\" (文字曼陀羅) and is a paper hanging scroll or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of Chinese characters and medieval-Sanskrit script representing elements of the Buddha's enlightenment, protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts. Called the \"Gohonzon\", it was originally inscribed by Nichiren, the founder of this branch of Japanese Buddhism, during the late 13th Century. The \"Gohonzon\" is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme Dharma and Nichiren's inner enlightenment. The seven characters Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō, considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the invocation that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect \"Gohonzons\", whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.\n\nMandalas have sometimes been used in Pure Land Buddhism to graphically represent Pure Lands, based on descriptions found in the \"Larger Sutra\" and the \"Contemplation Sutra\". The most famous mandala in Japan is the Taima mandala, dated to about 763 CE. The Taima mandala is based on the \"Contemplation Sutra\", but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently. Unlike mandalas used in Vajrayana Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual. Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.\n\nAlso in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Shinran and his descendant, Rennyo, sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society. Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the \"nembutsu\" (南無阿彌陀佛) written vertically. This style of mandala is still used by some Jodo Shinshu Buddhists in home altars, or \"butsudan\".\n\nOne of several parallels between Eastern and Mesoamerican cultures, the Mayan civilization tended to present calendars in a mandala form. It is similar in form and function to the \"Kalachakra\" (Wheel of Time) sand paintings of Tibetan Buddhists. The \"tzolk'in\" wheel has 260 segments, surprising because the Mayans recognized that the calendar year is 365 days long. The inclusion of the specific number 260 could however relate to the 26,000 year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. If so, this would indicate a remarkable awareness of these great cycles of time by this culture. Ultimately, the symbol was probably used for ritual purposes, and to measure the interval of a number of 9-month intervals like pregnancy, the cultivation time of some crops, and rituals that were performed at a 260-day spacing each year, for example, spring and fall.\n\nThis Mayan symbology has even made its way into New Age symbolism as the Dreamspell calendar, developed by José Argüelles. Sometimes described as an authentic Mayan mandala, it is \"inspired by\" elements of the \"Tzolk'in\" wheel of time.\n\nThe Sun Stone of the Aztec civilization was once believed to be their equivalent of a Tzolk'in calendar, but is now thought to be a ceremonial representation of the entire universe as seen by the Aztec religious class.\n\nThe earliest interpretations of the stone relate to its use as a calendar. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican anthropologist Antonio de León y Gama wrote a treatise on the Aztec calendar using the stone as its basis. Some of the circles of glyphs are the glyphs for the days of the month. The four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.\n\nAnother aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents Tonatiuh, the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the \"Sun Stone.\" Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents Tlaltecuhtli, the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths. Modern archaeologists, such as those at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for gladiatorial sacrifices than as an astrological or astronomical reference.\n\nYet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.\n\nLastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show Tenochtitlan as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority. Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—1 Flint (\"Tecpatl\"), 1 Rain (\"Atl\"), and 7 Monkey (\"Ozomahtli\")—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within \"Tenochtitlan\". His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler Moctezuma II's name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.\n\nForms which are evocative of mandalas are prevalent in Christianity: the celtic cross; the rosary; the halo; the aureole; oculi; the Crown of Thorns; rose windows; the Rosy Cross; and the dromenon on the floor of Chartres Cathedral. The dromenon represents a journey from the outer world to the inner sacred centre where the Divine is found.\n\nThe Cosmati pavements, including that at Westminster Abbey, are geometric mandala-like mosaic designs from thirteenth century Italy. The Great Pavement at Westminster Abbey is believed to embody divine and cosmic geometries as the seat of enthronement of the monarchs of England.\n\nSimilarly, many of the Illuminations of Hildegard von Bingen can be used as mandalas, as well as many of the images of esoteric Christianity, as in Christian Hermeticism, Christian Alchemy, and Rosicrucianism.\n\nAlchemist, Mathematician and Astrologer John Dee developed a geometric symbol which he called the \"Sigillum Dei\" 'Seal of God' manifesting a universal geometric order which incorporated the names of the archangels, derived from earlier forms of the \"clavicula salomonis\" or key of Solomon.\n\nThe Layer Monument, an early 17th-century marble mural funerary monument at the Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich, is a rare example of Christian iconography absorbing alchemical symbolism to create a mandala in Western funerary art.\n\nIn Persian Islamic theosophy, each of us is a part of God. We have been separated from our source like the rays of the sun and, we need to always keep in our mind that we have a divine light in us, which is the source of love. This light always shows us the right path to grow and find our way back to our source.\n\nTherefore in Persian Shamseh motif which symbolizes the sun, there is a center which is the symbol of god or the source of energy. This small circle is surrounded by many other circles or polygons with the same center but in different sizes. These circles are the light rays of the sun which symbolize every god’s creature. Every creature tends to reach God, so the purpose of life is to reach back the source of energy which is mentioned as pure love in some references. Some of us are closer to our origin, while some of us have a long journey to reach it. As in Shamseh, some circles are smaller, therefore, closer to the center.\n\nShamseh motif was wildly applied during Safavid time in Iran. Safavid was one of the most important ruling dynasties of Iran in art, architecture, astrology, philosophy, and theosophy. An extraordinary example of Shamseh motif would be the tiling of the ceiling of Sheik Lotfollah mosque in Isfahan. Persian \"Shamseh\" motif painted on a copper plate. The art of hand painting and enameling is called \"Meenakari\" in Farsi.]]\n\nAccording to art therapist and mental health counselor Susanne F. Fincher, we owe the re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought to Carl Jung, the Swiss analytical psychologist. In his pioneering exploration of the unconscious through his own art making, Jung observed the motif of the circle spontaneously appearing. The circle drawings reflected his inner state at that moment. Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word \"mandala\" to describe these circle drawings he and his patients made. In his autobiography, Jung wrote:\nJung recognized that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth. Their appearance indicates a profound re-balancing process is underway in the psyche. The result of the process is a more complex and better integrated personality.\nCreating mandalas helps stabilize, integrate, and re-order inner life.\n\nAccording to the psychologist David Fontana, its symbolic nature can help one \"to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises.\"\nOne of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur made with Google Earth imagery. Located in the paddy field in the west of Imphal, the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world’s largest mandala built entirely of mud. The site wasn’t discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery. The whole paddy field, locally known as Bihu Loukon, is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year. The site is situated 12 km aerial distance from Kangla with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48' N and 93° 49' E. It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters. This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’ in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right. Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters. The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth. The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River.\n\nBuddhist architecture often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including temple complex and stupas. A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century Borobudur in Central Java, Indonesia. It is built as a large stupa surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a stepped pyramid, and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant tantric Buddhist mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind. Other temples from the same period also has mandala plan, including Sewu, Plaosan and Prambanan. The similar mandala plan design are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.\n\nCircular diagrams are often used in phylogenetics, especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships. Evolutionary trees often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree. Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.\n\nMandalas can be found in early Buddhist art from the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nFashion designer Mandali Mendrilla designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the China Art Museum in Shanghai in November 2015. The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living Wish Tree.\n\n\n"}

It is understood as a sort of body made up of thoughts, just as the emotional body consists of emotions and the physical body is made up of matter. In occult understanding, thoughts are not just subjective qualia, but have an existence apart from the associated physical organ, the brain.\n\nAccording to Theosophists C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant (Adyar School of Theosophy), and later Alice Bailey, the mental body is equivalent to the \"Lower Manas\" of Blavatsky's original seven principles of man. But the New Age writer Barbara Brennan describes the Mental body as intermediate between the Emotional and the Astral body in terms of the layers in the \"Human Energy Field\" or Aura.\n\nThe mental body is usually considered in terms of an aura that includes thoughtforms. In Theosophical and Alice Bailey's teachings, it corresponds to the Mental plane.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, the mind is the latest acquisition of the human spirit and is related to the \"Region of Concrete Thought\", which is the lower region of the World of Thought. It is not yet an organized body and in most people it is still a mere inchoate cloud disposed particularly in the region of the head. It works as the link or focus between the \"threefold\" Spirit and the \"threefold\" body , in a reversed reflexion manner : the mind is like the projecting lens of a stereopticon, it projects the image in one of three directions, according to the will of the thinker, which ensouls the thought-form.\n\nHis writings, called Western Wisdom Teachings, give a clear description on how the man's inner Spirit perceives, from the world of thought, the lower worlds through the mind: \" We ourselves, as Egos, function directly in the subtle substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, which we have specialized within the periphery of our individual aura. Thence we view the impressions made by the outer world upon the vital body through the senses, together with the feelings and emotions generated by them in the desire body, and mirrored in the mind. From these mental images we form our conclusions, in the substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, concerning the subjects with which they deal. Those conclusions are ideas. By the power of will we project an idea through the mind, where it takes concrete shape as a thought-form by drawing mind-stuff around itself from the Region of Concrete Thought. \".\n\nHe also states that to the trained clairvoyant there appears to be an empty space in the center of the forehead just above and between the eyebrows and it looks like the blue part of a gas flame, but not even the most gifted seer can penetrate that veil, also known as \"THE VEIL OF ISIS\".\n\nSamael Aun Weor stated that only those who have worked consciously to do so have created a mental body. A \"solar mind\" or \"solar mental body\" is the quality of mind of a true human, yet, it is stated that this humanity is not composed of true humans, but rather intellectual animals: beings with a mind of an animal, but reasoning superior to that of other animals. According to Samael Aun Weor, the qualifications to being a real human being is identical to the lowest requirements of being a Buddha. The process of acquiring the mind of a human in this sense involves the psychological death of the \"I\" (desire) and the work of practical sexual alchemy. More explicitly stated, the title of Buddha is achieved through the Fourth Initiation of Major Mysteries, when the fourth serpent of fire or kundalini has risen.\n\nWhether the lunar or solar aspect, the mental body is stated to exist within the 5th dimension and is represented by Netzach. With the mental body one can travel through the mental world, the world of thoughts and ideas.\n\nIn Esoteric Christianity, the mental body is represented by the stubborn yet useful donkey that the Savior (Christ) subdues in order to be used as a vehicle to enter into heavenly Jerusalem (the superior worlds).\n\n"}

It is the only Personal Apostolic Administration in existence, and the only Catholic Church jurisdiction devoted exclusively to celebrating the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite. Its current Apostolic Administrator is Bishop Fernando Arêas Rifan.\n\nFrom 3 January 1949 to 29 August 1981, the Diocese of Campos was headed by Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer, who opposed the use there of Pope Paul VI's revision of the Roman Missal and held to the Tridentine Mass. After his resignation, the then 77-year-old Bishop Castro Mayer continued to lead opposition in the diocese to the revised liturgy and on 30 June 1988 joined with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in consecrating as bishops, against an express prohibition by Pope John Paul II, four priests of the Society of St. Pius X. For this action he was declared to have incurred excommunication.\n\nThe priests of Campos who shared his traditionalist Catholic views formed themselves into the Priestly Union of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, also known as the Sacerdotal Society of St. John Marie Vianney (SSJV) and, when Bishop de Castro Mayer died in April 1991, chose as his successor Licínio Rangel, who was given episcopal consecration later that year by three bishops of the Society of St. Pius X.\n\nTogether with the Society of Saint Pius X, the Campos group of priests made a pilgrimage to Rome during the Jubilee Year 2000 and was welcomed by Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, President of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, with a lunch and dialogue.<ref name=\"http://www.zenit.org/article-3435?l=english\">Traditionalist Schism in Brazil Ends</ref> They decided to seek reconciliation with the Holy See and, on 15 August 2001, wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II in which the...\" whole Union renewed the profession of Catholic faith, declaring full communion with the Chair of Peter, recognising 'his Primacy and the government of the universal Church, her pastors and her faithful', and likewise declaring: 'For no reason do we wish to be separated from the Rock (Peter) on which Jesus Christ founded his Church\".\nOn Christmas Day (25 December), 2001, Pope John Paul II responded with an autograph letter telling the priests that, \"warmly consenting to your request to be received into the full communion of the Catholic Church, we canonically recognise that you belong to her.\" The Pope also removed the excommunication of Bishop Rangel for his illicit episcopal ordination.\n\nWhen the necessary legislation had been drawn up, the Pope then established for the Campos group, with effect from 18 January 2002, the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, with authority over those Catholics in the Diocese of Campos who wished to use the Roman Rite in the form it had before the revisions following the Second Vatican Council. \n\nOn the date of entry into effect of the new arrangement, a ceremony was held in Campos, to \"sign the letter of entrance into full ecclesial communion of the priests of Campos from the Priestly Union of Saint John Mary Vianney and of the Catholic faithful they minister to, being then thus considered perfectly inserted in the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church.\"\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, some claimed that followers of the Priestly Union of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney constituted the majority of the Catholics of Campos, who had never known the revised Liturgy of the Mass, as their diocesan bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer had, during the 1970s, retained the Tridentine Mass in his territory. However, when at the end of 2003 separate statistics were, for the first time, gathered for the Diocese of Campos and the new personal apostolic administration, the latter reported 28,325 Catholics, 28 priests, 9 seminarians, 75 religious sisters and 24 schools, while the diocese reported 854,000 Catholics, 48 diocesan and 17 religious priests, 30 seminarians, 19 religious brothers and 67 religious sisters, and 5 schools (\"Annuario Pontificio\" 2005). The corresponding figures seven years later were, for the personal apostolic administration, 30,733 Catholics, 32 priests, 7 seminarians, 38 religious sisters and 24 schools, and for the diocese 940,000 Catholics, 69 diocesan and 16 religious priests, 27 seminarians, 18 religious brothers and 81 religious sisters and 18 schools. \n\nIn his letter of 25 December 2001, Pope John Paul II promised to ensure the episcopal succession of Bishop Licínio Rangel, and when Bishop Rangel asked that he be given an auxiliary bishop, recommended him to ask instead for a coadjutor, who would have the automatic right of succession. The Pope then, on 28 June 2002, appointed to that post Bishop Rangel's vicar general, Fernando Arêas Rifan, who automatically succeeded Bishop Rangel as Apostolic Administrator, when the latter died on 16 December 2002.\n\nA group of traditionalist Catholics was thus accommodated fully within the Catholic Church. They accept the authority of the Pope as Vicar of Christ and Shepherd of the Church, the legitimacy of the Second Vatican Council and the validity of the Mass approved by Pope Paul VI. The clergy of the apostolic administration possess the faculty to celebrate in Latin the Mass, the sacraments and all other sacramental rites in the form codified by Saint Pius V and modified by his successors down to Saint John XXIII.\n\nIn his first pastoral letter to the clergy, religious, associations and other faithful of the Apostolic Administration, Bishop Rifan stressed the importance of the papal mandate or canonical mission given to him, quoting the Council of Trent's anathema against any who would say that one who lacks it is a lawful preacher of the word of God and minister of the sacraments.\n\nHe also warned those to whom he addressed his pastoral letter against two errors. One is heresy, attacks against the traditional Faith. He saw as a defence against that the traditional Latin liturgy and liturgical discipline that the Apostolic Administration keeps. The other error is schism, attacks against the unity of governance of the Church. Members of the Apostolic Administration must be on their guard against this too, he said, especially since their rightful efforts to preserve the Catholic faith had some unfortunate effects, in particular the onset of \"a certain schismatic spirit that showed itself in a general taste for systematic criticism of Church authorities, a spirit of resistance, disobedience, disrespect, suspicion, backbiting, independence from the Church's Hierarchy and Magisterium, contentment with the abnormality of the situation, uncharitableness, a feeling of owning the whole of truth, a sectarian attitude that made us out to be the only good people ... with the underlying notion that 'the gates of Hell' had prevailed against the Church - something that, through the infallible help of our Saviour, is impossible.\"\n\nThe document in Portuguese \"Answers to 48 questions on our recognition by the Holy See\" explains in details the reasons for the priests' decision to seek reconciliation with the Holy See and for their disagreement with the attitude, in this matter, of the Society of St Pius X.\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Cardinal Castrillón stated that there were cordial relations between the Personal Apostolic Administration and the Diocese of Campos at all levels, and that priests of the Apostolic Administration were celebrating Mass in the older form for the traditionalist faithful in another dozen dioceses in Brazil in accordance with signed agreements that they had with the diocesan bishops.\n\n\n"}

It contains the remains of a Punic-Roman sanctuary, which was excavated by Italian archaeologists in the 1960s. The area is privately owned and it is currently in a dilapidated state.\n\nRas il-Wardija was probably first inhabited in the Bronze Age, in around 1500 BC. In around the 3rd century BC, during the Punic period, a religious complex (probably a nymphaeum) was established in the area. Since the site is clearly visible from the sea, it might have also served as a beacon for ships travelling between the Maltese Islands and North Africa.\n\nThe site remained in use throughout the Roman period. Carved crosses on the walls suggest that the site eventually became a Christian place of worship. The site remained in use until around the 4th century AD. A hermitage might have existed in the area during the medieval period.\n\nThe main structural elements of the site are:\nThe masonry structure has some similarities to the remains of the Punic-Roman sanctuary at Tas-Silġ in Marsaxlokk.\n\nThe area around Ras il-Wardija was used for defensive purposes during World War II. The site was first excavated by the Missione Archaeologica Italiana a Malta (Archaeological Mission of Malta) between 1964 and 1967. The temple was well preserved until the excavations, but it has since deteriorated.\n\nOn 30 March 1988, it was discovered that an ancient graffito carved on one of the walls of the sanctuary had been stolen. The graffito shows a human figure with outstretched arms, in the shape of a cross. It has been suggested that the figure represents the Punic goddess Tanit, but it might also be a medieval representation of a Christian cross. The graffito was recovered in June 2011, and it is now on display at the Gozo Museum of Archaeology in the Cittadella.\n\nThe land on which the sanctuary is located is privately owned by George Spiteri, and permission may be required in order to access the site. It is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.\n"}

Roquepertuse had no domiciles available for worshippers and has been used as a sanctuary where only priests may have lived permanently. It was destroyed by the Romans in 124 BC and was discovered in 1860. Most of the excavations were done in 1923 by Henri de Gérin-Ricard.\n\nOfficially, the findings have been dated to the 3rd century BC. This age has been established based on Celtic expansion into the area, which took place around the same time. However, the clothing and gestures of certain statues found at the site suggest that they date from the 5th or 6th century BC, instead. These statues are distinguished by their unique seated position, comparable to the upright and cross-legged seated position found in statues depicting the Buddha.\n\n\nThe first interpretations of archaeologists was that this was a secluded sanctuary. The latest findings, from various multidisciplinary studies, suggest that it was an agglomeration of about 0.5 hectares with a sanctuary to the north, as well as a bulwark of protection.\n\nThe site is important in part because it provides evidence for the Celtic \"head cult\" described in Greek and Roman accounts.\n\nThe site is near to another Celtic-Roman site at Entremont, which had similar relief sculpture of severed human and horse heads, as well as skull niches carved into pillars.

{"id": "599998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599998", "title": "Sayyid", "text": "Sayyid\n\nSayyid (also spelt Syed, Saiyed, Seyit, Seyd, Said, Sayed, Sayyed, Saiyid, Seyed and Seyyed) ( , ; meaning \"Mister\"; plural ) is an honorific title denoting people ( for females) accepted as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his cousin Imam Ali through his grandsons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali (combined Hasnain), sons of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and son-in-law Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib).\n\nFemale \"sayyids\" are given the titles \"Sayyida\", \"Syeda\", \"Alawiyah\" or \"Sharifa\". In some regions of the Islamic world, such as in India, the descendants of Muhammad are given the title \"Amir\" or Mir, meaning \"commander\", \"general\" (please note Amir is also a name commonly used, as is any variant of \"Sayyid\" or \"Sayyida\"). The descendents of the Islamic Prophet Muhammed honour the possession of family trees tracing back their ancestry. In other regions, they are called \" Shah\". Children of a Sayyida mother but a non-Sayyid father are referred to as Mirza.\n\nIn the Arab world, \"sayyid\" is the equivalent of the English word \"liege lord\" or \"master\" when referring to a descendant of Muhammad, as in \"Sayyid Ali Sultan.\" The word \"sidi\" (from the contracted form \"sayyidī\", 'my liege') is often used in Arabic.\n\nAlthough not verified, many Arabic language experts state that it has its roots in the word \"Al Asad\" , meaning \"lion\", probably because of the qualities of valour and leadership.\n\nAlthough reliable statistics are unavailable, conservative estimates put the number of Sayyids in the tens of millions.\n\nThe Sayyids are by definition a branch of the Banu Hashim, that traces its lineage to Adnan and therefore it is directly descended from Ishmael (Ismâ`îl), as well as being collaterally descended from his paternal half brother Isaac (Isha'aq), the sons of Abraham (Ibrahim).\n\nBanū Hāshim (Arabic: بنو هاشم) is the clan of prophet Muhammad ; his great-grandfather was Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, for whom the clan is named. Members of this clan are referred to as Hashemites. Descendants of Muhammed usually carry the titles Sayyid, Syed, Hashmi, Sayed and Sharif, or the Ashraf clan (synonymous to Ahl al-Bayt).\nToday, two sovereign monarchs – Abdullah II of Jordan and Muhammad VI of Morocco – and the erstwhile royal family of Libya are also considered to be a part of Banu Hashim.\n\nThe Hashemites (Arabic: الهاشميون, Al-Hāshimīyūn; also House of Hashim) are the ruling royal family of Jordan. The House was also the royal family of Syria (1920), Hejaz (1916–1925) and Iraq (1921–1958). The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca – also referred to as Hashemites – who ruled Mecca continuously from the 10th century until its conquest by the House of Saud in 1924. Their eponymous ancestor is Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.\n\nTraditionally, Islam has had a rich history of the veneration of relics, especially of those attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The most genuine prophetic relics are believed to be those housed in Istanbul's Topkapı Palace, in a section known as \"Hirkai Serif Odasi\" (Chamber of the Holy Mantle).\n\nIn the early period, the Arabs used the term \"Sayyid\" and \"Sharif\" to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. However, in the modern era, the term 'Sharif' (\"Sharifah\" for females) has been used to denote descendants from Hasan, and the term 'Sayyid' (\"Sayyidah\", \"Syeda\" for females) has been used to denote descendants from Husayn.\n\nSayyids often include the following titles in their names to indicate the figure from whom they trace their descent. The descendants of Ali and his other wives are called \"Alevi sayyid\"; they are titled Shah, Sain, Miya Fakir or Dewan.\n\nNote: (For non-Arabic speakers) When transliterating Arabic words into English there are two approaches.\n\nAlso, El-Husseini, Al-Husseini, Husseini, and Hussaini.\n\nThose who use the term \"Sayyid\" for all descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib regard Allawis or Alavis as Sayyids. However, Allawis are not descendants of Muhammad, as they are descended from the children of Ali and the women he married after the death of Fatima, such as Umm ul-Banin (Fatima bint Hizam). Those who limit the term \"Sayyid\" to descendants of Muhammad through Fatima,Allawis/Alavis are the same how \"Sayyids\".\n\nSome Sayyids also claim to be \"Najeeb Al Tarfayn\", meaning \"Noble on both sides\", which indicates that both of their parents are Sayyid. But in actuality this term is applied only to those Sayyids who have both Imam Hassan and Imam Hussain in their ancestry. These Sayyids, especially in the Arab world, would keep the prefix of \"Sayyid Alshareef\" or \"Shareefayn\", or \"Sayyidayn\" or \"Sheikh Assayyid\" before their names, followed by their father's and grandfather's names and then the clan's and tribe's names followed by \"AlHasani bil Hussaini\" or \"Al Hussaini bil Hasani\", depending on which Imam is patrilineal or matrilineal. Many Sayyids, especially in South Asia and Shia Sayyids, think that only the progeny of both Sayyid parents are called \"Najeeb Al Tarfayn\", but this idea may be attributed to a lack of knowledge in Arabic language and Genealogy. The importance of this concept of \"Najeeb AlTarfayn\" has its source in the Hadeeth of Muhammad wherein he stated that the Mahdi, or \"The Hidden One\", would be \"Najeeb AlTarfayn\" from his lineage. Hence, Shia and Sunni Sayyids have different interpretations of this concept.In the Arab world Najeeb AlTarfayn Saadah would keep two white-colored daggers as opposed to just one by other Sayyids to demarcate their superiority amongst them. Hence their International coat of arms also shows two daggers.\n\nThe existence of any descendant of Hasan al Askari is disputed by many people. However, it is believed by Shia followers of the Twelve Imams that Hasan al-Askari had a son called Muhammad al-Mahdi, who will be the redeemer of Islam. Genealogy trees of Middle Eastern and Central Asian families, mostly from Persia, Khorasan, Samarqand and Bukhara, show that Hasan al-Askari had also a second son called Sayyid Ali Akbar. It definitely indicates that al-Askari had children and it also substantiates the existence of Muhammad al Mahdi. Whether Al Askari had children or not is still disputed may be because of the political conflicts between the followers of the Imamah and the leadership of the Abbasids and Ghulat Shiites who do not believe in Hasan al-Askaris Imamah. Another group of historians studying the pedigrees of some Central Asian saints' \"shejere\" (genealogy trees), believe that the Twelfth Imam was not the only son of Hasan al-Askari, and that the Eleventh Imam had two sons, Sayyid Muhammad (i.e., the Shia Mahdi) and Sayyid Ali Akbar. One descendant of Sayyid Ali Akbar was Saint Ishan (Eshon) Imlo of Bukhara. Ishan Imlo is called \"saint of the last time\" in Bukhara, as it is believed that after him there were no more SaintsAsian Muslims generally revere him as the last of the Saints. According to the source, Ishan Imlo died in 1162AH (1748–1749); his mausoleum (mazar) is in a cemetery in Bukhara. Notable descendants of Sayyid Ali Akbar are Sufi Saints like Bahauddin Naqshband, descendant after eleven generations, Khwaja Khawand Mahmud known as Hazrat Ishaan, descendant after eighteen generations, the two brothers Sayyid ul Sadaat Sayyid Mir Jan and Sayyid ul Sadaat Mir Sayyid Mahmud Agha, maternal descendants of Hasan al Askari. and also qadi Qozi Sayyid Bahodirxon., Sufi saints Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin and Pir Baba.\n\nIn her book \"Pain and Grace: A Study of Two Mystical Writers of Eighteenth-Century Muslim India\", Dr.Annemarie Schimmel writes:\n\nAlthough Shiite historians generally reject the claim that Hasan al-Askari fathered children other than Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Shiite hadith book \"Usul al-Kafi\", in Bab Mawlid Abi Muhammad al-Hasan b. 'Ali confirms the Sufi claim that Hasan al-Askari had more than one wife, in addition to slave girls, with whom he had relations. In his Usul, al-Kafi writes:\n\nMen belonging to the Sayyid families or tribes in the Arab world used to wear White or Ivory colored daggers like Jambiyas, Khanjars or Shibriyas to demarcate their nobility amongst the other Arab men although this custom has been restricted due to the local laws of the variously divided Arab countries. Wearing Turbans of various colors especially white, black, green, yellow, orange or maroon is still done in its place and this practice has been followed more by the Non Arab Sayyids than Arabic speaking ones.\n\nThe Sayyid families in Iraq are so numerous that there are books written especially to list the families and connect their trees. Some of these families are the Al-Nasrullah, Al-Wahab, Al-Hashimi, Al-Quraishi, Al-Obaidi, Al-Yasiri, Al-Samarai, Al-Zaidi, Al-A'araji, Al-Hasani, Al-Hussaini, Al-Shahristani, Al-Qazwini Al-Qadri, Tabatabaei, Al-Alawi, Al-Ghawalib (Al-Ghalibi), Al-Musawi, Al-Awadi (not to be confused with the Al-Awadhi Huwala family), Al-Sabzewari, Al-Shubber, Al-Hayali, Al-Kamaludeen, Al Gharawi and some of the Al Kaabi and many others.\n\nSayyids (in \"seyyed\") are found in vast numbers in Iran. The Chief of “National Organization for Civil Registration” of Iran declared that more than 6 million of Iranians are Sayyid. The majority of Sayyids migrated to Iran from Arab lands predominantly in the 15th to 17th century during the Safavid era. The Safavids began transforming the religious landscape of Iran by imposing Twelver Shiism on the populace. Since most of the population embraced Sunni Islam, and since an educated version of Shiism was scarce in Iran at the time, Ismail imported a new Shia \"Ulama\" corps who predominantly were Sayyids from traditional Shiite centers of the Arabic-speaking lands, such as Jabal Amel (of southern Lebanon), Syria, Bahrain, and southern Iraq in order to create a state clergy. The Safavids offered them land and money in return for loyalty. These scholars taught the doctrine of Twelver Shiism, made it accessible to the population, and energetically encouraged conversion to Shiism.\n\nDuring the reign of Shah Abbas the Great, the Safavids also imported to Iran more Arab Shias, predominantly Sayyids, built religious institutions for them, including many \"Madrasas\" (religious schools), and successfully persuaded them to participate in the government, which they had shunned in the past (following the Hidden imam doctrine).\n\nCommon Sayyid family surnames in Iran are Husseini, Mousavi, Kazemi, Razavi, Eshtehardian, Tabatabaei, Hashemi, Hassani, Emami, Ladjevardi, Zaidi, and Imamzadeh.\n\nThey were given accommodation free of charge.\n\nIn Oman Sayyid is used by members of the Al Said ruling royal family. The absolute ruler of the country retains the title Sultan with members of the royal family eligible for succession to the throne given the title Sheikh, these may also use the title Sayyid should they wish to, although as Sheikh supersedes this, it is not a widely used practise. Members of the extended family or members by marriage carry the title Sayyid or Sayyida for a female. Such titles in Oman are hereditary through paternal lineage or in some exceptional circumstances may be given as an honorary title by Royal Decree.\n\nIn Yemen the Sayyids are more generally known as \"sadah\"; they are also referred to as \"Hashemites\". In terms of religious practice they are Shia, Sunni, and Sufi. Sayyid families in Yemen include the Rassids, the Qasimids, the Mutawakkilites, the Hamideddins, some Al-Zaidi of Ma'rib, Sana'a, and Sa'dah, the Ba 'Alawi sada families in Hadhramaut, Al-Wazir of Sana'a, Al-Shammam of Sa'dah, the Sufyan of Juban, the Al-Jaylani of Juban, and others.\n\nThe Sayyids in Libya are Sunni, including the former royal family, which is originally Zaidi-Moroccan (also known as the Senussi family).\nAdd to that the El-Barassa Family are Ashraf as claimed by the sons of Abdulsalam ben Meshish, a descendant of Hassan bin Ali bin Abi Talib.\n\nAlthough millions of people in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal claim Hashemite descent (Genealogy family trees 'Shajra' are looked into in identification of the authenticity of the claim to Hashemite descent). In 1901 the total number of Sayyids in British India was counted as 1,339,734. Recent estimates show that in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal there are more than fifteen million Sayyids: eight million in Pakistan, seven million in India, over one million in Bangladesh, and around seventy thousand in Nepal.\n\nSayyids migrated many centuries ago from different parts of the Middle East, Central Asia (Turkestan), during the invasion of the Mongols, and other periods of turmoil such as during the periods of the Ghaznavid dynasty, Delhi Sultanate, and Mughal Empire, encompassing a timespan of roughly until the late 19th century. Sayyids migrated to Sindh and Uch in the north and settled there very early. Other early migrant Sayyids moved deep into the south, to the Deccan sultanates located in the Deccan Plateau region in the time of the Bahmani Sultanate, and later the Qutb Shahi kings of Golkonda, Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar, and other kingdoms of Bijapur, Bidar, and Berar. Several visited India as merchants or escaped from the Abbasid, Umayyad, Safavid, and Ottoman Empires. Their names figure in Indian history at the breakup of the Mughal Empire, when the Sayyid Brothers created and dethroned Emperors at their will (1714–1720). The first Muslims appointed to the Council of India and the first appointed to the privy council were both Sayyids.\n\nSyeds, wherever they went, were respected by local communities. Most of them were assigned religious duties by local leaders. When the Muslim conquest of South Asia began, Turkish Iranian and Afghan Islamic forces from Central Asia also brought with them many Syed religious scholars who not only used to perform religious rites in the army but also preached Islam to the local population. Among them were the ancestors of modern-day Tirmizi and Naqvi al-Bukhari Syeds.\n\nDuring the entire period of Mughal ascendancy in the Indian sub-continent, the Mughals acknowledged Karlughs as the rulers of Pakhli sarkar. In addition, probably due to their common Central Asian origin, Mughals never levied taxes on the state of Pakhli Sarkar. Sultan Maqarrab revolted against his own brother Sultan Mehmud Khurd, but was defeated by the Sultan due to intervention from the Delhi Sultanate under the command of Syed Jalal Tirmizi Baba the grandson of Pir Baba. In honor Sultan Mehmud Khurd marry his daughter to Syed Jalal Baba in 1701. Around 1713 Sultan Mehmud Khurd went to Delhi; in his absence Shamsher Khan, a general of Sultan Khurd, revolted against the Mughals, citing increased interference on the part of the Mughal Empire at the Jhanjal fort of Thakot. This revolt was successfully put down after a siege of several months by Syed Jalal Baba, and their allies, the Yousafzais, defeated Shamsher Khan, who was killed in battle and Sultan Khurd imprisoned by Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha in Delhi until his death. Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha, the cousin of Syed Jalal Baba, who were both powerful Mughal Army generals of the Mughal Empire during the early 18th century. The Sayyid Brothers became highly influential in the Mughal Court after Aurangzeb's death and became kingmakers during the anarchy following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. They created and dethroned Mughal Emperors at their will during the 1710s. Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha was fatally poisoned in 1722.\n\nAnother main fight was fought between the Hindus and Sikhs of Shamdhara and Syed Jalal Baba troops in the Agror Valley (Shamdhara was a great centre of business run by Hindu Baniyas as like Qissa Khawani Bazaar Peshawer and was located on Silk road to China). Syed Jalal Baba issued an ultimatum to either accept Islam or be ready for battle. The Hindus and Sikhs chose battle, so Syed Jalal sent his brother, Pir Imam Tirmizi (the grandson of Pir Baba), along with Yosafzai's troops, to capture the Agror Valley. A bloody battle started among Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims at the place of Shamdhara named \"Kundiyan\"; this area still exists between Shamdhara (Yousafzai families still live there and are called Khankhel) and Chajjar Syedan (the Tirmizi families still live there). Signs of the ancient battles are easily found: hundred of human skulls can be unearthed after digging just a meter of ground. After a siege of several months, Hindus and Sikhs asked for safe passage to leave Shamdhara.\n\nAfter the Karlugh Turks were overthrown (the Turks retained small lands everywhere), the tribes of the Syeds and Yousafzai established their rule on the plains of Pakhli the Chattar, in the mountains of Kaghan, and in the Agror Valley. These areas were then divided among the above-mentioned tribes.\n\nHowever, after the fall of Jhanjer Fort and Shamdhara, Syed Jalal Baba and his allies gained control of the area, and from that base embarked on military campaigns across the state. Since they met with little resistance, the Syeds and Yousafzai easily entered the Rush area of Hazara.\n\nIn the 1850s the British captured Pakhli, Kaghan, and the Agror Valley from the Syeds and Yousafzai. Many Syeds and Yousafzai were killed and arrested by the British. Some Yousafzai made a truce with British, and now they all are titled as Khan of their areas. The majority of Syed and Yousafzai allies moved to the Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) (the location of famous villages Parari Syedan, Tikari, and Tilli Syedan) and in the mountains of Kaghan and Naran (village of Bugarmang). The British built a fort in 1865 (currently the headquarters of the Frontier Constabulary (FC)Oghi District) and deployed a battalion there. They also built a check post on the highest place of Oghi from which they watched and observed their enemies (this check post still exists and is known as \"Picket\").\nThe Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) tribes (Syeds and Yousafzai) had never been under direct British rule, although it was generally accounted to be part of the 'Frontier Region/Provincial Tribal Areas' from about 1901 onward and nominally attached to the then Hazara district. The tribes had been involved in fighting with British for quite some time, and a number of famous 'Black Mountain Expeditions' or 'Campaigns' took place between 1852 and the 1920s. A brief account of the British Expeditions against the Tor Ghar tribes follows:\n\nMeanwhile, The Islamic State of Swat was established in 1849 under Syed Akbar Shah (the grandson of Pir Baba) with Sharia law remaining in force, but the state was in abeyance from 1878 to 1915. Thereafter, Syedd Abdul-Jabbar Shah, nephew of Syed Akbar Shah, was made ruler by a local Jirga and had trouble exercising power. Syed Abdul-Jabbar Shah become prime minister of the State of Amb in the late 1920s.\n\nThe Sayyid population in India is distributed. The total population of Sayyids in India is 7,017,000, the largest populations being those of Uttar Pradesh (1,493,000), Maharashtra (1,108,000), Karnataka (766,000), Andhra Pradesh (727,000), Rajasthan (497,000), Bihar (419,000), West Bengal (372,000), Madhya Pradesh (307,000), Gujarat (245,000), and Tamil Nadu (206,000), with 25,000 in Jammu and Kashmir. Sayyids are also found in the north-eastern state of Assam, where locally they are also referred to as \"Dawans\".\n\nIn India, Sayyids of Hadramawt (who originated mainly from the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf) gained widespread fame. There is a big community of Sayyids settled in and around the Nanganallur region in Chennai. They can trace their ancestry directly to the Sayyids of Iraq.\n\nThe earliest migration of Sayyids from Afghanistan to North India took place in 1032AD when Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu (general and brother-in-law of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni) and his son Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud established their military headquarters at Satrikh ( from Zaidpur) in the Barabanki district, Uttar Pradesh. They are considered to be the first Muslim settlers in North India. In 1033AD Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud was killed at the battle of Bahraich, the location of his \"mazr\". Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud had no children. Iraqi Sayyids or Iraqi biradri in Eastern Uttar Pradesh are descendants of Sayyid Masud Al Hussaini who was direct descendant of Prophet's grandson Hussain ibn Ali and came to India from Iraq during the reign of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1330 A.D. He settled with his seven sons and forty champions in Ghazipur (U.P.). This is because some of them converted to Sunni Islam in the reign of Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi. His Shia descendants are now known as Sayyids of Ghazipur. Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri and Khan Bahadur Aga Syed Hussain were both Rizvi Sayyids through Aaqa Meer Sayyid Hussain Qomi Rizvi, whose sacred shrine is in the Zainageer Village of Sopore, Kashmir.\n\nSayyids of Syed nagli, or Said Nagli, or the Baquari Syeds had migrated from Termez (Present day Uzbekistan) during the Sultanate era. Sikandar Lodi was the ruler of Delhi when Mir Syed Mohammad al Hussain al Hussaini al Termezi Haji al Haramain came to India and settled at Syed Nagli. He was a Baquari Syed who drew his lineage from Imam Mohammad al Baqir.\n\nPerhaps the most important figure in the history of the Sayyid in Uttar Pradesh was Sayyid Basrullah Shustari, who moved from Mashad in Iran in 1549 and joined the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Akbar later appointed Shustari as his chief justice, and Shustari used his position to strengthen the position of the various Sayyid families. They were preferred in administrative posts, and formed a privileged elite. When the Mughal Empire disintegrated, the Sayyid played an important role in turbulent politics of the time. The new British colonial authorities that replaced the Mughals after the Battle of Buxar also made a pragmatic decision to work with the various Sayyid jagirdars. Several Sayyid taluqdars in Awadh were substantial landowners under the British colonial regime, and many other Sayyid still played their part in the administration of the state. After abolition of zamindari system many Sayyid zamindars (e.g. that of Ghazipur) had to leave their homes.\n\nThe ancestor of the Bārha Sayyids, Sayyid Abu'l Farah Al Hussaini Al Wasti left his original home in Wasit, Iraq, with his twelve sons at the end of the 13th century (or the beginning of the 14th century) and migrated to India, where he obtained four villages in Sirhind-Fategarh. By the 16th century Abu'l Farah's descendants had taken over Bārha villages in Muzaffarnagar.\n\nThe Sayyids of Bilgram are Hussaini Sayyids, who first migrated from Wasit, Iraq, in the 13th century. Their ancestor, Syed Mohammad Sughra, a Zaidi Sayyid of Iraq, arrived in India during the rule of Sultan Iltutmish. In 1217–18 the family conquered and settled in Bilgram.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Sufi that belonged to a Sayyid family was Syed Salar Masud, from whom many of the Sayyid families of Awadh claim their descent. Sayyids of Salon (Raebareli), Jarwal (Bahraich), Kintoor (Barabanki), and Zaidpur (Barabanki) were well known \"Taluqadars\" (feudal lords) of Awadh province.\n\nThe Sayyids are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, with Faizabad, Muzaffarnagar Balrampur, Raibareli, Hallaur, Wasa Dargah, Lucknow, Barabanki, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Kanpur Azamgarh, Allahabad, Amroha, Bareilly, Meerut and Aligarh being home to large Sayyid communities. They generally speak Urdu, and most also understand the various dialects of Hindi. The Sayyid are divided along sectarian lines, with a slight majority belonging to the Shia sect, especially in the Awadh region, while the Sunni are found mainly in the western districts. They are further divided into discreat endigamous clans, bases on territorial groupings. The most important ones are the Abidi Sadaat-e-Phoolpur Dist Balrampur Sadaat-e-Karari, Sadaat-e-Jais Sadaat-e-Bara, Sadaat-e-Kundharki, Sadaat Amroha, Sadaat-e-Barabanki, Sadaat-e-Saithal, Sadaat-e-Sirsi, Sadaat-e-Rudauli, Sayyids of Hallaur, Sayyids of Wasa Dargah, Sadaat-e-Bilgram and Sadaat-e-Barn, Sadaat-e-Chholas, Sadaat-e-Jarcha and Sadaat-e-Nagli. Other groupings include the Alavi, Abidi, Baqiri or Baquari, Barcha, Bukhari, Jafari, Jalali, Kazmi, Naqvi, Rizvi, Tirmizi and Zaidi, each claiming descent from a particular Shia Imam. Sayyids often include the following titles in their names to indicate the figure from whom they trace their descent. If they are descended from more than one notable ancestor or Shi'a Imam, they will use the title of the ancestor from whom they are most directly descended.\n\nTraditional Sayyid families rarely marry outside their community, with an emphasis of marrying into \"Najeeb Altarfain\" (of Sayyid descent from both the mother’s and father’s side) families. This insistence on endogamy has begun to decline among the more urbanized families, with an increase inter marriage with other group such as the Shaikh and Mughals.\n\nHistorically the Sayyids of UP were substantial landowners, often absentees, and this was especially the case with the Awadh taluqdars. In the urban townships, Sayyid families served as priests, teachers and administrators, with the British colonial authorities given the community a preference in recruitment. Though they are less than 3% of Muslim population, they control a majority of economic resources.The community also has a very high literacy rate.The independence and partition of India in 1947 was traumatic for the community, with many families becoming divided, with some members moved to Pakistan. This was followed by the abolishment of the zamindari system, where land was redistributed to those who till the land. Many Sayyids who remained on the land are now medium and small scale farmers. While in the urban areas, there has been a shift towards modern occupations.\n\nIn Gujarat, most of the Sayyid families are descended from individuals invited by the Muslim rulers of Gujarat to serve as advisers and administrators, and granted \"jagirs\". During the period of Sultan Mahmud Begada (1458–1511), the Sayyid of Gothada, Thasra, and Pali, a Zaidi SayyidSaadat-e-Bara. Sultan Mahmud Begada provided land to three Sayyid brothers and a grant to settle there after the victory of Pavagadh fort. In 1484 the young Sultan, after laying siege to the fort for twenty months, conquered it on 21 November 1484. He then transferred his capital to Champaner, which he completely rebuilt at the foothills of the Pavagadh fort, calling it Muhammadabad. During Mughal rule in Gujarat (1570–1750), they held the majority of the civil and ecclesiastical posts. For example, the Sayyids of Thasra, Kheda district were invited to serve as administrators and judges by the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, and provided land grants to settle there. They also provided an important element in the Mughal army, and many are still found in the old Muslim garrison towns such as Ahmedabad. In addition, many of the early Sufi saints that came to Gujarat belonged to Sayyid families. Most of these Sayyid families came from Central Asia, Iran, Yemen, Oman, Basra, and Bahrain.\n\nBihar\n\nIn bihar, sayyids settled from the 13th century onwards, many sufi saints of bihar were sayyids, most famous was Makhdoom yahya maneri(d:1381 Ad).\n\nApparently the most prominent sayyids of bihar has been Malick community, who descended from the seven sons and immediate blood relatives of sayid Ibrahim Malick,(d 1353 Ad) who was also a ruler of bihar and a famous sufi Saint. In bihar sayyids were landlords, barristers, intellectuals, clerics, teachers, businessmen and farmers.They had apparently strong hold of bihari politics prior to independence of india, as the first chief minister of bihar during the british india was barrister yunus of panhar, also a sayyid of mallick community, There is also a small minority of twelver sayyids in bihar.\n\nKerala has a two-thousand-year-old association with Arabia. In Malayalam, \"Thangal\" is an honorific Muslim title almost equivalent to the Arabic term Sayyid, which is given to males believed to be descendants of Muhammad. The present day Thangals are supposed to be descended from Sayyid families who migrated from the historic city of Tarim, in the Hadhramaut Province, Yemen, during the 17th century in order to propagate Islam on the Malabar Coast. Sayyids selected coastal areas to settle. The royal family of Arakkal in Kerala had Thangal origins.\n\nThere are a notable number of Sayyids in Tamil Nadu mostly concentrated in the cities like Erwadi, Nagore, Madurai and Kayalpattinam. Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed of Ervadi a Hussaini descendant of Prophet Mohammed and a ruler of Madinah travelled to South India in mid 12th century. His descendants who live at Ervadi with the clan name of Levvai are from a single forefather and are Sayyids. The heirs of Hazrat Shahul Hamid Abdul Qadir badusha of Nagore who live there and are called with clan name of Sahib or Saab or Saabu are Sayyids. Hazrat Kazi Syed Tajuddin the son of Mufti Jamaluddin al Ma'abari who founded the Kazimar Big Mosque in 13th century the first mosque in Madurai is from Syed family. Till today his descendants (Syeds-Qazis-Huqdars) have managed to live in the same Kazimar Street locality in the center of Madurai city for over 7 centuries and are managing the Kazimar Big Mosque constructed by their forefather. Syed Tajuddin's younger son Hazrat Kazi Alauddin lived in Kayalpattinam and his shrine is found there. His female descendants live there.\n\nThere are numerous Sayyids in Pakistan. Some of these Sayyids first migrated to Gardez, Bukhara, and Termez, and then to South Asia. Many settled early in Uch, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Punjab. There are many sayyids of both Shia and Sunni sects of Islam. Amongst the famous Sayyids who migrated to this region were Shah Yousaf Gardez of Multan, who came to Multan, Punjab, around 1050AD. His grandfather, Syed Ali Qaswer, a decedent of Imam Jafar Sadiq, the grandson of Imam Hussain, migrated from Bughdad and was settled in Gardez, Afghanistan. The Gardezis of Pakistan and the Azad of Jammu and Kashmir are his descendants. Other saints include Syed Ali Shah Tirmizi (Pir Baba) of Buner, Syed Kastir Gul (Kaka Sahib) of Nowshera, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, Shaykh Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi of Khanqi Andrabi in Kashmir, Haji Syed Ahmed Shah (Haji Baba) of Dir and Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki. Sayyid people of Pakistan are figured as the most prominent and well-established people of the country, with a number of them having become popular and well-known religious icons, political leaders, and professionals. Furthermore, Pakistan currently holds the largest Sayyid population in all of South Asia. Mashwanis are also living in Pakistan.\n\nThe Syeds in Balochistan are present in the Pishine and District Harnai. The Harnai Syed include sub-categories such as Bukhari, Qadree, Pahchi, Maswani, and Miagan. The Syed Bukhari is popular in Harnai district because of his religious thoughts. The popular mazar of Syed Bukhari in the districts of Harnai Shaikh Mussa Baba and Shaik Zirak and Mubarak are also populated...\n\nThe Sayyids of Punjab belong to the \"Hasani\" (descendants of Hasan), \"Husaini\" (descendants of Husayn), \"Zaidi\" (descendants of Zayd ibn Ali, grandson of Husayn), Rizvi, (descendants of Ali al-Ridha), \"Sherazi\" (descendants of Jafar-As-Sadiq) and \"Naqvi\"(descendants of Ali al-Hadi).\n\nThe Sayyids from Sheraz, Iran migrated to Baluchistan and later to Sindh are known as Sherazi Sayyid. They are living in Jacobabad and Thatta. The first Sherazi Sayyid to migrate from Baluchistan to Sindh was Malook Shah who was saint. He is buried near Jacobabad cities. Another famous saint of Sindh Mehr Shah was from the lineage of Malook Shah.\nMPA Aijaz Ali Shah and Ex-Provincial Secretary Arbab Ali Shah are Sherazi Sayyid.\n\nThe Tirmizis, who settled in Pakistan, are mostly descendants of the great Sufi spiritual saint Syed Ali Shah Tirmizi Pir Baba. Pir Baba's grave and shrine is in Bacha Killay village in the mountainous Buner District of present Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan. He was also known as \"Shāh Kurassan\" (\"King of Kurassan\").\n\nImportant Sayyid communities in South Asia include:\nIbraheem al-Ghamar bin Hasan Muthanna had a son named Isma'eel ad-Deebaj. Ad-Deebaj had two sons: Hasan bin Isma'eel ad-Deebaj – he left a large progeny; and Ibraheem bin Isma'eel ad-Deebaj – he came to be known as Tabataba. It is mostly his progeny who have spread across Iran and Iraq who are known as the Tabatabai and use that as their last name.\n\nIt was the children of Imam Hasan and their children who came to India as the first Muslims in Sind. This was in the time of Hajjaj bin Yusuf. Later many of them moved from Sind to other parts of India. Hasani Syeds populate a town named Rudauli near Lucknow, in Punjab and in other areas of the sub-continent.\n\nOne of the earliest settlements of Naqvis is reported from Nasirabad, Raibareli in North India. Naqvi Sadats migrated from Sabzevar, Iran and arrived in Nasirabad around 410 Hijri (around 1027AD) and settled there. After some time adjacent Patakpur (Nasirabad), was also inhabited by \"Mu'mins\" and rechristened as Nasirabad after the name of Syed Naseerudin companion and sipahsalar of Hazrath Shah Jalal (Rh:). Nasirabad is the earliest known Naqvi Sadats of India. Naseerabad is the native land of Khandan e Ijtihad and a multitude of very high-ranking scholars have come from there. The first \"Mujtahid\" from India, Dildar Ali Naseerabadi was from here and later his family came to be called \"Khandan e Ijtihad\" due to the heavy presence of high-ranking scholars. Some famous and known religious scholars from this lineage include Syedul Ulema Ayatullah Syed Ali Naqi Naqvi 'Naqqan', Jannat Ma'ab Ayatullah Syed Mohammad Naqvi, Ayatullah Aqa Hasan Sb, Ayatullah Syed Kalbe Hussain Naqvi, Hujjatul Islam Syed Kalbe Abid Naqvi, Hujjatul Islam Syed Kalbe Jawwad Naqvi, Hujjatul Islam Syed Hasan Zafar Naqvi (based in Karachi), Allama Syed Razi Jafar, Allama Nasir Ijtehadi, Dr Kalbe Sadiq, Hujjatul Islam Syed Ali Mohammad Naqvi.\nThe Sadaat Amroha or Amrohi Syed are a community of Sayyids, historically settled in the town of Amroha, in Uttar Pradesh, India. Many members of the Sadaat Amroha community have migrated to Pakistan after independence and have settled in Karachi, Sindh.\nThe Sadaat Bukhari of pargana Chail are Naqvi Syeds and being descended from syed Hussam aldin Bukhari ibn Sadruddin Rajju Qattal (brother of Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari) ibn Syed Ahmed Kabir ibn Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari.\nSadat-e-Bara (Urdu: ہسادات بار), sometimes pronounced Sadaat-e-Barha, are a community of Sayyids, originally from a group of twelve villages situated in the Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh in India. This community had considerable influence during the latter days of the Mughal Empire. They were also found in the Karnal district and Haryana in India. Many members of this community have migrated to Pakistan after independence and have settled in Karachi, Khairpur State in Sind and Lahore.\nZaidi Sayyed migrated from Jansath to the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh namely Sikanderpur, Kandipur in the Ambedkar Nagar district. These Sayyeds are descendants of Abul Farah Wasti who came to India from Wasit, Iraq in the late 13th century along with his four sons.\nThe Gardēzī Sadaat is a Sadaat Muslim family of Sayyid from Gardez, Afghanistan; consequently known as ‘Gardēzī Sadaat’ in South Asia.\nKintoor or Kintur is a village about north-east of Badosarai in the Barabanki district, famous for the battle of Kintoor of 1858 during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\nHallaur or Hallor (Urdu, Persian and Arabic: هلور, Hindi: हल्लौर, Bhojpuri: हलूर) is a town or a big village in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, situated near the banks of the West Rapti River. Residents of Hallaur are referred as Hallauri.\nWasa Dargah is a village in the eastern part of Uttar Paradesh. Situated from Domariaganj.\n\n\"the Y chromosomes of self-identified Syeds from India and Pakistan are no less diverse than those non-Syeds from the same regions.\" The authors of the study suggested that Syed status, rather than being strictly patrilineal, may have been passed through other routes.\n\nA study of \"Y chromosomes of self-identified Syeds from the Indian subcontinent\" by Elise M. S. Belle, Saima Shah, Tudor Parfitt and Mark G. Thomas showed that \"self-identified Syeds had no less genetic diversity than those non-Syeds from the same regions, suggesting that there is no biological basis to the belief that self-identified Syeds in this part of the world share a recent common ancestry. However, self-identified men belonging to the ‘Islamic honorific lineages’ (Syeds, Hashemites, Quraysh and Ansari) show a greater genetic affinity to Arab populations—despite the geographic distancethan do their neighbouring populations from India and Pakistan.\"\n\nIn Northern India, 29 percent of the Shia Muslim belong to Haplogroup J. There are 18 percent belonging mainly to Haplogroup J2 and another 11 percent belong to Haplogroup J1, which both represent Middle Eastern lineages. But Haplogroup J2 reflects presence from the neolithic period in the subcontinent. J2 occurs among 11 percent of Austro-Asiatic tribals. The frequency of J2 is higher in South Indian castes (19%) than in North Indian castes (11%) or Pakistan (12%). J2 appears at 20 percent among the Yadavas of South India while among the Lodhas of West Bengal it is 32 percent. In the Maldives, 22 percent of the Maldivian population were found to be haplogroup J2 positive. Overall, the presence of J1 and J2 markers in Indian populations is thought to be at least 3000–4000 years old. Proving that they're not from arabs but from within Indian Subcontinent.\n\nMost of the Alawi Sayyids who moved to Southeast Asia were descendants of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, especially of Ba 'Alawi sada, majority descendants of migrants from Hadhramaut. Even though they are alleged descendants of Imam Husain, it is uncommon for the female Sayyids to be called \"Sayyidah\", they are more commonly called \"Sharifah\". Most of them live in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Moro Province in Philippines, and Pattani. Many of the royal families of this region such as the previous royal families of Philippines (Sultanate of Sulu), Singapore (Sultanate of North Borneo), Malaysia (Sultanates of Johor and Malacca) and Indonesia (Sultanates of Siak, Pontianak, Gowa, some Javanese Sultanates) and the existing royal family of Brunei (House of Bolkiah) are also are Sayyids, especially of Ba'Alawi.\n\nSome common surnames of these Sayyids are al-Saqqaf, Shihab (or Shahab), al-Aidaroos, al-Habsyi (or al-Habshi), al-Kaff, al-Aththos, al-Haddad, al-Jufri (or al-Jifri), al-Muhdhar, al-Shaikh Abubakar, al-Qadri, al-Munawwar (see Ba 'Alawi sada for a more complete list).\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for \"the People of the House\" encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of \"teseyyüd\" – falsely claiming noble ancestry – spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors. In 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad.\n\nAccording to Iran's religious leader and the Deobandi creed, which is a creed especially followed by patriarchal Pashtun tribes, the status of being a Sayyid can only be attributed through the patrilineal lineage. According to Shia opinions, children of a Sayyida mother and a non-Sayyid father are referred to as Mirza. The Persian notation \"Mirza\", which is a derivation of the word \"Mirzada\" i.e. Son of a \"Mir\" has various meanings. One of the meanings of \"Mir\" is a Sayyid leader of a Sayyid branch or community, simultaneously being a religious Islamic scholar. Thus, a Sayyid of patrilineal lineage, being the son of a Mir can also be called \"Mirza\". This example substantiates the fact that there are different opinions concerning the transmission of the title \"Sayyid\". Another historical opinion of Ottoman Naqib al Ashrafs expresses that children of maternal prophetical descent are called \"Sharif\".\n\nHowever, in 1632 when an Ottoman court challenged a man wearing a \"sayyid\" green turban, he established that he was a \"sayyid\" on his mother's side, and this was accepted by the court.\nIn patriarchal societies, women usually have to assimilate themselves into their husbands status. However, this does not affect female descendants of the prophet, since it is seen as a sacred blood relation. Thus, the heraldic title can be given to an individual through his or hers mother's line in accordance to Ottoman Naqib al-Ashrafs. Even the Zaynabids, the descendants of Lady Zainab, the daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib can also be titled \"Sayyid\" or \"Sharif\", according to the Egyptian Imam al Suyuti. In Tajikistan matrilineal descendants are also honored. The fact why there is no total consensus indicating Sayyids and abandoning individuals of maternal descent, may be to limit the number, because of financial reasons, such as Khums or governmental support especially for Sayyids.\n"}

It is usually done around 4:00 AM. The meal is eaten before fajr prayer.Also, Fajr Prayer can be prayed after Suhoor. Suhur is matched to iftar as the evening meal, during Ramadan, replacing the traditional three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), although in some places dinner is also consumed after Iftar later during the night. Being the last meal eaten by Muslims before fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, sahur is regarded by Islamic traditions as a benefit of the blessings in that it allows the person fasting to avoid the crankiness or the weakness caused by the fast.\n\nAccording to a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, Anas ibn Malik narrated, \"The Prophet said, 'take suhoor as there is a blessing in it.'\"\n\nThe mesaharati (public waker) is a public waker for sahur and dawn prayer during Ramadan. According to the history books, Bilal Ibn Rabah was the first mesaharati in Islamic history, as he used to roam the streets and roads throughout the night to wake people up.\n\nThe occupation is summed up by Abu Rabah, a mesaharati in his neighbourhood in the old city of Damascus: \"My duty during the holy month of Ramadhan is to wake people up in the old city of Damascus for prayers and Sahur meal.\" According to Abbas Qatish, who is considered Sidon's best mesaharati, the attributes every mesaharati should possess are physical fitness and good health, \"because he is required to walk long distances every day. He should also have a loud voice and good lungs, as well as an ability to read poems. A mesaharati should supplicate God throughout the night to wake the sleepers.\"\n\nThe tradition is practiced in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan and Palestine. However, there has been a gradual disappearance of the mesaharati due to several factors, including: Muslims staying up later; using technology such as alarms clocks to awake for sahur; and louder and larger homes and cities that make the voice of the mesaharati harder to hear.\n\n"}

Hla Baw began his education at 4, and enrolled as a samanera or novitiate at age 9 under U Jagara. He later left for Mingala Makuna Monastery at Amarapura to continue his religious studies.\n\nIn 1920, he was ordained as a bhikkhu (monk) in the tradition of Burmese Buddhism with the dharma name Vimala () which means \"stainless, Undefiled.\" As his monkhood was sponsored by the residents of Mogok, a town well known for rubies and gems, Vimala became known as \"Mogok\". In 1924, Vimala became the chief abbot of Pikara Monastery. He began to give sermons focusing on abhidhamma and teaching vipassana meditation.\nHe attained Nirvana by practicing meditation for four years and became an Arhat. Then, he disseminated his method to the pupils for attaining Nirvana. He focused on the insight learning of the dynamic nature of mind and materials in his teaching. His teaching audio recordings are still available and learnt by Myanmar Buddhists to learn meditation methods.\n\nU Vimala established the Mogok tradition of vipassana meditation, which is independent of the meditation traditions established by his Burmese predecessors, Ledi Sayadaw and Mahasi Sayadaw. U Vimala stressed dependent origination and cittanupassana as part of meditation practice. There are currently over 300 meditation centers in Burma that teach his form of meditation.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1934 and enshrines the Atash Bahram, meaning “Victorious Fire”, dated to 470 AD. It is one of the nine Atash Behrams, the only one of the highest grade fire in Iran where Zoroastrians have practiced their religion since 400 BC; the other eight Atash Behrams are in India. According to Aga Rustam Noshiravan Belivani, of Sharifabad, the Anjuman-i Nasiri (elected Zoroastrian officials)\nopened the Yazd Atash Behram in the 1960s to non-Zoroastrian visitors.\n\nThe temple is located in Yazd, to the west of Shiraz, in the desert province of Yazda, where Zoroastrians have practiced their religion since about 400 BC. It is located on the Ayatullah Kashani Avenue and is away from Yazd Airport.\n\nThe highest grade of fire temples were first constructed in the Sasanian Empire for the reverence of fire, which is the manifestation of Ahura Mazda in the Zoroastrian religion. According to the Zoroastrian religion, this type of fire is consecrated by sixteen different sources, including the fire created by a lightning bolt.\n\nAccording to an inscription plaque fixed on the shrine, the construction of the Yazd Atash Behram temple is dated to 1934. The funds for building it were provided by the Association of the Parsi Zoroastrians of India. Construction was done under the guidance of Jamshid Amanat. The sacred fire of the temple is stated to have been burning since about 470 AD; originally started by the Sassanian Shah when it was in the Pars Karyan fire temple in southern Pars district of Larestan. From there it was transferred to Aqda where it was kept for 700 years. The fire was then moved in 1173 to Nahid-e Pars temple in nearby Ardakan, where it remained for 300 years until it was moved again to the house of a high priest in Yazd, and was finally consecrated in the new temple in 1934. \n\nA bust of Manekji Limji Hataria, who was instrumental in raising funds for building the temple, has been installed in the precincts of the temple. The bust also displays the Zoroastrian divine symbols of the Sun and the Moon.\n\nThe fire temple is built in Achaemenid architecture style in brick masonry to the design prepared by the architects from Bombay. It is similar in design to the Atash Behram temples in India. The building is surrounded by a garden which has fruit trees. There is a winged deity of the Ahura Mazda embedded on the front door of the temple. \n\nThe sacred fire is installed in the temple behind an amber tinted glass enclosure. Only Zoroastrians are allowed to go to the sanctum area of the fire. Non-Zoroastrians can only view it from outside the glass chamber. The Anjuman-i Nasiri \nopened the Yazd Atash Behram in the 1960s to non-Zoroastrian visitors.\n\n"}

As such, he was one of the main conduits of Luzzatto's teachings from Padua to Eastern Europe.\n\nGordon came to Italy in order to study medicine at the University of Padua. It is there that he met Luzzatto, under whom he learned Torah and Kabbalah. He considered leaving his medical studies in order to dedicate himself to the study of Kabbalah; however, Luzzatto urged him not to; he insisted that his \"maggid\" or mystical teacher wished for Gordon to be successful in both areas.\n\nGordon was thus unwittingly the initial source of publicity of Luzzatto's \"maggid\": he wrote an account to his teacher in Vilna, thus initiating much of the controversy that surrounded Luzzatto. While he was greatly pained by this matter, the \"maggid\" insisted that these developments were heaven-sent.\n\nGordon was one of the transcribers of Luzzatto's writings. Following Luzzatto's death and the dissolution of his followers, Gordon returned to Poland, where he established a group of his own which separated itself from the general community and adopted its own dress.\n"}

Akash is one of the six \"dravyas\" (substances) and it accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (\"jīva\"), non-sentient substance or matter (\"pudgala\"), principle of motion (\"dharma\"), the principle of rest (\"adharma\") and time (\"kāla\")\n\nAkasha provides the space for other substances. Akasha does not act as an obstruction. There are two types of Ākāśa: Lokakasha and Alokakasha. Alokakasha is beyond the Lokakasha and is empty; it has no other substance. \n\nĀkāśa is a compound word of Sanskrit language, wherein \"ā\" refers to \"towards\" and \"kāśa\" refers \"to be visible or to appear\". Thus, Akasha is the subtle “background” against which everything in the material universe becomes perceptible.\n\nSpace provides room to all other substances of the universe. The characteristic of space is to give room to or accommodate the other substances. The special feature of space is that it is not restricted to the universe like other substances but extends beyond the universe to the non-universe. \n\nIts qualities are as follows:\n\nSky and space both are different. We can see the sky because it is modification of the Pudgala whereas space is invisible.\n\nSpace substance is only one substance and as such it is indivisible (akhand). However, universe (lokakasha) and non-universe (alokakasha) are considered its two divisions.\nSpace is divided into two parts:\nThe dimension of Lokakasha is fourteen \"rajlok\" or \"rajju\", however Alokakasha is infinite.\n\nThat portion of space in which all the substances are found is called the universe (lokakash). There are three types of Lokakasha; a) Urdhwa Lok, where beings of higher qualities than us live (Siddha Lok where liberated souls stay is at the top of Urdhwalok), b) Madhya Lok - where human beings and other creatures live, and c) Adho Lok, where the inmates of hell live (it has seven layers).\n\nAt the summit of the \"lokākāśa\" is the \"Siddhashila\" (abode of the liberated souls).\n\nThe \"dharma\" & \"adharma\" \"dravyas\" are present only in \"Lokakasha\" and that is why \"jiva\" and \"pudgal\" are also there in the \"Lokakasha\" only.\n\nThe (empty) infinite space outside the universe is called the non-universe (alokakash). In the non-universe, space alone exists without the other five substances. Actually in non-universe there is nothing but space.\n\nAlokakash is perceptible only to the omniscient.\n"}
