Alexander Craighead was born in Freetown, Massachusetts in 1715, died March 1766 in Rocky Creek, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. He was the youngest son of Rev. Thomas Craighead and Margaret Holmes. He was the brother to my ancestor, John Craighead. Their mother was Margaret Holmes who was born in Scotland. She came with her husband and four of their five children from County Londonderry to America settling first in Massachusetts. Her brother, William Holmes' son Robert Holmes married Mary Franklin whose brother was Benjamin Franklin, Patriot, Statesmen, Scientist, and Signer of the American Declaration of Independence.

He often preached to his flock to resist threats to their independence, and he held the rights of the common man as sacred as that of kings. He is counted as the spiritual father of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, which was allegedly written nine years after his death.\n\nHe died in 1766, and was buried in the oldest burial ground of Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church, on Craighead Road off North Tryon Street in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n"}

From 1946 to 1951 he taught in Paris, and afterwards in New York. In his teachings and writings he sought to establish the close links between Christian theology and Christian liturgy. At the time of his death, he was the dean of the Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary.\n\nAlexander Schmemann was born in 1921 in Tallinn, Estonia, into a family of Russian émigrés. His grandfather had been a senator and a member of the State Council and his father an officer of the Imperial Life-Guards. When he was a child his family moved to France, where he was educated in Russian schools and at a French lycee before becoming a student at the University of Paris (1940–1945), where he wrote a thesis on theocracy and the Eastern Roman Empire. In 1943 he married Juliana Osorguine (1923–2017), before completing his theological studies in 1945 at the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris (where he studied with the noted Russian theologian, Father Sergei Bulgakov, amongst others).\n\nIn 22 October 1946 Schmemann was ordained to the presbyterate of the Orthodox Church by Vladimir (Tikhonicky). From 1946–51 he taught church history at St. Sergius Institute.\n\nHe was invited to join the faculty of Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, then in New York City, where he taught from 1951 onwards. When the seminary moved to its present campus in Crestwood, New York in 1962, Father Alexander assumed the post of dean, which he would hold until his death. He also served as adjunct professor at Columbia University, New York University, Union Theological Seminary and General Theological Seminary in New York. Much of his focus at St Vladimir's was on liturgical theology, which emphasizes the liturgical tradition of the Church as a major sign and expression of the Christian faith.\n\nFr Schmemann was accorded the title of \"protopresbyter\", the highest honor that can be bestowed on a married Orthodox priest. He held honorary degrees from Butler University, General Theological Seminary, Lafayette College, Iona College, and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology.\n\nHe was an Orthodox observer for the Second Vatican Council of the Catholic Church from 1962 to 1965.\n\nHe was active in the establishment of the Orthodox Church in America and in its being granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970.\n\nHis Russian-language sermons were broadcast into the Soviet Union on \"Radio Liberty\" for 30 years. He gained a broad following of listeners across the Soviet Union, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who became his friend after emigrating to the West.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was the dean of the Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, a position he had held since 1962. Schmemann died of cancer in 1983 in Crestwood, New York.\n\nFr Schmemann published many books and articles. \"For the Life of the World\", a popular volume on Christian faith as reflected in liturgy, has been translated into eleven languages. Originally prepared as study guide for the National Student Christian Federation in 1963, it even had an anonymous version published by the underground samizdat in the Soviet Union. \"The Eucharist\" was finished just before his death. This and several collections of his writings were published posthumously.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Schmemann's work, including entire courses, are taught at theology schools. In 2018 the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute of Eastern Christian Studies at St. Michael's College offered a course \"The Liturgical theology of Alexander Schmemann (1921-1983)\".\n\n\n"}

Following that period of growth, the community established its Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1962. In 2002, Bahá'í sources indicate about 300 Bahá'ís were recorded, including both Iranian Bahá'í refugees and Danish converts. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1200 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in Europe including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911–12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. World traveling Bahá'í journalist Martha Root subsequently visited King Haakon VII of Norway among her many trips. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\n\"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands.\"\n\nFollowing the release of these tablets a few Bahá'ís began moving to Scandinavian countries:\n\nStarting in 1946, following World War II, Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bahá'í community to send pioneers to Europe including Denmark; the pioneers set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by Edna True. Prominent members of the committee included the women Dagmar Dole and Elenoir Holliboaugh who arrived in Denmark in 1947 and who helped establish Denmark's first Bahá'í community wirh the first converts in Denmark – May Vestby and Palle Bischoff. Bischoff later pioneered to Greenland. Many of the early converts were supporters of the Det Radikale Venstre political party as part of a modern liberal outlook. From 1948 to 1952 thirty eight individuals converted to the Bahá'í Faith and none withdrew. In 1949 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in the country was elected in Copenhagen, and in 1950 the Danish community hosted a number of continent-wide European Bahá'í events though still having about 50 Bahá'ís in the community. One of these meetings was a Conference coordinating pioneers to several places in Norway. Some credit the success of the American pioneers in Denmark to the Danes being attracted to their \"cultural style\" – \"emancipated, independent, and idealistic\". In 1957 Denmark, Scandinavia and Finland together formed a regional Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly.\n\nIn 1960, shortly after the death of Shoghi Effendi and the culminating period of the Ten Year Crusade, which was an international Bahá'í teaching plan, Denmark became the home of some Iranian Bahá'ís, increasing the community's population to over 60, and the Danish National Spiritual Assembly was formed in 1962. In the wake of the 1968-9 cultural changes across Europe including youth movements, war and environmental issues protests. most Bahá'í communities experienced sizable growth; from 1971 to 1974 the community nearly doubled. By 1979 the community's progressing organization of assemblies and petitioning, lead to government recognition of the Bahá'í Faith as a legal institution with privileges, including the authority to grant marriages. In 1979 with the Iranian Revolution and its severe persecution of Bahá'ís, which continues past 2007, many thousands of Iranian Bahá'ís fled the country and the portion that came to Denmark almost doubled the community's population again.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.\nThough a small proportion in a nation of over 5 million, yet in 1995 when Denmark hosted the United Nations World Summit for Social Development the Bahá'ís participated in an NGO contribution to the Summit as well as to the NGO-Forum held alongside. Additionally the Bahá'is of Denmark are an object of academic study by University of Copenhagen Professor Margit Warburg and her students.\n\nAs of 2002 there are local estimates there are some 300 Bahá'ís in Denmark, and the community has also spread beyond Copenhagen into the countryside and rural provinces. It has been shown that there is a mix of liberal and conservative world views among the Bahá'ís of the Denmark community from academic study. However, the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1,251 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n\n"}

In an Islamic religious context, this oath is the standard procedure of pledging allegiance to a religious leader. It is known to have been practiced by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his successors (caliphs) after him with those wishing to join the Islamic community. Within the Sufi tradition the term is used to refer to the process of initiation into a Sufi order with the idea of commending oneself to a spiritual master in exchange of the spiritual and moral guidance imparted by him. The Bay'ah is a practice that also forms a notable feature within Ahmadiyya Islam. Following the death of a Caliph, the leader of the Community, a pledge of allegiance is taken by the newly chosen Caliph from members of the Community based upon this prophetic model and the bay'ah is the standard procedure for formally joining the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. \n\nSince 1993, a large Bay'ah is held on an international scale every year during the annual gathering of the Community. The Bay'ah is taken by the caliph at whose hand new converts pledge their allegiance and old members of the Community can reaffirm their pledges. The Bay'ah comprises the \"shahadah\", prayers of repentance and a promise to abide by the Ten Conditions stipulated by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad for joining the Community.\n\nThe concept of \"bay'ah\" is considered very important to Ahmadi Muslims. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, after claiming to be divinely appointed as the renewer of Islam, took the first \"bay'ah\" in 1889 at Ludhiana. After this, many individuals travelled long distances to Qadian to be initiated in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The practice was continued by his successors.\n\nThe tradition was originally started by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and continued by the 4 Caliphs after him.\n\nIn 1993 Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth Ahmadiyya Caliph, internationalised the \"Bay'ah\" through Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International (MTA) by which people from all over the world were now able to partake in this pledge which would be simultaneously translated into 12 different languages. Since then, The international oath of allegiance has taken place every year at the annual gatherings. Ahmad often claimed that this was the historical fulfillment of the Pentecost that was destined to occur at the time of the Second Coming.\n\nSince the first International Bay'ah, some acts have become part of the tradition during the ceremony. Foremost, the caliph wears a green coat of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad at the ceremony. This coat was lent to the fourth caliph for this ceremony by his sister. However, the coat was given to the caliphate at the request of the fifth caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad. \n\nThe members of the community form five or seven lines in front of the caliph at the ceremony to represent the five/seven continents of the world. Officials of the community organisation and other people who have worked for the community or are otherwise selected for this ceremony are present in these lines. The lines proceed to some extent in an orderly manner after which other members are present. Members of the community all over the world join the ceremony live through TV coverage by the community's own satellite channel MTA. The members and those who want to become members place their hands on the back of the person in their front, as is known from the tradition of the early Muslims at the time of Muhammad, and so form chains of physical contact with the caliph. This physical contact is seen necessary only for those present at the ceremony. \n\nThe oath of allegiance or Bay'ah is taken by the caliph in the following way: first he reads a sentence or a part of a sentence from the oath in Arabic and then in Urdu or English, which the members of the community repeat after him. The wording contains the \"shahadah\", prayers of repentance and involves a promise to abide by the Ten Conditions of Bai'at as stipulated by Ghulam Ahmad. Then the same sentence or part of the sentence is repeated by translators in many languages of the world simultaneously and repeated by the members of the community. \n\nAfter having gone through the whole text of the oath of allegiance in this manner, the caliph leads the members in silent prayers. At the end, all members of the congregation, which includes those participating around the world, prostrate themselves as an expression of gratitude towards God. This prostration is not directed in any particular direction and is performed in whichever direction one finds suitable but it is led by the caliph. \n\nThe year by year count of converts worldwide, in accordance with the reports announced by the Caliph at the occasion of the International Bai'at and printed officially by the community are as follows:\n\n"}

The religion tried to reform some of the traditional customs of Bodo society and reform the Bathouism (an animist doctrine) and opposed Christianity and missionaries amongst the marginalised communities of lower plains of holy Brahmaputra river. The Adi Dharma of Brahmo Samaj successfully kept many indigenous marginalised communities out of Christianity during Colonial rule.\n\nThe Bodo indigenous people were followers of the Bathouism which was based on the worship of Bathow. The Bodos ate pork, chicken and brewed and drank the rice beer \"zou\" .\n\nKalicharan Brahma (then Kalicharan Mech) agitated the Brahmo religion to unify and reform Bodo society to meet these challenges. He was initiated into the religious significance of Adi Brahmo \"Parambrahma\" in 1906 and began his program of social and religious reform of Bodo society. Based on the Adi Brahmo Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha, he did away with worship of various deities and animal sacrifices and in its place instituted the burning of \"ahuti\", which was similar to the Hindu \"homa\". He preached against rearing of pigs, fowl birds and brewing of the rice beer. To carry forward his teachings, he established the Bodo Mahasabha.\n\nMany Bodos who followed Brahmo Dharma started using Assamese of Gunabhiram Barua in favor of the Bodo language. In 1911, the title \"Brahma\" was formally accepted as the last name of the follower of this religion.\n\nThe Brahma Dharma did not become the predominant religion of the Bodos, but it has remained as an important Bodo institution. Under the Brahma Dharma, the Bodos found their first national awakening and consolidation. Some of the followers of Brahma Dharma (Joynarayan Basumatari, Satish Chandra Basumatary), incorporated Bathou back into the religion without the associated traditional forms of worship.\n\nDue to Brahma Dharma's insistence on education, most of the intellectual leaders of the Bodo society belong to the class created by the Brahma Dharma.\n\n"}
{"id": "1317753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1317753", "title": "Celtic Wicca", "text": "Celtic Wicca\n\nCeltic Wicca is a modern tradition of Wicca that incorporates some elements of Celtic mythology. It employs the same basic theology, rituals and beliefs as most other forms of Wicca. Celtic Wiccans use the names of Celtic deities, mythological figures, and seasonal festivals within a Wiccan ritual structure and belief system, rather than a traditional or historically Celtic one.\n\nWicca, as established by Englishman Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, was not Celtic in nature but contained some Celtic influences and borrowings from Celtic sources. \"Celtic\" Wicca can be seen as emphasizing and elaborating on the facets of Gardnerian Wicca that practitioners believe to be Celtic, while de-emphasizing some of the more obviously non-Celtic facets (such as the worship of deities from other cultures). Author Jane Raeburn believes that while there is \"a firm distinction between historical Celtic inspiration and modern Wiccan practice\", that the two can be blended to form \"a living path of ethical and spiritual growth\". As Carl McColman has observed, many people find beauty and meaning in this spirituality that blends \"religious witchcraft with Celtic wisdom\".\n\nSeveral different variations of the tradition have existed. For instance, Lady Sheba (Jessie Bell) called her tradition \"American Celtic Wicca\". Gavin Frost and Yvonne Frost of the Church and School of Wicca called their tradition \"Celtic Wicca\" and followers of this tradition identify as Celtic Wiccans. Additionally, numerous Eclectic Wiccan groups and individuals incorporate what they believe to be Celtic features and self-identify as Celtic Wiccans or Celtic Neopagans.\n\nCeltic Wicca can be seen as both a form of Wicca and a branch of Celtic Neopaganism. On the Neopagan continuum from eclectic to reconstructionist, Celtic Wicca is at the eclectic end: as non-historical as most forms of Neo-druidism, and contrasting firmly with Celtic Reconstructionism, which emphasizes cultural focus and historical accuracy.\n\nCeltic Wicca is criticized for a number of reasons. Critics point to the very recent development of the \"tradition\", its modernly syncretic nature, its misappropriation or misrepresentation of authentic Celtic traditions and history, and its difference from all historically attested Celtic beliefs and practices. Authors including Ronald Hutton, Aidan Kelly, John Michael Greer and Gordon Cooper have noted that Celtic Wicca draws on mythology by way of the Romanticist Celtic Revival rather than historical fact. Further, these authors have documented that Gardnerian Wicca was synthesized from elements of many cultures and traditions including Hinduism, English folklore, romanticized misinterpretations of what Gardner believed to be Native American beliefs and ceremonies, and the ritual structures and terminology used by the Freemasons. Greer and Cooper specifically point to Gardner's involvement in the English Woodcraft and Kibbo Kift groups as a strong influence.\n\n\n"}

Games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles. It is the sequel to the 2005 game \"\". Due to its violent content, the game was indexed in Germany by the BPjM in April 2008 and subsequently banned in October 2008.\n\nGreg Grunberg does not reprise his role as Ethan Thomas in \"Condemned 2\". Instead, Ethan is voiced by André Sogliuzzo.\n\n\"Condemned 2: Bloodshot\" is a psychological horror video game from a first-person perspective focused on melee-oriented combat. The game features bare-fisted hand-to-hand combat, combat with melee weapons, and first person shooting. The game also has adventure game elements in the forensic investigation of crime scenes.\n\nUnlike the first game, \"Condemned 2\" allows for hand-to-hand combat with the player's bare fists, with the left and right triggers controlling the player character's left and right fist respectively. Additionally, the player is now able to chain together attack combos, as well as perform various finishing moves executed via quick time events. The game also features context-sensitive \"environmental kills\" (such as shoving an enemy's head into a TV or a spiked wall).\n\nLike the original game, the sequel also features melee weapons and firearms. However, melee weapons now break after several strikes or blocks, forcing the player to be adept at resorting to the new hand-to-hand combat system. As in the original game, firearms are limited to the bullets in the current magazine, as the player is unable to carry additional ammo (although they can reload their current magazine by picking up spare ammo lying on the ground). An additional twist to the firearms combat is Ethan's alcoholism, which causes his aim to become blurry and unsteady unless he regularly drinks alcohol. Firearms combat is more prevalent in \"Condemned 2\" than in the original game, with a few levels focused on firefights with assault rifle-wielding enemies.\n\nThe game also features more in-depth forensic investigation gameplay. Players are able to investigate and catalog different elements of a crime scene, and make statements about the nature of the crime. Correctly guessing the nature of the crime earns the player a better ranking, which can lead to upgrades such as brass knuckles or body armor. Also featured are several \"Bloodshot Fight Club\" maps, which are action-based levels independent of the game's plot.\n\n\"Condemned 2\" contains new powers for Ethan to use. His \"instinct\" powers are all but completely scrapped in this episode, however some useful combat abilities come into play. By building up a combo meter, Ethan can perform powerful \"Chain Combos\" that begin a short sequence requiring well-timed or rapidly placed button presses in order to deal massive damage. Later in the game, Ethan gains the power of the \"Voice\". This power allows him to produce a powerful shockwave from his mouth that can blast open doors, explode enemy heads, and destroy Oro \"headpieces\".\n\n\"Condemned 2\" features multiplayer gameplay. There are nine maps in total depending on the game mode being played. The game supports 8 players online and features four multiplayer modes:\n\n\n\"Condemned 2: Bloodshot\" takes place 11 months after the events of the first \"\". The mysterious phenomenon causing insane violence and mass psychosis amongst Metro City's homeless population has only gotten worse, with massive riots breaking out across the city. Protagonist Ethan Thomas, having resigned from the FBI's Serial Crime Unit after the events of the Serial Killer X investigation, has been caught in a downward spiral and now finds himself homeless, violent, and an alcoholic. He still suffers from paranormal visions, and his alcoholism even manifests as an antagonistic alter-ego that taunts him during his hallucinations.\n\nUnder the orders of Director Farrell, Ethan is recruited back into the SCU to investigate the murder of his one-time mentor Malcolm Vanhorn. He is aided by his old partner Rosa and commanded by the hostile and antagonistic Agent Dorland, SCU's tactical commander. Over the course of Ethan's investigation, he discovers that his nemesis Serial Killer X is still alive, having been nursed back to health by his uncle Malcolm Vanhorn after being shot in the head at the end of the original \"Condemned\". Serial Killer X killed Malcolm Vanhorn, as well as Metro City's Mayor Rachel Mars, and eventually kidnaps Director Farrell.\n\nEthan and Rosa also discover the source of all the city's troubles is a secret organization known as \"the Oro\", the cult hinted at in the first \"Condemned\", whose members use painful metal implants to develop sonic powers that allow them to influence and control the rest of humanity. Rosa theorizes that they are the source of all humanity's crimes, wars, and hatred.\n\nSerial Killer X, having learned about the Oro, now wants to harness their sonic ability, and is currently killing and dissecting Oro members to obtain this ability. The Oro are much more powerful than previously thought; their members include many high-ranking members of society, including Mayor Mars, Director Farrell, and Agent Dorland. The Oro also control the SCU, and Dorland and his tactical teams attempt to kill Ethan when he discovers their secret. Ethan fights back with the help of Rosa and SCU Agent Pierce LeRue, and even Serial Killer X, who saves Ethan from the SCU, calling it \"a future investment\".\n\nMalcolm Vanhorn, who has spent his life battling the Oro, leaves Ethan a videotaped message revealing the final truth; Ethan's parents were Oro members who defected from the organization and were killed for it. Ethan himself is \"the Remedy\", a long-prophesied being possessing \"perfectly evolved\" vocal cords capable of generating the Oro's sonic power without the metal implants the Oro use. Ethan's ability is more powerful than the Oros, capable of destroying flesh and bone. The Remedy is destined to be \"the voice opposing that of the Oro\". As a result, Agent Dorland and the Oro want Ethan dead. Director Farrell, part of a splinter faction of Oro that wants to recruit rather than destroy Ethan, sacrifices his life to unlock Ethan's sonic powers after the two of them are cornered by Agent Dorland.\n\nEthan proceeds to the Peninsula, an artificial landmass where the Oro have a secret base from where they monitor and control the entire city. Using his newfound sonic powers, Ethan defeats the Oro members, destroys the Oro machinery allowing them to control the city, then battles Dorland in a sonic duel within the collapsing Peninsula. Defeated, Dorland informs Ethan that the Oro's motives are \"To create hostility, the unwavering desire to fight. To unknowingly become... our protectors.\" Ethan asks what they are protecting against, receiving no reply. Ethan then concludes that Dorland doesn't know it himself, that he is nothing more than a puppet, and the former commander is flung to his death. Ethan escapes in a helicopter along with Rosa and LeRue, declining LeRue's offer of a drink and falling asleep. Meanwhile, the President of the United States suffers an apparent heart attack after receiving the message \"The Remedy is among us!\", suggesting that the President was a member of the Oro.\nFinally, Serial Killer X is shown receiving Oro metal implants in his mouth, similar in appearance to the Oro Dark Primary, the \"final boss\" Oro member Ethan fought and killed at the end of the first \"Condemned\".\n\n\"Condemned 2: Bloodshot\" received \"favorable\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"Official Xbox Magazine\" praised the areas of atmosphere, graphics and sound for the game, and found it to be improved in almost all aspects over the original. The review did, however, find the ending to be weak and one of its major downsides. The three reviewers in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" praised the Xbox 360 version's atmosphere and improved combat system, but were not satisfied with the \"laggy, unnecessary feel\" of the game's multiplayer component. \"Edge\" said that the same console version had lost the first game's tight storyline in favor of a deranged psychotic bloodbath, in which guns and gore \"occur anywhere and everywhere to ever-decreasing effect\" and had taken precedence over the tension and fear factors which the magazine had enjoyed in the previous title. In a caption the review expressed surprise that \"you can [...] make enemy heads explode by shouting at them\" and noted that they did not expect that \"the ABC Warriors would appear in the game's final act, and that you'd take them down with a sonic crossbow and giant magnet.\"\n\n411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.7 out of 10 and said it was \"a game that encourages you to think outside the box and use some strategy and smarts while challenging you to stay alive in hopes of bringing your city back to sanity.\" \"Wired\" gave the game a score of eight stars out of ten and said that it \"has plenty of creepy moments, but it favors action over atmosphere. To that end it performs very well, and even throws in some juicy plot twists and a cliffhanger ending. But I miss the tension of the original, just the same.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave the Xbox 360 version a B− and called it \"A series of amazing shocks that are never quite worthy of suspension of disbelief.\"\n\nRumors about a sequel have circulated since \"Condemned 2\"s release; however, it had been doubtful that a \"Condemned 3\" would ever occur. One of the Condemned series' previous developers stated in an interview with video game website NeoGAF, \"Sadly it will never happen. \"Condemned 2\" just didn't sell enough copies. It is sad that \"Condemned 2\" got caught up in the 'everything needs multiplayer'. We could have really used the staff on multiplayer to make the single player campaign amazing. There was some good ideas of where to take the game. I've always wanted to do a reboot and just play \"Condemned 2\" off as a bad hangover and have Thomas closer to what he was in [\"Condemned: Criminal Origins\"].\"\n\nMonolith co-founder and former CEO Jace Hall currently holds the rights to the \"Condemned\" series and on January 31, 2015, he expressed his interest on Facebook to find the right indie development team to \"take over the franchise and move it forward.\"\n"}

{"id": "12361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12361", "title": "Gnome", "text": "Gnome\n\nA gnome is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small humanoid that lives underground.\n\nThe word comes from Renaissance Latin \"gnomus\", which first appears in the \"Ex Libro de Nymphis, Sylvanis, Pygmaeis, Salamandris et Gigantibus, etc\" by Paracelsus, published posthumously in Nysa in 1566 (and again in the Johannes Huser edition of 1589–1591 from an autograph by Paracelsus).\n\nThe term may be an original invention of Paracelsus, possibly deriving the term from Latin \"gēnomos\" (itself representing a Greek , literally \"earth-dweller\"). In this case, the omission of the \"ē\" is, as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) calls it, a blunder. Paracelsus uses \"Gnomi\" as a synonym of \"Pygmæi\" and classifies them as earth elementals. He describes them as two spans high, very reluctant to interact with humans, and able to move through solid earth as easily as humans move through air.\nThe chthonic, or earth-dwelling, spirit has precedents in numerous ancient and medieval mythologies, often guarding mines and precious underground treasures, notably in the Germanic dwarfs and the Greek Chalybes, Telchines or Dactyls.\n\nThe English word is attested from the early 18th century. Gnomes are used in Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\". The creatures from this mock-epic are small, celestial creatures which were prudish women in their past-lives, and now spend all of eternity looking out for prudish women (in parallel to the guardian angels in Catholic belief). Other uses of the term \"gnome\" remain obscure until the early 19th century, when it is taken up by authors of Romanticist collections of fairy tales and becomes mostly synonymous with the older word \"goblin\".\n\nPope's stated source, the French satire \"Comte de Gabalis\" (1670), used the term \"gnomide\" to refer to female gnomes (often \"gnomid\" in English translations). The author of this work, Nicolas-Pierre-Henri de Montfaucon de Villars, the abbot of Villars, describes gnomes as such:\n\"The Earth is filled almost to the Center with \"Gnomes\" or \"Pharyes\", a People of small Stature, the Guardians of Treasures, of Mines, and of Precious Stones. They are Ingenious, Friends of Men, and easie to be commandded. They furnish the Children of the \"Sages\" with as much Money, as they have need of; and never ask any other Reward of their Services, than the Glory of being Commanded. The \"Gnomides\" or Wives of these \"Gnomes\" or \"Pharyes\", are Little, but very Handson; and their Habit marvellously Curious.\"\n\nIn 19th century fiction, the chthonic gnome became a sort of antithesis to the more airy or luminous fairy. Nathaniel Hawthorne in \"Twice-Told Tales\" (1837) contrasts the two in \"Small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes\" (cited after OED). Similarly, gnomes are contrasted to elves, as in William Cullen Bryant's \"Little People of the Snow\" (1877), which has \"let us have a tale of elves that ride by night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine\" (cited after OED).\n\nOne of the first movements in Mussorgsky's 1874 work \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", named \"Gnomus\" (Latin for \"The Gnome\"), is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about, his movements constantly changing in speed.\nFranz Hartmann in 1895 satirized materialism in an allegorical tale entitled \"Unter den Gnomen im Untersberg\". The English translation appeared in 1896 as \"Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg\". In this story, the \"Gnomes\" are still clearly subterranean creatures, guarding treasures of gold within the Untersberg mountain.\n\nAs a figure of 19th century fairy tales, the term gnome became largely synonymous with other terms for \"little people\" by the 20th century, such as \"goblin\", \"brownie\", \"kobold\", \"leprechaun\", \"Heinzelmännchen\" and other instances of the \"domestic spirit\" type, losing its strict association with earth or the underground world.\n\n\n\nAfter World War II (with early references, in ironic use, from the late 1930s) the diminutive figurines introduced as lawn ornaments during the 19th century came to be known as garden gnomes. The image of the gnome changed further during the 1960s to 1970s, when the first plastic garden gnomes were manufactured. These gnomes followed the style of the 1937 depiction of the seven dwarves in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" by Disney. This \"Disneyfied\" image of the gnome was built upon by the illustrated children's book classic \"The Secret Book of Gnomes\" (1976), in the original Dutch \"Leven en werken van de Kabouter\". Garden gnomes share a resemblance to the Scandinavian tomte and nisse, and the Swedish term \"tomte\" can be translated as \"gnome\" in English.\n\nSeveral gnome themed entertainment parks exist. Notable ones are:\n\nGarden gnome liberationists such as the Gnome Liberation Front were introduced in France in 1997. They claim that Garden Gnomes deserve the same freedom that any other living creature would have. They are noted to have stolen hundreds of gnomes.\n\nGnome parades are held annually at Atlanta's Inman Park Festival. Numerous one-off gnome parades have been held, including in Savannah, Georgia (April 2012) and Cleveland, Ohio (May 2011).\n\n"}

Indeed, according to Law no. 142/1999, state-recognized religious denominations employees receive salaries from the state budget. Therefore, all Romanian citizens who pay taxes contribute to clergy salaries, regardless of their religious affiliation.\n\nRomania is one of the most religious countries in Europe, with 92% of people saying that they believe in God. Irreligion is much lower in Romania than in most other European countries and is among the lowest in the world. At the 2011 census, only 0.11% of the population declared itself atheist, up from the 2002 census, while 0.10% do not belong to any religion.\nOver 20,700 people in Romania are atheists, according to 2011 census. Thus, the number of Romanians who do not believe in God almost tripled in the previous decade. The highest concentration is in Bucharest–Ilfov area (nearly 8,000 atheists) and generally wealthy areas of the country (Transylvania, Banat), the lowest – in Oltenia (750), Dobruja and poor areas of Wallachia (Teleorman, Călărași, Ialomița). Before the census of October 2011, Secular Humanist Association (ASUR) conducted a campaign through which tried to promote an accurate census, in which people who consider themselves atheists to have confidence in selecting this option. According to ASUR, European Values Survey (1999) and World Values Survey (2005) polls show that the real percentage of those who declare themselves atheists is at least 6–7% of the population, 60–70 times more than the result of census in 2002. In \"The Cambridge Companion to Atheism\" (2006), Phil Zuckerman gives a figure of 4%. A 2014 poll by WIN/Gallup International Association shows that 16% of Romanians are not religious and only 1% are convinced atheists.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers from the Soros Foundation, Romanian atheists are a very young group and with a significantly higher level of education that the national average: 53% of atheists are under 30 years, and 33% of them have completed higher education. The group of atheists/agnostics/persons without religion lives in a proportion of 59% in urban areas – in the capital and other major cities – and are easier to find in Wallachia and harder in Moldavia.\n\nAtheists are more intolerant than most Romanians with regard to almost all social groups on which were questioned: Roma, sectarians, Hungarians, Muslims, Jews, poor. The only exception to this string of intolerance is represented by homosexuals, towards them atheists showing more tolerance than the national average. As ideological positioning, atheists declare themselves, equally, both right-wing and left-wing, most of them (56%) placing at the center of the ideological line. Only eight percent say they prefer leftist economic policies, while right-wing economic policies attract 47% of atheists.\n\n"}

Jediism attracted public attention in 2001 when a number of people recorded their religion as \"Jedi\" on national censuses.\n\nJediism is inspired by certain elements of \"Star Wars\", namely the fictional religion of the Jedi. Early websites dedicated to bringing up a belief system from the \"Star Wars\" films were \"The Jedi Religion and regulations\" and \"Jediism\". These websites cited the Jedi code, consisting of 21 maxims, as the starting point for a \"real Jedi\" belief system. The real-world Jediism movement has no founder or central structure.\n\nAlthough followers of Jediism acknowledge the influence of \"Star Wars\" on their religion, by following the moral and spiritual codes demonstrated by the fictional Jedi, they also insist their path is different from that of the fictional characters and that Jediism does not focus on the myth and fiction found in \"Star Wars\".\nThe Jedi follow the \"16 teachings\" based on the presentation of the fictional Jedi, such as \"Jedi are mindful of the negative emotions which lead to the Dark Side\" and \"Jedi are guardians of peace and justice\". Adherents also follow \"21 maxims\".\n\nJediism received press coverage following a worldwide email campaign in 2001 urging people to write \"Jedi\" as their answer to the religion classification question in their country's census, resulting in the Jedi census phenomenon. The majority of such respondents are assumed to have claimed the faith as a joke.\n\nIn 2007, the Temple of the Jedi Order was registered in Texas. However IRS tax exemption wasn't granted until 2015. \n\nDuring the drafting of the UK Racial and Religious Hatred Act, an amendment was proposed that excluded Jedi Knights from any protection, along with Satanists and believers in animal sacrifice. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn, the proposer explaining that it was \"a bit of a joke\" to illustrate a point that defining religious belief in legislation is difficult.\n\nIn 2007, 23-year-old Daniel Jones founded The Church of Jediism with his brother Barney, believing that the 2001 UK census recognised Jediism as a religion, and that there were \"more Jedi than Scientologists in Britain\". In 2009, Jones was removed from a Tesco supermarket in Bangor, North Wales, for refusing to remove his hood on a religious basis. The owner justified Jones's ejection by saying, \"He hasn't been banned. Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods. Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Luke Skywalker all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the Dark Side and we are only aware of the Emperor as one who never removed his hood.\"\n\nIn 2010, a man who described himself as a \"Star Wars follower\" and \"Jedi Knight\" was thrown out of a Jobcentre in Southend, Essex, for refusing to remove his hood, and later received an apology. The man said that \"The main reason is I want to wear my hood up, and I have got a religion which allows me to do that.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Free Church of Scotland expressed concern that a proposed Marriage and Civil Partnership bill would \"lead to Star Wars Jedi marrying couples\". Patrick Day-Childs of The Church of Jediism, and Rev Michael Kitchen of Temple of the Jedi Order, both defended the right of Jedi to perform marriage ceremonies.\n\nIn December 2016, the Charity Commission for England and Wales rejected an application to grant charitable organization status to The Temple of the Jedi Order, ruling that the group did not \"promote moral or ethical improvement\" for charity law purposes.\n\nIn April 2015, the students of Dokuz Eylül University in Turkey started a petition on Change.org demanding a Jedi temple be built on the campus. The petition was in response to a previous petition which had demanded a mosque on the campus of Istanbul Technical University (İTÜ). The petition demanding the mosque reached 180,000 signatures falling short of its 200,000 target and invoked a response from Mehmet Karaca, the rector of Istanbul Technical University (İTÜ), promising \"a landmark mosque\". Soon after, students from other universities started petitions demanding Jedi and Buddhist temples on their campuses.\n\n\n"}

It was the opening track to his sixteenth studio album \"Tonight\". One of two tracks on the album written solely by Bowie, an edited version of the song was released as a single in May 1985, nine months after the release of lead single \"Blue Jean\" and eight months after the release of the album. \"Loving the Alien\" peaked at No. 19 in the UK Singles Chart. The song explored Bowie's \"intense dislike\" of organized religion. \"Loving the Alien\" inspired the title of Christopher Sandford's 1997 biography of Bowie and the 2018 Bowie box set release, \"Loving The Alien (1983-1988)\".\n\nOne of two tracks on the album written solely by Bowie, as a demo the song was simply called \"1\". The singer said the track \"...came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\" He recorded a demo of the song in Montreux, Switzerland prior to recording the song for the album. Bowie later said that the production on the song undid the power of the lyric, saying he preferred the demo version, and in a separate interview lamented \"You should hear 'Loving the Alien' on demo. It's wonderful on demo. I promise you! (laughs). But on the album, it's ... not as wonderful.\"\n\nA music video was co-directed by Bowie with David Mallet. The original video included a short shot of Bowie with a nosebleed; this original version was only released on the 1987 video single \"Day-In Day-Out\". All subsequent releases of the video have the nosebleed scene edited out. An edited version of the song was released as a single in May 1985, nine months after the release of lead single \"Blue Jean\" and eight months after the release of the album.\nBowie's biographer David Buckley called it \"the only track on the album with the gravitas of much of his earlier work\". Journalist Dylan Jones described it as \"definitely the best song from the \"Tonight\" album\". Yo Zushi of the \"New Statesman\" described the song as a \"seven-minute masterpiece\". While critical of much of Bowie's 1980s output in his appraisal of \"Best of Bowie\" in 2002, BBC reviewer Chris Jones stated: \"Loving the Alien does have a strange distant beauty to it. Like watching a ballet through a telescope.\"\n\n\n\n\nBowie performed the song on his 1987 Glass Spider Tour (released on \"Glass Spider\" (1988)). On the Reality Tour in 2003 and 2004, he again performed this song, but this time a stripped-down version with only Bowie on vocals and Gerry Leonard on guitar. Bowie said that the latter arrangement was perhaps \"the way it should have always been done.\"\n\nThe song \"Loving the Alien\" appears on several Bowie compilation albums, including \"\" (1993), some versions of \"Best of Bowie\" (2002), \"Sound + Vision\" (2003 and 2014 reissues), \"The Platinum Collection\" (2005), \"The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987\" (2007), \"iSelect\" (2008), and \"Nothing Has Changed\" (3-CD version) (2014).

{"id": "51343232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51343232", "title": "Morality in Islam", "text": "Morality in Islam\n\nMorality in Islam is a comprehensive term that serves to include the concept of righteousness, good character, and the body of moral qualities and virtues prescribed in Islamic religious texts. The underlying idea of Islamic morality is that of love: love for God and love for God's creatures. The idea is that mankind will acquire and follow the body of moral qualities in order to seek God's pleasure and to treat the fellow human beings in the best possible manner.\n\nTeaching on morality and moral conduct constitute a basic principle of Islam, and the moral themes form a large part of it. The Quran and the Hadith – the central religious texts of Islam – serve as the primary source for it. Both the Quran and the hadith often speak in emphatic manners to instruct the Muslims to adopt a morally good character. Showing kindness to people, and charity to the poor and the helpless are the most highlighted and most insisted virtues in the Quran. In particular, helping people especially in their needs, forgiving others' offenses, respecting parents and elders, fulfilling promises, being kind to people and to animals, being patient in adversaries, maintaining justice, being honest in nature, controlling anger come as major virtues in Islamic concept of morality.\n\nThe Quran, which Muslims believe to be the verbatim word of God, serves as the primary source of moral teachings in Islam. The Sunnah, which is the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions, also serves as an important source for Islamic moral teachings. Besides these, the works of Islamic scholars and philosophers, and the moral examples set by important Islamic personalities (such as the four rightly guided caliphs) are other sources for Islamic ethical and moral guidance.\n\nIslamic primary sources and later Islamic scholarly works have made detailed discussions and laid down detailed instructions on moral issues. However, some general principles can be found in case of following morality. One typical Islamic teaching on morality is that imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is permissible and just; but forgiving the offender is better. To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence. Another principle is that whatever is good and beneficial for mankind is morally good, and vice versa. According to Islamic sharia, a Muslim is expected to act only in good manners as bad manners earn vices. Muhammad is reported as saying \"It is not possible that you indulge in rebuking and reviling and remain righteous at the same time\".\n\nMuch emphasis has been attached in Islamic tradition on developing strong moral values. Faith is considered incomplete without having sense of morality. In Islamic sharia, a worshiper devoid of morality is seen as someone who has failed to realize the true significance of worshiping. In other words, the prayers which can not keep a person away from wrongdoings are seen worthless. Muhammad is reported as saying that a real poor person is he who will appear on the Day of Judgment with a lot of rewards earned by his prayers, fasting, zakat; but in his life he had also abused someone, had falsely accused someone, had illegally taken another's property, had murdered somebody; so all his virtues will be distributed to the victims, and he will be thrown to hell (). Islamic tradition holds that moral qualities and good actions elevate the status of a man. Since the pursuance of moral qualities are more of a voluntary nature, their observance falls into the category of supererogatory worshipping, and is seen as the key to attaining the nearness of God. Islamic prophet Muhammad said, \"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character\" ().\n\nCharacter primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another. Character can be good or bad. A good character is the one that has good moral qualities. There was a debate among the early Islamic moralists as to whether character could be changed. They recognized the dual aspect of character – innate and acquired – and thus noted that with conscious practice it could be changed to a certain degree.\n\nAs a religion, Islam promotes the idea of good character as is evident from its canonical texts. The Quran describes Muhammad as being 'on exalted quality of character' () and refers to him as 'an excellent example' () which ultimately means that the religious and moral examples, set by Muhammad, are to be followed and cultivated by the Muslims in order to construct a morally good character. Muslim moralists have discussed the ethico-religious importance of having a good character as well as the ways of acquiring it. Imam Birgivi, a 16th century Muslim scholar and moralist, says that 'To cure yourself of a bad feature of character is an obligation'. Continuous practice of moral virtues and a conscious effort to internalize those qualities can lead to the formation of a morally good character. Al-Isfahani says that purification of soul means the control, not the elimination, of desires. According to Birgivi, changing of character depends on such things as 'a person's wish' and 'the strength of one's understanding', and the preservation of a good character requires the avoidance of the company of evil-charactered people who indulge into indecent activities, drunkenness, and meaningless gossip.\nThere are numerous sayings of Muhammad that highlight the importance of good character. Some of them are:\n\nNumerous verses of the Quran and the sayings of Muhammad tell the Muslims to be generous with their wealth and to respond to the calls of the mankind's needs. Muslims believe that spending wealth for others, especially for the needy, and helping people are a fundamental duty for them, and these things earn God's mercy and reward in the afterlife. Similarly, caring for one's kinsmen and neighbors has also been emphasized. The Quran says that the righteous are those people who fulfill their promises, and feed the needy, the orphans and the captive for the love of God (). At another place, it says \"Those who (in charity) spend their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\" (). In a long hadith collected in Sahih Muslim, Jarir narrates that once they were with Muhammad when some poor people came. They were ill-clad with torn dresses and were starving. When Muhammad saw them, the color of his face changed. He asked Bilal to assemble the people and then delivered a speech, and said \"Everyone should give in charity dinar, dirham, cloth, dates, wheat, etc.\" He went on till he urged: \"Give, even if it is a stone of a date.\" After this, a man from Ansar brought a bag so full of materials that it was slipping from his hand. Other people also brought things to be given in charity till there were two big heaps of eatable goods and clothes. At that, the face of Muhammad glowed with joy.\n\nMiserliness is discouraged in Islam, and the hoarding of wealth which is not used to redress the miseries of the needy and the poor is seen to be a cause of punishment in the afterlife. Helping people in time of their needs is seen more important than praying in the mosque.\n\nAs a virtue, forgiveness is much celebrated in Islam, and is regarded as an important Muslim practice, inspired by both the Quran and the Sunnah. The issue of forgiveness can take on two different forms: God's forgiveness for human beings for their sins, and forgiveness among fellow human beings for each other. In the first instance, human beings have been asked to seek God's forgiveness for their sins, and they have been promised God's mercy and forgiveness. In the second instance, human beings have been encouraged to practice the act of forgiveness among themselves. To forgive a person who has done moral offense, and not to be cruel to him is seen as a noble virtue. In Islamic theology, the act of forgiveness is not meant to deny or underplay the moral injury suffered by the victim; rather it involves a positive change in mentality toward the offender. Thus, an act of forgiveness means rising above one's self-interest or narrow-mindedness, and achieving nobler quality of heart.\nThose who practice the act of forgiveness have been promised reward by God. In a frequently quoted hadith, Muhammad is reported as saying: 'the best deeds before God are to pardon a person who has wronged you, to show affection for relatives who have broken ties with you, and to act generously towards a person who has deprived you.'\n\nIn Islamic context, to be tolerant of one another comes both as a teaching and an injunction which is to be cultivated at personal, social, and religious levels. After its introduction in 610 CE, Islam sought to moderate the violent attitudes, prevalent among the people of pre-Islamic Arabia, with the practice of tolerance and other virtues. Islam expects people to practice tolerance in their family and social life. It is the teaching of Islam that when faced with ill-treatment by any unwise person, a sensible person should be less reactive and more tolerant. The misbehavior of others should not provoke him to do the same. During the initial years of Islam, Muslims faced persecutions by the Meccan pagans. During this period, Muhammad was once asked by his companions to invoke God's wrath on the persecutors. Muhammad became displeased with such a request and advised them to be more tolerant. Once a Bedouin became discontented and expressed his dissatisfaction even after receiving gifts from Muhammad. Muhammad understood his nature, showed tolerance to him, and satisfied him with more gifts, thus paving the way for the Bedouin to take lesson from this. In the History of Islam, Abdullah ibn Ubayy was known as the \"leader of the hypocrites\". The activities of the hypocrites were condemned by several verses in the Quran. After Ubayy's death, at his son's request, Muhammad offered his own shirt as Ubayy's shroud. At his son's second request, Muhammad even led his funeral prayer. When Umar objected about this, Muhammad said: \"If I knew that Allah will pardon Ubayy if I pray for his forgiveness more than seventy times, I would even do that.\"\n\nOn social and state levels, the importance of tolerance comes from the fact that it is related to such greater issues as peace and justice which are said to be the desired goal of Islam. Given that diversity is a natural phenomenon in this world, the Quran puts much emphasis on the observance of tolerance in order to maintain peace and security. In , the Quran recognizes the diversity among people: 'O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you.' By mentioning the common origin of mankind, the Quran reminds them of their relating to each other, and urges them to 'rise above' the racial and national divisions. In a nutshell, it is the teaching of Islam that the diversity or difference in social, cultural, political, or religious spheres are to be accepted by members of communities to secure a peaceful co-existence. About religious tolerance, the Quran says: 'Let there be no compulsion in religion' (). No forceful conversion is recognized in Islam. According to Islamic jurists, forced conversion is not possible in Islam because faith basically relates to heart, and not so much to external affairs.\n\nIn Islam, honesty implies maintaining sincerity and truthfulness in all actions, interactions, and transactions, and the issue of honesty touches almost all aspects of human life. Here, honesty serves as a umbrella term having some basic components like speaking truth; fulfilling commitments, whether written or verbal; remaining truthful to one's word; rendering the assigned duty sincerely and as meticulously as possible; imparting everyone's due rights without the person's asking for it; being objective in evaluating any case and giving judgments; avoiding falsehood, deception, and favoritism. Selection and promotion of personnel in an organization based on merit and not on favoritism is also a part of honesty. As Islam is a God-centered religion, honesty demands that it be maintained not only in public but also in private, not only when supervised but also when not supervised. Honesty has particularly been emphasized in business transactions, not only in selling and buying but in issues like pricing and advertising policies. Correct measurement is to be maintained. Again, Muhammad has instructed that the sellers should put the commodities of poorer quality in clear display so that the customers are not deceived. Hiking the price to gain more profit or lowering the price to put the competitors at trouble are considered unethical. Similarly, exaggerated claims and suppression of unfavorable information in advertising are discouraged. Honesty is regarded by Muslim scholars as one of the five essential qualities for any Muslim accountants.\n\nThe Quran and the hadith describe God as being kind and merciful to His creatures, and tell people to be kind likewise. Among the 99 Names of God in Islam, the most common and famous are \"the Compassionate\" (al-raḥmān) and \"the Merciful\" (al-raḥīm). The Quran says, \"Verily, Allah is kind and merciful to the people\" (). Numerous sayings of Muhammad tell the Muslims to be kind and merciful to the creatures of God. In Sahih Bukhari, it is said \"He who is not merciful to others, will not be treated mercifully (by God)\" (). Narrated in Sahih Muslim, Muhammad said, \"Verily, Allah is mild and is fond of mildness, and He gives to the mild what He does not give to the harsh\" (). He also said, \"He who is deprived of kindness is in fact deprived of goodness ().\n\nMuhammad has been described as being kind and compassionate to people and animals. Biographies of Muhammad record incidences showing his kindness and leniency to others. Once, a man came to him and said that he had committed a certain sin. As reparation for his sin, Muhammad asked the man if he could free a slave upon which the man expressed his inability. Muhammad asked him if he could fast for two months upon which the man replied in the negative. Muhammad asked him again if he could feed sixty poor men upon which the man replied that he was even unable to do that. In the meantime, a bag of dates was brought there as gift for Muhammad. Muhammad gave the bag of dates to the man and told him to distribute the dates among the poor as reparation. The man passionately said \"who is poorer than me in Medina?\" Hearing this, Muhammad smiled and told the man to distribute the dates among his own family members.\n\nIslam has prescribed kind treatment not only to humans but also to animals. Prophet Muhammad was probably the first in history to talk about the rights and proper treatment of animals. Kind and humane treatment earn virtue, and can even be a means of salvation. Similarly, cruelty towards animals can lead to punishment by God. Islamic tradition narrates the story of a man who got salvation for showing mercy to a thirsty dog. On one occasion, the man saw a dog which was about to die because of extreme thirst. He realized its plight, went down into a well, brought some water for the dog, and saved its life. God became pleased with him and pardoned all his previous sins (). It also narrates the story of a woman who locked up a cat. She neither fed the cat nor set it free to feed for itself. For her cruelty, she was punished by God. The early rulers in Islamic world used to instruct people in behaving properly to the animals.\n\nFor proper treatment of animals, Islam has specified some guidelines:\n\nThe Quran uses the words \"adl\", \"qist\", \"qast\", \"wasat\", and \"mizan\" in referring to justice, with the word \"adl\" being mostly used and literally meaning to straighten, to balance, to depart from wrong, or to be equal. Its meaning is thus \"a combination of moral and social values denoting fairness, balance, temperance and straightforwardness.\" In Islam, justice is not only a moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances. The Quran at its two hundred places warns people against injustice, and at its one hundred places directs people to establishing justice. The Quran served for the early Muslims, as it serves for the present Muslims, as the primary source for the notion of justice. As his capacity as a prophet, the Quranic notion of justice was explained and translated into practice by Muhammad in dealing with various social issues, thus setting moral and legal examples and standards of justice in society and paving ways for the later Muslim theologians and scholars to \"formulate theories of justice\". The obligation to establish justice comes as a fundamental principle in the Quran, second in importance only to the oneness of God. The Quranic injunction of fairness and fair dealing is equally applicable to all people, irrespective of caste, creed, and color. According to the scholars of the Quran, rendering justice to people is a trust from God entrusted on mankind, and this should be fulfilled with a sense of responsibility, not just as a formality.\n\nIn Islamic sharia, fulfilling a contract is regarded as compulsory, and is one of the three qualities necessary for becoming a true Muslim, as the famous hadith says \"Three are the signs of a hypocrite, even if he observed fast and prayed and asserted that he was a Muslim: when he spoke he told a lie, when he made promise he acted treacherously, and when he was trusted he betrayed\" (). Both the Quran and the hadith have attached importance to respect a contract once it has been made, and whether the other party is a Muslim or non-Muslim. Apart from the ordinary verbal promises, fulfillment of business contracts and repayment of loans come as a special instruction for the Muslims. Business contracts and words are not to be breached in pursuance of more profits. Similarly, admonition has been issued against the non-payment of loans as it is said to ruin the afterlife of a believer.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, fulfillment of promises has some other dimensions. Islamic belief holds that before creating humans in this world, God assembled their souls and asked them if He was not their Lord upon which they replied in the affirmative. Thus, accepting Allah as true God and following His commands in all sphere of life is regarded as the greatest fulfillment of that covenant. Again, in case of Muslim marriage, full payment of Mahr – the amount of money which a bridegroom needs to pay to the bride at the time of their marriage – has been emphasized. Non-payment, partial payment, or manipulation of mahr (jointure) is seen as the disruption of marriage contract. A hadith in Tibrani says \"If a man has married a woman and in his heart he has the intention of not paying that mahr, then he has deceived her. If he dies and he has not paid her right, then on the Day of Judgment he will be presented before Allah as a rapist. And a man who has borrowed money from another man while he did not have the intention of re-paying the debt, then he has deceived him, and consequently he defrauded him. If he dies in this condition, without paying back his debt, then he will meet Allah as a thief.\"\n\n\"Every religion has its characteristic, and the characteristic of Islam is modesty.\" This saying of Muhammad, collected in al-Muwatta, shows the unique position modesty holds in Islam. Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. Here, modesty is seen no less important in speech and behavior than in dressing. Again, modesty has a dual aspect in Islam: modesty is to be maintained in public which is generally related to people, as well as in private which is related to God. Islam expects that a Muslim who believes in God will feel shy in front of God, and this shyness will prevent him from disobeying God, from committing any sinful or immodest act, whether in public or private, because he has awareness of God. Muhammad has said, \"Modesty is part of faith\" (). Thus Islam has linked modesty with faith. Islam also expects that a Muslim will be polite in his behavior with others. Display of anger, indecent behavior, or indecent exposure of body parts are highly discouraged. Modesty is seen as a human trait that distinguishes human beings from other animals. Muhammad has been described as being more bashful than a maiden.\n\nModesty in dressing has particularly been emphasized. According to Islamic Law, known as sharia, Muslims are required to cover their body parts with proper dressing. Sharia has also laid down specific guidelines for men and women regarding their dressing. Covering everything from 'navel to knee' is mandatory for men. In some Muslim societies, women wear the niqab, a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full burqa, a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Following is the most frequently cited verse of the Quran regarding modesty: \"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. God is Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their chests, and not to reveal their adornment\" ().\n\nHumility is defined as being modest and respectful. The prophetic narrations and Muhammad's own examples of simplicity and humbleness inspire the Muslims to practice humility in their life. According to tradition, Muhammad was rare to engage in argument with others. He was rare to laugh in a loud voice; rather, he preferred soft smiling. During the conquest of Mecca, when Muhammad was entering into the city riding on a camel, his head lowered, in gratitude to God, to the extent that it almost touched the back of the camel.\n\nIslam has instructed its followers to maintain decency in speech, and misuse of tongue has been admonished. Excessive or absurd talking, or useless gossiping are generally discouraged. The person who talks too much is seen as having greater chances of making mistakes. Speech that hurts others' feelings or insults people are prohibited. Similarly, calling someone by any name that harms the honor of the person is prohibited. Decent and gentle speech has been encouraged as it is seen both as a virtue and as a means of cultivating goodness among people. Muhammad has preferred maintaining silence than engaging in meaningless talks. Polemics in speech or heated arguments with ignorant people are disapproved of in Islam. In The Quran and the hadith, there are many instructions regarding the decent use of tongue. Some of them are:\n\n\nTrustworthiness, which is connected to fulfilling assigned responsibilities properly, has a wide field of application in Islam and conveys a wide range of meaning. Islam has made every person responsible for returning the trust to their due recipients; and this command applies to both the common people and the ruling men. Misappropriation or breach of trust has been condemned severely. Anas ibn Malik narrates that there was hardly any occasion where Muhammad had delivered a speech but he had not said this \"The person who lacks trustworthiness also lacks faith. And the person who does not keep promises has no religion.\" Muhammad has said, \"Every one of you is a guardian and everyone will be asked about his subjects. Imam is a guardian. He will be asked about his subjects. A man is the guardian of the persons in his household. He is answerable about them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house. She will be asked about her responsibility. The servant is the guardian of the articles of his master. He is answerable about this responsibility of his\" ().\n\nPerforming one's duty sincerely and honestly is a trust. It means that a person will have the intention to properly carry out the duties entrusted to him, and will do it in the best possible manner without indulging in corruption. Receiving undue advantages from office is seen as corruption. The rulers of the state or the government officials who do not care for the welfare of their citizens and thus cause sufferings to them are seen as the worst deceiver and have been warned with the direst consequences in afterlife. Adi bin Umaira narrates that he has heard the Prophet as saying: \"Whomsoever we have given some post and he has concealed a needle or a thing smaller than that, then it will be a misappropriated thing with which he will have to appear on the Day of Judgment\" (). Similarly, trust demands that posts be offered to able and deserving persons: persons who will be able to keep the trust of organizations. To deny the public posts to those whose deserve them most, or to make appointments at public posts through nepotism is seen as misappropriation against God, His messenger, and the people. Those who make such unfair appointments have been warned that their prayers would not be accepted, and hell would be their destination. Sahih Bukhari narrates that a man asked Muhammad when the Doomsday would occur. Muhammad replied \"When deposits in trust would start being lost, then wait for the Doomsday.\" He was asked again, \"What is the meaning of loss of trusts?\" He replied: \"When responsibilities are entrusted to unfit persons, then wait for the Doomsday\" ().\n\nAccording to Islamic theology, the wealth and abilities given to a man is a trust from God which means that they should be used in ways recommended by God, and these should not be abused for illegal activities.\n\nProtecting the confidential information of the meetings and the secret information of others is also a trust provided that these are not related to illegal activities. Disclosing family secrets, especially that of the wife, is seen as the worst type of misappropriation. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim that \"On the Day of Judgment before Allah, the greatest act of misappropriation will be that a man may love his wife and the wife may also be inclined towards her husband and then he may disclose his wife's secrets to others.\"\n\nAfter Muhammad started his preaching in 610 CE, his relationship with his own tribesmen, the Quraysh people, deteriorated gradually. Despite this, the Quraysh people of Mecca used to deposit their valuable things at Muhammad because of his honesty and trustworthiness. When Muhammad was compelled to leave Mecca because of Quraysh opposition, he directed his cousin Ali to return those deposits at their due recipients after his leave.\n\nThe issue of patience is of special interest in Islam. Islamic tradition holds that God has made this world a testing ground for mankind, especially for the believers, and that the sincerity and strength of their faith will be judged through various trials. Patience is one of the moral qualities which Islamic sharia considers necessary for a Muslim in order to keep away from evildoings, and in a broader sense, to protect his faith. This is because Islamic holy scriptures say that believers will be tested with various adversaries in their life, and only those who can prove their faith and can remain grateful to God despite those adversaries will earn His blessings. In Islamic theology, the solution to any crisis in a Muslim's life lies in two things: prayer and patience (Quran ), and Muslims have been asked to seek God's help through these two things.\n\nTruthfulness has been much emphasized in Islam, not only as a virtue, but also as a religious obligation; and falsehood has been admonished severely. Islam demands that its followers lead their life on the basis of truthfulness and fair dealing. Falsehood and dishonesty must be avoided because they mark departure from religion. Telling lie is one of the major sins in Islam. Muhammad was asked whether a Muslim could be a coward. He answered: 'Yes.' He was asked whether a Muslim could be a miser. He answered: 'Yes.' He was again asked: 'Can a Muslim be a liar?' He replied: 'No.' Falsehood is seen as something which is against the general characteristics of human nature: it corrupts the human soul and paves the way for many other evil activities. According to the Quran, truthfulness was a characteristic virtue of the prophets (Quran ; ; ; ; ).\n\nIslam has some other considerations regarding truthfulness:\n\nAnger management comes as an important issue in Islamic tradition as anger is seen to destroy human conscience and to become the cause of many evil and violent activities. Anger is considered one of the characteristic features of pre-Islamic period – a period known as age of ignorance. A hadith in Tirmizi says, \"Adam's sons have been created of different types. … the best people among these are those who get angry late and immediately repent.\" In a famous hadith Narrated Abu Huraira, Muhammad said \"The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger\" (). Controlling anger is seen as a virtue and a sign of righteous person. Muhammad is reported as suggesting several methods to assuage anger for a man when he gets angry: to sit down if he is standing, and/or to lie down if he is sitting; to perform ablution (Islamic way of washing hands and face); to seek refuge from God against the influence of Satan.\n\nIn Islam, sincerity of intention determines the significance of any act, that is to say, the value of any act depends on the motivation behind the act, not on the act itself. Good intention is said to earn reward and God’s pleasure while bad intention God's displeasure. In Islamic theology, this applies not only to general act but also to prayers and worshiping. Thus, any act of worshiping which is done to attain worldly fame, or any act of charity which is given to impress people, is considered invalid and is regarded as a sinful act by Islamic jurisprudence. Only those acts of prayer or charity which are done to seek God's pleasure or to benefit people are granted by God. In Islam, sincerity of intention has some other significances: a) if a person sincerely intends to do any good deed and then becomes unable to materialize it into action due to any reason, he is still said to get reward for it; b) an act of worshiping done to gain worldly fame and not to seek God's pleasure is regarded as lesser shirk; c) the reward for a righteous act increases from ten to thousand times depending on the sincerity of the doer's intention.\n\nThe family and the social tradition in Islamic world has long fostered the idea of respecting the elders of family and society. Elders are generally honored by the young members as part of both Islamic culture and religious duty. It is one of the important Islamic good manners found in Islamic world. Examples of respecting elders include, among others, not walking ahead of the elders, allowing them to talk first in meetings, avoiding argument with them, and not raising voice before them. Prophetic tradition narrates that 'he who does not love the younger and does not respect the elders is not one of us' (Sunan al-Tirmidhi). Anas inb Malik narrates that Muhammad said, 'If a young man honors an elderly on account of his age, Allah appoints someone to honor him in his old age' (Sunan al-Tirmidhi).\n\nIslamic traditions generally do not separate the older into old homes, rather accommodate them into their own houses. They are also respected as the guardian of the house. Among the elderly members of a family, the parents occupy a special position in case of receiving veneration by their children. With regard to the rights of parents, the Quranic injunction is to behave well with then, to take care of them especially in their old age, not to be rude to them, and to show highest respect to them.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29435245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29435245", "title": "Muhammad and the Bible", "text": "Muhammad and the Bible\n\nArguments that prophecies of Muhammad in the Bible presaged his birth, teachings, and death have formed part of Muslim tradition from the early history of Muhammad's \"Ummah\" (, Community), although Christians like John of Damascus, Martin Luther and John Calvin have interpreted Muhammad as being the Antichrist. However, many other Christian figures have taken alternate approaches.\n\nMuslim writers have expanded on these viewpoints and have argued that they can specifically identify references to Muhammad in the text of the Bible, both in the Jewish Tanakh and in the Christian New Testament. Several verses in the Quran, as well as several Hadiths, state that Muhammad is described in the Bible. On the other hand, scholars have generally interpreted these verses as referring to the community of Israel or Yahweh's personal soteriological actions regarding the Israelite's or members of the faithful community. The apocryphal Gospel of Barnabas, which explicitly mentions Muhammad, has also been identified as an ancient prediction about the Prophet, but this book is widely recognized by scholars as a fabrication from the Early Modern Age.\n\nDeuteronomy 18:18 has often been considered a prophecy of Muhammad by Muslim scholars. Al-Samawal al-Maghribi, a medieval Jewish mathematician who converted to Islam, pointed to Deuteronomy 18:18 in his book \"Confutation of the Jews\" as a prophecy fulfilled by Muhammad. Samawal argued in his book that since the children of Esau are described in Deuteronomy 2:4-6 and Numbers 20:14 as the brethren of the children of Israel, the children of Ishmael can also be described the same way. Some Muslim writers, like Muhammad Ali and Fethullah Gülen, have interpreted several verses in the Quran as implying that Muhammad was alluded to in Deuteronomy 18:18, including Quran 46:10 and 73:15.\n\nHistorians interpret Deuteronomy 18:18 as referring to a future member of the community of Israel who reenacts the function of Moses, serving as act as a mediator for the covenant between YHWH and the Israelites. Walter Brueggemann writes that \"The primary requirement for the prophet, like\nthe king in 17:15, is that he or she must be a member of Israel, thoroughly situated in the traditions and claims of the Yahwistic covenant.\" The Gospels of Matthew and John both make Jesus out to be the prophet like Moses from Deuteronomy 18.\n\nAl-Samawal al-Maghribi referred to this verse also in his book as a prophecy of Muhammad. He said that Mount Sinai refers to Moses, Mount Seir \"the Mount of Esau\" refers to Jesus, and Mount Paran \"the Mount of Ishmael\" refers to Muhammad. Since, many Muslim scholars have looked to Deuteronomy 33 as containing a prophetic prediction of Muhammad.\n\nDeuteronomy 33:2 is part of the poem known as the Blessing of Moses spanning Deuteronomy 33:1-29. Scholars consider that the poem serves as Yahwistic declaration for the blessing of the future of Israel as a socially unified whole that will benefit and prosper through YHWH's beneficence. The poem relates YHWH's movement from the south from Mount Sinai, the mountain where He resides, to His enterance on the scene as a \"formidable invading force.\"\n\nMuslims interpret this verse as a prophecy of Muhammad, as tradition says that when the Archangel Gabriel commanded Muhammad to read something, he replied \"I am not learned.\" Old Testament scholars believe that this passage refers to members of the Judahite community intentionally ignoring God's warnings of judgment.\n\nMuslim tradition holds that Isaiah 42 predicted the coming of a servant associated with Qedar, the second son of Ishmael and who went on to live his life in Arabia, and so interpret this passage as a prophecy of Muhammad. According to the Hadiths, Muslims like 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As have believed that Muhammad was the servant of Isaiah 42 during his very lifetime.\n\nIn 1892, Isaiah 42:1-4 was first identified by Bernhard Duhm as one of the Servant songs in the Book of Isaiah, along with Is. 49:1-6; Is. 50:4-7; and Is. 52:13-53:12. The Old Testament identifies the servant of the Servant songs as the Israelite's in Is. 41:8-9; Is. 44:1; Is. 44:21; Is. 45:4; Is. 48:20 and Is. 49:3. John Barton and John Muddiman write that \"The idea of a 'servant' played a small part in the earlier chapters, being used as a designation of the unworthy Eliakim in 22:20 and of the figure of David in 37:35, but it now comes to the fore as a description of major significance, the noun being used more than 20 times in chs. 40-55. Its first usage is obviously important in establishing the sense in which we are to understand it, and here it is clear that the community of Israel/Jacob is so described.\"\n\nAccording to some Muslim interpreters, Haggai's promise for the coming of wealth in the future to be a reference to Muhammad's advent. The wealth, \"himada\" in Hebrew, is closely rooted to the Arabic \"hemed\", which is personalized in the Arabic name Ahmad, an abbreviation of Muhammad. Muslims believe this is further indicated by Haggai's saying that the \"himada\" will go on to bring \"shalom\", something Muslims believe was accomplished by Muhammad.\n\nAccording to scholars, Haggai 2:1-9 is discussing YHWH's eschatological return in the future in order to restore and rebuild the Temple. In verse 6, the passage says that God's return is in \"a little while once more\" (Haggai 2:6), the language being used to accentuate its imminence, while the Hebrew phrase for \"once more\" refers to earlier events, specifically in the context of Haggai 2, alluding to God's initial appearance on Mount Sinai. YHWH's return causes all of creation (\"the heavens and the earth\") and the nations (v. 7) to shake, and the nations respond in submission by bringing all their wealth to YHWH's house, the temple.\n\nMany Muslim scholars have argued that the Greek words \"paraklytos\" (comforter) and \"periklutos\" (famous/illustrious) were used interchangeably, and therefore, these verses constitute Jesus prophesying the coming of Muhammad. However, there is not one Greek manuscript in existence with this reading, all Greek manuscripts read παράκλητος \"parakletos\".\n\nCritical scholarship recognizes that the Paraclete, or Advocate, is mentioned five times throughout John's Gospel (John 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26-27; 16:7-11; 16:13-17). The Advocate, called the \"Spirit of Truth\" is considered the Holy Spirit; a replacement for Jesus into the world after Jesus leaves, still dependent on Christ (14:6) and sent by the Father at Jesus' demand (14:16, 24). The Spirit is said to permanently remain with the disciples (14:18-21). John's Gospel says that the world cannot receive the Spirit though the Spirit can abide within the disciples (14:17). The Spirit will accuse the world of sin (16:9) and glorify Jesus (16:14), and though it is 'the spirit that gives life', the spirit does not add new revelations to those of Jesus.\n\nSome Muslims including Muhammad Abu Zahra claim that changes were made to the present-day canon of the Christian Bible, by excluding material that represented the authentic message of Jesus, claiming that the authentic tradition is represented in the Gospel of Barnabas, which contains predictions of Muhammad. A later Muslim writer, Ata ur-Rahîm, claimed that \"The Gospel Barnabas was accepted as a Canonical Gospel in the churches of Alexandria up until 325\". The Gospel of Barnabas is generally seen to be a fabrication made during the Renaissance.\n\nEarly Christian writers claimed that Muhammad was predicted in the Bible, as a forthcoming Antichrist, false prophet, or false Messiah. According to Albert Hourani, initial interactions between Christian and Muslim peoples were characterized by hostility on the part of the Europeans because they interpreted Muhammad in a biblical context as being the Antichrist. The earliest known exponent of this view was John of Damascus in the 7th century. In c. 850 CE about 50 Christians were killed in Muslim-ruled Córdoba, Andalusia after a Christian priest named Perfectus said that Muhammad was one of the \"false Christs\" prophesied in Matthew 24:16.42. The monk Eulogius of Córdoba (c. 800-859 AD) justified the views of Perfectus and the other Martyrs of Córdoba, saying that they witnessed \"against the angel of Satan and forerunner of Antichrist...Muhammed, the heresiarch.\" John Calvin argued that \"The name Antichrist does not designate a single individual, but a single kingdom which extends throughout many generations\", saying that both Muhammad and the Catholic popes were \"antichrists\".\n\nThe prophecy of the \"Four kingdoms of Daniel\" in Chapter 7 of the Book of Daniel has also been interpreted by Christians as a prediction of Muhammad. Eulogius argued that Muhammad was the Fourth Beast in the prophesy. Another medieval monk, Alvarus, argued that Muhammad was the \"eleventh king\" that emerged from the Fourth Beast. According to historian John Tolan,\n\nIn Daniel's description of this beast, Alvarus sees the career of the Antichrist Muhammad and his disciples. This eleventh king who arises after the others, \"diverse from the first,\" who subdues three kings, is it not Muhammad, who vanquished the Greeks, the Romans, and the Goths? \"And he shall speak great words against the most High\": did he not deny the divinity of Christ, thus, according to Saint John, showing himself to be an Antichrist? He \"shall wear out the saints of the most High\": is this not a prediction of the persecutions inflicted by the Muslims, in particular of the martyrdoms of Córdoba? He will \"think to change times and laws\": did he not introduce the Muslim calendar and the Koran? \"\n\nSince the seventh century, the Prophet of Islam's name has been the focus of several stereotypes. Greek and Latin sources presented exaggerated and sometimes wrong stereotypes in literature, and the orthographic forms, which varied among them, were shared by two Western cultures: Spain and France. These variants and forms of the Prophet of Islam's name formulated stereotypes that molded the opinion and feelings of the West toward the leader of the new religion. Their references played a principal role in introducing Muhammad and his religion to the West as a false prophet who wrote the Koran, a Saracen prince or deity, the biblical beast, a schismatic from Christianity, a satanic creature, and the Antichrist.\n\nThe \"1910 Catholic Encyclopedia\" holds that \"contradictory opinions have been expressed by scholars in the last three centuries\" about Muhammad’s \"moral character and sincerity\" since \"Many of these opinions are biased either by an extreme hatred of Islam and its founder or by an extreme admiration, coupled with a hatred of Christianity.\"\n\n\n \n \n"}

The conch was named after the Danava.\n\nAs per the Harivamsa, Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, is described as possessing a conch shell called Panchajanya, one of his four attributes together with the mace Kaumodaki, the disc-like weapon Sudarshana Chakra and a lotus flower. The conch was used during the Kurukshetra War. Panchajanya or Shankhasur was an evil sea demon who lived in a colossal conch shell in the deepest depths of the Prabhasa ocean or was a demon in the form of a conch shell. He kidnapped the son of Sandipani, the guru of Shri Krishna, Balarama, Sudama,and Uddhava and imprisoned him in the conch shell. Upon completion of their studies, Krishna, Balarama, and Uddhava persuaded the teacher to ask for the preceptor’s dakshina (fees) of his liking. Sandipani asked for, as his dakshina, the restoration of his child. Krishna became enraged when he heard about the kidnap and plunged into the sea to rescue the son of Sandipani.

{"id": "387981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387981", "title": "President of the Church", "text": "President of the Church\n\nIn the Latter Day Saint movement, the President of the Church is generally considered to be the highest office of the church. It was the office held by Joseph Smith, founder of the movement, and the office assumed by many of Smith's claimed successors, such as Brigham Young, Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Several other titles have been associated with this office, including First Elder of the church, Presiding High Priest, President of the High Priesthood, Trustee-in-Trust for the church, Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and Translator. Joseph Smith was known by all of these titles in his lifetime (although not necessarily with consistency).\n\nSmith died in 1844 without having indisputably established who was to be his successor. Therefore, his death was followed by a succession crisis in which various groups followed leaders with succession claims. Years later, the office of President was reorganized in many of the resulting , the largest of which are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), and The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite). Some smaller denominations, such as the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), reject the office as an unscriptural creation.\n\nThe concept that the Church of Christ would have a single presiding officer arose in late 1831. Initially, after the church's formation on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith referred to himself as merely \"an apostle of Jesus Christ, and elder of the church.\" However, there was one other apostle—Oliver Cowdery—and several other elders of the church, making the formal hierarchy of the church unclear.\n\nIn September 1830, after Hiram Page claimed to have received revelations for the church, a revelation to Smith stated that \"no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.\" This established Smith's exclusive right to lead the church.\n\nIn early June 1831, Smith was ordained to the \"high priesthood\", along with twenty-two other men, including prominent figures in the Latter Day Saint movement such as Hyrum Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and Martin Harris. As \"high priests\", these men were higher in the priesthood hierarchy than the elders of the church. However, it was still unclear whether Smith and Cowdery's calling as apostles gave them superior authority than that of other high priests.\n\nOn November 11, 1831, a revelation to Smith stated that \"it must needs be that one be appointed of the high priesthood to preside over the Priesthood and he shall be called President of the high priesthood of the Church ... and again the duty of the President of the high priesthood is to preside over the whole church.\" Smith was ordained to this position and sustained by the church on January 25, 1832, at a conference in Amherst, Ohio.\n\nIn 1835, the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ\" were revised, changing the phrase \"an ... elder of the church\" to \"the first elder of this Church.\" Thus, subsequent to 1835, Smith was sometimes referred to as the \"First Elder\" of the church. The 1835 revision also added a verse referring to the office of \"president of the high priesthood (or presiding elder)\", which had since been added to the church hierarchy.\n\nThough there has never been a popular movement in the church to have a president removed or punished, he could theoretically be removed from his position or otherwise disciplined by the Common Council of the Church. The only president of the church brought before the Common Council was Joseph Smith, who was tried for charges made against him by Sylvester Smith after the return of Zion's Camp in 1834. The Council determined that Joseph Smith had \"acted in every respect in an honorable and proper manner with all monies and properties entrusted to his charge.\"\n\nThe President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church's leader and the head of the First Presidency, the church's highest governing body. Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be a \"prophet, seer, and revelator\", and refer to him as \"the Prophet\", a title originally given to Joseph Smith. When the name of the president is used by adherents, it is usually prefaced by the title \"President\". Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be God's spokesman to the entire world and the highest priesthood authority on earth, with the exclusive right to receive revelations from God on behalf of the entire church or the entire world. The President of the Church serves as the head of the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes and the head of the Council of the Church. The President of the Church also serves as the ex officio chairman of the Church Boards of Trustees/Education.\n\nIn the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), the president of the church's formal title is the \"Prophet-President\". The Prophet-President is the highest priesthood leader of the church. The position is composed of several roles: (1) \"President of the Church\", (2) \"President of the High Priesthood\" and (3) \"Prophet, Seer, and Revelator\" to the church.\n\nAs \"President of the Church\", the Prophet-President is the church's chief executive and is the leader of the First Presidency, the church's chief executive council. As \"President of the High Priesthood\", the Prophet-President is the church's leading priesthood official. (Since the initiation of the ordination of women in 1985, it is now possible for this position to be filled by a woman, though all Prophet-Presidents to date have been men.) As \"Prophet, Seer, and Revelator\", the Prophet-President is the Community of Christ's spiritual leader and can present revelations to the church to be added to the Doctrine and Covenants—an open canon of scripture, which stands with the Bible and the Book of Mormon as sacred text. In the church, only the Prophet-President is considered to be a prophet, seer, and revelator, and so far, each person to hold this position has presented additional revelations or spiritual writings to the church, which have been added to the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nGenerally, the Prophet-President will name or ordain a successor prior to his death or retirement. The office was traditionally referred to as President of the High Priesthood. Prior to 1995, these successors had been chosen consistent with lineal succession, even though it was not a church rule. Accordingly, the first six Prophet-Presidents following movement founder Joseph Smith were his direct descendants.\n\nIn 1995, Wallace B. Smith broke with the precedent of lineal succession by naming W. Grant McMurray as his successor. In November 2004, McMurray resigned from the office of Prophet-President without naming a successor, citing medical and personal issues. The First Presidency, composed of McMurray's two counselors, continued to function as the church's chief executive council. A Joint Council of church leaders led by the Council of Twelve Apostles announced in March 2005 that Stephen M. Veazey would be Prophet-President designate. Veazey had been serving as president of the Council of Twelve. Delegates elected to a special World Conference of the church approved Veazey and he was ordained as the Prophet–President on June 3, 2005.\n\nThe Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints continues to believe in the lineal succession through the Jewish Laws of Inheritance. As such, the president of the Remnant Church, Frederick Niels Larsen, is a direct descendant (maternal 2nd great-grandson) of Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\nSimilar to other denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement, in The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the \"President of the General Church\" is also a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe tiny Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), headquartered in Independence, Missouri, has a First Presidency with a President and two Counselors. Succession generally goes to the First Counselor at the time of the previous President's death or resignation (no Cutlerite president has ever resigned), subject to approval of the church membership.\n\nIn the earliest years of its existence, the Mormon fundamentalist Short Creek Community regarded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as \"the only true and living church,\" viewing itself merely as a \"body of Priesthood\" set apart to perpetuate plural marriage and other \"crowning ordinances\" of the Gospel, such as the United Order. Hence, they tended to express a degree of admiration for contemporary LDS Church Presidents, while simultaneously insisting that they had compromised on serious matters and did not truly hold the \"keys of the Presidency of the Church,\" which had allegedly been returned to the spirit world at the death of Joseph F. Smith in 1918. Thus, they generally valued Church direction less than direct pronouncements from their own Priesthood Council. This \"Council of Friends\" consisted of seven \"High Priest Apostles\" or \"Presiding High Priests,\" the seniormost of whom was considered \"President of the Priesthood\" or Prophet.\n\nFollowing LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball's 1978 Revelation on Priesthood, extending the right of ordination to black African males in perceived contradiction to the teachings of Brigham Young and other early LDS leaders, the fundamentalists in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, began to regard their parent organization as a \"complete Gentile sectarian church.\" In 1991, Rulon Jeffs, by that time sole surviving member of the Priesthood Council and thus Prophet of the group, incorporated his followers into \"the Corporation of the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\" or FLDS Church, with himself as President. Upon his death in 2002, Jeffs was succeeded by his First Counselor and son, Warren Jeffs. Despite the younger Jeffs' resignation from the Presidency in 2011 following his imprisonment for child sexual assault, and a brief tenure by Wendell Loy Nielsen as President of the Church's corporate assets, most FLDS members continue to regard Jeffs as a prophet.\n\nSome sects in the Latter Day Saint movement do not accept the office of President of the Church as a valid office in the priesthood; these groups often maintain that because Jesus' original church was led by twelve apostles, not by a president or a three-man presidency, the latter-day church should be similarly organized. For instance, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) is governed by a Quorum of the Twelve; the members of the quorum are generally regarded as co-equal holders of the highest office in the church.\n\n"}

{"id": "42535059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42535059", "title": "Riva Helfond", "text": "Riva Helfond\n\nRiva Helfond (March 8, 1910 - May 13, 2002) was an American artist and printmaker best known for her social realist studies of working people's lives.\n\nRiva Helfond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. She spent some of her childhood in Russia and returned to New York at the age of eleven, living in New York or New Jersey for most of the rest of her life. Between 1928 and 1940, she studied at the School of Industrial Art and the Art Students League; her teachers included William von Schlegell, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Morris Kantor for painting and Harry Sternberg for printmaking. Among her fellow students were Alexander Brook and her future husband, the sculptor William (Bill) Barrett (d. 1967).\n\nHelfond began teaching in the College Art Association Program (1933–36) and then taught printmaking at the Harlem Arts Community Center (1936–38). Initially she taught lithography alongside Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, and others before moving to the graphic arts division, where she worked with Louis Lozowick and Jacob Kainen, and the silkscreen division, which was supervised by Anthony Velonis and which had Harry Gottlieb and Elizabeth Olds as founding members. Among her students at the Center was Robert Blackburn, who would go on to found New York's Printmaking Workshop in the 1940s. Later on, Helfond taught printmaking at New York University (1964), and she was on the faculty of Union College in Cranford, New Jersey, from 1980 onwards.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1941, Helfond was an artist in the New York Works Progress Administration program's graphics division, creating work in a variety of media, including lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, aquatints, collograph, and silkscreens. Some of her work shows the impact that color had as it entered American printmaking during this period, and she was adventurous in exploring the possibilities opened up by screen printing. She printed all of her own work, which ranged from austere, often monochromatic social realist portraits of working people and cityscapes in the 1920s and 1930s to colorful, abstract, lyrical landscapes in later years. Some of her color abstractions originated as watercolors from nature during travels in Greece and France and were then turned into oil paintings.\n\nHelfond was politically progressive, and along with contemporaries like Elizabeth Olds, Beatrice Mandelman, and Minna Citron, she is especially well known for works that \"pointedly condemned the state of labor, and the relationship between big business and big government, in the 1930s.\" Examples of these include \"Custom Made\" (1940), a lithograph showing a woman slumped over her work in a WPA sewing room, and \"Snow Clearing\" (1933), showing men at work shoveling a street.\n\nThere are also a number of prints about the grim lives of coal miners, such as \"Miner and Wife\" (1937), an \"American Gothic\"–style portrait of a couple, with the husband showing a closed fist; \"Out of the Pit\" (1935), a double portrait of miners with blackened faces; and \"Coal Picker\" (1938), showing elderly women scavenging in a coal mine. After Helfond married Bill Barrett, whose Welsh relatives worked in the mines, she used these new connections to bring other artists interested in social justice together with the miners. Helfond ran into several obstacles while working in the coal districts of Pennsylvania. For one thing, she was irked that the gatherings of miners and her male artist friends in the local bars tended to exclude her and other women, making it harder for her to develop the relationships necessary to her work. Another obstacle sprang from cultural differences: Helfond recounted how in the mining town of Lansford, the local women became less friendly when she revealed that she was Jewish. Despite these challenges, Helfond's prints of coal miners are considered an important addition to the body of work documenting the lives of the working poor during the New Deal.\n\nHelfond's work has been exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

{"id": "1027722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1027722", "title": "Shlomo Carlebach (musician)", "text": "Shlomo Carlebach (musician)\n\nShlomo Carlebach (), known as Reb Shlomo to his followers, was a singer, rabbi, and spiritual leader.\n\nKnown as “Rabbi Shlomo” to his followers, Carlebach (14 January 1925 – 20 October 1994), was a Jewish rabbi, religious teacher, composer, and singer who was known as \"The Singing Rabbi\" during his lifetime.\n\nAlthough his roots lay in traditional Orthodox yeshivot, he branched out to create his own style combining Hasidic Judaism, warmth and personal interaction, public concerts, and song-filled synagogue services. At various times he lived in Manhattan, San Francisco, Toronto and a Moshav he founded, Mevo Modi'im, Israel. Carlebach is the subject of Soul Doctor, a musical that debuted on Broadway in 2013.\n\nCarlebach is considered by many to be the foremost Jewish religious songwriter of the 20th century. In a career that spanned 40 years, he composed thousands of melodies and recorded more than 25 albums that continue to have widespread popularity and appeal. His influence also continues to this day in \"Carlebach minyanim\" and Jewish religious gatherings in many cities and remote pristine areas around the globe.\n\nCarlebach was also considered a pioneer of the Baal teshuva movement (\"returnees to Judaism\"), encouraging disenchanted Jewish youth to re-embrace their heritage, using his special style of enlightened teaching, and his melodies, songs, and highly inspiring story telling.\n\nShlomo Carlebach was descended from old rabbinical dynasties in pre-Holocaust Germany. The Carlebach family is a notable Jewish family originally from Germany that now lives all over the world. He was born in 1925 in Berlin, where his father, Rabbi Hartwig Naftali Carlebach (1889–1967), was an Orthodox rabbi. He had a twin brother, Rabbi Eli Chaim Carlebach. His family left Germany in 1931 and lived in Baden bei Wien, Austria and by 1933 in Switzerland.\n\nCarlebach emigrated to Lithuania in 1938 where he studied at a yeshiva. In 1938 his father became the rabbi of Congregation Kehilath Jacob, a small synagogue on West 79th Street in New York City's Upper West Side. Carlebach came to New York in 1939 via Great Britain. He and his twin brother Rabbi Eli Chaim Carlebach took over the rabbinate of the synagogue after their father's death in 1967.\n\nCarlebach studied at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas and Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, and Beth Medrash Gevoha in Lakewood, New Jersey. His aptitude for Torah study was recognized by great Torah scholars and teachers, among them Rabbi Shlomo Heiman, and the Rosh Yeshiva of Bais Medrash Gevoha, Rabbi Aharon Kotler. He was considered one of the top students of Rabbi Kotler. Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner, who gave Carlebach Semikha, considered it a loss to the Torah world that he chose a career in musical Jewish outreach over one as a scholar and teacher. During his yeshiva studies he was often asked to lead the services as a hazzan.\n\nIn 1950, Carlebach set up a small Torah learning group which he called T.S.G.G. (pronounced TASGIG), an acronym for \"Taste And See God Is Good\".\n\nThat year, Carlebach attended a Hebrew language ulpan at the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), where he used to play hasiddic melodies on the piano. One of those impressed with his playing was Sara Schafler-Kelman, who invited Carlebach to sing chasidic tunes at the on Convent Avenue, an offer which he reluctantly accepted. Schafler prepared a poster for the event, entitled \"The Place of Music in the Hassidic Tradition\". This was Carlebach's first invited performance. Years later, Carlebach said to Schafler-Kelman, \"You gave me a title for my life's work.\"\n\nIn 1951, Carlebach began learning English in a special program at Columbia University, having previously conversed mainly in Yiddish. Becoming fluent in English only at the age of 26, he developed an unusual grammar, mixing Yiddish and English, that became his hallmark, and later influenced the language of his followers, as well as many other members of the neo-hassidic movement.\n\nCarlebach became a disciple of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. From 1951-1954, he worked as one of the first emissaries (\"shluchim\") of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe who urged him to use his special skills and go to college campuses to reconnect Jews to Judaism.\n\nIn 1972, he married Elaine Neila Glick, a teacher. They had two daughters, Nedara (Dari) and Neshama. Neshama Carlebach is a songwriter and singer in her own right, basing herself on her father's style and name.\n\nCarlebach began writing songs at the end of the 1950s, primarily based on verses from the Tanakh or the Siddur set to his own music. Although he composed thousands of songs, he could not read musical notes. Many of his soulful renderings of Torah verses became standards in the wider Jewish community, including \"Am Yisrael Chai\" (\"[The] Nation [of] Israel Lives\"—composed on behalf of the plight of Soviet Jewry in the mid-1960s), \"Pitchu Li\" (\"Open [for] Me [the Gates of Righteousness]\") and \"Borchi Nafshi\" (\"[May] My Soul Bless [God]\").\n\nThe \"New York Times\" reported in its obituary of Carlebach that his singing career began in Greenwich Village, where he met Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger and other folk singers who encouraged his career, and helped him get a spot at the Berkeley Folk Festival in 1966. But Carlebach was actually recording well before this and was invited to the festival by one of its organizers after she heard a recording of Carlebach.\n\nAfter his appearance at the Berkeley Folk Festival he decided to remain in the San Francisco Bay Area to reach out to what he called \"lost Jewish souls\"—runaways and drug-addicted youth. His local followers opened a center called the House of Love and Prayer in the Inner Richmond district of San Francisco, to reach out to disaffected youth with song and dance and communal gatherings. He became known as \"The Singing Rabbi\". Through his infectious music and his innate caring many Jews feel that he inspired and reconnected thousands of Jewish youngsters and adults, otherwise lost to Judaism.\n\nSome Carlebach melodies were entered in Israel's annual Hasidic Song Festival.\nIn 1969, his song \"Ve'haer Eneinu\", sung by the Shlosharim won first prize. The Hasidic festivals were a yearly event that helped to popularize his music. He also produced albums with a more liturgical sound. Some of the musicians he worked with during this period added a psychedelic tinge and a wider range of backup instrumentation. Carlebach now spent much of his time in Israel, living in Moshav Me'or Modi'im.\n\nCarlebach's songs were characterized by relatively short melodies and traditional lyrics. His catchy new tunes were easy to learn and became part of the prayer services in many synagogues around the world.\n\nReturning to New York City, Carlebach also became known for his stories and Hasidic teachings. As part of his performances he spoke of inspirational subjects, rooted in Hasidism and Kabbalah. Some of his teachings have been published by his students and appear alongside his recorded songs. Carlebach spread the teachings of Chabad, Breslov, and popularized the writings of, among others, the Rebbe of Ishbitz, Mordechai Yosef Leiner, and Rebbe Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno.\n\nCarlebach became the Rabbi of the Carlebach Shul on West 79th Street. He continued to perform regularly at concerts, and to record various albums of his original melodies.\n\nCarlebach died of a heart attack on a flight to Canada. His body was flown to Israel for burial at Har HaMenuchot. During the funeral the mourners sang Carlebach's songs, including \"Chasdei Hashem Ki Lo Samnu.\" Israel's Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau gave a eulogy. An annual memorial service is held on the 16th of Cheshvan at Carlebach's grave site. Additional memorial events take place throughout Israel and around the world.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Jonathan Rosenblatt, Carlebach \"changed the expectations of the prayer experience from decorous and sombre to uplifting and ecstatic as he captivated generations with elemental melodies and stories of miraculous human saintliness, modesty and unselfishness.\"\n\nDuring his lifetime, Carlebach was often relegated to pariah status, marginalized by many of his peers. Because in his yeshiva years he had excelled in Talmud studies, many had hoped that he would later become a Rosh Yeshiva or a similar figure; many harbored ill will toward his chosen path in music and outreach. In addition, his activities in public were\noften not considered proper according to traditional orthodox teachings. This included encouraging and listening to women singing (not relatives) and touching women affectionately (violating Orthodox standards of shomer negiah).\n\nIn the years since his death, Carlebach's music has been embraced by many faiths as spiritual music. His music can be heard today in synagogues, Carlebach minyanim, churches, gospel choirs and temples worldwide. Many musical groups state that they draw inspiration from Carlebach and his music including Matisyahu, Chaim-Dovid Saracik, Sam Glaser, Moshav Band, Benyamin Steinberg, Reva l'sheva, Naftali Abramson, Gili Houpt, Yehuda Green, Aharon Razel and others. Various community leaders and rabbis were also influenced by him.\n\nA musical written about his life, \"Soul Doctor\", by Daniel Wise was presented as a limited engagement off-Broadway in 2008 and in New Orleans in 2010, and was received with critical acclaim. The musical had a brief off-Broadway run as a guest attraction at New York Theatre Workshop in the Summer of 2012, and earned Eric Anderson a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical nomination for his portrayal of Shlomo Carlebach. \"Soul Doctor\" opened on Broadway August 15, 2013.\n\nA documentary film about Carlebach directed by Boaz Shahak, \"You Never Know\", was released at the Jerusalem Film Festival, also in 2008.\n\nCarlebach's approach towards \"kiruv\" (the popular Hebrew term for Orthodox Judaism outreach) was often tinged with controversy. Put most favorably, \"He operated outside traditional Jewish structures in style and substance, and spoke about God and His love in a way that could make other rabbis uncomfortable.\"\n\nAfter his death, \"Lilith\" magazine, a Jewish feminist publication, catalogued allegations of sexual impropriety against him. Specifically, named accusers are quoted in this article, as well as unnamed sources and Jewish communal leaders with knowledge of the allegations. His followers reject these accusations and claim that it is unfair to accuse him at a time when he could not respond to his accusers. However, accusations had already been made as early as the 1970s. Especially in light of the #metoo movement some have begun to question whether Jewish communities should still use his music. In January 2018 his daughter Neshama wrote an open letter to the women who were harmed by Carlebach. She wrote \"I accept the fullness of who my father was, flaws and all. I am angry with him. And I refuse to see his faults as the totality of who he was.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51017", "title": "Siren (mythology)", "text": "Siren (mythology)\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Sirens (Greek singular: \"Seirēn\"; Greek plural: \"Seirēnes\") were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Roman poets placed them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the \"flowery\" island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.\n\nThe etymology of the name is at present contested. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin. Others connect the name to σειρά (\"seirá\" \"rope, cord\") and εἴρω (\"eírō\" \"to tie, join, fasten\"), resulting in the meaning \"binder, entangler\", i. e. one who binds or entangles through magic song. This could be connected to the famous scene of Odysseus being bound to the mast of his ship, in order to resist their song.\n\nSirens were believed to combine women and birds in various ways. In early Greek art, Sirens were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially harps. The tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia \"Suda\" says that from their chests up, Sirens had the form of sparrows, and below they were women or, alternatively, that they were little birds with women's faces. Birds were chosen because of their beautiful voices. Later Sirens were sometimes depicted as beautiful women, whose bodies, not only their voices, are seductive.\n\nOriginally, Sirens were shown to be male or female, but the male Siren disappeared from art around fifth century BC.\n\nThe first-century Roman historian Pliny the Elder discounted Sirens as pure fable, \"although Dinon, the father of Clearchus, a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in India, and that they charm men by their song, and, having first lulled them to sleep, tear them to pieces.\" In his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci wrote of the Siren, \"The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep; then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners.\"\n\nIn 1917, Franz Kafka wrote in \"The Silence of the Sirens\", \"Now the Sirens have a still more fatal weapon than their song, namely their silence. And though admittedly such a thing never happened, it is still conceivable that someone might possibly have escaped from their singing; but from their silence certainly never.\"\n\nAlthough a Sophocles fragment makes Phorcys their father, when Sirens are named, they are usually as daughters of the river god Achelous, with Terpsichore, Melpomene, Calliope or Sterope. In Euripides' play, \"Helen\" (167), Helen in her anguish calls upon \"Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth (Chthon).\" Although they lured mariners, the Greeks portrayed the Sirens in their \"meadow starred with flowers\" and not as sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys. Sirens are found in many Greek stories, notably in Homer's \"Odyssey\".\n\nTheir number is variously reported as from two to five. In the \"Odyssey\", Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia or Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia; Apollonius followed Hesiod gives their names as Thelxinoe, Molpe, and Aglaophonos; Suidas gives their names as Thelxiepeia, Peisinoe, and Ligeia; Hyginus gives the number of the Sirens as four: Teles, Raidne, Molpe, and Thelxiope; Eustathius states that they were two, Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia; an ancient vase painting attests the two names as Himerope and Thelxiepeia. Their individual names are variously rendered in the later sources as Thelxiepeia/Thelxiope/Thelxinoe, Molpe, Himerope, Aglaophonos/Aglaope/Aglaopheme, Pisinoe/Peisinoë/Peisithoe, Parthenope, Ligeia, Leucosia, Raidne, and Teles.\n\nAccording to Ovid (43 BC–17 AD), the Sirens were the companions of young Persephone. They were given wings by Demeter to search for Persephone when she was abducted. However, the \"Fabulae\" of Hyginus (64 BC–17 AD) has Demeter cursing the Sirens for failing to intervene in the abduction of Persephone. According to Hyginus, sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who heard their songs were able to pass by them.\n\nIt is also said that Hera, queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses. The Muses won the competition and then plucked out all of the Sirens' feathers and made crowns out of them. Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called \"Leukai\" (\"the white ones\", modern Souda).\n\nIn the \"Argonautica\" (third century BC), Jason had been warned by Chiron that Orpheus would be necessary in his journey. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew out his lyre and played his music more beautifully than they, drowning out their voices. One of the crew, however, the sharp-eared hero Butes, heard the song and leapt into the sea, but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess Aphrodite.\nOdysseus was curious as to what the Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their beautiful song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.\n\nStatues of Sirens in a funerary context are attested since the classical era, in mainland Greece, as well as Asia Minor and Magna Graecia. The so-called \"Siren of Canosa\" – Canosa di Puglia is a site in Apulia that was part of Magna Graecia – was said to accompany the dead among grave goods in a burial. She appeared to have some psychopomp characteristics, guiding the dead on the after-life journey. The cast terracotta figure bears traces of its original white pigment. The woman bears the feet, wings and tail of a bird. The sculpture is conserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, in Madrid.\n\nThe Sirens were called the Muses of the lower world, classical scholar Walter Copland Perry (1814–1911) observed: \"Their song, though irresistibly sweet, was no less sad than sweet, and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy, the forerunner of death and corruption.\" Their song is continually calling on Persephone. The term \"siren song\" refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that, if heeded, will lead to a bad conclusion. Later writers have implied that the Sirens were cannibals, based on Circe's description of them \"lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones.\" As linguist Jane Ellen Harrison (1850–1928) notes of \"The Ker as siren\": \"It is strange and beautiful that Homer should make the Sirens appeal to the spirit, not to the flesh.\" The siren song is a promise to Odysseus of mantic truths; with a false promise that he will live to tell them, they sing,Once he hears to his heart's content, sails on, a wiser man.<br>We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured<br>on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so—<br>all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!\n\n\"They are mantic creatures like the Sphinx with whom they have much in common, knowing both the past and the future\", Harrison observed. \"Their song takes effect at midday, in a windless calm. The end of that song is death.\" That the sailors' flesh is rotting away, suggests it has not been eaten. It has been suggested that, with their feathers stolen, their divine nature kept them alive, but unable to provide food for their visitors, who starved to death by refusing to leave.\n\nBy the fourth century, when pagan beliefs were overtaken by Christianity, the belief in literal sirens was discouraged. Although Saint Jerome, who produced the Latin Vulgate version of the bible, used the word \"sirens\" to translate Hebrew \"tannīm\" (\"jackals\") in Isaiah 13:22, and also to translate a word for \"owls\" in Jeremiah 50:39, this was explained by Ambrose to be a mere symbol or allegory for worldly temptations, and not an endorsement of the Greek myth.\n\nThe Early Christian euhemerist interpretation of mythologized human beings received a long-lasting boost from Isidore's \"Etymologiae\":\n\nSirens continued to be used as a symbol for the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era; however, in the 17th century, some Jesuit writers began to assert their actual existence, including Cornelius a Lapide, who said of woman, \"her glance is that of the fabled basilisk, her voice a siren's voice—with her voice she enchants, with her beauty she deprives of reason—voice and sight alike deal destruction and death.\" also argued for their existence, and Athanasius Kircher argued that compartments must have been built for them aboard Noah's Ark.\nCharles Burney expounded c. 1789, in \"A General History of Music\": \"The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician, implies a \"songstress.\" Hence it is probable, that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on the coast of Sicily, who by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable.\" John Lemprière in his \"Classical Dictionary\" (1827) wrote, \"Some suppose that the Sirens were a number of lascivious women in Sicily, who prostituted themselves to strangers, and made them forget their pursuits while drowned in unlawful pleasures. The etymology of Bochart, who deduces the name from a Phoenician term denoting a \"songstress,\" favors the explanation given of the fable by Damm. This distinguished critic makes the Sirens to have been excellent singers, and divesting the fables respecting them of all their terrific features, he supposes that by the charms of music and song they detained travellers, and made them altogether forgetful of their native land.\"\n\nThe theme of perilous mythical female creatures seeking to seduce men with their beautiful singing is paralleled in the Danish medieval ballad known as \"Elvehøj\", in which the singers are elves. The ballad is also conserved in a Swedish version. A modern literary appropriation of the myth is to be seen in Clemens Brentano's \"Lore Lay\" ballad, published in his novel \"Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter\" (1801).\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally released on the Eagles' album \"Hotel California\" on December 8, 1976. It was subsequently released as the B-side of \"Life in the Fast Lane\" single on May 3, 1977.\n\nIn a 1978 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Henley said: \"'The Last Resort', on \"Hotel California\", is still one of my favorite songs... That's because I care more about the environment than about writing songs about drugs or love affairs or excesses of any kind. The gist of the song was that when we find something good, we destroy it by our presence — by the very fact that man is the only animal on earth that is capable of destroying his environment. The environment is the reason I got into politics: to try to do something about what I saw as the complete destruction of most of the resources that we have left. We have mortgaged our future for gain and greed.\" \n\nOn an episode of \"In the Studio with Redbeard\" (which devoted an entire episode to the making of \"Hotel California\"), Frey stated: I have to give all the credit for 'The Last Resort' to (Don) Henley. It was the first time that Don, on his own, took it upon himself to write an epic story. We were very much at that time, concerned about the environment and doing anti-nuclear benefit (concerts). It seemed the perfect way to wrap up all of the different topics we had explored on the \"Hotel California\" album. Don found himself as a lyricist with that song, kind of outdid himself...We're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. There's enough crap floating around the planet that we can't even use so it just seems to be our way. It's unfortunate but that is sort of what happens. Frey referred to the song as \"Henley's opus.\" \n\nHenley recalled that he had been reading about \"the raping and pillaging of the West by mining, timber, oil and cattle interests\" at the time he wrote the song. He said that he wanted to expand the song's scope even further, and so he \"tried to go 'Michener' with it,\" but was never totally satisfied with how it came out.\n\nThe band recorded \"The Last Resort\" at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. However, Black Sabbath were also recording \"Technical Ecstasy\" in an adjacent studio and played very loudly. The Eagles had to re-record the song a number of times due to the noise coming through the wall from the next studio.\n\nMusic critic Dave Thompson considers it an update of Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi\" but says that it is \"even more weary and despairing.\" Thompson regards the line \"Some rich men came and raped the land. Nobody caught ‘em\" to be a critique of a free market economy. Critic William Ruhlmann said of it that it \"sketches a broad, pessimistic history of America that borders on nihilism.\" Author James Perone says that it ties \"all the previous songs [from \"Hotel California\"] together in this final reflection of the dark side of California Life.\" He notes, for example, how the song lyrics contrast the beauty of the California desert with ugly suburban houses and ultimately progresses to criticize the concept of manifest destiny, on which American expansion to California was partially based. He regards the key lyric to be the line \"They called it paradise; I don't know why,\" noting the emphasis given to it by the resignation of Henley's voice and by the falling melody. Perone does criticize the use of synthesizer on the song instead of actual string instruments, which he feels sounds artificial. To Eagles' biographer Marc Eliot, \"The Last Resort\" tells \"the story of a nation's self-destruction and physical decay told as metaphor for personal creative burnout.\" In 2016, the editors of \"Rolling Stone\" rated \"The Last Resort\" as the Eagles #27 greatest song.\n\n"}
{"id": "691293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=691293", "title": "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism", "text": "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\n\nThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism () is a book written by Max Weber, a German sociologist, economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in 1930. It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general.\n\nIn the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism. In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses Lutherans (especially Pietists, but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and Moravians (specifically referring to the Herrnhut-based community under Count von Zinzendorf's spiritual lead).\n\nIn 1998, the International Sociological Association listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century. It is the 8th most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.\n\nAlthough not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (\",\" \",\" and \"Ancient Judaism),\" \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" argues that Puritan ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.\n\nReligious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of Benjamin Franklin:\n\nWeber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.\n\nThe Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any \"sacred\" calling (German: \"Ruf\"). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.\n\nTo emphasize the work ethic in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending \"less\" time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.\n\nIt is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft. To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a \"calling\" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a Pietist background.\n\nHe defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and \"esprit\" that favour the rational pursuit of economic gain: \"We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, \"in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]\", strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin.\"\n\nWeber points out that such a spirit is not limited to Western culture if one considers it as the attitude of individuals, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism). He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it. Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes. As he wrote in his essays:\n\nAfter defining the \"spirit of capitalism,\" Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the Reformation. Many others like William Petty, Montesquieu, Henry Thomas Buckle, John Keats have noted the affinity between Protestantism and the development of commercialism.\n\nWeber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.\n\nWeber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the Reformation, though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages. The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a psychological viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or \"religious geniuses\" within Protestantism, such as Martin Luther, were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.\n\nIn the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other \"signs\" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of double predestination, in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.\n\nWorldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a \"vocation\" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the \"Protestant Ethic\", he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the \"unio mystica\" that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate \"Luther, the symbolic exponent of bureaucratic despotism, with the ascetic hostility to Eros — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives.\"\n\nHowever, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in Lutheranism, which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in Calvinistic forms of Christianity. The trend was carried further still in Pietism. The Baptists diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop \"un\"politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.\n\nWhat Weber argued, in simple terms:\n\nThe manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to nascent capitalism.\n\nBy the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of Benjamin Franklin, which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.\n\nIn his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.\n\nWeber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and observation, the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from magic, that \"disenchantment of the world\" that could be seen as a unique characteristic of Western culture.\n\nIn the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun work on \"The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects\". Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into sociology of religion within his later works (the study of Judaism and the religions of and ).\n\nThis book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of rationalization. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the \"spirit\" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's \"Spirit of Capitalism\" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.\n\nThe essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of Karl Marx and his theories. While Marx's historical materialism held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen \"The Protestant Ethic\" as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.\n\nOther scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, \"it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth.\" Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.\n\nTable of contents from the 1958 Scribner's edition, with section titles added by Talcott Parsons:<br>\nPart 1. The Problem\n\nPart 2. The Practical Ethics of the Ascetic Branches of Protestantism.\n\nThe economist and historian Henryk Grossman criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to Marx's extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the enclosure of the commons in England. And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this \"bloody legislation\" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France. For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of idleness and the poorhouses they instituted physically forced people from serfdom into wage-labor. For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism. However, it is possible that the Protestant \"work ethic\" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.\n\nIn a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:\n\nHowever, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his \"main dependent variable\" (Cantoni, 2).\n\nOther recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.\n\nDudley and Blum write:\nH. M. Robertson, in his book \"Aspects of Economic Individualism\", argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to Adam Smith, the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.\n\nLooking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and David Ricardo did not found economic science \"de novo\". In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the Scholastics. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the Labor Theory of Value, which had already been proved incorrect by the School of Salamanca.\n\nIt has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the \"Protestant ethics\" but rather through the promotion of literacy.\n\nBecker and Wossmann at the University of Munich, as well as Andrey Korotayev and Daria Khaltourina at the Russian Academy of Sciences, showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.\n\nIn 1958, American sociologist Gerhard Lenski conducted an empirical inquiry into \"religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life\" in the Detroit, Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". According to Lenski, \"the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory.\" Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, had observed that \"diligence and frugality\" made Methodists wealthy. \"In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations.\"\n\nGerman theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: \"Sociologists of religion like Peter L. Berger and David Martin have interpreted the Protestant revolution in Latin America as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant Pentecostal congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes.\"\n\n\n\n"}
