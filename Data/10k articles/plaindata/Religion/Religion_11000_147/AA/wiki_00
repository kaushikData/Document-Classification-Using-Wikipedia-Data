Until the announcement of the 70th birthday release of his recordings in 2008, Vega was widely thought to have been ten years younger; the 2005 book \"Suicide: No Compromise\" lists 1948 as his birth year and quotes a 1998 interview in which Vega talks about watching Elvis Presley on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (1956) as a \"little kid\". A 1983 \"Los Angeles Times\" article refers to him as a 35-year-old, and several other sources also list 1948 as his birthdate. Two 2009 articles confirmed his 1938 birth date, one in \"Le Monde\" about the Lyon exhibit and one in the magazine \"Rolling Stone\". Vega also long claimed to be Catholic due to his mother's Puerto Rican ancestry. Although themes of Catholicism were important to his lyrics and visual art over the years, in a 2008 interview with \"The Jewish Chronicle\" he admitted he lied about his own religious upbringing to \"fuel the myth\".\n\nIn the mid 1960s, he attended Brooklyn College where he studied both physics and fine art under Ad Reinhardt and Kurt Seligmann and graduated in 1967. In the 1960s, he became involved with the Art Workers' Coalition, a radical artists group that harassed museums and once barricaded the Museum of Modern Art. In 1969, funding from the New York State Council on the Arts made possible the founding of MUSEUM: A Project of Living Artists—an artist-run 24-hour multimedia gallery at 729 Broadway in Manhattan. Calling himself Alan Suicide, he graduated from painting to light sculptures, many of which were constructed of electronic debris. He gained a residency at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo where he continued to exhibit until 1975. Barbara Gladstone continued to show his work well into the 1980s.\n\nSeeing The Stooges perform at the New York State Pavilion in August 1969 was an epiphany for Vega. In 1966, he met and befriended Martin Reverby. Together, the two began experimenting with music and formed the band Suicide along with guitarist Paul Liebgott. The group played twice at MUSEUM before moving on to the OK Harris Gallery. Calling himself \"Nasty Cut\", he used the terms \"Punk Music\" and \"Punk Music Mass\" in flyers to describe their music, which he adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. In 1971 the group dropped Paul Liebgott and added Mari Reverby on drums, though she didn't play in their live performances. With Bermowitz finally settling on Alan Suicide as a working name, they began to play music venues. Suicide went on to perform at the Mercer Arts Center, Max's Kansas City, CBGB and ultimately, achieve international recognition.\n\nIn 1980, Vega released his eponymous first solo record. It defined the frantic rockabilly style that he would use in his solo work for the next several years, with the song \"Jukebox Babe\" becoming a hit single in France. In 1985, he released the more commercially viable \"Just a Million Dreams,\" but was dropped from his record label after its release. The album originally was set to be produced by Ric Ocasek as a follow-up to the critically acclaimed \"Saturn Strip\" (1983), but production switched over to Chris Lord-Alge and Vega ran into several difficulties during the recording sessions. The album eschewed many of Vega's experimental traits in favor of power pop songs and he later lamented, \"They took all my songs and turned them into God knows what.\"\n\nVega teamed up with Martin Rev and Ric Ocasek again in the late eighties to produce and release the third Suicide album, \"A Way of Life\" (1988). Visual artist Stefan Roloff produced a music video for the song \"Dominic Christ\" which was released by Wax Trax! Records and Suicide went overseas to promote the album by performing the song \"Surrender\" in Paris which was aired on French television. Shortly thereafter, Vega met future wife and music partner Elizabeth Lamere while piecing together sound experiments that would evolve into his fifth solo album, \"Deuce Avenue\" (1990). \"Deuce Avenue\" marked his return to minimalist electronic music, similar to his work with Suicide, in which he combined drum machines and effects with free-form prose. Over the next decade he would release several more solo records as well as perform with Suicide.\n\nIn 2002, art dealer Jeffrey Deitch tracked him down after a couple of his young gallery employees \"gushed\" over a Suicide gig at the NYC Knitting Factory. Vega constructed \"Collision Drive\", an exhibition of sculptures combining light with found objects and crucifixes.\n\nVega's tenth solo album, \"Station\", was released on Blast First Records in 2007 and was described by his colleagues as \"his hardest, heaviest album for quite a while, all self-played and produced.\" In 2008, British label Blast First Petite released a limited edition Suicide 6-CD box set and monthly tribute series of 10\" Vinyl EP's, to mark the occasion of Alan Vega's 70th birthday Musicians who contributed to the tribute series included The Horrors, Lydia Lunch, Primal Scream, and Miss Kittin.\n\nIn 2009, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon, France, mounted \"Infinite Mercy\" – a major retrospective exhibit of Vega's art, curated by Mathieu Copeland. This included the screening of two short documentary films: \"Alan Vega\" (2000) by Christian Eudeline, and \"Autour d’Alan Vega (extraits)\" (1998) by Hugues Peyret.\n\nIn 2012, Vega suffered a stroke. That, and problems with his knees, led him to focus on less physically demanding art, such as painting, rather than music. He continued to live in downtown New York City.\n\nIn 2016, Vega made a small return to music by contributing vocals to the song \"Tangerine\" on French pop veteran singer Christophe's album \"Les Vestiges du chaos\".\n\nIn 2017, Alan Vega's final album \"IT\" was released posthumously on July 14 on Fader. The album was produced by Alan Vega, Liz Lamere, Perkin Barnes and Jared Artaud of New York City band The Vacant Lots. The album cover and inner sleeves featured Vega's original artwork. Two posthumous art shows \"Dream Baby Dream\" at Deitch Gallery and \"Keep IT Alive\" at Invisible-Exports exhibited Alan Vega's work in New York City.\n\nOn Vega's religious views, he was raised in the Jewish faith, but declared himself to be Catholic for many years due to his mother's upbringing. When asked about God he stated, \"I distrust the name 'God' but, yes, I do believe in a higher power, God is in all of us,\" he says, before deciding: \"There is an immense power. There has to be.\" He also shared the views of Spinoza, the pantheist philosopher.\n\nVega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016 at the age of 78. His death was announced by musician and radio host Henry Rollins, who shared an official statement from Vega's family on his website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The river is long, flowing through the regional units of Arcadia and Elis. Its source is near the village Dorizas, about halfway between Tripoli and Megalopoli in the highlands of Arcadia. It flows southwest toward Megalopoli, where it has been diverted around open pit lignite mines. At Thoknia it receives its right tributary Elissonas, and continues north towards Karytaina. Below Karytaina the Lousios flows into the Alfeios, and the Alfeios continues northwest, passing north of Andritsaina. Near Tripotamia the rivers Ladon and Erymanthos flow into the Alfeios. The Alfeios then flows west along Olympia and empties into the Ionian Sea south of Pyrgos.\n\nThe ancient highway linking Patras and Kalamata ran along this river for most of the length east of Olympia.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Peneus and Alpheus were two rivers re-routed by Heracles in his fifth labour in order to clean the filth from the Augean Stables in a single day, a task which had been presumed to be impossible. A poem by Roger Caillois, called \"Le fleuve Alphée\" (the Alpheus River), is mainly about this river.\n\nIn the Aeneid, Virgil describes the \"Alpheus\" as flowing under the sea to resurface at Ortygia on Sicily, or \"so runs the tale\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5416118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5416118", "title": "Altar cards", "text": "Altar cards\n\nAltar cards are three cards placed on the altar during the Tridentine Mass. They contain certain prayers that the priest must say during the Mass, and their only purpose is as a memory aid, although they are usually very beautifully decorated.\n\nAltar cards were not used before the sixteenth century, and even today they are not used when a bishop celebrates the Tridentine Mass, because he reads the entire Mass from the Pontifical Canon. When Pope St. Pius V restored the Missal, only the card at the middle of the altar was used, and it was called the \"Tabella Secretarum\". The left card was added first, and then the right one was added for the sake of symmetry.\n\nThe altar card on the left contains the Last Gospel (John 1:1–14), which is said at the very end of the Mass. The card on the right contains the prayer for blessing the wine and water (\"Deus qui humanæ substantiæ\") and the \"Lavabo\" (\"I shall wash\", from the words of Psalm 26[25 in the Septuagint/Vulgate]:6–12).\n\nThe larger, centre card contains the \"Gloria\", the prayer \"Munda cor meum\" recited before reading the Gospel, the \"Credo\", the prayer for offering the Host (\"Suscipe, Sancte Pater\"), the Words of Consecration, and portions of the Canon of the Mass. Usually, the card's centre contains a picture of the Crucifixion.\n\nThe altar cards may only stand on the altar during Mass. The center one stands against the Tabernacle, altar cross or other support, and the left and right ones stand against either the candlesticks or the superstructural steps (each called a \"gradine\") of the altar. \n\nAfter Mass, they must either be removed or placed face downwards under the altar cover. The cards must be removed for the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.\n"}
{"id": "273424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273424", "title": "Anchorite", "text": "Anchorite\n\nAn anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress; adj. anchoritic; from , \"anachōrētḗs\", \"one who has retired from the world\", from the verb , \"anachōréō\", signifying \"to withdraw\", \"to retire\") is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, or Eucharist-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting instead for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop.\n\nThe anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. In the Catholic Church today, it is one of the \"Other Forms of Consecrated Life\" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.\n\nThe anchoritic life became widespread during the early and high Middle Ages. Examples of the dwellings of anchorites and anchoresses survive. A large number of these are in England. They tended to be a simple cell (also called anchorhold), built against one of the walls of the local village church. In Germanic-speaking areas, from at least the 10th century, it was customary for the bishop to say The Office of the Dead as the anchorite entered his cell, to signify the anchorite's death to the world and rebirth to a spiritual life of solitary communion with God and the angels. Sometimes, if the anchorite were walled up inside the cell, the bishop would put his seal upon the wall to stamp it with his authority. Some anchorites, however, freely moved between their cell and the adjoining church.\n\nMost anchoritic strongholds were small, perhaps no more than square, with three windows. Viewing the altar, hearing Mass, and receiving the Eucharist was possible through one small, shuttered window in the common wall facing the sanctuary, called a \"hagioscope\" or \"squint\". Anchorites would also provide spiritual advice and counsel to visitors through this window, as the anchorites gained a reputation for wisdom. Another small window would allow access to those who saw to the anchorite's physical needs, such as food and other necessities. A third window, often facing the street, but covered with translucent cloth, would allow light into the cell.\n\nAnchorites were supposed to remain in their cell in all eventualities. Some were even burned in their cells, which they refused to leave even when pirates or other attackers were looting and burning their towns. They ate frugal meals, spending their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Anchorites' bodily waste was managed by means of a chamber pot.\n\nIn addition to being the physical location wherein the anchorite could embark on the journey towards union with God, the anchorhold also provided a spiritual and geographic focus for people from the wider society who came to ask for advice and spiritual guidance. Although set apart from the community at large by stone walls and specific spiritual precepts, the anchorite also lay at the very centre of that same community. The anchorhold has been called a communal 'womb' from which would emerge an idealized sense of a community's own reborn potential, both as Christians and as human subjects.\n\nAn idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic Rule. The most widely known today is the early 13th century text known as \"Ancrene Wisse\". Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as \"De Institutione Inclusarum\" written in the 12th century, around 1160–62, by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister. It is estimated that the daily set devotions detailed in \"Ancrene Wisse\" would take some four hours, on top of which anchoresses would listen to services in the church, and engage in their own private prayers and devotional reading.\n\nThe earliest recorded anchorites lived in the 3rd century CE. For example, Hilarion (Gaza, 291–Cyprus, 371) was known as the founder of anchoritic life in Palestine.\n\nThe anchoritic life proved especially popular in England. Well-known anchorites include:\n\nThe evidence supports the existence of a total of around 780 anchorites on 600 sites in England between 1100 and 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries ordered by Henry VIII, which brought anchoritism in England to an end. Women were more numerous among the anchorites than men, especially in the 13th century.\n\nEnglish anchorholds can still be seen at Chester-le-Street in County Durham and at Hartlip in Kent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly is known to be first elected by 1958 in Vientiane and eventually Laos' own National Spiritual Assembly is first elected in 1967. The current community is approximately eight thousand adherents and four centers: Vientiane, Vientiane Province, Kaysone Phomvihane, Pakxe and smaller populations in other provinces. While well established and able to function as communities in these cities, Bahá'ís have a harder time in other provinces and cannot print their own religious materials. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated almost 14000 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nBetween 1883 and 1954 Laos was part of French Indochina. `Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion from 1892 to 1921, mentions French Indochina. `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets mentioned taking the Bahá'í Faith to Indochina and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. These tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\n(Tablet 7) \"The moment this divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion..., if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, also to Japan, Asiatic Russia, Korea, French Indochina, Siam, Straits Settlements, India, Ceylon and Afghanistan, most great results will be forthcoming.\"\n\nShoghi Effendi, head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, claims the first Bahá'ís to arrive in Laos and Cambodia probably in 1955 (came by April, 1956, and after Laotian independence in 1954.) This was Dr. Heshmat Ta'eed, the first pioneer to Laos. The first person to join the Bahá'í Faith in Laos was Bui Van-an who was visiting from Vietnam. In August 1956 it is noted Bahá'ís from Laos tried to attend the regional conference in Djakarta, Indonesia but were denied visas. However, in November seventeen Bahá'ís representing Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam met in Saigon, Vietnam for a regional conference. In January 1958 the Bahá'ís of Vientiane celebrated World Religion Day with Buddhist Monks, a Sihk, a Hindu and government officials - and a Miss Banu Hassan is noted as another pioneer in Laos coming from the United States. In February the Bahá'ís in Vientiane hosted a regional conference with Bahá'ís from Vietnam and Thailand attending. In April 1958 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly is known to be first elected. By August 1958 there is mention of a native conversion to the religion - a woman member of a black Thai ethnic minority. In December 1958 Bahá'ís from Laos again attended an event in Saigon. There is also a very brief mention of a Bahá'í center in Vientiane circa 1958 where Thomas Anthony Dooley III, aka Dr. Tom Dooley, picked up his Laotian translator, Ngoan van Hoang. In January 1959 Vientiane Bahá'ís again held the World Religion Day observance. By April 1959 the Bahá'ís had elected a Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly and a registered group of Bahá'ís was living in Sam Neua. In November 1959 the Bahá'ís in Vientiane hosted a winter school with Bahá'ís from Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam attending. The 1960 observance of World Religion Day gathered about 300 attendees, including members of the King's Council, Consular and United Nations officials, and representatives of various sects of six religions who took part and heard a message from the king of Laos, brought to the meeting by a prince. It was also in 1960 that Bahá'ís in Vientiane acquired an authorization confirming through a special decree issued by the Ministry of Finance in Laos for the Bahá'í Community to own in its name a plot of land as an endowment.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1963 the regional National Assembly of South East Asia oversaw the Bahá'í communities of area from Borneo to the Philippines to Thailand with a local spiritual assembly in Vientiane. The first Thai pioneer left on June 1, 1960, for Luang Prabang Laos. By December 1960 the first from the \"Maew\" or Hmong people\nin Laos accept the religion in Luang Prabang where there is also an assembly. It is also known that Jacqueline and Chester Lee, who had become Bahá'ís in Cambodia in 1955, moved to Vietienne 1965 where they lived until they moved to Hong Kong (Chester left in 1967 while Jacqueline left in 1969.) In Oct 1963, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Thailand, with its seat in Bangkok, was given jurisdiction over the Bahá'ís of Laos until 1967 when they elected their own National Spiritual Assembly with the presence of the first Hand of the Cause to visit Laos - Dr. Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir. The members of the first national assembly were: F. Missaghian, Sy Chanh, Boon My, M. Beizayee, F. Antipolo, L. Kham Say, Lau Chou, F. Faridian and C. M. Lee. In October 1967 an intercontinental conference was held in New Delhi with several Hands of the Cause and representatives of National Spiritual Assemblies from India, Ceylon, Arabia, Laos, Thailand, North East Africa, Philippines, Iran, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, South and Central Arabia, Turkey and Pakistan present. About February 1969 Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Qásim Faizi, the second to visit Laos, met with the national assembly. In April 1969 Dr. Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir made a return trip to Laos. At the fourth national convention, April 1970, it announced that the first members of the Puthai, a tribe in the Savannakhet area, as well as Meo in Laos, had joined the religion. By September 1970 the Laotian Bahá'í Publishing Trust had translated four Baha'i English books, pamphlets, and a prayer book into the Lao language and local conferences in Savannakhet and Thakkek were called with Bahá'ís from each region attending. In January 1971 native Laotian Bahá'ís were able to travel to an international Bahá'í conference in Singapore. In February Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga visited Laos and in October Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone visited Laos and traveled to several regions of Laos as well as meeting with the national assembly. In 1972 several trips of Bahá'ís spread word that Maitreya Buddha had returned as Bahá'u'lláh - during which time the population of Bahá'ís greatly expanded. In accord with a government request, land owned by the assembly of Vientiane was converted for growing crops - a team of youth cleared the land, fenced it in, planted and managed the crops. The second youth training institute was late January 1976 and included sessions included workshops on Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies, Bahá'í views on marriage, history of the religion, Feasts and Bahá'í Holy Days, the Bahá'í Nineteen Day Fast among other topics. In May 1978 the national center in Vientiane hosted the first national children's convention.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.\n\nIn 1983 30 teachers of children's classes gathered for a seminar that included topics like the Central Figures of the Bahá'í Faith, Baha'i administration, Bahá'í teachings on loyalty to government and abstention from politics, and a viewing of Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum's trip turned into the movie \"The Green Light Expedition\". In 1983 scores of children regularly attend classes at Bahá'í schools held at the Ban Amon Bahá'í Center at the national center in Vientiane. By February 1984 other projects Bahá'ís undertook include an assembly purchasing two cows and a community garden with profits from sales going to national and local funds.\n\nIn the 1980s, among the many refugees who came to the United States following the Vietnam War, were 200 Hmong Bahá'ís from Laos who settled in Portland, Oregon. The Bahá'í community of Portland set up an after-school tutoring project initially aiming at war-torn Liberia but lacking practical connection turned to serve the Hmong children in the area around 2000-2001 and has since become more organized into a project - the Roses After School Mentoring Project.\n\nIn 1983 there were nineteen delegates for the national convention. In 1988 Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone again toured Laos including giving public talks as well as visiting refugee camps.\n\nHowever the community in Laos has been frustrated. After experiencing quick growth in the early 1970s (see above), in the 1980s the community had reached approximately eight thousand adherents and four centers: two in Vientiane, one in Vientiane Province, in the northwest and one in Kaysone Phomvihane, Savannakhet Province mid-south with smaller numbers of Bahá'ís just north of Savannakhet in Khammouane Province and in the city of Pakxe in the far south and smaller populations in other provinces. The land on which the four Bahá'í centers were located was approved by the Lao government for use by the Bahá'ís. Additionally, the government has given official approval for Bahá'ís to use land where they already have a cemetery. The Bahá'ís were planning to construct new spiritual centers in Savannkhet's Dong Bang Village and in Lat Khouay Village near Vientiane. They have received both village and district level approval to use the land, but were awaiting the official land deeds from the District Land Offices. The Bahá'í spiritual assemblies in Vientiane and Kaysone Phomvihane cities practiced freely, but smaller communities in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces have periodically faced restrictions by local authorities. From 2001 some local officials in Luang Prabang in the north central area acted harshly toward Bahá'ís and Christians. Examples included forced renunciations that sometimes involved forced participation in animist traditions, including the drinking of animal blood. Other officials forced some believers to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes against their will. Efforts by local officials to force Bahá'ís to renounce their faith continued in some areas. In more isolated cases, provincial authorities instructed their officials to monitor and arrest Bahá'ís and other religions. In some cases in 2005 some Bahá'ís were threatened with arrest or expulsion from their villages in some provinces if they did not comply\n\nThe Vientiane Bahá'í assembly previously encountered difficulties establishing its ownership of the Bahá'í center in Vientiane; however, in 2005 authorities granted approval for use of the property by the Bahá'ís. Bahá'í local spiritual assemblies and the national spiritual assembly routinely held Bahá'í Nineteen Day Feasts and celebrated all Bahá'í holy days. The National Spiritual Assembly based in Vientiane met regularly and has sent delegations to the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel. The Government prohibited foreigners from proselytizing, although it permitted foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with religious affiliations to work in the country. Foreigners caught distributing religious materials could be arrested or deported. Decree 92 specifically authorized proselytizing by local citizens, providing the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) (see Constitution of Laos) approves the activity. In practice the authorities interpreted proselytizing as an illegal activity that creates divisiveness in society.\n\nAlthough Decree 92 authorized the printing of non-Buddhist religious texts and allowed religious materials to be imported from abroad, it also required permission for such activities from the LFNC. As early as 2005 there are reports the LFNC did not authorize Bahá'ís to print their own religious materials, although they had been seeking permission to do so for several years. Some believers bring religious materials into the country; however, these persons face possible arrest.\n\nAs of 2009 outreach is underway in Oudomsai, Xiang Khouang, Luang Prabang, and Salavan Provinces.\n\nThere is a 2000 estimate of more than 1,200 members and a 2006 estimate of approximately eight thousand. In 2008 Bahá'ís estimated their population at 8,500 adherents. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13,960 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n"}

Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the “priestist” Old Believers (поповцы (Popovtsy)) and the non-priestist Old Believers (беспоповцы (Bespopovtsy)).\n\nThe Beglopopovtsy movement formed in the late 17th century and included priests, who had \"deserted\" the Russian Orthodox Church (hence, the name \"beglopopovtsy\", meaning \"with deserted priests\"). They settled in the Nizhny Novgorod region beyond the Volga River (along the Kerzhenets and Belbash Rivers), around Starodub, Chernigov (modern \"Chernihiv\", Ukraine), and on the Vetka Island (\"see Vetkovskoye soglasie\"). In the second half of the 18th century, the Beglopopovtsy formed a group at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. \n\nAt the beginning, all priestist Old Believers were beglopopovtsy. They represented the more moderate conservative opposition, who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Nikon. They recognized ordained priests from the new style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonian reforms. In 1846 the priestist Old Believers convinced Amvrosii (Popovich, 1791-1863) deposed Greek Orthodox bishop (who had been removed under Turkish pressure) to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old Believers priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old Believer bishops in Russia reached ten, and they established their own episcopate, the so-called Belokrinitskaya hierarchy. \n\nNot all priestist Old Believers recognized this new established hierarchy, which provoked a schism within the priestist Old Believers. For various reasons many could not accept this so-called Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy. From this time priestist Old Believers became divided into two groups: those who accepted the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and those who did not.

The earliest version of this text was likely composed around the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th.\n\nThe Blood Bowl Sutra describes how Maudgalyāyana, disciple of the Buddha famous for his supernatural or magical powers, descended to hell to save his mother. He finds her in the company of women who are tormented by the hell wardens and are forced to drink their own menstrual blood. They are punished like this because the blood produced by their bodies pollutes the ground and offends the earth gods, or ends up in rivers from which the water to make tea for holy men is drawn.\n\nThe belief that women descend to the underworld shortly after childbirth has been present in Japanese folklore for quite some time. Story 9 of Volume 3 in the Nihon Ryōiki tells of how a woman died in labor and went to hell.\n\nDespite the Ōjōyōshū being one of the most important texts to describe hell, it bears no mention of the Blood Pool Hell. It is possible that the nature of hell as presented in the Blood Bowl Sutra was not introduced to Japanese religious thought until the Muromachi period. \nAt Yama-dera temple, there is a pool called the \"Blood Pond.\" It is said that at one time, the Blood Bowl Sutra was used for dedicatory services to women who had died in childbirth. A similar ceremony was likely held at Gangō-ji.\nUntil relatively recently, ceremonies surrounding the Blood Bowl Sutra were also held at Shōsen-ji temple. Believers would enclose a copy of the Blood Bowl Sutra in women's coffins in order to save them from being condemned to the Blood Pond Hell. A copy of the sutra discovered at Saidai-ji appears to have been used in a similar fashion.\n\n"}

Early in his life, the family moved to a suburban neighborhood in Turin, where there was a Salesian oratory which would have much influence on the formation of the whole Carretto family. The Salesian spirit would also be felt in the professional life that Carretto began at the age of eighteen as an elementary teacher in Gattinara.\n\nHe entered the youth sector of the Catholic Action in Turin at the age of twenty-three by the invitation of its then president Luigi Gedda. After completing his studies, he graduated in Philosophy from Turin. From 1936 to 1952, his envolvement in Catholic Action grew until he became its National Youth President. In 1940, after winning a competition, he was sent to be the Educational Director in Bono, Sardinia. But his envolvement there was short due to conflicts with the Fascist regime and the influence his teachings exerted on young people beyond the bounds of the school. So he was sent to Isili and then back to Piedmont. There he was allowed to resume his work as a teaching director at Condove, in Susa Valley, about 30 kilometers from Turin. With the advent of the Italian Social Republic, he received from Rome the task of reorganizing the structure of the Catholic Action of Northern Italy. From a business point of view, he was removed from the list of teaching directors and kept under surveillance for not having joined the regime.\n\nAt the end of the war in 1945, Caretto and Gedda jointly created the National Association of Catholic Masters in Rome. In 1946 he became the national president of the Italian Youth of Catholic Action (GIAC). In 1948, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the foundation of Catholic Action, he organized a large youth demonstration in Rome which became known as the famous gathering of the three hundred thousand \"Green Basque\". Shortly thereafter he founded the International Office of Catholic Youth, of which he became the vice president. In 1949, with his friend Enrico Dossi, he created a new agency within the GIAC dedicated to young people's tourism. In time it would become the Youth Tourism Center (CTG), of which he was the first national president.\n\nIn 1952 Carretto found himself in disagreement with an important part of the Catholic political world that desired an alliance with the political right. He had to resign from his position as president of GIAC. It was at this time that he decided to join the religious congregation of the Little Brothers of Jesus which had been founded by René Voillaume and inspired by Charles de Foucauld.\n\nOn December 8, 1954 he left for the novitiate of El Abiodh, near Oran, Algeria. For ten years he lived an eremitical life in the Sahara composed of prayer, silence and work, an experience he expressed in \"Letters from the Desert\", as in all the books he would later write. The same experience fed his whole life and his subsequent action. There he rediscovered his old friend Arturo Paoli, who also passed from the leadership of Catholic Action to religious life in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHe returned to Italy in 1965 and settled in Spello, Umbria, where Leonello Radi (a former president of GIAC) managed to have the fraternity of the Little Brothers of the Gospel entrust the former Franciscan convent of San Girolamo, near the cemetery. Brother Carlo was enthusiastic about the new arrangement. Leonello Radi said: \"the main activity of Carlo Carretto was the eight hours of prayer a day, I carried it I do not know how many times with my red beetle, during the trip we talked and, above all, we prayed\". Soon the spirit of initiative of Carretto and the prestige it enjoys opened the community to the reception of those who, believers or not, wished to spend a period of reflection and search for faith lived in prayer, in manual work and in the exchange of experiences. At the convent where the Fraternity was, many country houses scattered on Mount Subasio were added, transformed into hermitages named after various holy figures. For over twenty years, Coretto was the animator of this center flanked by its many collaborators, friends and benefactors, including the Roman engineer Renato Di Tillo who was very important for the activity of the group and a fraternal friend also of Saint Teresa of Calcutta.\n\nDuring these years he continued his activities as a writer. One notable book of that period was the \"Small Family Church\" which provoked controversy in the Catholic world over whether the ideas it expressed align with Christian morality. A man of the word and of the pen, he used these two means very effectively to communicate to others his \"discoveries\" and his experience of faith.\n\nHis books have been translated into many languages creating a group of readers in many countries around the world. Consequently, he was often invited to bring his word to conferences and spiritual meetings. His deep interiority did not isolate him from the world and from his problems but instead pushed him to take an interest in the spirits of \"prophecy\" (i.e. preaching) and service.\n\nDespite his retirement, he has always participated in the events of Italian society. In 1974, during the debate around the referendum on divorce, he joined the group of \"Catholics for the No\", opposed to the repeal of the law on divorce already in force.\n\nHowever, the Italian Catholic Action remained his first love, never forgotten. In 1986, when internal conflicts with the National Presidency of ACI pushed Pope John Paul II to recall the association to a more visible commitment in the world, Carretto wrote a Letter to Peter in which he passionately defends the \"religious choice\" pursued by the ACI of the new Statute and its President Alberto Monticone.\n\nCarlo Carretto died in his hermitage of Saint Jerome in Spello on the night of Tuesday 4 October 1988, the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, of whom he had been a biographer.\n\n\n"}

Llewellyn Henry Gwynne was from July 1915 deputy chaplain-general of the army in France, with the relative rank of major-general. Both had been colonial bishops prior to appointment.\n\nIn the Second World War, the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an (Anglican) chaplain-general, who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. An Assistant Chaplain-General was a Chaplain 1st class (full Colonel) and a senior Chaplain was a Chaplain 2nd class (Lieutenant Colonel).\n\nIn 1948 the first Bishop to the Forces was appointed; the Bishop is a suffragan of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the full title of the Bishop to the Forces is \"The Archbishop of Canterbury's Episcopal Representative to the Armed Forces\". The Bishop to the Forces is not a military chaplain. The current holder of the office is Nigel Stock, Bishop at Lambeth. There is sometimes confusion between the (Anglican) \"Bishop \"to\" the Forces\" and the (Roman Catholic) \"Bishop \"of\" the Forces\": for this reason the latter is normally given his title in full, i.e. \"The Roman Catholic Bishop of the Forces\".\n\nEach of the three armed services has a chief chaplain (ranking as an archdeacon), for the navy the Chaplain of the Fleet, for the army the Chaplain-General, and for the Royal Air Force the Chaplain-in-Chief.\n\nThe Museum of Army Chaplaincy holds archive material and information relating to the history of the Chaplains General to the British Army both past and present.\n\n\"Chaplain General\" is also used as a term outside the Anglican Church, referring to the senior chaplain in a nation's military (sometimes called the \"Chief of Chaplains\", as in the United States military). Some nations, like South Africa, Israel, and Canada, have one Chaplain General or Chief of Chaplains for the military as a whole; others, like the United States, have one for each branch of the armed forces; while others have one for each major religion or faith group represented among its military personnel.\n\n\n"}

After achieving success in the Western TV series \"Rawhide\", he rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone's \"Dollars\" Trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \"Dirty Harry\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.\n\nFor his work in the Western film \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and the sports drama \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy \"Every Which Way But Loose\" (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980), after adjustment for inflation. Other popular films include the Western \"Hang 'Em High\" (1968), the psychological thriller \"Play Misty for Me\" (1971), the crime film \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\" (1974), the Western \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), the prison film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), the action film \"Firefox\" (1982), the suspense thriller \"Tightrope\" (1984), the Western \"Pale Rider\" (1985), the war films \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), and \"Heartbreak Ridge\" (1986), the action thriller \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), the romantic drama \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995), and the drama \"Gran Torino\" (2008).\n\nIn addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama \"Mystic River\" (2003) and the war film \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama \"Changeling\" (2008), and the South African biographical political sports drama \"Invictus\" (2009). The war drama biopic \"American Sniper\" (2014) set box-office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.\n\nEastwood received considerable critical praise in France for several films, including some that were not well received in the United States. Eastwood has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and in 2007 he was awarded the Legion of Honour medal. In 2000, Eastwood was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.\n\nSince 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso Productions, which has produced all but four of his American films. Starting in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, a non-partisan office.\n\nEastwood was born on May 31, 1930, in San Francisco, California, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. (1906–1970) and Ruth (Runner) Wood (1909–2006). Ruth later took the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr. Eastwood was nicknamed \"Samson\" by the hospital nurses because he weighed at birth. He has one younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (born 1934). Eastwood is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry. He is descended from Mayflower passenger William Bradford, and through this line is the 12th generation of his family born in North America.\n\nDuring the 1930s, his family moved often as his father worked at jobs along the West Coast. Contrary to what Eastwood has indicated in media interviews, they did not move at all between 1940 and 1949. Settled in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car.\n\nEastwood attended Piedmont Middle School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores; records indicate he also had to attend summer school. From January 1945 until at least January 1946, he attended Piedmont High School, but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard, and for burying someone in effigy on the school lawn, on top of other school infractions. He transferred to Oakland Technical High School and was scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, although it is not clear if he ever did. \"Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major,\" joked classmate Don Kincaid. Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed \"I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere.\" \"I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school,\" explained Fritz Manes, a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s. Biographer Patrick McGilligan notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.\n\nEastwood held a number of jobs, including as a lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University in 1951 but instead was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. \"He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero. Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military,\" commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, Sondra Locke. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings. While returning from a prearranged tryst in Seattle, Washington, he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam to safety.\n\nAccording to the CBS press release for \"Rawhide\", the Universal (known then as Universal-International) film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature, then 6'4\" (193 cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, \"He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything\". Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.\n\nIn May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for \"Six Bridges to Cross\" but was rejected by Joseph Pevney. After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in \"Revenge of the Creature\" (1955), a sequel to the recently released \"The Creature from the Black Lagoon\". In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's \"Lady Godiva of Coventry\", won a role in February 1955, playing \"Jonesy\", a sailor in \"Francis in the Navy\" and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, \"Tarantula\", where he played a squadron pilot. In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film \"Never Say Goodbye\" and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with \"Law Man\", also known as \"Star in the Dust\". Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on NBC's \"Allen in Movieland\", which starred comedian Steve Allen, actor Tony Curtis and swing musician Benny Goodman. Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.\n\nEastwood played \"Tom\" in (1956) \"Star in the Dust \" with Richard Boone. Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in \"The First Traveling Saleslady\" (1956) and later hired him for \"Escapade in Japan\", without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling. Upon the advice of Irving Leonard, his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's \"Reader's Digest\" series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a \"Highway Patrol\" episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in \"West Point\" series and a suicidal gold prospector on \"Death Valley Days\".\n\nIn 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of \"Navy Log\" and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on \"Maverick\" opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture \"Lafayette Escadrille\" and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in \"Ambush at Cimarron Pass\", a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career.\n\nIn 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series \"Rawhide\", the breakthrough in his career he had long been searching for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Eastwood to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958. It took just three weeks for \"Rawhide\" to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The \"Rawhide\" years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 \"Rawhide\" was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of \"Rawhide\"s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.\n\nIn late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on \"Rawhide\", Eric Fleming, rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called \"A Fistful of Dollars\", to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his \"Rawhide\" image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of the transition from a television western to \"A Fistful of Dollars\": \"In \"Rawhide\" I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an anti-hero.\" Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the \"mask\" he was attempting to create for the loner character.\n\n\"A Fistful of Dollars\" proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to \"For a Few Dollars More\" and the final film of the trilogy (\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\") were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.\n\nIn January 1966, Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named \"Le Streghe\" (\"The Witches\") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress Silvana Mangano. Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that \"no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'.\" Two months later Eastwood began work on the third \"Dollars\" film, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. \"I know about these things,\" he said. \"Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can.\" Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word \"Vaya!\" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.\n\nThe \"Dollars\" trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when \"A Fistful of Dollars\" opened on January 18, followed by \"For a Few Dollars More\" on May 10, and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" on December 29. All the films were commercially successful, particularly \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", which eventually earned $8 million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star. All three films received bad reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect. Judith Crist described \"A Fistful of Dollars\" as \"cheapjack,\" while \"Newsweek\" considered \"For a Few Dollars More\" as \"excruciatingly dopey.\" Renata Adler of \"The New York Times\" said \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was \"...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre.\" \"Time\" magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger. Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.\n\nStardom brought more roles for Eastwood. He signed to star in the American revisionist western \"Hang 'Em High\" (1968), featured alongside Inger Stevens, Pat Hingle, Dennis Hopper, Ed Begley, Alan Hale, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and James MacArthur, playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead. The film earned Eastwood a fee of $400,000 and 25 percent of its net box-office takings. Using money earned from the \"Dollars\" trilogy, accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, Malpaso Productions, named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwood's property in Monterey County, California. As recently as a month prior to the film's release, 38-year-old Eastwood was still a relative unknown; in July 1968, syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners noted \"The proverbial man in the street is still asking, \"Who's Clint Eastwood?\" Leonard arranged for \"Hang 'Em High\" to be a joint production with United Artists; when it opened in August 1968, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. \"Hang 'Em High\" was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the \"New York Post\", who described it as, \"a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement.\"\n\nBefore the release of \"Hang 'Em High\", Eastwood had already begun working on \"Coogan's Bluff\", about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) through the streets of New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1 million—more than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. \"Coogan's Bluff\" also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the \"Dirty Harry\" films.\n\nEastwood was paid $750,000 in 1968 for the war epic \"Where Eagles Dare\", about a World War II squad parachuting into a Gestapo stronghold in the alpine mountains. Richard Burton played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as Two-Face in the \"Batman\" television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.\n\nEastwood then branched out to star in the only musical of his career, \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20 million, which was extremely expensive for the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nIn 1970, Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\", directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger—unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar. Although it received moderate reviews, the film is listed in \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\". Later the same year, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film \"Kelly's Heroes\", with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas. \"Kelly's Heroes\" was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions. Filming commenced in July 1969 on location in Yugoslavia and in London. The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. In the winter of 1969–70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, \"The Beguiled\", a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by Geraldine Page) of a Southern girls' school. Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French. However, it grossed less than $1 million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the \"emasculated\" role of Eastwood.\n\nEastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing \"Play Misty for Me\", a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner's \"Misty\". When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in \"Time\" magazine, Andrew Sarris in the \"Village Voice\", and Archer Winsten in the \"New York Post\" all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.\n\n\"Dirty Harry\" (1971), written by Harry and Rita Fink, centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) police inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means. \"Dirty Harry\" has been described as being arguably Eastwood's most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the \"loose-cannon cop\" genre. Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry established the \"first true archetype\" of the action film genre. His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of .44 Magnum revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the Smith & Wesson Model 29 carried by Harry Callahan. \"Dirty Harry\" achieved huge success after its release in December 1971, earning $22 million in the United States and Canada alone. It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan. Although a number of critics praised Eastwood's performance as Dirty Harry, such as Jay Cocks of \"Time\" magazine who described him as \"...giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character,\" the film was also widely criticized as being fascistic.\n\nFollowing Sean Connery's announcement that he would not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western \"Joe Kidd\" (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. \"Joe Kidd\" received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.\n\nIn 1973, Eastwood directed his first western, \"High Plains Drifter\", in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in \"Pale Rider\". The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory, influenced by Leone. The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was \"as derivative as it was expressive,\" with Arthur Knight of the \"Saturday Review\" remarking that Eastwood had \"...absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society.\" John Wayne, who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, \"The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great.\"\nEastwood next turned his attention towards \"Breezy\" (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1 million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. \"Breezy\" was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.\n\nOnce filming of \"Breezy\" had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in \"Magnum Force\" (1973), a sequel to \"Dirty Harry\", about a group of rogue young officers (among them David Soul, Robert Urich and Tim Matheson) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals. Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1 million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success. \"The New York Times\" critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's Frank Rich called it \"the same old stuff\".\n\nIn 1974, Eastwood teamed up with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\", a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4 million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.\nEastwood's next film \"The Eiger Sanction\" (1975) was based on Trevanian's critically acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman, an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last \"sanction\" in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald, Switzerland on August 12, 1974. Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality. Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 \"The Eiger Sanction\" was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2 million at the box office, and was received with mixed reviews. Joy Gould Boyum of the \"Wall Street Journal\" dismissed the film as \"brutal fantasy\". Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Brothers, through Frank Wells, that has lasted to the present day.\n\n\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), a western inspired by Asa Carter's 1972 novel of the same name, has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the American Civil War and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and Chief Dan George as an elderly Cherokee who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director Philip Kaufman was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the Directors Guild of America—who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director. The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho during a six-day conference entitled \"Western Movies: Myths and Images\". Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as King Vidor, William Wyler, and Howard Hawks; and a number of academics. Upon release in the summer of 1976 \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the \"Dollars\" westerns and praised the film's atmosphere. The film would later appear in \"Time\" \"Top 10 Films of the Year\".\n\nEastwood was then offered the role of Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\", but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines. He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post's Vietnam War film, \"Go Tell the Spartans\" and instead decided to make a third \"Dirty Harry\" film, \"The Enforcer\". The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer (Tyne Daly) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film, culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island, was considerably shorter than the previous \"Dirty Harry\" films at 95minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100 million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.\n\nIn 1977, he directed and starred in \"The Gauntlet\" opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it \"... classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny.\" The following year, he starred in \"Every Which Way But Loose\" in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.\n\nEastwood starred in \"Escape from Alcatraz\" in 1979, the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of Frank Lee Morris who, along with John and Clarence Anglin, escaped from the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1962. The film was a major success; Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" praised it as \"crystalline cinema\" and Frank Rich of \"Time\" described it as \"cool, cinematic grace\".\n\nIn 1980, Eastwood directed and played the title role in \"Bronco Billy\" alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Eastwood has cited \"Bronco Billy\" as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that film was \"...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while\", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Later that year, Eastwood starred in \"Any Which Way You Can\", the sequel to \"Every Which Way But Loose\". The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as \"funnier and even better than its predecessor\". Released over the Christmas season of 1980, \"Any Which Way You Can\" was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.\nIn 1982, Eastwood directed and starred in \"Honkytonk Man\", based on the eponymous Clancy Carlile's depression-era novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis, but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son Kyle) to Nashville, Tennessee, where he is supposed to record a song. Only \"Time\" gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy. Nevertheless, the film received critical acclaim in France, where it was compared to John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\", and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93percent on Rotten Tomatoes. In the same year Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the Cold War-themed \"Firefox\". Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas, the film was shot before but released after \"Honkeytonk Man\". Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20 million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to date. \"People\" magazine likened Eastwood's performance to \"Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul\".\n\nEastwood directed and starred in the fourth \"Dirty Harry\" film, \"Sudden Impact\", which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and is considered the darkest and most violent of the series. By this time Eastwood received 60 percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio. \"Sudden Impact\" was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line \"Go ahead, make my day\" (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress, and used during the 1984 presidential elections. The film was the second most commercially successful of the \"Dirty Harry\" films, after \"The Enforcer\", earning $70 million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.\n\n\"Tightrope\" (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite Geneviève Bujold in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the \"Dirty Harry\" films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. \"Tightrope\" was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy \"City Heat\" (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50 million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's \"Beverly Hills Cop\".\n\nEastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the 1985 \"Amazing Stories\" episode \"Vanessa in the Garden\", which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke. This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg, who later co-produced \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\". He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in \"Pale Rider\" (1985), a film based on the classic 1953 western \"Shane\" and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's 1973 western \"High Plains Drifter\" in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural. \"Pale Rider\" became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" remarking, \"This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist\".\n\nIn 1986, Eastwood co-starred with Marsha Mason in the military drama \"Heartbreak Ridge\", about the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada. He portrays a United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant veteran of the Korean War and Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense who expressed contempt for the film. At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times. The film grossed $70 million domestically.\n\nEastwood starred in \"The Dead Pool\" (1988), the fifth and final film in the \"Dirty Harry\" series. It co-starred Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson, and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called \"Dead Pool\". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. \"The Dead Pool\" grossed nearly $38 million, relatively low receipts for a \"Dirty Harry\" film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.\n\nEastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed \"Bird\" (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie \"Bird\" Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award. However, \"Bird\" was a commercial failure, earning just $11 million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy \"Pink Cadillac\" (1989). The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman (Bernadette Peters) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink Cadillac. The film failed both critically and commercially, earning barely more than \"Bird\" and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.\n\nEastwood directed and starred in \"White Hunter Black Heart\" (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's \"roman à clef\", about John Huston and the making of the classic film \"The African Queen\". Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4 million. Later in 1990, Eastwood directed and co-starred with Charlie Sheen in \"The Rookie\", a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.\n\nIn 1992, Eastwood revisited the western genre in his film \"Unforgiven\", a film in which he directed and starred as an aging ex-gunfighter long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as \"The Cut-Whore Killings\" and \"The William Munny Killings\" but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films. \"Unforgiven\" was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described it as \"the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 \"The Searchers\". The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, (including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples) and won four, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. In June 2008 \"Unforgiven\" was ranked as the fourth-best American western, behind \"Shane\", \"High Noon\", and \"The Searchers\", in the American Film Institute's \"AFI's 10 Top 10\" list.\nEastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy's life. The film was among the top 10 box office performers in that year, earning $102 million in the United States alone. Later in 1993, he directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in \"A Perfect World\". Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits the road with a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood's directing career, and the film has since been cited as one of his most underrated directorial achievements.\n\nAt the May1994 Cannes Film Festival Eastwood received France's Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal, and on March 27, 1995, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the 67th Academy Awards. His next film appearance was in a cameo role as himself in the 1995 children's film \"Casper\". Later that same year he expanded his repertoire by playing opposite Meryl Streep in \"The Bridges of Madison County\". Based on the novel by Robert James Waller, the film relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for \"National Geographic\", who has an affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife, Francesca (Streep). Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews and a subject deemed potentially unsuitable for film, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" was a commercial and critical success. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Streep and Eastwood weave a spell, and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age.\" The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture and won a César Award in France for Best Foreign Film. Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.\n\nIn 1997, Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller \"Absolute Power\", alongside Gene Hackman (with whom he had appeared in \"Unforgiven\"). Eastwood played the role of a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret Service cover-up of a murder. The film received a mixed reception from critics.\nLater in 1997, Eastwood directed \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\", based on the novel by John Berendt and starring John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Jude Law. The film met with a mixed critical response.\n\nEastwood directed and starred in \"True Crime\" (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by Isaiah Washington). \"True Crime\" received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" writing, \"his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though.\" The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55 million budget and was Eastwood's worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from \"White Hunter Black Heart\", which had a limited release.\n\nIn 2000, Eastwood directed and starred in \"Space Cowboys\" alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Eastwood played one of a group of veteran ex-test pilots sent into space to repair an old Soviet satellite. The original music score was composed by Eastwood and Lennie Niehaus. \"Space Cowboys\" was critically well-received and holds a 79 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes, although Roger Ebert wrote that the film was, \"too secure within its traditional story structure to make much seem at risk.\" The film grossed more than $90 million in its United States release, more than Eastwood's two previous films combined. In 2002, Eastwood played an ex-FBI agent chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thriller \"Blood Work\", loosely based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly. The film was a commercial failure, grossing just $26.2 million on an estimated budget of $50 million and received mixed reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes describing it as, \"well-made but marred by lethargic pacing\". Eastwood did, however, win the Future Film Festival Digital Award at the Venice Film Festival for the film.\n\nEastwood directed and scored the crime drama \"Mystic River\" (2003), a film dealing with themes of murder, vigilantism and sexual abuse and starring Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins. The film was praised by critics and won two Academy Awards – Best Actor for Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Robbins – with Eastwood garnering nominations for Best Director and Best Picture. The film grossed $90million domestically on a budget of $30million. In 2003 Eastwood was named Best Director of the Year by the National Society of Film Critics.\n\nThe following year Eastwood found further critical acclaim with \"Million Dollar Baby\". The boxing drama won four Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Hilary Swank) and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). At age 74 Eastwood became the oldest of eighteen directors to have directed two or more Best Picture winners. He also received a nomination for Best Actor, as well as a Grammy nomination for his score, and won a Golden Globe for Best Director, which was presented to him by daughter Kathryn, who was Miss Golden Globe at the 2005 ceremony. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" lauded the film as a \"masterpiece\" and the best film of the year.\n\nIn 2006, Eastwood directed two films about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, \"Flags of Our Fathers\", focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers on the island and the letters they wrote home to family members. \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for \"Letters from Iwo Jima\". At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nEastwood next directed \"Changeling\" (2008), based on a true story set in the late 1920s. Angelina Jolie stars as a woman reunited with her missing son only to realize he is an impostor. After its release at several film festivals the film grossed over $110 million, the majority of which came from foreign markets. The film was highly acclaimed, with Damon Wise of \"Empire\" describing \"Changeling\" as \"flawless\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" magazine described it as \"emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed\" and that the film's characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an \"almost breathtaking deliberation\". For the film Eastwood received nominations for Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, Best Direction at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and director of the year from the London Film Critics' Circle.\n\nEastwood ended a four-year \"self-imposed acting hiatus\" by appearing in \"Gran Torino\", which he also directed, produced and partly scored with his son Kyle and Jamie Cullum. Biographer Marc Eliot called Eastwood's role \"an amalgam of the Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, and William Munny, here aged and cynical but willing and able to fight on whenever the need arose\". \"Gran Torino\" grossed almost $30 million during its opening weekend release in January 2009, the highest of his career as an actor or director. \"Gran Torino\" eventually grossed over $268 million in theaters worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of Eastwood's career so far (without adjustment for inflation).\n\nEastwood's 30th directorial outing came with \"Invictus\", a film based on the story of the South African team at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, with Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, Matt Damon as rugby team captain François Pienaar and Grant L. Roberts as Ruben Kruger. The film met with generally positive reviews; Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars and described it as a \"...very good film... with moments evoking great emotion,\" while \"Variety\" Todd McCarthy wrote, \"Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood's film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.\" For the film Eastwood was nominated for Best Director at the 67th Golden Globe Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Eastwood directed \"Hereafter\", again working with Matt Damon, who portrayed a psychic. The film had its world premiere on September 12, 2010 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited release later in October. \"Hereafter\" received mixed reviews from critics, with the consensus at Rotten Tomatoes being, \"Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, \"Hereafter\" fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.\" In the same year, Eastwood served as executive producer for a Turner Classic Movies (TCM) documentary about jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, \"\", to commemorate Brubeck's 90th birthday.\n\nIn 2011, Eastwood directed \"J. Edgar\", a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. The film received mixed reviews, although DiCaprio's performance as Hoover was widely praised. Roger Ebert wrote that the film is \"fascinating,\" \"masterful,\" and praised DiCaprio's performance. David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\", while also praising DiCaprio, wrote, \"It's too bad \"J. Edgar\" is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings\". Eastwood starred in the baseball drama \"Trouble with the Curve\" (2012), as a veteran baseball scout who travels with his daughter for a final scouting trip. Robert Lorenz, who worked with Eastwood as an assistant director on several films, directed the film.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLVI, Eastwood narrated a halftime advertisement for Chrysler titled \"It's Halftime in America\". The advertisement was criticized by several U.S. Republicans, who claimed it implied that President Barack Obama deserved a second term. In response to the criticism, Eastwood stated, \"I am certainly not politically affiliated with Mr. Obama. It was meant to be a message about job growth and the spirit of America.\"\n\nEastwood next directed \"Jersey Boys\", a musical biography based on the Tony Award-winning musical \"Jersey Boys\". The film told the story of the musical group The Four Seasons, and was released on June 20, 2014. Eastwood directed \"American Sniper\", a film adaptation of Chris Kyle's eponymous memoir, following Steven Spielberg's departure from the project. The film was released on December 25, 2014. \"American Sniper\" grossed more than $350 million domestically and over $547 million globally, making it one of Eastwood's biggest movies commercially. His next film, \"Sully\", starred Tom Hanks as Chesley Sullenberger, who successfully landed the US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in an emergency landing, keeping all passengers on board alive. Released in the United States in September 2016, it became another commercial success for Eastwood, grossing over $238 million worldwide. In 2018, he directed the biographical thriller \"\", which saw previously non-professional actors Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler and Alek Skarlatos playing themselves as they stop the 2015 Thalys train attack. The film received a generally negative reception from critics, who were largely critical of the acting by the three leads. The Mule, in which he is director and lead, will be released in December 2018.\n\nBeginning with the thriller \"Play Misty for Me\", Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. \"The New Yorker\"s David Denby wrote that, unlike Eastwood,\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take. Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, and the Coen brothers. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\", if he believes production is too slow. In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses storyboards for developing the layout of a shooting schedule. He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film, considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers. Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not \"so much that it insults their intelligence.\"\n\nAccording to \"Life\" magazine, \"Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic.\" Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood's films are \"superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative\" while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing \"unrushed and relaxed.\" Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his movies a \"noir-ish\" feel.\n\nEastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.\n\nEastwood has been recognized with multiple awards and nominations for his work in film, television, and music. His widest reception has been in film work, for which he has received Academy Awards, Directors Guild of America Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and People's Choice Awards, among others. Eastwood is one of only two people to have been twice nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film (\"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\") the other being Warren Beatty (\"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Reds\"). Along with Beatty, Robert Redford, Richard Attenborough, Kevin Costner, and Mel Gibson, he is one of the few directors best known as an actor to win an Academy Award for directing. On February 27, 2005, he became one of only three living directors (along with Miloš Forman and Francis Ford Coppola) to have directed two Best Picture winners. At the age of 74, he was the oldest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director to date. Eastwood has directed five actors in Academy Award–winning performances: Gene Hackman in \"Unforgiven\", Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in \"Mystic River\", and Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank in \"Million Dollar Baby\".\n\nOn August 22, 1984, Eastwood was honored at a ceremony at Grauman's Chinese theater to record his hand and footprints in cement. Eastwood received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1996, and received an honorary degree from AFI in 2009. On December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Eastwood into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.\n\nIn early 2007, Eastwood was presented with the highest civilian distinction in France, Légion d'honneur, at a ceremony in Paris. French President Jacques Chirac told Eastwood that he embodied \"the best of Hollywood.\" In October 2009, he was honored by the Lumière Award (in honor of the Lumière Brothers, inventors of the Cinematograph) during the first edition of the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France. This award honors his entire career and his major contribution to the 7th Art. In February 2010, Eastwood was recognized by President Barack Obama with an arts and humanities award. Obama described Eastwood's films as \"essays in individuality, hard truths and the essence of what it means to be American.\"\n\nEastwood has also been awarded at least three honorary degrees from universities and colleges, including an honorary degree from the University of the Pacific in 2006, an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 27, 2007, and an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music at the Monterey Jazz Festival on September 22, 2007.\n\nOn July 22, 2009, Eastwood was honored by Emperor Akihito of Japan with the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon for his contributions to the enhancement of Japan–United States relations.\n\nEastwood won the Golden Pine lifetime achievement award at the 2013 International Samobor Film Music Festival, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Gerald Fried.\n\nEastwood has contributed to over 50films over his career as actor, director, producer, and composer. He has acted in several television series, including his starring role in \"Rawhide\". He started directing in 1971, and made his debut as a producer in 1982, with \"Firefox\", though he had been functioning as uncredited producer on all of his Malpaso Company films since \"Hang 'Em High\" in 1968. Eastwood also has contributed music to his films, either through performing, writing, or composing. He has mainly starred in western, action, and drama films. According to the box office–revenue tracking website Box Office Mojo, films featuring Eastwood have grossed a total of more than $1.68 billion domestically, with an average of $37 million per film.\n\nEastwood has had numerous casual and serious relationships of varying length and intensity over his life. Between proposing to and marrying \"Maggie\" Johnson in 1953, he had an affair that allegedly resulted in a child who was given up for adoption. He continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 14 year long relationship with actress and stunt woman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter. Johnson reportedly tolerated an open marriage with Eastwood. Eastwood and Johnson were divorced and he continued seeing many other women. In 1975, actress Sondra Locke began living with Eastwood. She took the relationship seriously and was extremely distraught when she discovered much later that Eastwood continued to have sexual relationships with other women. When they separated, Locke filed a palimony lawsuit. Eastwood had two children with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Clint had a relationship with Frances Fisher which produced a daughter, Francesca Fisher, born 1993. He married for the second time to news anchor Dina Ruiz in 1996, which lasted until 2013. He has been seen with other women since then.\n\nDespite smoking in some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthy eating and daily Transcendental Meditation.\n\nHe opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California in 1971. Eastwood sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea.\n\nHe is an avid golfer and owns the Tehàma Golf Club. He is an investor in the world-renowned Pebble Beach Golf Links west of Carmel and donates his time to charitable causes at major tournaments. Eastwood is a certified pilot and often flies his helicopter to the studios to avoid traffic.\n\nIn 1973, Eastwood told the late film critic Gene Siskel, \"No, I don't believe in God.\" Nearly four decades later while promoting his film, \"Hereafter\" (2010), Eastwood stated that \"I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that's OK, too. It's whatever suits you. I do believe in self-help. I'm not a New Age person but I do believe in meditation, and for that reason I've always liked the Buddhist religion. When I've been to Japan I've been to Buddhist temples and meditated and I found that rewarding.\"\n\nAs much as anything, Eastwood has found spirituality in nature (as suggested by his 1985 Western, \"Pale Rider\"), stating that \"I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were Protestant, but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.\"\n\n\"Of course, it would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone\"\n\nEastwood has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating habits. As a young man making a name for himself during the production of \"Rawhide\", Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of \"TV Guide\", for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died unexpectedly of a heart attack at the age of 64. The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set. Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death. He abstained from hard liquor, adopted a more rigorous health regime, and sought to stay fit. However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1971. Eastwood eventually sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.\n\nIn 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in Transcendental Meditation when he appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation. He has meditated every morning for years. Eastwood is an experienced pilot, and sometimes flies his own helicopter to the studio to avoid traffic.\n\nEastwood owns the Tehàma Golf Club, located in Carmel-by-the-Sea, and is an investor in the Pebble Beach Golf Links. He plays golf, including at tournaments sponsoring charitable causes.\n\nEastwood has long shown an interest in politics and is a registered Libertarian. He won election as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California in April 1986. In 2001, Governor Gray Davis appointed him to the California State Park and Recreation Commission, where he led opposition to an extension of the toll six-lane freeway extension of California State Route 241 through San Onofre State Beach. Eastwood endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He delivered a prime time address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, where he drew attention for a speech he delivered to an empty chair representing Barack Obama.\n\nEastwood is an audiophile and has had a strong passion for music all his life, particularly jazz and country and western music. He dabbled in music early on, and in late 1959 he produced the album \"Cowboy Favorites\", which was released on the Cameo label. The album included some classics such as Bob Wills's \"San Antonio Rose\" and Cole Porter's \"Don't Fence Me In\". Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In 1963, Cameo producer Kal Mann told him that \"he would never make it big as a singer\". Nevertheless, during the off season of filming \"Rawhide\", Eastwood and Paul Brinegar—sometimes joined by Sheb Wooley—toured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled \"Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs\", earned them as much as $15,000 a performance. Eastwood has his own Warner Bros. Records-distributed imprint, Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers. This deal was unchanged when Warner Music Group was sold by Time Warner to private investors.\n\nEastwood favors jazz (especially bebop), blues, classic rhythm and blues, classical, and country-and-western music; his favorite musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson. He is also a pianist and composer. Jazz has played an important role in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album \"Cowboy Favorites\", released on the Cameo label.\n\nEastwood has his own Warner Bros. Records-distributed imprint Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from \"The Bridges of Madison County\" onward. Eastwood co-wrote \"Why Should I Care\" with Linda Thompson and Carole Bayer Sager, which was recorded by Diana Krall.\n\nEastwood composed the film scores of \"Mystic River\", \"Million Dollar Baby\", \"Flags of Our Fathers\", \"Grace Is Gone\", \"Changeling\", \"Hereafter\", \"J. Edgar\", and the original piano compositions for \"In the Line of Fire\". He wrote and performed the song heard over the credits of \"Gran Torino\".\n\nThe music in \"Grace Is Gone\" received two Golden Globe nominations by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the 65th Golden Globe Awards. Eastwood was nominated for Best Original Score, while the song \"Grace is Gone\" with music by Eastwood and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager was nominated for Best Original Song. It won the Satellite Award for Best Song at the 12th Satellite Awards. \"Changeling\" was nominated for Best Score at the 14th Critics' Choice Awards, Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, and Best Music at the 35th Saturn Awards. On September 22, 2007, Eastwood was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music at the Monterey Jazz Festival, on which he serves as an active board member. Upon receiving the award he gave a speech claiming, \"It's one of the great honors I'll cherish in this lifetime.\"\n\nMalpaso has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from \"The Bridges of Madison County\" onward. It also released the album of a 1996 jazz concert he hosted, titled \"Eastwood after Hours—Live at Carnegie Hall\". Eastwood owns an extensive collection of LPs, which he plays on a Rockport turntable. Eastwood co-wrote \"Why Should I Care\" with Linda Thompson and Carole Bayer Sager, which was recorded by Diana Krall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48911263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48911263", "title": "Darkestrah", "text": "Darkestrah\n\nDarkestrah is a Kyrgyz pagan metal band, formed in 1999 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Throughout their career the band has blended folklore music with metal elements. In its lyrics and in musical composition, the band uses national folk musical instruments, such as the komuz and kyl-kyak, and references shamanism and Tengrism. The band also takes influence from genres such as progressive rock and post-rock, generally constructing lengthy, rhythmically complex songs that often feature several discrete movements.\n\nThe word \"Darkestrah\" is a portmanteau of two words: \"dark\" and \"orchestra\"; however, in one interview, the band's drummer Asbath stated that there is still mystic and hidden meaning in the name of the band.\n\nSince its formation in 1999, the band has released six studio albums, two EPs, one split album, and one live album.\n\nDarkestrah, the Kyrgyz Pagan Metal group, was established in Bishkek, and their first demo, \"The Black Pagan Act\" was recorded in December 1999. In 2000 December, their second demo, \"Through the Ashes of Shamanic Flames\" was released by the German label Curse of KvN Sadistic. In 2003 February, the band recorded their first full-length album, \"Sary Oy\", which appeared on the same label in January 2004. In this album, traditional folk songs with traditional Kyrgyz instruments were combined with metal. It is a concept album about a Kyrgyz legend.\n\nIn March 2004, the EP \"The Way to Paganism\" was recorded; the German label No Colours Records released on 14 April 2005, along with the full-length album \"Embrace of Memory\" on 25 October. In 2007 they recorded a new album, \"Epos\", with a new studio called \"Kick the Flame Studio\". \"Epos\" is almost fully dedicated to Issyk-kul Lake. It is filled with Pagan motives, and it consists of a single track that runs for more than thirty-three minutes.\n\nIn 2007, Darkestrah cut its ties with No Colours and it signed a contract with American Paragon Records. In 2008 March, they released their new album, \"The Great Silk Road\". This earned them the attention of the French label Osmose Productions, on which they released the EP \"Khagan\" in 2011 and their fifth full-length album, \"Manas\" (based on the Kyrgyz Epic of Manas), in 2013.\n\nThe band's releases up to this point were fairly unique in the largely male-dominated world of black metal for featuring female vocalist Kriegtalith, who utilised occasional clean vocals and an unconventional style reminiscent of Tuvan throat singing alongside the traditional shrieks of black metal. She left the band in 2014, however.\n\nAn \"official live bootleg\", \"Everything Becomes Fire\", was self-released in 2015; it was recorded in Germany in 2006. A split with the Saudi band Al-Namrood (Darkestrah's side being a re-recording of the track \"Akyr Zaman\", previous versions of which had appeared on \"Embrace of Memory\" and the multi-artist compilation \"Stimme aus der Tiefe #1\"), on the Canadian label Shaythan Productions, and Darkestrah's sixth full-length album \"Turan\", again on Osmose, were both released in 2016. Shaythan Productions has also released vinyl editions of some of Darkestrah's back catalogue (thus far, \"Epos\" and \"The Great Silk Road\").\n\nCurrent\n\nPast members\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rehmus (June 1929 – March 2004), was an American occultist, linguist, Egyptologist, classicist, writer, editor, translator, illustrator, cartoonist, and occasional graphic artist primarily known for being the author of \"The Magician's Dictionary\".\n\nJoseph Haskew, his long-term partner, wrote of Rehmus's early life and youth:\nHaskew further adds:\nAs a polymath and philomath, Rehmus was actively involved with the quest to understand and expand human intelligence, himself being a member of several high-IQ support groups. Among these affiliations was his involvement with the San Francisco area Mensa society; he often contributed to that local society's publication, \"The Ecphorizer\". Rehmus was also a member of the Prometheus Society, a high-IQ society with admission standards 600 times more stringent than Mensa's. His contributor notice from \"The Ecphorizer\" runs thus:\nHis public reputation rests mainly on his contribution to the study of the occult through his renowned book \"The Magician's Dictionary\", a vast pseudo-encyclopaedic work first published in 1990 that proposes a re-evaluation of some of the core building blocks of modern belief structures through definition and commentary on key words and phrases, from \"Aaron\" to \"Zuvuya\".\n\nApart from founding and editing various magazines and journals (sometimes under pseudonyms), Rehmus was a regular contributor to numerous and diverse scholarly and amateur publications, providing articles, texts, artworks, and even erudite crossword puzzles.

The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colored foil, hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate. However, real eggs continue to be used in Central and Eastern European tradition. Although eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth, in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus resurrected. In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\" This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches. This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in \"pre-dynastic period in Egypt, as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete\".\n\nThe practice of decorating eggshells as part of spring rituals is ancient, with decorated, engraved ostrich eggs found in Africa which are 60,000 years old. In the pre-dynastic period of Egypt and the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete, eggs were associated with death and rebirth, as well as with kingship, with decorated ostrich eggs, and representations of ostrich eggs in gold and silver, were commonly placed in graves of the ancient Sumerians and Egyptians as early as 5,000 years ago. These cultural relationships may have influenced early Christian and Islamic cultures in those areas, as well as through mercantile, religious, and political links from those areas around the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Christian custom of Easter eggs, specifically, started among the early Christians of Mesopotamia, who stained eggs with red colouring \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed at His crucifixion\". The Christian Church officially adopted the custom, regarding the eggs as a symbol of the resurrection of Jesus, with the Roman Ritual, the first edition of which was published in 1610 but which has texts of much older date, containing among the Easter Blessings of Food, one for eggs, along with those for lamb, bread, and new produce. The blessing is for consumption as a food, rather than decorated. \n\nSociology professor Kenneth Thompson discusses the spread of the Easter egg throughout Christendom, writing that \"use of eggs at Easter seems to have come from Persia into the Greek Christian Churches of Mesopotamia, thence to Russia and Siberia through the medium of Orthodox Christianity. From the Greek Church the custom was adopted by either the Roman Catholics or the Protestants and then spread through Europe.\" Both Thompson, as well as British orientalist Thomas Hyde state that in addition to dying the eggs red, the early Christians of Mesopotamia also stained Easter eggs green and yellow.\n\nInfluential 19th century folklorist and philologist Jacob Grimm speculates, in the second volume of his \"Deutsche Mythologie\", that the folk custom of Easter eggs among the continental Germanic peoples may have stemmed from springtime festivities of a Germanic goddess known in Old English as Ēostre (namesake of modern English \"Easter\") and possibly known in Old High German as *\"Ostara\" (and thus namesake of Modern German \"Ostern\" 'Easter'):\n\nAlthough one of the Christian traditions are to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with candy such as jelly beans. These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, which may be left by the Easter Bunny. They may also be put in a basket filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a bird's nest.\n\nThe Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of Lent in the West.\nHistorically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began.\nEggs were originally forbidden during Lent as well as on other traditional fast days in Western Christianity (this tradition still continues among the Eastern Christian Churches).\nLikewise, in Eastern Christianity, meat, eggs, and dairy are all prohibited during the Lenten fast.\n\nThis established the tradition of Pancake Day being celebrated on Shrove Tuesday. This day, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins, is also known as Mardi Gras, a French phrase which translates as \"Fat Tuesday\" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, Great Lent begins on Clean Monday, rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called Cheesefare Week.\n\nDuring Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast. This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes. Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the eggs that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the Spanish dish hornazo (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn Hungary, eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the empty tomb of Jesus.\n\nIn the Orthodox churches, Easter eggs are blessed by the priest at the end of the Paschal Vigil (which is equivalent to Holy Saturday), and distributed to the faithful. The egg is seen by followers of Christianity as a symbol of resurrection: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.\n\nSimilarly, in the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, the so-called święconka, i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring Paschaltide, in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a memorial service people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous paschal greeting, \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see Radonitza).\n\nIn Greece, women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of Communion). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga. They also bake tsoureki for the Easter Sunday feast. Red Easter eggs are sometimes served along the centerline of tsoureki (braided loaf of bread).\n\nIn Egypt, it's a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during Sham el-Nessim holiday, which falls every year after the Eastern Christian Easter.\n\nThe dying of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural substances (such as, onion peel (brown colour), oak or alder bark or walnut nutshell (black), beet juice (pink) etc.), or using artificial colourings.\n\nA greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen yarn. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English \"pasche\". They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping (egg tapping) competition.\n\nIn the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the blood of Christ, with further symbolism being found in the hard shell of the egg symbolizing the sealed Tomb of Christ — the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead.\n\nWhen boiling them with onion skins leaves can be attached prior to dying to create leaf patterns. The leaves are attached to the eggs before they are dyed with a transparent cloth to wrap the eggs with like inexpensive muslin or nylon stockings, leaving patterns once the leaves are removed after the dyeing process. These eggs are part of Easter custom in many areas and often accompany other traditional Easter foods. Passover haminados are prepared with similar methods.\n\nPysanky are Ukrainian Easter eggs, decorated using a wax-resist (batik) method. The word comes from the verb \"pysaty\", \"to write\", as the designs are not painted on, but written with beeswax. \n\nDecorating eggs for Easter using wax resistant batik is a popular method in some other eastern European countries. \n\nIn some Mediterranean countries, especially in Lebanon, chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on Easter Day, young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed, He is', breaking and eating them. This also happens in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.\n\nIn Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as Easter egg trees, and in several areas public wells as Osterbrunnen.\n\nThere used to be a custom in Ukraine, during Easter celebrations to have \"krashanky\" on a table in a bowl with wheatgrass. The number of the \"krashanky\" equalled the number of departed family members.\n\nAn egg hunt is a game in which decorated eggs, which may be hard-boiled chicken eggs, chocolate eggs, or artificial eggs containing candies, are hidden for children to find. The eggs often vary in size, and may be hidden both indoors and outdoors. When the hunt is over, prizes may be given for the largest number of eggs collected, or for the largest or the smallest egg.\n\nThe central European Slavic nations (Czechs and Slovaks etc.) have a tradition of gathering eggs by gaining them from the females in return of whipping them with a pony-tail shaped whip made out of fresh willow branches and splashing them with water, by the Ruthenians called \"polivanja\", which is supposed to give them health and beauty.\n\nCascarones, a Latin American tradition now shared by many US States with high Hispanic demographics, are emptied and dried chicken eggs stuffed with confetti and sealed with a piece of tissue paper. The eggs are hidden in a similar tradition to the American Easter egg hunt and when found the children (and adults) break them over each other's heads.\n\nIn order to enable children to take part in egg hunts despite visual impairment, eggs have been created that emit various clicks, beeps, noises, or music so that visually impaired children can easily hunt for Easter eggs.\n\nEgg rolling is also a traditional Easter egg game played with eggs at Easter. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Easter. This tradition was taken to the New World by European settlers, and continues to this day each Easter with an Easter egg roll on the White House lawn. Different nations have different versions of the game.\n\nIn the North of England, during Eastertide, a traditional game is played where hard boiled \"pace eggs\" are distributed and each player hits the other player's egg with their own. This is known as \"egg tapping\", \"egg dumping\", or \"egg jarping\". The winner is the holder of the last intact egg. The annual egg jarping world championship is held every year over Easter in Peterlee Cricket Club.\n\nIt is also practiced in Italy (where is called \"scuccetta\"), Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Russia, and other countries. In parts of Austria, Bavaria and German-speaking Switzerland it is called \"Ostereiertitschen\" or \"Eierpecken\". In parts of Europe it is also called \"epper\", presumably from the German name \"Opfer\", meaning \"offering\" and in Greece it is known as \"tsougrisma\". In South Louisiana, this practice is called pocking eggs and is slightly different. The Louisiana Creoles hold that the winner eats the eggs of the losers in each round.\n\nIn the Greek Orthodox tradition, red eggs are also cracked together when people exchange Easter greetings.\n\nEgg dance is a traditional Easter game in which eggs are laid on the ground or floor and the goal is to dance among them without damaging any eggs which originated in Germany. In the UK the dance is called the hop-egg.\n\nThe Pace Egg plays are traditional village plays, with a rebirth theme. The drama takes the form of a combat between the hero and villain, in which the hero is killed and brought back to life. The plays take place in England during Easter.\n\nIn 1873 J.S. Fry & Sons of England introduced the first chocolate Easter egg in Britain.\n\nIn Western cultures, the giving of chocolate eggs is now commonplace, with 80 million Easter eggs sold in the UK alone. Formerly, the containers Easter eggs were sold in contained large amounts of plastic, although in the United Kingdom this has gradually been replaced with recyclable paper and cardboard. \nIn the Indian state of Goa, the Goan Catholic dish Marzipan is used to make easter eggs. In the Philippines, mazapán de pili (Spanish for \"pili marzipan\") is made from pili nuts.\n\nThe jewelled Easter eggs made by the Fabergé firm for the two last Russian Tsars are regarded as masterpieces of decorative arts. Most of these creations themselves contained hidden surprises such as clock-work birds, or miniature ships.\n\nIn Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and other Central European countries' folk traditions, and making artificial eggs out of porcelain for ladies is common.\n\nEaster eggs are frequently depicted in sculpture, including a 27-foot (9 m) sculpture of a pysanka standing in Vegreville, Alberta.\n\nWhile the origin of Easter eggs can be explained in the symbolic terms described above, among followers of Eastern Christianity the legend says that Mary Magdalene was bringing cooked eggs to share with the other women at the tomb of Jesus, and the eggs in her basket miraculously turned bright red when she saw the risen Christ.\n\nA different, but not necessarily conflicting legend concerns Mary Magdalene's efforts to spread the Gospel. According to this tradition, after the Ascension of Jesus, Mary went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with \"Christ has risen,\" whereupon he pointed to an egg on his table and stated, \"Christ has no more risen than that egg is red.\"\n\nAfter making this statement it is said the egg immediately turned blood red. Red Easter eggs', known as \"kokkina avga\" (κόκκινα αυγά) in Greece and krashanki in Ukraine, are an Easter tradition and a distinct type of Easter egg prepared by various Orthodox Christian peoples. The red eggs are part of Easter custom in many areas and often accompany other traditional Easter foods. Passover haminados are prepared with similar methods.\nDark red eggs are a tradition in Greece and represent the blood of Christ shed on the cross. The practice dates to the early Christian church in Mesopotamia.\nIn Greece, superstitions of the past included the custom of placing the first-dyed red egg at the home's iconostasis (place where icons are displayed) to ward off evil. The heads and backs of small lambs were also marked with the red dye to protect them.\n\nThe egg is widely used as a symbol of the start of new life, just as new life emerges from an egg when the chick hatches out.\n\nPainted eggs are used at the Iranian spring holidays, the Nowruz that marks the first day of spring or Equinox, and the beginning of the year in the Persian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical Northward equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The painted eggs symbolize fertility and are displayed on the Nowruz table, called Haft-Seen together with various other symbolic objects. There are sometimes one egg for each member of the family. The ancient Zoroastrians painted eggs for Nowruz, their New Year celebration, which falls on the Spring equinox. The tradition continues among Persians of Islamic, Zoroastrian, and other faiths today. The Nowruz tradition has existed for at least 2,500 years. The sculptures on the walls of Persepolis show people carrying eggs for Nowruz to the king.\n\nThe Neo-Pagan holiday of Ostara occurs at roughly the same time as Easter. While it is often claimed that the use of painted eggs is an ancient, pre-Christian component of the celebration of Ostara there are no historical accounts that the celebration of Ostara included this practice, apart from the Old High German lullaby which is believed by most to be a modern fabrication. Rather, the use of painted eggs has been adopted under the assumption that it might be a pre-Christian survival.\n\nThere are good grounds for the association between hares (later termed Easter bunnies) and bird eggs, through folklore confusion between hares' forms (where they raise their young) and plovers' nests.\n\nIn Judaism, a hard-boiled egg is an element of the Passover Seder, representing festival sacrifice. The children's game of hunting for the afikomen (a half-piece of matzo) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition, by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize. In other homes, the children hide the afikoman and a parent must look for it; when the parents give up, the children demand a prize for revealing its location.\n"}
{"id": "664270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664270", "title": "Glory (religion)", "text": "Glory (religion)\n\nGlory (from the Latin \"gloria\", \"fame, renown\") is used to describe the manifestation of God's presence as perceived by humans according to the Abrahamic religions.\n\nDivine glory is an important motif throughout Christian theology, where God is regarded as the \"most glorious\" being in existence, and it is considered that human beings are created in the Image of God and can share or participate, imperfectly, in divine glory as image-bearers. Thus Christians are instructed to \"let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\"\n\n\"Glory\" is one of the most common praise words in scripture. In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of glory is expressed with several Hebrew words, including \"Hod\" (הוד) and \"kavod\". Later, these original Hebrew Bible concepts for glory were translated in the Christian Testament as the Greek word \"doxa\" (δόξα). The Hebrew word \"kavod\" (K-V-D) has meant \"importance\", \"weight\", \"deference\", or \"heaviness\", but primarily \"kavod\" means \"glory\", \"respect\", \"honor\", and \"majesty\". In translating the Hebrew Bible, the Greek word used is \"δόξα\", a word also appearing extensively in the New Testament which was originally written in Greek. \"Doxa\" means \"judgment, opinion\", and by extension, \"good reputation, honor\". St. Augustine later rendered it as \"clara notitia cum laude\", \"brilliant celebrity with praise\".\n\nIn , Moses is told that no human being can see the glory ( \"kavod\") of Yahweh and survive:\n\nAnd the Lord said to Moses, “This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.\" But, he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.” And the Lord said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”\n\nThe prophet Ezekiel writes in his vision: \n\nAnd upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.\n\nSuch was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.\n\nIn the New Testament, the corresponding word is the , \"doxa\", sometimes also translated \"brightness\". For example, at the nativity of Christ:\n\nIn the countryside close by there were shepherds out in the fields keeping guard over their sheep during the watches of the night. An angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone round them. They were terrified, but the angel said, 'Do not be afraid. Look, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people.'\n\nIn the event known as the Transfiguration of Jesus, Moses and Elijah appeared in glory with Jesus, and the disciples who witnessed this revelation, Peter, James and John, 'saw his glory'.\n\nIn the gospel of John, Jesus says that His destiny begins to be fulfilled when Judas Iscariot sets out to betray Him:\n\nJesus subsequently addresses a long prayer to His Father in which he says:\n\nCatholic doctrine asserts that the world was created as an act of God's free will for his own glory. Catholic doctrine teaches, however, that God does not seek to be glorified for his own sake, but for the sake of mankind that they may know Him.\n\nThe theologian C. S. Lewis, in his essay The Weight of Glory, writes \"Glory suggests two ideas to me, of which one seems wicked and the other ridiculous. Either glory means to me fame, or it means luminosity.\" He concludes that glory should be understood in the former sense, but states that one should not desire fame before men (human glory), but fame before God (divine glory).\n\nGlorification (also referred to as canonization) is the term used in the Orthodox Christian Church for the official recognition of a person as a saint of the Church. The Orthodox Christian term \"theosis\" is roughly equivalent to the Protestant concept of glorification.\n\nIt is in this sense that the resurrected bodies of the righteous will be \"glorified\" at the Second Coming. As the soul was illuminated through \"theosis\" so the restored body will be illuminated by the grace of God when it is \"changed\" at the Parousia (). This glorified body will be like the resurrected body of Jesus (); similar in appearance to the body during life, but of a more refined and spiritualized nature ().\n\nIn his dissertation \"Concerning the End for which God Created the World\", Jonathan Edwards concludes, \"[I]t appears that all that is ever spoken of in the Scripture as an ultimate end of God's works is included in that one phrase, `the glory of God'.\"\n\nThere are two events that occur during glorification, these are \"the receiving of perfection by the elect before entering into the kingdom of heaven,\" and \"the receiving of the resurrection bodies by the elect\"\n\nGlorification is the third stage of Christian development. The first being justification, then sanctification, and finally glorification. (Rom. 8:28-30) Glorification is the full realization of salvation.\n\nGlorification is the Protestant alternative to purgatory, as it is \"the means by which the elect receive perfection before entering into the kingdom of Heaven.\" Purgatory deals with the means by which the elect become perfect, and takes place after physical death; glorification deals with the elect becoming perfect, and is an ongoing process which takes place during life. The majority of Protestant denominations believe in this form of glorification, although some have alternative names.\n\nAfter the final judgement, in some doctrines all the righteous dead will arise and their bodies will be perfected and become a glorified body, under which form they can enter Heaven.\n\nThe Baha'i Faith claims that Baha'u'llah, whose name translates to the Glory of God, is the Messenger of God promised to Man by all the older Abrahamic religions, like Christianity, Judaism and Islam. In Bahá'í belief the Greatest Name is Bahá’ (بهاء), translated as \"glory\" or \"splendour.\"\n\nIn Islamic belief, God has 99 names, and in some Islamic traditions it is believed that there is a special hidden 100th name which is the greatest. \n\nTo glorify God in Islam is one of the four eternal good deeds. Glorifying God (Tasbih , Arabic: تسبيح) is mentioned in many verses in the Quran. For example \"The seven heavens and the earth and all beings therein glorify God. There is not a single thing that does not glorify God with praise, but you do not understand their glorification. God is truly clement and forgiving\" [Quran 17:44]. The prophet Muhammad said the eternal good deeds (Arabic: الباقيات الصالحات) are to glorify God (Tasbih , Arabic: تسبيح) , to praise God (Hamed , Arabic: حمد), to unify God (Tawhid, Arabic: توحيد) and to elevate God (Takbir , Arabic: تكبير). These are eternal good deeds due to their devotional and spiritual meanings as the Muslims understand them. For example, you glorify God because God is impeccable and you are in God's wonderful kingdom; you praise God because God is sustaining, ruling and loving you and everyone; you unify God because only God exists and nothing exists beside God; you elevate God so that nothing would remain or be elevated in your heart beside God. The prophet Muhammad said \"To glorify God, to praise God, to unify God and to elevate God is more pleasing to my heart than everything under the sun.\" The Quran says \"wealth and children are the gloss of the worldly life, while the eternal good deeds are better\" [18:46]. It is a common act of devotion for Muslims to glorify God (33 times), praise God (33 times) and elevate God (33/34 times) after each of the five daily regular prayers following the hadith saying of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nGlorification in Islam has many layers of meanings that varies according to one's spiritual state and circumstances. Yet all these meanings generally imply viewing God as impeccable and the feeling of wonderment for being in such glorious existence. Among these meanings for example are:\nThese are just few meanings, yet the glorification of God (Tasbih) is mentioned in more than 90 verses in the Quran and in many hadith sayings of the prophet Muhammad.\n\nIn comparison to the desire for glory from God, stands the desire for glory from man. Thomas Aquinas, in his \"Summa Theologica\", cautions that an inordinate desire of glory, or praise, from man is a sin. He lists vainglory as a capital vice and, in some cases, as a mortal sin, cf. quotation. However, this is not to be confused with the desire for what Aquinas calls \"honours\", which Aquinas considered a good, and embraces a moderate and reasoned pursuance of.\n\nAccording to the Book of Revelation 20.11-15, the dead in Christ will receive a perfect glorified body at the first resurrection; those saints alive will be transformed into a glorified perfect body. The second resurrection is for the white throne judgement. Those not resurrected in the first resurrection will be resurrected for judgement to include those born during the thousand-year kingdom. Those whose names do not appear in the book of life will be thrown in the lake of fire.\n\n The manifestation of glory (upon a saint for example) is often depicted in iconography using the religious symbol of a halo. Other common symbols of glory include white robes, crowns, jewels, gold, and stars. The Coronation of the Virgin is one of the most common depictions of Mary in glory.\n\nThere are a number of specialised senses of \"glory\" in art, which all derive from French usages of \"gloire\". \"Glory\" was the medieval English word for a halo or aureole, and continues to be used sometimes in this sense, mostly for the full-body version. The subject of Christ in Majesty is also known as \"Christ in Glory\", and in general any depiction of a sacred person in heaven (e.g. in the clouds, surrounded by angels) can be called a \"glory\", although this sense is obsolete.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The words and are synonyms for gongen. is the term for belief in the existence of gongen.\n\nThe gongen concept is the cornerstone of the honji suijaku theory, according to which Buddhist deities choose to appear to the Japanese as native kami in order to save them, which is based on the Mahayana Buddhist notion of upaya, \"expedient means\".\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that the word \"gongen\" derives from Tokugawa Ieyasu's posthumous name (Tōshō Daigongen). However, the term was created and started being used in the middle of the Heian period in an effort to harmonize Buddhism and indigenous religious practice in what is called shinbutsu-shūgō or \"syncretism of kami and buddhas\". At that time, the assumption that Japanese \"kami\" and buddhas were essentially the same evolved into a theory called , which held that native kami were manifestations or avatars of buddhas, bodhisattvas and other Buddhist deities. The theory gradually spread around the country and the concept of gongen, a dual entity composed of a buddha and a kami, evolved.\n\nUnder the influence of Tendai Buddhism and Shugendō, the gongen concept was adapted to religious beliefs tied to Mount Iwaki, a volcano, so that female kami Kuniyasutamahime became associated with Avalokiteśvara \"ekadaśamukha\" (Jūichimen Kannon Bosatsu, \"Eleven-Faced Guanyin\"), Ōkuninushi with Bhaisajyaguru (Yakushi Nyōrai) and Kuninotokotachi with Amitābha (Amida Nyōrai).\n\nThe title \"gongen\" started being attached to the names of kami and shrines were built within the premises of large Buddhist temples to enshrine their tutelary kami. During the Japanese Middle Ages, shrines started being called with the name gongen to underline their ties to Buddhism. For example, in Eastern Japan there are still many Mount Haku shrines where the shrine itself is called either gongen or jinja. Because it represents the application of Buddhist terminology to native kami, the use of the term was legally abolished in the Meiji Restoration with the and shrines began to be called \"jinja\".\n\n\n is the name of a complex Shinto shrine structure in which the \"haiden\", or worship hall, and the honden, or main sanctuary, are interconnected under the same roof in the shape of an H. One of the oldest examples of \"gongen-zukuri\" is Kitano Tenmangū in Kyoto. The name comes from Nikkō Tōshō-gū in Nikkō because, as we have seen, it enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen and adopts this structure.\n\n\n"}

It had its peak during the 1960s and 1970s. Native American students who were baptized members of the LDS Church were placed in foster homes of LDS members during the school year. They attended majority-white public schools, rather than the Indian boarding schools or local schools on the reservations.\n\nThe program was developed according to LDS theology, whereby conversion and assimilation to Mormonism could help Native Americans, who had been classified as Lamanites in terms of theology in the Book of Mormon. An estimated 50,000 Native American children went through the program. The foster placement was intended to help develop leadership among Native Americans and assimilate them into majority-American culture. The cost of care was borne by the foster parents, and financially stable families were selected by the church. Most of these placements took place in the Navajo Nation, with a peak participation of 5,000 students in 1972. The program decreased in size after the 1970s, due to criticism, changing mores among Native Americans, and restriction of the program to high school students as schools improved on reservations. Many of the students and families praised the program; others criticized it and the LDS Church for weakening the Native Americans' ties to their own cultures.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, four plaintiffs (now referred to as the \"Doe Defendants\") filed suit in the Window Rock District of the Navajo Nation Tribal Court, alleging they had been sexually abused for years while in the foster program, roughly from the years 1965 to 1983, and the Mormon Church did not adequately protect them. The church filed suit in federal district court in Salt Lake City, alleging that the Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction and seeking an injunction \"to stay the proceedings from moving forward under tribal jurisdiction.\" Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and also ruled that it first had to \"exhaust all remedies\" in Tribal Court. This is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence.\n\nDuring the earliest days of the LDS Church in Utah, Mormons often raised Native American children in their homes. Leader Brigham Young advocated buying children held by Native Americans and Mexican traders as slaves (a legal practice in the Utah Territory prior to the American Civil War), freeing them from slavery, and encouraged Latter-day Saints to educate and acculturate the children as if they were their own.\n\nLDS theology suggests that the Native Americans have a special status. It held that Native Americans had two distinct phenotypes: \"Nephites, light-skinned, \"righteous and civilized people;\" and Lamanites, \"idle, savage and bloodthirsty,\" for which they were \"cursed by God\" with dark skin.\" Although this is a prevailing view, there are alternative perspectives about whether the distinction referred to in the Book of Mormon actually referred to skin color. These differing views are more complex than popular and simplistic characterizations portray. For more, see Brant A. Gardner, \"What Does the Book of Mormon Mean by 'Skin of Blackness?'\"\n\nThe Indian Student Placement Program (ISPP) of the late 20th century developed from an informal placement in 1947 in Richfield, Utah by the LDS Church. A 16-year old Navajo teenager, Helen John, asked permission to stay in the city to go to school. As a result, Golden Buchanan and Miles Jensen organized an informal placement program under the direction of Spencer W. Kimball, who was the chairman of the church's Committee on Indian Relationships. With her parent's permission, Helen was allowed to stay with the Buchanan family, whom she knew in Richfield. This arrangement was not an official program, but it was the basis for the Indian Placement Program that would later be established. The Buchanans agreed to take in other children as well, and that year three students were placed into the unofficial program. These arrangements continued, and by 1954 there were some 68 Native American students (mostly from the Navajo Nation) placed into foster homes in four different western states.\n\nThe ISPP worked to instill Western notions of industry through the imposition of an ethno-religious identity. The Lamanite identity defined Indians as culturally and spiritually apostate Israelites destined for latter-day restoration through an internalized Protestant work ethic. Although some rejected this theological identity others found it a point of strength and empowerment as they attended schools and participated in specific ISPP efforts to develop Western leadership patterns among Native American participants.\n\nThe ISPP was defined as an \"educational opportunity,\" as opposed to foster care. Its objective was the \"assimilation and \"whitening\" of Indian children as a divine imperative outlined in the Book of Mormon.\" The church members believed that, \"by educating and assimilating Indian children into Mormon culture and religion they could be \"lightened,\" thereby breaking their Lamanite (or dark-skinned) \"curse\" and restoring the prophecy of their redemption.\" In 2013, the Mormon Church officially renounced this doctrine.\n\nThe success of these students led to the church establishing a formal placement program in July 1954, under the Church Social Services, which was part of the Relief Society. Under this program, a social worker was assigned to each Native American foster child. A reception center was built in Richfield to accommodate the large numbers of participants. Buses and other transportation were arranged to bring children to the center where they would be fed, receive medical examinations, and be introduced to their foster families. Students participated from the Navajo Nation and other tribes in the Southwest, as well as some from other parts of the United States.\n\nWhen the program became institutionalized, there were some complaints that LDS missionaries were assigned to recruit new participants. In 1956, the Bureau of Indian Affairs received complaints that the placement program was being used to increase the church's proselytizing efforts. The governments of Utah and Arizona in March 1957 met with church representatives to address the issue. As a result, caseworkers rather than missionaries were given the responsibility of making the final decision for acceptance of students into the Indian Placement Program.\n\nIn order for children to participate in the program, their parents had to request their placement. Foster parents were recommended by local bishops and were expected to provide free room, board, and clothing for the Native American children. These children had to be at least eight years old, baptized as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and be in good standing in the church and in good health.\n\nIn October 1960, Kimball discussed the program at the General Conference. He said that Natives who participated in the program were gradually turning lighter, becoming 'white and delightsome.' \"The day of the Lamanites is nigh,\" Kimball said, claiming that Navajo placement students were \"as light as Anglos\" and, in one case, several shades lighter than parents \"on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather.\" It should be noted that the Church has moved away from other race-based qualifications that, while practiced, were never accepted as doctrine and have been repudiated by the church. See, e.g. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, \"Race and the Priesthood.\" Additionally, racial references in scripture headings, not considered doctrine, have been removed.\n\nSome families had their children baptized in the church in order to gain the opportunity to go to school off the reservation. To avoid this, in the 1950s and 1960s, the church added new requirements for acceptance of children into the program. In 1969, the Unified Social Services was established in the church; this became the administrative body to run the Indian Placement Program. In 1973 it was renamed and organized as LDS Social Services.\n\nBy 1972, nearly 5,000 Native Americans were living in foster homes through this program. Some students went on to study at Brigham Young University, earning college degrees. In 1971 they created a performance group of singers and dancers called \"The Lamanite Generation.\" Among their pieces was \"Go My Son,\" a song referring to the \"ladder of education.\"\n\nIn 1972 local priesthood leaders were given the responsibility for recruiting and screening new students. Due to strong criticism and rising Native American activism, the program had nearly been discontinued in 1977. The US government commissioned a study under the Interstate Compact Secretariat, which oversaw educational efforts. It heard much praise from Native American families for the program. After assessing the program results and hearing testimonial from participants and foster families, the church decided to continue it.\n\nAfter 1972, the number of students that participated in the program decreased. By the late 1970s, the number of participants in the Indian Placement Program was around 2,500. In response to the improvement of local schools developed on the reservations in preference to boarding schools, in the 1980s the Indian Placement Program limited participants to high-school students; the number of students dropped to 500 in 1990. In 1996 there were virtually no more participants, although the last graduated in 2000.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Indian Placement Program was directed to emphasize creating stronger bonds and increased communication between the natural families and the selected foster families. The goal of the program was to \"introduce Native Americans to mainstream values and social roles without demanding the abandonment of the old for the new.\" According to the Maxwell Institute of BYU, it attempted to help Native Americans receive more formal education and training, while helping them maintain their identity.\n\nMultiple studies have been conducted of the program. As recorded, about one-third of the participants stayed in the program until graduation from high school. 40 percent of students decided to drop out of the program, and 15 percent of students left the program because of their parents' wishes or needs. Students who did drop out were still more likely to finish high school than were Native American peers who had not participated in the program. Students in the Indian Placement Program had an 82 percent graduation rate. Studies found that the \"longer students remained in the program, the more likely they were to be employed and to earn high incomes\" and also to marry.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, however, the Indian Placement Program was increasingly criticized. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. The commission found that the program was largely positive, and enjoyed emphatic support both from Native American parents and white foster parents. Critics \"view intervention as an intrusion on the right to be fully Native American, a weakening of cultural pluralism, and a cause of psychological damage.\" Most of the students came from the Navajo Nation.\n\nOn March 22, 2016, two members of the Navajo Nation, (plaintiffs \"RJ\" and \"MM\") filed a complaint in Navajo Nation District Court (a tribal court) against LDS Family Services and against the Corporation of the President, alleging sexual abuse during their foster placement in the IPP from 1976 to 1983. Their complaint was amended April 21.\n\nOn May 31, 2016 a third Navajo plaintiff (\"BN\") filed a lawsuit alleging abuse from 1965 to 1972. On June 6, a fourth plaintiff (\"LK\") sued in Navajo Nation District Court.\n\nAlso on May 31, attorneys for the LDS Church petitioned for declaratory judgement in the United States District Court for the District of Utah (\"not\" the tribal court), seeking both a declaration that the tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Church, and an order enjoining the lawsuit from proceeding in tribal court. Because the Church's suit was filed against the Navajo plaintiffs in the District Court, the Church becomes the plaintiff in the federal jurisdiction.\nOn June 3, LDS Church attorneys expanded their motion to Judge Robert Shelby in District Court to include plaintiff BN, and amended their response to seek a federal order restraining the tribal court from proceeding.\n\nIn November 2016, Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church's motion to dismiss and ruled that it first had to \"exhaust all remedies\" in Tribal Court. Shelby wrote that \n\nit was necessary to allow the Navajo Nation courts to develop the factual record, because \"the existing record is significantly incomplete concerning the nature and scope of the agreements [between the Mormon Church and the defendants], and any nexus between those agreements and the alleged conduct\" alleged in the Doe Defendants' complaints.\n\nBy ordering the Mormon Church to first exhaust its legal remedies in tribal court, Shelby said that the Navajo Nation judicial system would then be able to assess the facts of the case and whether jurisdiction was on the table. Further, it would allow the Navajo courts time to analyze the complex legal and factual issues at hand—thus advancing Congress's explicit policy in promoting tribal self-governance and the development of tribal court jurisprudence. \n\nThis ruling is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence.\n\n"}

The number of Jains in Canada later increased, leading to the establishment of Jain temples in Canada. The type of Jainism in Canada later exhibited several differences from Jainism in India.\n\nThe number of Jains in Canada greatly increased in the 1970s due to the liberalization of Canada's immigration laws. This has allowed for a community of Jain immigrants to become established in Canada, where they have formed a unique spiritual and cultural identity. Most Canadian Jains now live in Ontario, particularly Toronto.\n\nThe first Jain society in the Toronto area was formed in 1974. At that time, there were approximately 150 Jain families in the region. A Jain religious center was first officially established in Toronto in 1988 when the Jain society purchased a Church building and converted it into a temple. The temple served both the Svetambara and Digambar communities, whose theology and religious practice differs in some aspects.\n\nA new temple is in construction in Scarborough, which, once completed in 2016, it will be the largest Jain temple in North America.\n\nCanadian Jainism differs from Jainism in India in part due to the lack of Jain ascetics. In India, ascetics often promote sect loyalty and religious orthodoxy. This difference has promoted a more non-sectarian Jain identity which allows for diversity of beliefs. Some Jains have argued that this leads to a less authentic version of Jainism. Others have applauded the way that Canadian Jainism promotes a more casteless modern interpretation of the religion. In the Gujarati community Jains have become integrated with Hindus, and have often served together on community projects. \n\nMany Canadian Jains actively promote vegetarianism, meditation, and interfaith dialog.\n\n\n"}

JEM's political agenda includes issues such as: radical and comprehensive constitutional reform to grant Sudan's regions a greater share of power in ruling the country (one point of this is a rotating presidency), the replacement of social injustice and political tyranny with justice and equality, and basic services for every Sudanese.\n\nThe beginnings of the Justice and Equality Movement trace to the writers of the \"\", a manuscript published in 2000 that details the structural inequality in the country; the JEM founder, Khalil Ibrahim, was one of the authors. JEM advocates replacing the dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir and the ruling Congress Party with a civil, democratic state that respects the rights of Sudan's various ethnic groups, women, and youth. The JEM further committed itself to these principles when it signed the New Dawn Charter in January 2013.\n\nJEM claim to possesses forces numbering around 35,000 and an ethnically diverse membership. According to critics it is not the \"rainbow of tribes\" it claims to be, as most Jem members, including its leader, are from the Zaghawa tribe. JEM is part of the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), an alliance of groups opposed to the government in Khartoum that include the Sudan Liberation Movement(Abdul Wahed), the Sudan Liberation Movement (Minnawi), and the Sudan Liberation Movement - North.\n\nIn October 2007, the JEM attacked the Defra oilfield in the Kordofan region of Sudan. The Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, a Chinese-led consortium, controls the field. The next month, a group of 135 Chinese engineers arrived in Darfur to work on the Defra field. Ibrahim told reporters, \"We oppose them coming because the Chinese are not interested in human rights. [They are] just interested in Sudan's resources.\" The JEM claims that the revenue from oil sold to China funds the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militia.\n\nOn the morning of December 11, 2007, Khalil Ibrahim claimed that JEM forces fought and defeated Sudanese government troops guarding a Chinese-run oilfield in the Kordofan region. Khartoum officials, however, denied that any oil fields had come under attack. Ibrahim said that the attack was part of a JEM campaign to rid Sudan of Chinese-run oilfields and stated that \"[The JEM] want all Chinese companies to leave. They have been warned many times. They should not be there.\"\n\nIn May 2008, JEM engaged in its most famous operation against the Sudanese government when it attacked the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. JEM's advance recorded many impressive gains which included temporarily controlling the city of Omdurman, the airport at the Wadi Sayedna military base, north of Khartoum, and three bridges leading into the capital. The operation ended with heavy battles in the western part of the Sudanese capital that included the government's use of army helicopters to repel the JEM advance. Following this battle, Eltahir Elfaki, the General Secretary of JEM's legislative council, vowed that the war would henceforth be fought across the country, saying that \"We haven't changed our tactics. From the beginning, Jem is a national movement and it has a national agenda.\" Khalil Ibrahim declared that \"This is just the start of a process and the end is the termination of this regime\".\n\nIn April 2013, JEM and its allies in the Sudan Revolutionary Front engaged in many successful attacks against Sudanese government forces. In a raid coordinated between all the parties of the SRF that included the use of 20 vehicles, the opposition forces briefly held the strategic city of Um Rawaba in North Kordofan, located south of Khartoum. As part of the offensive, JEM and the SRF also gained control of Abu Korshola, a strategic town of 40,000 in South Kordofan. In its bid to retake control, the Sudanese Armed Forces engaged in indiscriminate air raid campaigns. On May 27, the opposition forces withdrew in order to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to the area's residents. Since then, opposition forces continue to engage in offensive operations, leading to dozens of casualties for Sudanese forces around Abu Korshola.\n\n"}
{"id": "4976123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4976123", "title": "Kalachuris of Kalyani", "text": "Kalachuris of Kalyani\n\nThe Kalachuris of Kalyani were a 12th-century Indian dynasty, who ruled over parts of present-day northern Karnataka and Maharashtra. This dynasty rose to power in the Deccan region between 1156 and 1181 CE (25 years).\n\nThe rulers of the dynasty traced their origins to one Krishna, who is said to have conquered Kalinjar and Dahala in present-day Madhya Pradesh (see Kalachuris of Tripuri). Bijjala, a viceroy of the dynasty, is said to have established the authority over Karnataka after wresting power from the Chalukya king Taila III. Bijjala was succeeded by his sons Someshvara and Sangama but after 1181 CE, the Chalukyas gradually retrieved the territory. Their rule was short and turbulent and yet very important from a socio-religious point of view; a new sect known as the Lingayat or Virashaiva sect was founded during these times in a time extent of 25 years.\n\nA unique and purely native form of Kannada literature-poetry called the \"Vachanas\" was also born during this time. The writers of \"Vachanas\" were called \"Vachanakaras\" (poets). Many other important works like Virupaksha Pandita's \"Chennabasavapurana\", Dharani Pandita's \"Bijjalarayacharite\" and Chandrasagara Varni's \"Bijjalarayapurana\" were also written.\n\nThe Kalachuris of Kalyani overthrew the Kalyani Chalukyas in the early part of the \"12th century\", and had a relatively short but stormy rule. The name \"Kalachuri\" is shared by multiple earlier dynasties, two of which ruled in central India. Some historians such as Dr. P.B. Desai believe that the southern Kalachuris of Kalyani are descendants of these central Indian dynasties. In the 6th century, before the rise of the Badami Chalukyas, the Kalachuris of Mahishmati had carved out an extensive empire covering areas of Gujarat, Malwa, Konkan and parts of Maharashtra. However, after their crippling defeat at the hands of Chalukya Mangalesha, they remained in obscurity for a prolonged period of time. Subsequently, the Kalachuris of Tripuri and their branches rose to power in central India.\n\nA 1174 CE record says the Kalyani Kalachuri dynasty was founded by one Soma who grew beard and moustache to save himself from the wrath of Parashurama, and thereafter the family came to be known as \"Kalachuris\", Kalli meaning a long moustache and churi meaning a sharp knife. They migrated to the south and made Magaliveda or Mangalavedhe (Mangalavada) their capital. They titled themselves Kalanjara-puravaradhisvara (\"Lord of Kalanjara\"), which indicates their central Indian origin. Their emblem was Suvarna Vrishabha or the golden bull. They must have started as modest feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. They were also referred to as Katachuris (shape of a sharp knife) and \"Haihaya\" (or \"Heheya\").\n\nThe later records of the dynasty claim that they descended from Brahma, the Creator of the universe.\n\nThe early Kalachuris of the south were Jains and encouraged Jainism in their kingdom. The first notable chief of the Kalachuri family of Karnataka was Uchita. While there were several kings who followed him ruling as feudatories of the Kalyani Chalukyas, it was Jogama who became an influential vassal of Vikramaditya VI, being related to the great Chalukya king by matrimony.\n\nThe Southern Kaluchuri kingdom went into decline after the assassination of Bijjalla. The rulers who followed were weak and incompetent, with the exception of Sovideva, who managed to maintain control over the kingdom. Western Chalukyas ended the Kalachuri Dynasty. Many Kalachuri families migrated to Kanara districts of Karnataka. The Kalachuris are the principal characters in the Andhra epic \"The battle of Palnadu\".\n\n\nAs per the \"1163 CE\" inscription which records a religious offering (mahadana) in the presence of Hampi \"Lord Virupaksha\" by Bijjala the Kalachuri King.\n\nThe Southern Kalachuri kings minted coins with Kannada inscriptions on them.\n\n"}

According to practitioners, it was first brought to the West in the 1930s by Chan Kam Lee and was subsequently popularized by Chee Soo who was the President of the International Taoist Society from 1958 until his death in 1994.\nThe Lee style of t'ai chi ch'uan comprises two forms known as 'the dance' or Tiào wǔ 跳舞, and 'the form'. Other exercises include I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands', Whirling Hands, Whirling Arms, and various qi and Li development exercises.\nLee style t'ai chi is related to Martial Arts training, and there are five distinct areas of development that comprise the whole Art:\n\nAccording to Chee Soo the Lee style is the only true Taoist art and the oldest form of T'ai Chi Ch'uan in existence. It is derived from an original set of eight movements created by Ho-Hsieh Lee from Beijing at the beginning of the Western Zhou dynasty around 1000 BC. His family moved to a fishing village called Weihaiwei on the East coast of China in Shandong Province and settled there and practised a range of Taoist Arts. The techniques were passed on from one generation to the next and kept within the family until the last in their line, Chan Kam Lee, fled the war torn China of the 1930s and emigrated to London to establish a business in the jewel trade. Here he met and adopted a young orphan named Chee Soo, and he passed the techniques on to him as he had no children of his own.\n\nIn 1977 Chee Soo was interviewed by Brian Hayes on LBC radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, and meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee:\n\n\"Chee Soo\": It's rather curious, by a very strange coincidence, probably another Chinese fairy tale really. When I left Doctor Barnardo homes at fourteen years of age I became a page boy in Earl's Court in a nursing home, and I used to go over to Hyde Park and have a kick around on my day off on Sundays, and I happened to be playing with my ball when my ball actually hit the back of the head of a gentleman sitting on a park bench.\n\n\"Interviewer\": Who was doing these gentle movements.\n\n\"Chee Soo\": No he was sitting there, just sitting there very quietly, and I went over to retrieve my ball, and I came up to the front of him to apologise, and I saw he was Chinese, and we got talking and he was an importer/exporter, very much alone he had no family, and I was of course actually an orphan and having no family of my own, and the friendship gradually grew and grew, and till eventually in actual fact after many meetings he invited me to his club in Holborn, Red Lion Square, which he had a little club meeting three or four times a week, and from then on I practised under him almost continuously.\nAccording to a British Movietone News documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey - UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying Wu Shu in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association.\n\nIn 1976 a book about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan written by Chee Soo was published entitled \"The Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan\" which describes the history and philosophy of the style in detail including descriptions of each aspect of the Art with photographs and descriptions of the Lee style T'ai Chi form. Chee Soo wrote several books about the various aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts published by HarperCollins which became best-sellers and were subsequently licensed by HarperCollins to other major international publishers and translated into various languages including French (distributed in Canada, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal), German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Polish, and Indonesian.\n\nAccording to an interview with Marilyn Soo - Chee Soo's widow and the President of the International Taoist Society - Chee Soo moved to Coventry in the 1980s and trained a group of teachers to continue his work teaching the Lee style Taoist Arts.\n\nSince his death in August 1994 there are now several schools teaching the Lee style T'ai Chi based in the British Isles each of which emphasise different aspects of the Lee style Taoist Arts.\n\nThe emblem of the Lee family is the Seahorse which represents Yin within Yang as it is the only creature where the male incubates and gives birth to the offspring.\n\nChee Soo's T'ai Chi classes invariably included Qigong or energy cultivation, and Tao Yin or breathing exercises. The Lee style qigong exercises are called K'ai Men (开门) or 'Open Door'. Chee Soo wrote a book published by HarperCollins in 1983 under the title \"Chinese Yoga\" (later re-titled \"Taoist Yoga\"), which was devoted entirely to this aspect of the Arts. This book contains details of Taoist alchemy energy cultivation methods involving deep breathing into the dantian or \"Golden Stove\" or \"Lower Cauldron\" in order to stimulate the flow of Chi or internal energy, circulating it through various energy centres located along the meridians and vessels which are usually associated with acupuncture and known as the Microcosmic orbit. Various types of breathing exercises are described and categorized in terms of Yin and Yang breathing and recommendations are given in terms of regulating the body in accordance with the peak of energy flowing through each organ and its corresponding line of meridian depending on the time of day and season of the year. There are also various recommendations for constant good health regarding the Chang Ming diet or Chinese food therapy based on the underlying principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. \nAn important aspect of this style of qigong is that it not only deals with qi or internal energy but also teaches the practitioner to supplement their personal store of ch'i with energy drawn from the energy field of the Universe itself which Chee Soo called external energy or 'Ching Sheng Li' (jīng shēng lì 精生力).\n\nThe Lee style includes a number of \"forms\" comprising set sequences of movements. These movements are based upon fourteen basic stances which are named after animal movements. These stances are also grouped into sequences with names like \"Drive the Tiger Away\" and \"The Fair Lady Weaving\". The movements can be performed at various speeds and may be timed with breathing. There are two forms known as the T'ai Chi Dance or which Chee Soo referred to as Tiàowǔ 跳舞 and he said was about 400 years old, and the T'ai Chi form itself known as 'The Form'. The etymology of the Chinese ideogram Wu 舞 suggests that the Lee style T'ai Chi dance may have its origins in Wu shamanism. The dance is 185 stances or steps long whereas the form is 140 stances split into 42 sequences.\n\nThe Lee style also includes various interactive exercises, the most important of which is called I Fu Shou or 'sticky hands'; similar to the pushing hands exercises that are seen in other T'ai Chi styles. Two people stand opposite each other making contact on the back of the wrist and move in circles gently testing each other's balance. The emphasis is on sensitivity and yielding to force.\n\nI Fu Shou is an exercise in which two people participate. Each person tries to upset the balance of the other whilst maintaining their own stability. Contact is through the arms and hands throughout the exercise. No matter what stance is adopted, there may always be a weakness in the balance of the body whether one moves left or right, backward or forward, upward or downward, and it is by taking advantage of these six directional weaknesses that the participants in I Fu Shou try to ‘uproot’ each other - to cause the other to lose their footing. The most difficult way to do this is to lift the other off the ground, but even this may be achieved provided that one has practiced diligently and developed a faultless technique.\n\nA full description is available to read online on Chee Soo's publisher's website.\n\nWhirling Arms and Whirling Hands are the two exercises in the Lee style of T'ai Chi Ch'uan which are used to teach basic principles of self-defence.\n\nLike I fou shou, Whirling Arms (Lun Pei) and Whirling Hands (Lun Shou) encourage the development of quick mental and physical reactions and a high level of sensitivity. Both are characterized, as their names suggest, by circular movements of the arms and hands.\nThe two arts include techniques to ward off, parry and deflect thrusts which may be made towards your body, and with constant practise you can develop the ability to recognize your partner's intentions before they are carried out. You will learn how to feel and exploit the weaknesses in their movements and postures, and in so doing you will come to understand your own weaknesses and develop greater concentration and awareness. You will build the foundations for a stronger balance, learn how to synchronize your body movements, and become much more sensitive and perceptive. In addition to all these, the control and utilization of your Ch'i energy plays a very big part in your practise.\n\nT’ai Chi Sword \nAccording to Master Chee Soo in his book about the Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan:\n\nT'ai Chi sword makes full use of the combined techniques of Whirling Hands and Whirling Arms, but these are made more difficult by the weight and length of the sword. Greater mental concentration is required to retain complete control of the arms, wrists and hands, while maintaining perfect balance, especially in a few sequences where the body makes a complete whirl to demonstrate the 'order of the universe'...the 'Sword' form, which comprises 216 movements, has no straight lines\nT'ai Chi stick \nLee style T'ai Chi stick comprises a form of 270 movements. The T'ai Chi stick is a staff approximately six feet long.\n\nChee Soo wrote six books about the Lee Style Taoist Arts\n\n"}

It was the principal city of the vast plain of undivided Punjab for many centuries, and was also the capital of the Sikh empire of Maharaja Ranjit Singh until the mid-1850s. It is today the capital of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan.\n\nBefore the partition of India in 1947, Lahore was a cosmopolitan city with Hindu, Sikh and Jain residents. In 1941, 64.5% of the population of Lahore was Muslim and about 36% was Hindu or Sikh. At that time, the city contained numerous, almost countless temples, gurudwaras and other non-Muslim centers of worship. In the seven decades thereafter, nearly all non-Muslim places of worship have been demolished or usurped, and it is an astonishing, unbelievable fact that there are, as of 2017, no more than two functional Hindu temples in the city. This is in striking contrast to any small or large city in India, across the same border of partition; every single mosque in Amritsar or Delhi has been maintained and new ones have been built regularly for the benefit of the thriving and ever-increasing population of Indian Muslims.\n\nOnly Krishna mandir and Valmiki mandir are two functional Hindu temples in Lahore.\n"}

It is second in sales after \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" and third in readership after \"Israel HaYom\" and \"Yedioth Ahronoth\". \n\nFrom Sunday to Thursday the newspaper is printed under the \"Ma'ariv Hashavu'a\" () brand, while the weekend edition that is out on Friday is printed under the \"Ma'ariv SofHashavu'a\" () brand.\n\nSince May 2014, \"Maariv\"s co-editors in chief are Doron Cohen and Golan Bar-Yosef. Apart from the daily newspaper and its supplements, \"Maariv\" has a chain of local newspapers with a national scale distribution and magazines division.\n\n\"Maariv\" was founded in 1948 by former \"Yediot Aharonot\" journalists led by Dr. Ezriel Carlebach, who became Maariv's first editor-in-chief. It was the most widely read newspaper in Israel in its first twenty years.\n\nFor many years, the Nimrodi family held a controlling stake in \"Maariv\", and Yaakov Nimrodi served as its chairman. In March 2010, Zaki Rakib bought a 50% share from Israel Land Development Company and Ofer Nimrodi, bringing new energy and a much needed cash infusion to the newspaper, which had been losing millions of NIS a year since 2004. Rakib became the new chairman. \n\nHowever, it was announced in March 2011 that Nochi Dankner was to take control of \"Maariv\" through his Discount Investment. On 25 March, Discount transferred 20 million NIS to the struggling firm. On 11 September, \"Maariv\"s chairman Dani Yakobi issued a statement saying that he would sell the newspaper's printing equipment to be able to pay September salaries. On 7 September, Globes announced that Dankner had reached an agreement with Shlomo Ben-Zvi, publisher of \"Makor Rishon\", to buy out the newspaper. However, the deal faltered, and Dankner turned to the court on 23 September for a stay of proceedings' process. The court appointed a trustee, Shlomo Nass, who ran the newspaper and searched for a buyer. During the following weeks the workers waged a campaign against IDB and Dankner, demanding he honor his obligations to them and pay their salaries, pensions and severance packages in full.\nIn early November the trustee sold the newspaper to Ben Zvi without the debts or the workers. Ben Zvi kept a fraction of the journalists and commenced a partial convergence process between \"Maariv\" and \"Makor Rishon\" under his company, Makor Rishon Hatzofe Hameuchad.\n\nAs of January 2013, the company Maariv Modiin Ltd. no longer operates \"Maariv\", and until its scheduled closure it will be operated by the court appointed trustee.\n\nIn March 2014, after a long struggle to stabilize the company, Ben Zvi turned to the municipal Jerusalem court for a stay of proceedings' process. \"Maariv\" closed most of its departments and published only a thin version, until the court appointed trustee could find a new owner. In May 2014 the brand was purchased by Eli Azur, who has holdings in a number of media outlets in Israel, including \"The Jerusalem Post\", \"Sport1\", \"Israel Post\" and 103FM radio station. A few days after the deal was approved, Azur relaunched the daily newspaper as \"Maariv-Hashavua\", and a weekend edition called \"Maariv-Sofhashavua\", which is an amalgamation of \"Maariv\" and the group's weekend magazine \"Sofhashavua\".\n\n\"Maariv\" is associated with Israel's political center and has been critical of Benjamin Netanyahu's center-right government.\n\nMoshe Arens, in a \"Haaretz\" opinion piece penned in 2012, wrote that the owner of \"Maariv\" had resolved a few years earlier to steer the newspaper leftward, \"forsaking the right-wing readership that was loyal to it for years\".\n\nIn a TGI survey for the first half of 2012, \"Maariv\"s market share was 11.9 percent. Until 2013 \"Maariv\" owned a printing house, which was sold to the newspaper Yisrael Hayom to cover the newspaper's big debts. Since then \"Maariv\" has outsourced the printing operations to other printing houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1403568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1403568", "title": "Orphism (religion)", "text": "Orphism (religion)\n\nOrphism (more rarely Orphicism; ) is the name given to a set of religious beliefs and practices originating in the ancient Greek and Hellenistic world, as well as from the Thracians, associated with literature ascribed to the mythical poet Orpheus, who descended into the Greek underworld and returned. Orphics also revered Persephone (who annually descended into the Underworld for a season and then returned) and Dionysus or Bacchus (who also descended into the Underworld and returned). Orpheus was said to have invented the Mysteries of Dionysus. Poetry containing distinctly Orphic beliefs has been traced back to the 6th century BC or at least 5th century BC, and graffiti of the 5th century BC apparently refers to \"Orphics\".\n\nClassical sources, such as Plato, refer to \"Orpheus-initiators\" (), and associated rites, although how far \"Orphic\" literature in general related to these rites is not certain. As in the Eleusinian mysteries, initiation into Orphic mysteries promised advantages in the afterlife.\n\nThe Orphic theogonies are genealogical works similar to the Theogony of Hesiod, but the details are different. The theogonies are symbolically similar to Near Eastern models. The main story has it that Dionysus (in his incarnation as Zagreus) is the son of Zeus and Persephone; Zeus gives his inheritance of the throne to the child, as Zeus is to leave due to Hera's anger over a child being born by another mother; the Titans are enraged over the proclamation of attendance and, at Hera's instigation, decide to murder the child. Dionysus is then tricked with a mirror and children's toys by the Titans, who murder and consume him. Athena saves the heart and tells Zeus of the crime, who in turn hurls a thunderbolt on the Titans. The resulting soot, from which sinful mankind is born, contains the bodies of the Titans and Dionysus. The soul of man (the Dionysus part) is therefore divine, but the body (the Titan part) holds the soul in bondage. Thus, it was declared that the soul returns to a host ten times, bound to the wheel of rebirth.\n\nThere are two Orphic stories of the rebirth of Dionysus: in one it is the heart of Dionysus that is implanted into the thigh of Zeus; in the other Zeus has impregnated the mortal woman Semele, resulting in Dionysus's literal rebirth. Many of these details differ from accounts in the classical authors. Firmicus Maternus, a Christian author, gives a different account with the book \"On the Error of Profane Religions\". He says that Jupiter (Zeus) originally was a (mortal) king of Crete—a concept of Euhemerus—and Dionysos was his son. Dionysos was murdered, and then cannibalized. Only his heart was salvaged by Athena. A statue of gypsum (the same substance the Titans used to disguise themselves) was then made to look like Dionysos, and the heart placed within.\n\nThe Orphic theogonies include:\n\nSurviving written fragments show a number of beliefs about the afterlife similar to those in the \"Orphic\" mythology about Dionysus' death and resurrection. Bone tablets found in Olbia (5th century BC) carry short and enigmatic inscriptions like: \"Life. Death. Life. Truth. Dio(nysus). Orphics.\" The function of these bone tablets is unknown.\n\nGold-leaf tablets found in graves from Thurii, Hipponium, Thessaly and Crete (4th century BC and after) give instructions to the dead. Although these thin tablets are often highly fragmentary, collectively they present a shared scenario of the passage into the afterlife. When the deceased arrives in the underworld, he is expected to confront obstacles. He must take care not to drink of Lethe (\"Forgetfulness\"), but of the pool of Mnemosyne (\"Memory\"). He is provided with formulaic expressions with which to present himself to the guardians of the afterlife.\n\nI am a son of Earth and starry sky. I am parched with thirst and am dying; but quickly grant me cold water from the Lake of Memory to drink.\n\nOther gold leaves offer instructions for addressing the rulers of the underworld:\nNow you have died and now you have come into being, O thrice happy one, on this same day. Tell Persephone that the Bacchic One himself released you.\n\nOrphic views and practices have parallels to elements of Pythagoreanism. There is, however, too little evidence to determine the extent to which one movement may have influenced the other. In the fifteenth century, the Neoplatonic Greek scholar Constantine Lascaris (who found the poem Argonautica Orphica ) considered a Pythagorean Orpheus.\nThe book \"The works of Aristotle\" (1908, p. 80 \"Fragments\") mentioned\n\nBertrand Russell (1947) noted\n\nBertrand Russell (1947) pointed out about Socrates\n\nThe main elements of Orphism differed from popular ancient Greek religion in three ways: by characterizing human souls as divine and immortal but doomed to live (for a period) in a \"grievous circle\" of successive bodily lives through metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls; by prescribing an ascetic way of life which, together with secret initiation rites, was supposed to guarantee not only eventual release from the \"grievous circle\" but also communion with god(s); and by being founded upon sacred writings about the origin of gods and human beings.\n\nDistinctively Orphic views and practices are attested as early as Herodotus, Euripides, and Plato. The recently published Derveni papyrus allows Orphic mythology to be dated to the end of the 5th century BC, and it is probably even older. Other inscriptions found in various parts of the Greek world testify to the early existence of a movement with the same core beliefs that were later associated with the name of Orphism.\n\n\n\n"}

The site is a center for the Jain religion. This is an atishaya kshetra (\"miraculous holy place\"), with 108 shrines.\n\nPoporaji is more than eight hundred years old. The site has two basements; one of them has three idols. The idol of Bhagwan Adinath is made of shining black stone and is two feet and eight inches in height. Idols inside are also in same color and stone. Two of the three Adinath idols were installed in V.S. 1202 (AD 1145) according to the inscriptions on them and are oldest at this Kshetra.\n\nIn 1783, the ruler of Orchha Vikramajit (1776–1817) shifted his capital from Orchha to Tehri and renamed it Tikamgarh, which is in the vicinity of Papora. An inscription of Vikrama 1840 (AD 1784) suggests that the site then had emerged as a tirtha. Motilal Varni (an associate of Ganesh Varni), had established a religious school which has produced several distinguished scholars like Darbari Lal Kothia. He had donated his own collection of handwritten manuscripts to the school.\n\nThe oldest temples mainly from 18th and 19th century, are in the part termed Prachina Samucchaya, which includes two underground chambers (bhoyras) from the 12th century. In 1860 AD, a unique cluster of 24 temples was constructed. At the same time the chariot-shaped temple that serves as the grand entrance gate was constructed. A number of temples were constructed in 1965. Many temples have notable old and modern wall paintings. Temple construction has gradually continues, with a circular Bahubali temple being among the recent ones.\n\nPrayers and worship take place in the temple basement and in Chandraprabhu Mandir, with an idol dated samvat 1524 that is regarded to be helpful in materializing the desires of pilgrims. The temple of Lord Parshvanath contains a unique image of Padmavati devi. \n\nIn addition to the 108 temples, there exists a school and a library founded by Motilal Varni, an Udasina Ashrama and a hostel for the students. Four dharmashalas, a rest house and a dining hall is also in the tirth kshetra compound.\n\nAtishaya – (i) Here exists an ancient little pond. It is said that when pilgrims dropped a paper listing of required utensils in this pond, the utensils were received from the pond and used by the pilgrims. After use and cleaning, these utensils were returned to the pond and utensils thus disappeared back into the water. This miracle is not seen nowadays because one person did not return the utensils received from the pond.\n\nHere is a well known as ‘Patrakhan Well’. It is said that an old woman organized a party on the completion of a big temple (Temple No.-1) in samvat 1872. Suddenly the water of the well was finished and lack of water for guests was felt. Then that old women entered the well and reached the bottom. Then as she started her heartfelt prayers, water began flowing in the well and as the old woman was lifted from the well, the level of water also increased simultaneously. Thus the honor of that old sacred woman was kept. This well still exists near the mess of school here.\n\nThe administration and day-to-day activities of Paporaji are controlled by the Shri Digamber Jain Atishay Kshetra Paporaji Prabhandhkarini Committee. The committee is renewed every five years by general election. \n\n"}

The division of a religious institute into provinces is generally along geographical lines, and may consist of one or more countries, or of only a part of a country. There may be, however, one or more houses of one province situated within the physical territory of another since the jurisdiction over the individual religious is personal rather than territorial. The title of the office is often abbreviated to Provincial.\n\nAmong the friars and Third Order Religious Sisters of the Augustinian, Carmelite and Dominican orders, the title or Prioress Provincial is generally used. The Friars Minor, in contrast, use the title in line with their emphasis on living as brothers to one another.\n\nThe old orders had no provincial superiors; even when the monasteries were united to form congregations, the arch-abbot of each congregation was in the position of a superior general whose powers were limited to particular cases, almost like the powers of a metropolitan archbishop over the dioceses of his suffragans. Provincial superiors are found in the institutes of more recent formation, which began with the mendicant orders. The Holy See hesitated for a long time before allowing the division of congregations with simple vows, especially congregations of women, into different provinces as a regular institution, and some congregations have no such division. \n\nThe Provincial Superior is ordinarily elected by the Provincial Chapter, subject to confirmation by the Superior General or the General Chapter, depending on the regulations of the particular groups (in the Society of Jesus he is directly appointed by the Father General). The \"Regulations\" (Normae) of 18 June 1901, vest the appointment of the provincial in the general council. The provincial superior is never elected for life, but ordinarily for three or six years. In religious orders with clerics, he is a regular prelate, and has the rank of ordinary with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In religious institutes whether of men or of women, he or she appoints the regular confessors, calls together the Provincial Chapter, presides over its deliberations, and takes care that the orders of the General Chapter and the Superior General are properly carried out. He or she is an \"ex officio\" member of the chapter. His or her principal duty is to make regular visitations of the houses of the province in the name of the General and to report to the latter on all the religious and the property of the order; authority over the various houses and local superiors differs in different orders. He or she has, in many cases, the right of appointment to the less important offices. For institutes of men, at the end of his\nterm of office, the provincial is bound, according to the Constitution \"Nuper\" of Innocent XII (23 December 1697), to prove that he has complied with all the precepts of that decree concerning Masses; if he fails to do so, he loses his right to be elected and to vote in the general chapter.\n\nA unique case was eastern Paraguay, where the Spanish colonial authorities allowed the Jesuit missionaries to establish both the Catholic faith and a unique, humane regime for the local Guarani Indian tribes, making their provincial superior the governor of the first autonomous Indian reserve, known as the (Jesuit) Misiones or Reducciones, till 1667, ten years after a Guarani rebellion against increased abuse by the regular colonial authorities: the territory lost its status and was divided up between Spain (then under the viceroyalty of la Plata, previously part of Upper Peru) and Portugal (Brazil)\n\n"}

Some groups, such as the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, from a non-sectarian or non-religious view, suggest that the rosy cross predates Christianity, where \"the cross represents the human body and the rose represents the individual's unfolding consciousness.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the rose represents silence while the cross signifies \"salvation, to which the Society of the Rose-Cross devoted itself by teaching mankind the love of God and the beauty of brotherhood, with all that they implied.\" Others saw the Rosy Cross as a symbol of the human process of reproduction elevated to the spiritual: \"The fundamental symbols of the Rosicrucians were the rose and the cross; the rose female and the cross male, both universal phallic [...] As generation is the key to material existence, it is natural that the Rosicrucians should adopt as its characteristic symbols those exemplifying the reproductive processes. As regeneration is the key to spiritual existence, they therefore founded their symbolism upon the rose and the cross, which typify the redemption of man through the union of his lower temporal nature with his higher eternal nature.\" \n\nIt is further a symbol of the Philosopher's Stone, the ultimate product of the alchemist.\n\nThe Rosicrucian Fellowship and kindred groups of rosicrucianists, promulgating an Esoteric Christian viewpoint, hold that the Rosicrucian Brotherhood was founded in the early 14th century, or between the 13th and 14th centuries, as an Invisible College of mystic sages, by a highly evolved entity having the symbolic name of Christian Rosenkreuz in order \"to prepare a new phase of the Christian religion to be used during the coming age now at hand, for as the world and man evolve so also must religion change\".\n\nParacelsus, who was called the \"Luther of Medicine\", describes these mystics sages as \"persons who have been exalted (verzueckt) to God, and who have remained in that state of exaltation, and have not died (...) nobody knew what became of them, and yet they remained on the earth\". Modern Rosicrucian groups and some researchers suggest that there is much evidence that the Rosicrucian Order not only has made herself known in the early 17th century through the Rosicrucian Manifestos, but has been active since the beginning of the Renaissance period, not only as an hermetic Order, but also through forerunners – geniuses of the western world, sometimes also known to be Freemasons – in the literary, cultural, ethical, political, religious and scientific fields.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Karl von Eckartshausen, a German Christian mystic, describes the true Adepts of the Rose Cross in the following terms: \"These sages, whose number is small, are children of light, and are opposed to darkness. They dislike mystification and secrecy; they are open and frank, have nothing to do with secret societies and with external ceremonies. They possess a spiritual temple, in which God is presiding\". Later, in the early 20th century, Max Heindel, a Rosicrucian Initiate, emphasizes that the roots of the Brothers of the Rose Cross, immersed in the western mystery tradition, are almost impossible to be traced as \"theirs is a work which aims to encourage the evolution of humanity, they have labored far back into antiquity--under one guise or another\".\n\nConnections between Free Masonry and Rose Cross exist from times preceding the formation of actual Grand Lodge (Landmarks of Andersen in 1717), as it is proved by the poem Threnodie of Henry Adamson (1638) \"We are brethren of the Rosie Crossie, We have the Mason Word and second sight\" \n\nThomas De Quincey in his work titled; \"Rosicrucians and Freemasonry\", suggest that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism.\n\nMore recently, the Rosy Cross is also a symbol found in some Masonic Christian bodies and employed by individuals and groups formed during the last centuries for the study of Rosicrucianism and allied subjects, but derived from the adoption of a red rose.\n\nWithin the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite concordant body of Freemasonry, the Eighteenth Degree is specifically concerned with the rose cross and confers the title of \"Knight Rose Croix\". Of one version of the degree, Albert Pike wrote in 1871,\n\nHe goes on to give an explanation of what he believes to be the symbolism of the Rose Cross in that degree:\n\nThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn made use of the rosy cross as well, including 'The Ritual of the Rose Cross,\" designed for spiritual protection and as preparation for meditation. Based on the Rosicrucian symbolism of the Red Rose and the Cross of Gold, it is also a key symbol of the Golden Dawn's Second Order. According to Regardie, the Golden Dawn rosy cross contains attributes for the Elements, Planets, Zodiac, Hebrew alphabet, alchemical principles, the hexagram and pentagram, the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, and the formula of INRI. On the back side of the rosy cross is inscribed the motto of the Zelator Adeptus Minor at the bottom, \"The master Jesus Christ, God and Man\" between four Maltese crosses, and in the center, written in Latin, \"Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol Signum.\"\n\nRegardie says of the rosy cross in \"The Golden Dawn\":\n\nThis lamen is a complete synthesis of the masculine, positive, or rainbow scale of color attributions, which is also called the Scale of the King. The four arms of the cross belong to the four elements and are colored accordingly. The white portion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the planets.\n\nThe petals of the rose refer to the twenty-two paths on the Tree of Life and the Twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It is the cross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the center of the forces of the Sephiroth and the paths. The extreme center of the rose is white, the reflected spiritual brightness of Kether, bearing upon it the Red Rose of Five Petals and the Golden Cross of Six Squares; four green rays issue from around the angles of the cross. Upon the white portion of the lamen, below the rose, is placed the hexagram, with the planets.\n\nAround the pentagrams, which are placed one upon each elemental colored arm, are drawn the symbols of the spirit and the four elements. Upon each of the floriated (the arms) of the cross are arranged the three alchemical principles of sulfur, salt, and mercury. The white rays issuing from behind the rose at the inner angles between the arms of the cross are the rays of the divine light issuing and coruscating from the reflected light of Kether in its center; and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the Key Word - I.N.R.I.\n\nThe symbol of the rosy cross played a substantial role within the system of Thelema as developed by Aleister Crowley. In a cosmological context, the rose is Nuit, the infinitely expanded goddess of the night sky, and the cross is Hadit, the ultimately contracted atomic point. For Crowley, it was the job of the adept to identify with the appropriate symbol so to experience the mystical conjunction of opposites, which leads to attainment. In this sense, the rose cross is a grand symbol of the Great Work:\n\nCrowley also makes clear that this process is reflected in the sexual act as well:\n\nThe rosy cross is further symbolic of the grade of Adeptus Minor in the A∴A∴, the Qabalistic sphere of Tiphareth on the Tree of Life, the magical formula INRI, and the concepts of Light (LVX) and Life.\n\nThe rose cross also has a place in the system of Ordo Templi Orientis. It is associated with the Fifth Degree, the title of which is \"Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix, and Knight of the Pelican and Eagle.\" Of it, Crowley writes in \"An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order\":\n\nThe Fellowship of the Rosy Cross was a Christian mystical organization established by Arthur Edward Waite in England in 1915. It developed out of the breakdown of Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn. It was based on Waite's complicated ideas and its rites reflected his interest in the history of the Rosicrucian Order, Freemasonry, and Christian mystical teachings through the ages. Most of its members were Freemasons or theosophists. One of its most noted members was the novelist Charles Williams who was a member from 1917 to at least 1928 and possibly later. There were plans to establish a branch in the United States but they appear never to have been fulfilled. The order ended with Waite's death in 1942. Arthur Edward Waite wrote also a book entitled \"The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross\", which presents the brotherhood as a Christian order dating from the Middle Ages.\n\nOne modern form of the \"Rosie Cross\" is found in a Rosicrucian Christian symbol that places a crown of red roses ennobling a white rose at the centre of the cross; radiating behind is the golden five-pointed star, an allusion also to 'the Five Points of Fellowship'. It is the symbol of the fraternity that has prepared a great lodge for the Brethren to be gathered.\n\nAnother version used by the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis suggests that \"together, the rose and cross represent the experiences and challenges of a thoughtful life well-lived.\"\n"}

{"id": "48936829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48936829", "title": "Shinto wedding", "text": "Shinto wedding\n\nShinto weddings, , began in Japan during the early 20th century, popularized after the marriage of Crown Prince Yoshihito and his bride, Princess Kujo Sadako. The ceremony relies heavily on Shinto themes of purification, and involves ceremonial sake drinking of three cups three times, the \"nan-nan-san-ku-do\". Shinto weddings are in decline. Fewer Japanese people get married, and those who do often choose Western-style chapel ceremonies.\n\nA Shinto wedding ceremony is typically a small affair, limited to family, while a reception is open to a larger group of friends.\n\n\"Shinzen kekkon\", literally \"wedding before the kami,\" is a Shinto purification ritual that incorporates the exchange of sake between the couple before they are married. The ceremony typically takes 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nFood items, including salt, water, rice, sake, fruit, and vegetables, are left at a ceremonial wedding altar, which also holds the wedding rings.\n\nA Shinto priest stands to the right of the altar, while a shrine maiden, \"Miko\", stands to the left. The couple will often stand in the center of the room, while closest family members stand behind tables containing sake and small fruits.\n\nThe priest will purify the shrine and call the attention of benevolent spirits, or \"kami\". Then, the priest announces the beginning of the \"san-san-ku-do\" ceremony, or \"three-three-nine-times,\" reflecting three oaths taken three times, represented by three cups, poured three times, and swallowed in three sips. This often includes three pourings from three cups of increasing sizes. The first, smallest cup, is first poured to the groom, who drinks from it before offering it to the bride. The second pouring goes first to the bride, then to the groom. The final pouring goes from the groom first, then the bride (essentially repeating the first pour).\n\nThe sake aspect of the ceremony is said to be the core of a Shinto wedding. The ritual may have originated at samurai weddings, though the symbolism of the action and numbers has no clear origin. Some see the ritual as representative of sharing joys and sorrows as a married couple, others suggest that \"san-san\" is a homonym for \"birth after birth,\" suggesting fertility symbolism. Still others suggest it represents man, woman, and child, or heaven, earth and man.\n\nThe couple approaches the altar, where the groom reads his vows while the bride listens. Reflecting a history of arranged marriage in Japan, a \"nakodo\", or \"matchmaker,\" will be thanked in the vows. If no matchmaker exists, a friend or family member will be appointed to fill the role, serving a role similar to the \"best man\" or \"bridesmaid.\" Then, the families join in with the drinking of sake and a traditional cheer of \"kampai.\"\n\nIn the final portion of the ceremony, the priest offers Japanese evergreen to the altar, said to reflect gratitude to the spirits who blessed the union. The bride and groom follow with their own offering, then a representative from each family (often the fathers of the bride and groom). The rings are then presented.\n\nWithin wedding prayers, the gods Izanagi and Izanami are often invoked. These married gods were part of the Japanese lore of the \"first wedding,\" and are called upon to reflect a harmonious balance within the marriage. Other aspects of the Shinto wedding prayer include calling for the couple to work to maintain a respectful home, and for the couple to have children.\n\nShinto brides and grooms typically wear a kimono. The bride wears a traditional kimono, oftentimes combined with a wig. There is also a paper hat, a tsuno-kakushi, or \"horn hider,\" meant to conceal the \"horns\" of jealous demons. Typical colors for this kimono include red and white, colors of Shinto purity.\n\nThe Shinto wedding is a modern invention. The first mention of a wedding in a Shinto manual was in 1872; weddings are not reported until the 1880s. These weddings were limited to the families of Shinto priests. Earlier Shinto weddings were a family gathering without religious significance, aside from the occasional appearance of female dancers, \"katsurame\", said to protect the bride from demons.\n\nScholars suggest that the adoption of religious wedding ceremonies was driven by the decline of state-sponsored Shinto shrines during the 1880s. A rash of new ceremonies emerged in this period, including visits for newborns and on certain birthdays.\n\nPrince Yoshihito married Kujo Sadako in a Shinto ceremony at the Imperial Palace in 1900, one of the first ceremonies of its kind. The wedding reflected a change in Meiji-era thinking about marriage, which had recently legally allowed for marriage to be a balanced partnership between husband and wife.\n\nThe next Shinto wedding ceremony was performed at Tokyo's Hibiya Daijingu shrine in 1901. Later, shrines such as Ueno Shimotani and Tokyo's Izumo Grand Shrine hosted wedding ceremonies. These ceremonies, concentrated in Tokyo, were still limited to elites. Soon, wedding ceremonies were performed in more cities, starting in Osaka and Kyoto, and began to attract the donation of larger dowries.\n\nAfter being stripped of its status as a state religion in 1945, there came a rapid rise in the democratization of Shinto wedding ceremonies, and, in turn, the number of people choosing them. This also reflected a mass movement of families into cities and smaller homes, which made it more difficult to host domestic ceremonies.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of the commercial wedding industry, which grew out of collaboratives that lent large venues for wedding ceremonies.\n\nJapanese Shinto weddings are overseen by priests, but often take place in hotels or in special venues designed to accommodate weddings. As Japan's marriage rate declines, fewer Shinto weddings are being performed; the number has dropped from 90% of ceremonies to 50% since the 1990s. Japanese weddings more often reflect a Christian wedding ceremony, regardless of the personal faith of the married couple.\n\nIn 1999, two gay men were married in a Shinto ceremony at Kanamara Shrine in Kawasaki, but gay weddings have not been widespread in Shinto shrines, and the position of the Association of Shinto Shrines on gay weddings is vague.\n\n"}

{"id": "3185267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3185267", "title": "The Bible Unearthed", "text": "The Bible Unearthed\n\nThe Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, a book published in 2001, discusses the archaeology of Israel and its relationship to the origins and content of the Hebrew Bible. The authors are Israel Finkelstein, Professor of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University, and Neil Asher Silberman, an archaeologist, historian and contributing editor to \"Archaeology Magazine\".\n\nThe methodology applied by the authors is historical criticism with an emphasis on archaeology. Writing in the website of \"The Bible and Interpretation\", the authors describe their approach as one \"in which the Bible is one of the most important artifacts and cultural achievements [but] not the unquestioned narrative framework into which every archaeological find must be fit.\" Their main contention is that:\nOn the basis of this evidence they propose\nAs noted by a reviewer on Salon.com the approach and conclusions of \"The Bible Unearthed\" are not particularly new. Ze'ev Herzog, professor of archaeology at Tel Aviv University, wrote a cover story for \"Haaretz\" in 1999 in which he reached similar conclusions following the same methodology; Herzog noted also that some of these findings have been accepted by the majority of biblical scholars and archaeologists for years and even decades, even though they have only recently begun to make a dent in the awareness of the general public.\n\nEarly biblical archaeology was conducted with the presumption that the Bible must be true, finds only being considered as illustrations for the biblical narrative, and interpreting evidence to fit the Bible. Some archaeologists such as Eilat Mazar continue to take this \"Bible and spade\" approach, or, like the journal \"Bible and Spade\", attempt to treat archaeology as a tool for proving the Bible's accuracy, but since the 1970s most archaeologists, such as prominent Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, have begun instead to interpret the evidence only in the light of other archaeology, treating the Bible as an artifact to be examined, rather than as an unquestioned truth. This approach has led to results both in favor and against the historicity of the old Testament.\n\n\"The Bible Unearthed\" begins by considering what it terms the 'preamble' of the Bible—the Book of Genesis—and its relationship to archaeological evidence for the context in which its narratives are set. Archaeological discoveries about society and culture in the ancient Near East lead the authors to point out a number of anachronisms, suggestive that the narratives were actually set down in the 9th–7th centuries: \n\nThe book comments that this corresponds with the documentary hypothesis, in which textual scholarship argues for the majority of the first five biblical books being written between the 8th and 6th centuries. Although archaeological results, and Assyrian records, suggest that the Kingdom of Israel was the greater of the two, it is the Kingdom of Judah which is afforded greater prominence by \"Genesis\", whose narratives concentrate on Abraham, Jerusalem, Judah (the patriarch), and Hebron, more than on characters and places from the northern kingdom (Israel); \"the Bible Unearthed\" explains this pre-eminence of Yahwist text as an attempt to seize the opportunity, afforded by the destruction of Israel in 720 BCE, to portray the Israelites as a single people, with Judah having (always) had primacy.\n\nThe book remarks that, despite modern archaeological investigations and the meticulous ancient Egyptian records from the period of Ramesses II, there is an obvious lack of any archaeological evidence for the migration of a band of semitic people across the Sinai Peninsula, except for the Hyksos. Although the Hyksos are in some ways a good match, their main centre being at Avaris (later renamed 'Pi-Ramesses'), in the heart of the region corresponding to the 'land of Goshen', and Manetho later writing that the Hyksos eventually founded the Temple in Jerusalem, it throws up other problems, as the Hyksos became not slaves but rulers, and they were chased away rather than chased to bring them back. Nevertheless, the book posits that the exodus narrative perhaps evolved from vague memories of the Hyksos expulsion, spun to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt.\n\nFinkelstein and Silberman argue that instead of the Israelites conquering Canaan after the Exodus (as suggested by the book of Joshua), most of them had in fact always been there; the Israelites were simply Canaanites who developed into a distinct culture. Recent surveys of long-term settlement patterns in the Israelite heartlands show no sign of violent invasion or even peaceful infiltration, but rather a sudden demographic transformation about 1200 BCE in which villages appear in the previously unpopulated highlands; these settlements have a similar appearance to modern Bedouin camps, suggesting that the inhabitants were once pastoral nomads, driven to take up farming by the Late Bronze Age collapse of the Canaanite city-culture.\n\nThe authors take issue with the book of Joshua's depiction of the Israelites conquering Canaan in only a few years—far less than the lifetime of one individual—in which cities such as Hazor, Ai, and Jericho, are destroyed. Finkelstein and Silberman view this account as the result of the telescoping effect of the vagaries of folk memory about destruction caused by other events; modern archaeological examination of these cities shows that their destruction spanned a period of many centuries, with Hazor being destroyed 100 to 300 years after Jericho, while Ai (whose name actually means 'the ruin') was completely abandoned for roughly a millennium \"before the collapse of Late Bronze Canaan. ... Like Jericho, there was no settlement at the time of its supposed conquest by the children of Israel.\"\n\nAlthough the book of Samuel, and initial parts of the books of Kings, portray Saul, David and Solomon ruling in succession over a powerful and cosmopolitan united kingdom of Israel and Judah, Finkelstein and Silberman regard modern archaeological evidence as showing that this may not be true. Archaeology instead shows that in the time of Solomon, the northern kingdom of Israel was quite small, too poor to be able to pay for a vast army, and with too little bureaucracy to be able to administer a kingdom, certainly not an empire; it only emerged later, around the beginning of the 9th century BCE, in the time of Omri. There is little to suggest that Jerusalem, called by the Bible David's capital, was \"perhaps not more than a typical hill country village\" during the time of David and of Solomon, and Judah remained little more than a sparsely populated rural region, until the 8th century BCE. Though the Tel Dan Stele seems to confirm that a \"House of David\" existed, and \"clearly validates the biblical description of a figure named David becoming the founder of the dynasty of Judahite kings in Jerusalem\", it says nothing else about him.\nThere are remains of once grand cities at Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer, with archeological evidence showing that they suffered violent destruction. This destruction once was attributed to the 10th century BCE campaigns by Shishak, these cities therefore being ascribed to David and Solomon as proof of the Bible's account of them, but the destruction layers have since been redated to the late 9th century BCE campaign of Hazael, and the cities to the time of the Omride kings.\n\nThe Tel Dan Stele, the Mesha Stele, the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser, and direct evidence from excavations, together paint a picture of the Omride kings ruling a rich, powerful, and cosmopolitan empire, stretching from Damascus to Moab, and building some of the largest and most beautiful constructions of Iron Age Israel; by contrast, the Bible only remarks that the Omrides 'married foreign women' (presumably to make alliances) and upheld Canaanite religion, both of which it regards as wicked. \"The Bible Unearthed\" concludes that the biblical writers deliberately invented the empire, power, and wealth, of Saul, David, and Solomon, by appropriating the deeds and achievements of the Omrides, so that they could then denigrate the Omrides and obscure their accomplishments, since these kings held a religious viewpoint that was anathema to the biblical editors.\n\nThe Book of Kings, as it stands today, seems to suggest that the religion of Israel and Judah was primarily monotheistic, with one or two wayward kings (such as the Omrides) who tried to introduce Canaanite polytheism, the people occasionally joining in this 'apostasy' from monotheism, but a close reading and the archaeological record reveals that the opposite was true. Iron Age remains show that in the time of the setting of the Book of Kings, sacrifices continued to be offered at hilltop shrines (which the Bible terms \"high places\"), incense and libations were being offered throughout the land, and clay figurines of deities were still being used in homes everywhere in the land as household gods. Inscriptions from \"the early eighth century site of Kuntillet Ajrud in northeastern Sinai\" as well as \"in a late-monarchic inscription from the Shephelah of Judah\", even seem to refer to \"the goddess Asherah as being the consort of YHWH\".\n\nThe world changed for Judah when the kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians in 720 BCE. Judah was flooded with refugees; the population of Israel had been nine times larger than that of Judah, so many small Judean villages suddenly became cities, archaeology evidencing that the population of Jerusalem itself expanded by about 15-fold, turning it from a small hilltown into a large city. The social and religious struggles, which obviously would occur with such a large influx of population, are not mentioned by the Bible. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the priests of Jerusalem began to promote Yahweh-based monolatry, aligning themselves with king Hezekiah's anti-Assyrian views, perhaps because they believed that Assyrian domination of Israel had caused social injustice, or perhaps because they just wanted to gain economic and/or political control over the newly wealthy countryside; Hezekiah advanced their agenda, banning the worship of deities other than Yahweh, destroying the hilltop shrines, actions which \"The Bible Unearthed\" views as preparation for rebelling against Assyria.\n\nBy 701 BCE, the Assyrians had captured most of Judah, and then they besieged Jerusalem; the Bible's coverage of the events leading up to the siege is sparse, briefly listing only a few refortifications of Jerusalem, giving a passing mention to the Siloam tunnel, and briefly admitting to the loss of most of Judah's cities, but archaeology gives much more detail. For example, the fortifications of Lachish were heavily strengthened by Hezekiah, but it was besieged, fell, and was then burnt to the ground; according to an illustration on the walls of the Assyrian palace at Ninevah, the Assyrians deported the city's population and religious objects before they burnt it.\n\nThe Bible claims that nearly 200,000 men in the army besieging Jerusalem were slaughtered one night by an angel, causing the Assyrian king Sennacherib to relent and return to Assyria; it immediately goes on to state that Sennacherib was killed by his sons, while he was praying to his god, implying that this was shortly after the battle. However, as \"The Bible Unearthed\" points out, this contrasts with the Assyrian record on the Taylor Prism, in which Hezekiah's mercenaries abandoned him, and he only then convinced the Assyrian army to leave by handing over not only vast amounts of money, jewels, and high quality ivory-inlaid furniture, but also his own daughters, harem, and musicians, and making Judah into a tributary state of the Assyrians. Additionally, although Sennacherib was clearly murdered (by person(s) uncertain), it was in 681 BCE; he had lived for over 19 years beyond the end of the siege, conducting several military campaigns elsewhere, and rebuilding and refurnishing his palace entirely.\n\nHezekiah predeceased Sennacherib, dying just a couple of years after the siege. His successor (and son), Manasseh, reversed the religious changes, re-introducing religious pluralism; Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that this may have been an attempt to gain co-operation from village elders and clans, so that he would not need so much centralised administration, and could therefore allow the countryside to return to economic autonomy. According to the archaeology there must have been a deliberate expansion of agriculture into the Judean desert, and the rich finds from this period suggest that much profit was gained from Judah's now peaceful position in the middle of many of the caravan routes between Assyria's allies; the state certainly increased its administration of trade to levels that far exceed those before.\n\nHezekiah's actions had given away the gold and silver from the Jerusalem Temple, impoverished his state, lost him his own daughters and concubines, and reduced his territory to a small region around Jerusalem, most of the people elsewhere in Judah being deported; Manasseh had brought peace and prosperity back to the country, but because the Book of Kings bases its decisions on theological prejudice, it condemns him as the most sinful monarch ever to rule Judah and hails instead Hezekiah as the great king. \"The Bible Unearthed\" suggests that the priesthood and populace outside Jerusalem may well have held the opposite opinion—that Hezekiah's imposition of monolatry was blasphemous, and the disasters that befell the country during his reign had been punishment from the gods.\n\nAs recorded in the Book of Kings, Manasseh's grandson, Josiah, enacted a large religious reform soon after he became king; he ordered renovations to the Jerusalem Temple, during which the High Priest 'found' a \"scroll of the law\", which insisted on monotheism with sacrifice centralised at a single temple—that in Jerusalem. Finkelstein and Silberman note that most scholars regard the core of Deuteronomy as being the \"scroll of the law\" in question, and regard it as having been written not long before it was 'found', rather than being an ancient missing scroll as characterised in the Bible; Deuteronomy is strikingly similar to early 7th century Assyrian vassal-treaties, in which are set out the rights and obligations of a vassal state (in this case Judah) to their sovereign (in this case, Yahweh). Josiah imposed this \"scroll\" as the new religious orthodoxy, and, like Hezekiah before him, destroyed the old cult centres; Josiah even went so far as to slaughter the priests of these shrines, burn their bodies, and bury their bones in the tombs near them, upon the old altars.\n\nThe sudden collapse of the Assyrian Empire in the last decades of the 7th century BCE offered an opportunity for Josiah to expand Judah's territory into the former kingdom of Israel, abandoned by the Assyrians. It was now that the author of Deuteronomy, working in Josiah's court, reworked older legends, texts, and histories into a single national history; with the message that it had been the non-Deuteronomic practices of the Israelites that had led to their downfalls, and implied that Joshua, as well as David in some respects, was a foreshadowing of what Josiah could achieve.\n\nArchaeology suggests that Josiah was initially successful, extending his territory northwards towards Bethel, a cult-centre of the kingdom of Israel; however he then rode out to meet the Egyptian Pharaoh—Necho—at Meggido. Necho had been merely 'passing through', leading an army to join the Assyrian civil war on the side of the Assyrian (rather than Babylonian) faction, but Josiah was killed; the circumstances of his death are uncertain, though the Book of Chronicles claims that despite Necho's lack of enmity for Josiah, Josiah insisted on attacking him. Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that Necho may have objected to Josiah's expansionist policies, which could have threatened the Egyptian dominance of the region to the west of Judah (the Philistine lands) or of the strategically important Jezreel Valley to its north, or could equally have objected to the effect of the new (deuteronomic) social policies on the caravan routes, which ran through southern Judah.\n\nWith Josiah's death Egypt became suzerain over Judah. The new king, Egypt's vassal ruler, undid Josiah's changes, restoring the former shrines and returning the country once again to religious pluralism. But when the Babylonian faction eventually won the Assyrian civil war, they set out to forcibly retake the former Assyrian tributaries. Judah, as a loyal Egyptian vassal-state, resisted, with disastrous consequences: the Babylonians plundered Jerusalem in 597 BCE and imposed their own vassal king; these events are described in the Bible and confirmed, with variations, in the Babylonian Chronicle. A few years later, the king of Judah rebelled against his Babylonian masters, and the Babylonians returned to destroy all the cities in Judah, burning Jerusalem to the ground in 587 BCE.\nIn 539 BCE, the Achaemenids conquered Babylon, and, in accordance with their Zoroastrian perspective, allowed the people deported by the Babylonians to return; this is described by the Cyrus Cylinder, which also indicates that the Persians repaired the temples in these conquered lands, returning any sacred artifacts to them. According to the archaeological record, no more than 25% of the population had actually been deported; according to the Book of Ezra and its parallel passages in the First Book of Esdras, when the deportees began to return, their leader—Zerubbabel—refused to allow the undeported Israelites to assist them in reconstructing the Jerusalem temple, apparently believing that only the former deportees had the right to determine the beliefs and practices which could count as the orthodoxy. Although the undeported majority then tried to stop the reconstruction, Darius, the new Achaemenid king, eventually allowed it to continue.\n\nThe conflict between the returnees and those who had always been in Judah evidently required resolution; the two groups had to be reintegrated. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the Deuteronomic law advanced by parts of the deported elite (the ancestors of the returnees), and the laws and legends of the inveterate inhabitants, were melded together into a single Torah so that it could form a central authority able to unite the population. Artaxerxes, Darius' grandson, commissioned Ezra to take charge of Judah, following the divine laws which Ezra was holding in his hand; \"The Bible Unearthed\" comments that academics like Richard Elliott Friedman propose that Ezra himself was the final redactor of the Torah, noting that the Bible identifies him as \"the scribe of the law of the god of heaven\".\n\n\"The Bible Unearthed\" was well received by some biblical scholars and archaeologists and critically by others. Baruch Halpern, professor of Jewish Studies at Pennsylvania State University and leader of the archaeological digs at Megiddo for many years, praised it as \"the boldest and most exhilarating synthesis of Bible and archaeology in fifty years\", and Jonathan Kirsch, writing in the \"Los Angeles Times\", called it \"a brutally honest assessment of what archeology can and cannot tell us about the historical accuracy of the Bible\", which embraces the spirit of modern archaeology by approaching the Bible \"as an artifact to be studied and evaluated rather than a work of divine inspiration that must be embraced as a matter of true belief\". Phyllis Trible, professor of biblical studies at Wake Forest University, concluded her review in \"The New York Times\" as follows:\nKenneth Kitchen was critical, writing that \"[A] careful critical perusal of this work—which certainly has much to say about both archaeology and the biblical writings—reveals that we are dealing very largely with a work of imaginative fiction, not a serious or reliable account of the subject\", and \"Their treatment of the exodus is among the most factually ignorant and misleading that this writer has ever read.\" Richard Hess, also being critical, wrote that \"The authors always present their interpretation of the archaeological data but do not mention or interact with contemporary alternative approaches. Thus the book is ideologically driven and controlled.\"\n\nA review of the book by fellow archeologist William G. Dever published in the \"Biblical Archaeology Review\" and subsequently in the \"Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research\", resulted in heated exchanges between Dever and Finkelstein. Dever's review noted that the book had many strengths, notably archaeology's potential for re-writing the history of \"Ancient Israel\", but complained that it misrepresented his own views and concluded by characterizing Finkelstein as \"idiosyncratic and doctrinaire\"; Finkelstein's reaction was to call Dever a \"jealous academic parasite,\" and the debate quickly degenerated from that point.\n\nThe book became a bestseller within its field. In February 2009, Amazon.com ranked it as the 8th most popular in the fields of Old Testament Christian Theology, and the Archaeology of Christianity, as well as being the 22nd most popular book on the history of Israel. In 2006, the popularity of the text led to a four-part documentary series upon it, which was subsequently broadcast on The History Channel.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "99176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99176", "title": "The Reverend", "text": "The Reverend\n\nThe Reverend is an honorific style most often placed before the names of Christian clergy and ministers. There are sometimes differences in the way the style is used in different countries and church traditions. \"The Reverend\" is correctly called a \"style\" but is often and in some dictionaries called a title, form of address or title of respect. The style is also sometimes used by leaders in non-Christian religions such as Judaism and Buddhism.\n\nThe term is an anglicisation of the Latin \"reverendus\", the style originally used in Latin documents in medieval Europe. It is the gerundive or future passive participle of the verb \"revereri\" (\"to respect; to revere\"), meaning \"[one who is] to be revered/must be respected\". \"The Reverend\" is therefore equivalent to \"The Honourable\" or \"The Venerable\". It is paired with a modifier or noun for some offices in some religious traditions: Anglican archbishops and most Roman Catholic bishops are usually styled \"The Most Reverend\" (\"reverendissimus\"); other Anglican bishops and some Roman Catholic bishops are styled \"The Right Reverend\"; some Reformed churches have used \"The Reverend Mister\" as a style for their clergy.\n\nWith Christian clergy, the forms \"His Reverence\" and \"Her Reverence\" is also sometimes used, along with its parallel in direct address, \"Your Reverence\". The abbreviation \"HR\" is sometimes used.\n\nIn traditional and formal English usage, both British and American, it is still considered incorrect to drop the definite article, \"the\", before \"Reverend\". In practice, however, \"the\" is often not used in both written and spoken English. When the style is used within a sentence, \"the\" is correctly in lower-case. The usual abbreviations for \"Reverend\" are \"Rev.\", \"Revd\" and \"Rev'd\".\n\"The Reverend\" is traditionally used as an adjectival form with first names (or initials) and surname (e.g. \"The Reverend John Smith\" or \"The Reverend J.F. Smith\"); \"The Reverend Father Smith\" or \"The Reverend Mr Smith\" are correct though now old-fashioned uses. Use of the prefix with the surname alone (\"The Reverend Smith\") is considered a solecism in traditional usage: it would be as irregular as calling the person in question \"The Well-Respected Smith\". In some countries, especially Britain, Anglican clergy are acceptably addressed by the title of their office, such as \"Vicar\", \"Rector\", or \"Archdeacon\".\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries it has been increasingly common for \"reverend\" to be used as a noun and for clergy to be referred to as being either \"a reverend\" or \"the reverend\" (\"I talked to the reverend about the wedding service.\") or to be addressed as \"Reverend\" or, for example, \"Reverend Smith\" or \"the Reverend Smith\". This has traditionally been considered grammatically incorrect on the basis that it is equivalent to referring to a judge as being \"an honourable\" or an adult man as being \"a mister\".\n\nAlthough it is formally an incorrect use of the term, \"Reverend\" is sometimes used alone, without a name, as a reference to a member of the clergy and treated as a normal English noun requiring a definite or indefinite article (e.g. \"We spoke to the reverend yesterday.\") but such usage is incorrect. It is likewise incorrect to form the plural \"Reverends\". Some dictionaries, however, do place the noun rather than the adjective as the word's principal form, owing to an increasing use of the word as a noun among people with no religious background or knowledge of traditional styles of ecclesiastical address. When several clergy are referred to, they are often styled individually (e.g. \"The Reverend John Smith and the Reverend Henry Brown\"); but in a list of clergy, \"The Revv\" is sometimes put before the list of names, especially in the Roman Catholic Church in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nIn some churches, especially Protestant churches in the United States, ordained ministers are often addressed as \"Pastor\" (as in \"Pastor John\" or \"Pastor Smith\"). \"Pastor\", however, is considered more correct in some churches when the minister in question is the head of a church or congregation.\n\nMale Christian priests are usually addressed as \"Father\" or, for example, as \"Father John\" or \"Father Smith\". However, in official correspondence, such priests are not normally referred to as \"Father John\", \"Father Smith\", or \"Father John Smith\", but as \"The Reverend John Smith\". \"Father\" as an informal title is used for Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Old Catholic priests and for many priests of the Anglican and Lutheran churches. In England, however, even Roman Catholic priests were often referred to as \"Mr\" until the 20th century except when members of a religious order. \"Mr\" is still not incorrect for priests of the Church of England.\n\nSome female Anglican or Old Catholic priests use the style \"The Reverend Mother\" and are addressed as \"Mother\".\n\n\"The Reverend\" may be modified to reflect ecclesiastical standing and rank. Modifications vary across religious traditions and countries. Some common examples are:\n\n\nNone of the clergy are usually addressed in speech as \"Reverend\" or \"The Reverend\" alone. Generally, \"Father\" is acceptable for all three orders of clergy, though in some countries this is customary for priests only. Deacons may be addressed as \"Deacon\", honorary prelates as \"Monsignor\"; bishops and archbishops as \"Your Excellency\" (or \"Your Grace\" in Commonwealth countries), or, in informal settings, as \"Bishop\", \"Archbishop\", etc.\n\n\n\nAmong Southern Baptists in the United States, pastors are often referred to in written communication and formal address as \"Reverend\". However, Southern Baptist pastors are often orally addressed as either \"Brother\" (\"Brother Smith\", as New Testament writers describe Christians as being brothers and sisters in Christ) or \"Pastor\" (as in \"Pastor Smith\" or simply \"Pastor\" without the pastor's last name).\n\nMany African American Baptists use \"Reverend\" informally and formally, however correctly \"The Reverend John Smith\" or \"The Reverend Mary Smith\". \n\nMembers of the National Baptist Convention usually refer to their pastors as \"The Reverend\".\n\n\nIn some Methodist churches, especially in the United States, ordained and licensed ministers are usually addressed as \"Reverend\", unless they hold a doctorate in which case they are often addressed in formal situations as \"The Reverend Doctor\". In informal situations \"Reverend\" is used. \"The Reverend\", however, is used in more formal or in written communication, along with \"His/Her Reverence\" or \"Your Reverence\". \"Brother\" or \"Sister\" is used in some places, although these are formally used to address members of Methodist religious orders, such as the Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery. Use of these forms of address differs depending on the location of the church or Annual Conference.\n\nIn British Methodism, ordained ministers can be either presbyters (ministers of word and sacrament) or deacons (ministers of witness and service). Presbyters are addressed as \"The Revd\" (with given name and surname) or as Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms with surname alone.\n\nThe United Methodist Church in the United States often addresses its ministers as \"Reverend\" (e.g., \"Reverend Smith\"). \"The Reverend\", however, is still used in more formal or official written communication.\n\nChurch ministers are styled \"The Reverend\". The moderators of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Presbyterian Church of Australia, the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the United Church of Canada, when ordained clergy, are styled \"The Right Reverend\" during their year of service and \"The Very Reverend\" afterwards. Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) are styled simply \"The Reverend\". By tradition in the Church of Scotland, the ministers of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, (also known as the High Kirk of Edinburgh) and Paisley Abbey are styled \"The Very Reverend\". In Presbyterian courts where elders hold equal status with ministers it is correct to refer to ministers by their title (Mr, Mrs, Dr, Prof etc.). Traditionally in Scotland ministers are referred to in their communities in this way and this is an entirely correct form of address.\n\nLike some other groups that assert the lack of clerical titles within the church as narrated in the New Testament, congregations in the Restoration Movement (i.e., influenced by Barton Warren Stone and Alexander Campbell), often disdain use of \"The Reverend\" and instead use the more generalized designation \"Brother\". The practice is universal within the Churches of Christ and prevalent in the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ but has become uncommon in the Disciples of Christ, which use \"The Reverend\" for ordained ministers.\n\nInternally, members of the priesthood do not use \"The Reverend\" as a style, but are generally known as \"brother\" or \"sister\" or by their specific priesthood office (\"deacon\", \"teacher\" or \"priest\" are often appended after the person's name, instead of, for example, \"Deacon John Adams\" or \"Deacon Adams\", and generally only in written form; in contrast, elders, bishops, evangelists, apostles, etc. are often, for example, known as \"Bishop John Smith\" or \"Bishop Smith\"). Any member of the priesthood who presides over a congregation can, and often is, known as \"pastor\" or (if an elder), \"presiding elder\". Such use might only be in reference to occupying that position (\"she is the pastor\") as opposed to being used as a style (\"Pastor Jane\"). Priesthood members presiding over multiple congregations or various church councils are often termed \"president\". Externally, in ecumenical settings, \"The Reverend\" is sometimes used.\n\nIn some countries, including the United States, the title \"Pastor\" (such as \"Pastor Smith\" in more formal address or \"Pastor John\" in less formal) is often used in many nondenominational Christian traditions rather than \"The Reverend\" or \"Reverend\".\n\nVirtually all Japanese Buddhist traditions, especially Jodo Shinshu, which have carried over to the West style priests as \"the Reverend\" rather than \"the Venerable\", the religious style often used by Chinese and Tibetan Buddhists. This was a practice borrowed from Christianity and has been in use since the early 20th century.\n\nMost Jewish ministers of religion have the title Rabbi, which denotes that they have received rabbinical ordination (semicha). They are addressed as \"Rabbi\" or \"Rabbi Surname\". It is, however, not essential to be a rabbi to practice as a Jewish minister of religion. In particular, few cantors (chazzanim) are rabbis but many have authority to perform functions such as witnessing marriages. In this case they often use the style \"The Reverend\"; more usually, however, a cantor is called \"Cantor\" or \"Cantor Surname\".\n\nSome small communities without a rabbi will be led by a knowledgeable person who is styled as \"Reverend\". This is most often formally bestowed on the individual and is a requirement in some countries, which require a formally recognised religious leader to perform formal communal functions such as weddings and funerals.\n"}

The Bible's depiction of the 'period of the Judges' is widely considered doubtful.

{"id": "1324544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1324544", "title": "Yamabushi", "text": "Yamabushi\n\nIn modern use, the term \"ubasoku-yamabushi\" refers to laymen practitioners of shugendō. The religion places a heavy emphasis on asceticism and feats of endurance, and white and saffron-robed \"yamabushi\" toting a \"horagai\" conch-shell trumpet are still a common sight near the shugendō holy site of Dewa Sanzan and in the sacred mountains of Kumano and Omine.\n\n\"Yamabushi\" began as \"yamahoshi\", isolated clusters (or individuals) of mountain hermits, ascetics, and \"holy men\", who followed the path of \"shugendō\", a search for spiritual, mystical, or supernatural powers gained through asceticism. This path may or may not have had a founder, as the myths surrounding En no Gyōja are numerous and complex; he is quite similar to a Japanese Merlin in this way. Men who followed this path came to be known by a variety of names, including \"kenja\", \"kenza\", and \"shugenja\". These mountain mystics came to be renowned for their magical abilities and occult knowledge, and were sought out as healers or mediums, although Shinto shrines had traditionally reserved this role exclusively for maidens known as Miko.\n\nMost of these ascetics, in addition to their devotion to \"shugendō\", studied the teachings of the Tendai sect of Buddhism, or the Shingon sect, established by Kōbō Daishi in the 8th century. Shingon Buddhism was one of the primary sects of \"mikkyō\" (密教) or Esoteric Buddhism, according to which enlightenment is found through isolation, and the study and contemplation of oneself, as well as nature, and esoteric images called mandala. Both the Shingon sect and the Tendai viewed mountains as the ideal place for this sort of isolation and contemplation of nature.\n\nIn their mountain retreats, these monks studied not only nature and religious/spiritual texts and images, but also a variety of martial arts. Whether they felt they had to defend themselves from bandits, other monks, or samurai armies is questionable, but the idea of studying martial arts as a means to improve oneself mentally and spiritually, not just physically, has always been central to Japanese culture, beyond the specific tenets of one religious sect or another. Additionally, the Yamabushi developed their own forms of cooking that utilized vegetation that was naturally found on the mountains where they trained. This cuisine allowed them to spend weeks or even months in the mountains without having to venture down into the towns or cities below to restock on supplies. Thus, like the \"sōhei\", the \"yamabushi\" became warriors as well as monks.\n\nAs their reputation for mystical insight and knowledge grew, and their organization grew tighter, many of the masters of the ascetic disciplines began to be appointed to high spiritual positions in the court hierarchy. Monks and temples began to gain political influence. By the Nanboku-chō Period, in the 13th and 14th centuries, the \"yamabushi\" had formed organized cohorts called \"konsha\", and these \"konsha\", along with \"sōhei\" and other monks began to take direction from the central temples of their sects. They assisted Emperor Go-Daigo in his attempts to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate, and proved their warrior skills to be up to the challenge of fighting professional samurai armies.\n\nSeveral centuries later, in the Sengoku Period, \"yamabushi\" could be found among the advisers and armies of nearly every major contender for dominion over Japan. Some, led by Takeda Shingen, aided Oda Nobunaga against Uesugi Kenshin in 1568, while others, including the abbot Sessai Choro, advised Tokugawa Ieyasu. Many fought alongside their fellow monks, the \"Ikkō-ikki\", against Nobunaga, who eventually crushed them and put an end to the time of the warrior monks.\n\nYamabushi also served as \"sendatsu\", or spiritual mountain guides, since medieval times for pilgrims along the Kumano Kodo to the Kumano Sanzan, including retired emperors and aristocrats.\n\n\n"}
