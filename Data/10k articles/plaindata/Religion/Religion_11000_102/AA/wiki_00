It is extant in unilingual Sumerian from Nippur during the Old Babylonian period, and thereafter in bilingual editions from the Kassite, middle Assyrian and neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian versions, where the later ones are closer textually to the old version than the Middle Babylonian. Along with its companion composition, Lugal-e, it is the only Sumerian composition other than incantations and proverbs to have survived in the canon from the Old Babylonian period into the first Millennium. The title comes from the opening line: an-[gim] dím-ma, en-líl-gim dím-ma, “created like An, created like Enlil.”\n\nThe narrative relates that he mounts the monsters, “slain heroes,” he has defeated as trophies on his [gigir z]a-gìn-na, “shining chariot.” Echoing the number of Tiāmat’s eleven monstrous offspring, (from the Enûma Eliš, whom Marduk had vanquished), Ninurta’s conquests included \n\n\nHe then journeys with his attendants, Udanna, the all-seeing god, Lugalanbadra, the bearded lord, and Lugalkudub, with full battle regalia in a terrifying procession to Nippur. Nusku warns him that he is frightening the gods, the Ananna, and, if he can tone it down a little, Enlil will reward him. In the Ekur, he displays his trophies and booty to the general astonishment of the gods – including his brother, the moon god Sin, father, Enlil, and mother Ninlil. Ninurta then extols his virtues in a long hymn of self-praise in an effort to solicit the establishment of his own cult. On his departure from the Ekur, he is petitioned by the god Ninkarnunna to extend his blessings to the king, perhaps the underlying purpose of the whole poem. The work ends with: Ninurta dumu mah é-kur-ra, “Ninurta, the magnificent scion of Ekur.”\n\nThe ancient use of the text is uncertain. It may have been recited during some kind of cultic activity, such as the annual transport of the Ninurta idol between the temples, Ešumeša and Ekur.\n\nNinurta's return to Nibru: a šir-gida to Ninurta at ETCSL\n"}

The temple and town form one of the four Char Dham and Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinathholy shrines for Vaishnavites. It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River at an elevation of above the mean sea level. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 1,060,000 visits.\n\nThe image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a tall, the black stone statue of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The statue is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight \"swayam vyakta kshetras\", or self-manifested statues of Vishnu.\n\nMata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river Ganges on mother earth, is the most prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple. Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which later came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. The committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members on its board.\n\nThe temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like \"Vishnu Purana\" and \"Skanda Purana\". It is glorified in the \"Divya Prabandha\", an early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD.\n\nThe temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, a state in North India. The hill tracks are located above the mean sea level. The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is located behind the Neelakanta peak.\n\nThe temple has three structures: the Garbhagriha (sanctum), the Darshan Mandap (worship hall), and Sabha Mandap (convention hall). The conical-shaped roof of the sanctum, the \"garbhagriha\", is approximately tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof. The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a mandap, a large, pillared hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the hall are covered with intricate carvings.\n\nThe main shrine houses the Shaligram (black stone) idol of Lord Badrinarayana, which is housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The idol of Lord Badrinarayana shows Him holding a \"Shankha\" (conch) and a \"Chakra\" (wheel) in two of His arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting on His lap in a \"Yogamudra\" (\"Padmasana\") posture. The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealthKubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nar and Narayan. There are fifteen more images that are also worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu), Garuda (the vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara ( 788-820), Nar and Narayan,Ghantakarna, Vedanta Desika and Ramanujacharya. All the idols of the temple are made of black stone.\n\nThe Tapt Kund, a group of hot sulfur springs just below the temple, are considered to be medicinal; many pilgrims consider it a requirement to bathe in the springs before visiting the temple. The springs have a year-round temperature of , while outside temperature is typically below all year round. The two water ponds in the temple are called Narad Kund and Surya Kund.\n\nThere is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures (–500 ). According to some accounts, the temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara converted it to a Hindu temple. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument. Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from  814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the image of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title \"Bolanda Badrinath\", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.\n\nThe throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century. During the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee.The selection of priest is done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families\n\nThe temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage in the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur. It was still under renovation as late as the 1870s but these were completed by the time of the First World War. At that time, the town was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff, but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand. The Kumbh Meld festival held every twelve years raised the number of visitors to 50,000. The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.\n\nDuring 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to curb illegal encroachment.\n\nAccording to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in meditation at this place. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him in the form of the Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which is not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the \"padmasana\" posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage Narada, who saw Vishnu's consort, Lakshmi, massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana. \n\nThe \"Vishnu Purana\" narrates another version of the origins of Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar, and Narayanboth of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their religion and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.\n\nThe temple finds mention in several ancient books like \"Bhagavata Purana\", \"Skanda Purana\" and \"Mahabharata\". According to the \"Bhagavata Purana\", \"[t]here in Badrikashram the Personality of Godhead (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nar and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities\". The \"Skanda Purana\" states that \"[t]here are several sacred shrines in heaven, on earth, and in hell; but there is no shrine like Badrinath\". The area around Badrinath is also celebrated in \"Padma Purana\" as abounding in spiritual treasures. The \"Mahabharata\" revered the holy place as the one which can give salvation to devotees arriving close to if, while in other holy places they must perform religious ceremonies. The temple is revered in \"Nalayira Divya Prabandham\", in 11 hymns in the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon by Periazhwar and in 13 hymns in Thirumangai Azhwar. It is one of the 108 \"Divyadesam\" dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath.\n\nDevotees of all faiths and all schools of thought of Hinduism visit the Badrinath Temple. All the major monastic institutions like Kashi Math, Jeeyar Mutt (Andhra mutt), Udupi Pejavar and Manthralayam Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutts have their branches and guest houses there.\n\nThe Badrinath temple is one of five related shrines called Panch Badri, which are dedicated to the worship of Vishnu. The five temples are Vishal Badri - Badrinath Temple in Badrinath, Yogadhyan Badri located at Pandukeshwar, Bhavishya Badri located from Jyotirmath at Subain, Vridh Badri located from Jyotirmath in Animath and Adi Badri located from Karnaprayag. The temple is considered one of the holiest Hindu \"Char Dham\" (four divine) sites, comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath, Puri and Dwarka. Although the temple's origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Adi Shankara attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer. The four monasteries are located across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Sri Sharada Peetam Sringeri at Sringeri, Karnataka in the South.\n\nThough ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (\"Chota\" meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which lie in the foothills of the Himalayas. The name \"Chota\" was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.\n\nThe journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus, who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetimes. Traditionally, the pilgrimage starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding clockwise in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.\n\nThe most prominent festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of the river Ganges on mother earth. The mother of Badrinath, who is believed to have divided the river into twelve channels for the welfare of earthly beings, is worshiped during the festival. The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.\n\nThe Badri Kedar festival is celebrated during the month of June in both the temple and the Kedarnath temple. The festival lasts for eight days; artists from all over the country perform during the function.\n\nThe major religious activities (or \"pujas\") performed every morning are \"mahabhishek\" (ablution), \"abhishek\", \"gitapath\" and \"bhagavat puja\", while in the evening the \"pujas\" include \"geet govinda\" and \"aarti\". Recital in vedic scripts like \"Ashtotram\" and \"Sahasranama\" is practiced during all the rituals. After \"aarti\", the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image is given to the devotees the next day as prasad during the \"nirmalaya darshan\". All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.\n\nThe temple is closed for winter on the auspicious day of bhatridwityia or later during October–November. On the day of closure, \"Akhanda Jyothi\", a lamp is lit filled with ghee to last for six months. Special \"pujas\" are performed on the day by the chief priest in the presence of pilgrims and officials of the temple. The image of Badrinath is notionally transferred during the period to the Narasimha temple at Jyotirmath, located away from the temple. The temple is reopened around April-May on Akshaya tritiya, another auspicious day on the Hindu calendar. Pilgrims gather on the first day of opening of the temple after the winter to witness the \"Akhanda Jyothi\".\n\nThe temple is one of the holy places where the Hindus offer oblations to ancestors with the help of the priests. Devotees visit the temple to worship in front of the image of Badrinath in the sanctum and have a holy dip in Alaknanda River. The general belief is that a dip in the tank purifies the soul.\n\nThe Badrinath Temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which was later known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. A committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples. The act was modified in 2002 to appoint additional committee members, including Government officials and a Vice chairman. There are seventeen members in the board; three selected by the Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly, one member each by the Zilla Parishads of Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli and Uttarkashi, and ten members nominated by the state government.\n\nAs indicated in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When the last of the ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for the priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer, and a public officer to assist the chief executive officer.\n\nAlthough Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. This tradition is believed to have been initiated by Adi Shankara, who was a South Indian philosopher. The Rawal (chief priest) is requested by the Government of Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh government before the formation of Uttarakhand state) to the Kerala Government. The candidate should possess a degree of Acharya in Sanskrit, be a bachelor, well-versed in reciting \"mantras\" (sacred texts) and be from the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. The erstwhile ruler of Garhwal, who is the tutelary head of Badrinath, approves the candidate sent by the Government of Kerala. A Tilak Ceremony is held to instate the Rawal and he is deputed from April to November when the temple remains open. The Rawal is accorded high holiness status by Garhwal Rifles and the state governments of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. He is also held in high esteem by the Royals of Nepal. From April to November, he performs his duties as a temple priest. Thereafter, he either stays in Joshimutt or returns to his native village in Kerala. The duties of the Rawal starts at 4 a.m. every day with the \"Abhisheka\". He should not cross the river until Vamana Dwadasi and must adhere to \"Brahmacharya\". The Rawal is assisted by the Garhwali Dimri Pundits belonging to the Village Dimmer, Nayab Rawals, Dharmadikari, Vedapathi, a group of priests, Pandas Samadhi, Bhandari, Rasoiyas (cook), devotional singer, clerk of devashram, Jal Bhariya (water keeper) and temple guards. Badrinath is one of the few temples in North India that follow the ancient Tantra-Vidhi of Shrauta tradition more common in the south.\n\nIn 2012, the temple administration introduced a token system for visitors to the temple. Tokens indicating the time of visit were provided from three stalls in the taxi stands. Each devotee to visit the presiding deity is allocated 10–20 seconds. Proof of identity is mandatory to enter the temple. The temple is reached from Rishikesh, located away via Dev Prayag, Rudra Prayag, Karna Prayag, Nanda Prayag, Joshimath, Vishnuprayag and Devadarshini. From Kedarnath, visitors can follow the -long Rudra Prayag route or the -long Ukhimath and Gopeshwar route.\n\n\n"}

The first Bahá'í to enter the country was Martha Root in 1919. The first pioneer to settle there was Wilfrid Barton early in 1940 and the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Montevideo was elected in 1942. By 1961 Uruguayan Bahá'ís had elected the first National Spiritual Assembly and by 1963 there were three Local Assemblies plus other communities. By 2001 there was an estimated 4,000 Bahá'ís in Uruguay.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bahá'í to Uruguay, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil, then Argentina and Uruguay before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. \n\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. … Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America ... the republics of the continent of South America—Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, the Guianas, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as Falkland Islands, the Galapagòs, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad...\"\n\nFollowing the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America.\n\nShoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\nFollowing the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.\n\nEarly in 1940 the first pioneer, Wilfrid Barton, arrived in Uruguay. May Maxwell stopped one day in Uruguay on a trip in February 1940 and died a few days later while in Buenos Aires where Wilfrid Barton joined by newly arrived Simon Rosenzweig from Montevideo assisted in the funeral. Barton reports the first converts in spring of 1941 - Emilia A. Martinez Morente and Abraham Kassabian in Montevideo. The first Local Assembly of Montevideo was elected in 1942. Later in 1942 Barton reports of 13 Bahá'ís and work was progressing in translating some literature including The Dawn-Breakers.\n\nIn the midst of World War II there is a report that the assembly of Montevideo was dissolved in early 1945 but was re-established by summer 1945. Barton was joined by pioneer Flora Hottes in early 1946. A regional committee to coordinate efforts and build unity and familiarity in regions leading to regional national assemblies were appointed in 1946 - Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay were in one such committee's jurisdiction. Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. The second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Santiago, Chile, in January, 1948 with Uruguayan delegate Gambeta Roldan. When the regional national assembly of South America was elected the members included Rangvald Taetz of Uruguay. By 1950 there was still the one assembly in Uruguay. In 1956 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo hosted the sixth convention to elect the regional assembly of South America. The regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay & Bolivia; one member was Roberto Cazcarra of Montevideo. In early 1958 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo held their first summer school and in the fall of 1959 eighteen Bahá'ís gathered for a conference to discuss the progress of the religion in Uruguay. In December 1959 the Montevideo newspaper El País covered a presentation on Israel, which mentioned the Bahá'í Faith. In spring 1960 Hand of the Cause William Sears visited the Bahá'ís in Minas. In late 1960 the secretary of the regional assembly, Chilean Salvador Tormo, died in a plane crash in Uruguay. In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly - Uruguay's was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, `Alí-Akbar Furútan. The members of the first Uruguayan national assembly were: Leopolda Caraballo, Else Cazcarra, Roberto Cazcarra, Mary Dutra, Francisco Flores, Elena Caraballo, Mario Regina Marius, Carola Escofet, and Edward Belcher. By 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies also in Maldonado, and Minas, and a smaller group in Juan Lacaze (see List of cities in Uruguay.)\n\nThe contributions of the community were noted in 1995 when three Uruguayan senators urged a favorable vote supporting the human rights of Iran's Bahá'ís, saying: \"A vote in this sense will not only be in accordance with the country's tradition, but shall encourage the members of this community to continue their benevolent work within Uruguay and the rest of the world.\"\n\nThere have been some well known Baha'is who have lived in Uruguay. In 1968 Alfredo Speranza, an Uruguayan pianist who's given concerts in Uruguay and other countries, became a member of the religion. In 2004, Uruguayan artist Sima Baher was invited to exhibit her art by the embassy of Uruguay in Argentina at the Borges Cultural Center. In 1984, Phil Sisson left New York City and traveled to South America where he served as a Bahá'í pioneer. His first recording, \"The Dream\" was recorded in Montevideo and featured Baha'i chants of the Hidden Words by Baha'u'llah, prayers and meditations, and original songs. Sisson also toured throughout the region with Raul Medina, and hosted his own television show called \"Oro Solido\" on Uruguayan national TV and throughout Río de la Plata, was guest performer on \"Telecataplum\" (see Canal 12), and performed at La Allianaza, was a featured guest artist in the \"Miss Hawaiian Tropic Beauty Pageant in Punta del Este\", and was invited to perform at the Israeli Embassy in Montevideo. Sisson married Lena Hedayatzadeh in 1989, two years after adopting Lua Aline who (in 2004) served for three months at the Baha'i Lotus Temple in New Delhi, India. - \"Her service was the sweetest affirmation and compliment she could have ever bestowed upon us.\" In 2006, Sisson released his second recording, \"We're One People\" in San Diego, California.\n\nThere have also been activities noted among the community in general. Bahá'ís from Uruguay pioneered to the Falkland Islands and Brazil. Summer schools held in Uruguay showed 87 attendees in 1985 and 93 in 1987, when Bahá'ís were believed to live in 96 locations in Uruguay. By 1988 a community of Bahá'ís was to be found in Maldonado. In 1989 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo hosted two events; underr the auspices of the national assembly the first was an international women's conference attracting about 300 people from 12 countries. and second, held through the work of the local assembly, was an \"Evening of Cultural Integration\" brought together representatives from Armenian, African, and Israeli ethnicities including cultural forms of dress and talks on integrating into Uruguayan community. Fifty-five members of the religion from Uruguay joined those from across Brazil and other places for a 2008 regional conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in São Paulo.\n\nBy 2001 there was an estimated 4,000 Bahá'ís, about 0.2% of the national population according to the World Christian Database, concentrated primarily in Montevideo. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 7,300 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n\n"}

Mottahedeh underscored Yen's service upon her death in 1970: \"This noble lady played an important role in the development of the Baha'i Faith in the international field, and it was through her efforts that the Baha'is began their work with the United Nations\", and wrote a memorial.\n\nThe BIC seeks to \"promote world peace by creating the conditions in which unity emerges as the natural state of human existence\" by promoting and applying principles which are derived from the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith to develop a united and sustainable civilization. The BIC also works on the advancement of human rights, the advancement of women, universal education, the encouragement of just economic development, the protection of the environment, and a sense of world citizenship.\n\nTo achieve its purpose, the BIC cooperates with governments, the United Nations and other inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations; in May 1970 it gained consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and in 1976 with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Then in 1989 the BIC developed a working relationship with the World Health Organization, and it also has a working relationship with various other United Nations agencies and enterprises including the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The BIC has also undertaken joint development programs with various other United Nations agencies; in the 2000 Millennium Forum of the United Nations a Bahá'í was invited as the only non-governmental speaker during the summit.\n\nThe Bahá'í International Community has offices at the United Nations in New York and Geneva and representations to United Nations regional commissions and other offices in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Nairobi, Rome, Santiago, and Vienna. In recent years an Office of the Environment and an Office for the Advancement of Women were established as part of its United Nations Office. There also exists an Office of Public Information which is based at the Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa, Israel; that office distributes information about the Bahá'í Faith and publishes ONE COUNTRY, a quarterly newsletter.\n\nOn 4 March 2009, the Bahá'í International Community released an open letter to Iran’s Chief Prosecutor, Ayatollah Qorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi, addressing his recent statements regarding the administrative affairs of the Bahá’ís of Iran.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3516212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3516212", "title": "Book of Life", "text": "Book of Life\n\nIn Christianity and Judaism, the Book of Life (Hebrew: ספר החיים, transliterated \"Sefer HaChaim\"; \"Biblíon tēs Zōēs\") is the book in which God records the names of every person who is destined for Heaven or the World to Come. According to the Talmud it is open on Rosh Hashanah, as is its analog for the wicked, the Book of the Dead. For this reason extra mention is made for the Book of Life during Amidah recitations during the Days of Awe, the ten days between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement (the two High Holidays, particularly in the prayer Unetaneh Tokef).\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible the Book of Life—the book or muster-roll of God—records forever all people considered righteous before God. To be blotted out of this book signifies death. It is with reference to the Book of Life that the holy remnant is spoken of as being written unto life in Jerusalem; compare also Ezekiel 9:4, where one of the six heavenly envoys \"who had the scribe's inkhorn upon his loins\" is told to mark the righteous for life, while the remainder of the inhabitants of Jerusalem are doomed. The Psalms also speaks of a book of the living: \"Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.\n\nEven the tears of men are recorded in this Book of God. \"Every one that shall be found written in the book . . . shall awake to everlasting life\". This book is probably identical with the \"Book of Remembrance\" in which are recorded the deeds of those that fear the Lord.\n\nThe apocryphal Book of Jubilees speaks of two heavenly tablets or books: a Book of Life for the righteous, and a Book of Death for those that walk in the paths of impurity and are written down on the heavenly tablets as adversaries (of God). Also, according to Jubilees 36:10, one who contrives evil against his neighbor will be blotted out of the Book of Remembrance of men, and will not be written in the Book of Life, but in the Book of Perdition. In Daniel 12:10 and Enoch 47:3 \"the Ancient of Days\" is described as seated upon his throne of glory with \"the Book\" or \"the Books of Life\" (\"of the Living\") opened before him. So are, according to Enoch 56:1, the righteous \"written before the glory of the Great One,\" and, according to Enoch 108:3, the transgressors \"blotted out of the \"Book of Life\" and out of the books of the holy ones.\" Reference is made also in The Shepherd of Hermas (Vision i. 3; Mandate viii.; Similitude ii.); in Revelation 3:5, 13:8, 17:8, 20:12–15, where \"two Books\" are spoken of as being \"opened before the throne, the Book of Life, and the Book of Death, in which latter the unrighteous are recorded together with their evil deeds, in order to be cast into the lake of fire.\" It is the \"Book of Life\" in which the apostles' names are \"written in heaven\" (Luke 10:20), or \"the fellow-workers\" of Paul (Phil 4:3), and \"the assembly of the first-born\" (Hebrews 12:23; compare I Clem. 45). Allusion is made also in Enoch 81:4, 89:61–77, 90:17–20, 98:76, 104:7; 2 Baruch 24:1; Ascension of Isaiah 9:20.\n\nThe Book of Life is referred to seven times in the Book of Revelation (3:5 13:8 17:8 20:12 20:15 21:27 22:19) one of the books of the New Testament, attributed to John of Patmos. As described, only those whose names are written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, and have not been blotted out by the Lamb, are saved at the Last Judgment; all others are doomed. \"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire\" (\"Rev.\" 20:15, King James Version). \"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works\". (\"Rev.\" 20:12, King James Version)\n\nIt is also mentioned in Pauls letter to the Philippians 4:3.\n\nWhile the prevailing tendency among apocryphal writers of the Hasidean school was to give the Book of Life an eschatological meaning, the Jewish liturgy and the tradition relating to the New Year and Atonement days adhered to the ancient view, which took the Book of Life in its natural meaning, preferring, from a practical point of view, the worldliness of Judaism to the heavenliness of the Essenes. Instead of transferring, as is done in the Book of Enoch, the Testament of Abraham, and elsewhere, the great Judgment Day to the hereafter, the Pharisaic school taught that on the first day of each year (\"Rosh Hashanah\"), God sits in judgment over his creatures and has the Books of Life together with the books containing the records of the righteous and the wicked.\n\nThe origin of the heavenly Book of Life must be sought in Babylonia, where legends speak of the Tablets of Destiny and of tablets containing the transgressions, sins, wrongdoings, curses and execrations of a person who should be \"cast into the water\"; that is, blotted out. The living are the righteous, who alone are admitted to citizenship in the theocracy, while the wicked are denied membership and blotted out of God's book (\"Ex.\" xxxii. 32 \"et seq\".). The life in which the righteous participate is to be understood in a temporal sense, as temporal life is apparently prayed for in the liturgical formula: \"Inscribe us in the Book of Life.\" \n\nIn \"Daniel\" xii. 1, however, those who are found written in the book and who escape the troubles preparatory to the coming of the Messianic kingdom are they who, together with the risen martyrs, are destined to share in everlasting life. Eternal life is certainly meant in \"Enoch\" xlvii. 3, civ. 1, cviii. 3, and frequently in the \"New Testament\", especially in \"Revelation\". The Targum (\"Isa.\" iv. 3; \"Ezek.\" xiii. 9) speaks of the \"Book of Eternal Life.\" The Mishnah states that the deeds of every human being are recorded in a book (\"Abot,\" ii. 1; see iii. 16). The \"Sefer Ḥasidim\" (xxxiii) pointedly adds that God is in no need of a book of records; \"the Torah speaks the language of man.\"\n\nA book of life motif is frequently found in Jewish houses of worship. It is both a decorative feature and fundraiser. Some synagogues have raised money by inscribing congregation member's names in a \"book of life\" as a tribute to their financial generosity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8577960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8577960", "title": "Chinese jade", "text": "Chinese jade\n\nChinese jade refers to the jade mined or carved in China from the Neolithic onward. It is the primary hardstone of Chinese sculpture. Although deep and bright green jadeite is better known in Europe, for most of China's history, jade has come in a variety of colors and white \"mutton-fat\" nephrite was the most highly praised and prized. Native sources in Henan and along the Yangtze were exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most Chinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern province of Xinjiang.\n\nJade was prized for its hardness, durability, musical qualities, and beauty. In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective qualities caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the soul and immortality. With gold, it was considered to be a symbol of heaven. The most prominent early use was the crafting of the Six Ritual Jades, found since the 3rd-millennium  Liangzhu culture: the \"bi\", the \"cong\", the \"huang\", the \"hu\", the \"gui\", and the \"zhang\". Since the meanings of these shapes were not mentioned prior to the eastern Zhou dynasty, by the time of the composition of the \"Rites of Zhou\", they were thought to represent the sky, the earth, and the four directions. By the Han dynasty, the royal family and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in jade burial suits sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the souls attached to it. Jade was also thought to combat fatigue in the living. The Han also greatly improved prior artistic treatment of jade.\n\nThese uses gave way after the Three Kingdoms period to Buddhist practices and new developments in Taoism such as alchemy. Nonetheless, jade remained part of traditional Chinese medicine and an important artistic medium. Although its use never became widespread in Japan, jade became important to the art of Korea and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Chinese word \"yù\" 玉 \"jade; gems of all kinds; (of women) beautiful; (courteous) your\" has semantically broader meanings than English \"jade\" \"any of various hard greenish gems used in jewelry and artistic carvings, including jadeite and nephrite; a green color of medium hue; made of jade; green like jade\". \"Yù\" has referred to many rocks and minerals that carve and polish well, especially jadeite, nephrite and agalmatolite, as well as bowenite and other varieties of serpentine. Jadeite is now known as \"yìngyù\" ( \"hard jade\") and nephrite correspondingly as \"ruǎnyù\" ( \"soft jade\"). The polysemous term \"yù\" is used in various Chinese \"chengyu\" \"set phrases, such as \"pāozhuānyǐnyù\" ( \"cast aside a brick, pick up a jade\") \"offer banal/humble remarks to spark abler talk by others; sacrifice a little to gain much\"—one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, and idioms, for instance \"yùlì\" ( \"jade standing\") \"gracious; graceful\".\n\nThe Chinese character for \"yu\" \"jade\" dates back to circa 11th century BCE oracle bone script from the late Shang dynasty, when it depicted pieces of jade hanging on a string. Chinese characters most commonly combine a radical, such as the \"jade radical\" 玉 or 王, that suggests meaning and a phonetic that hints at pronunciation. The \"jade radical\" frequently occurs in characters for names of gemstones (e.g., \"bì\" 碧 \"green jade; bluish green\" and \"shānhú\" 珊瑚 \"coral\"), and occasionally for words denoting \"preciousness\" (\"bǎo\" \"treasure\" and \"bǎobǎo\" \"precious/darling baby\").\n\nJade has been used in virtually all periods of Chinese history and generally accords with the style of decorative art characteristic of each period. Its deep significance in Chinese culture has deemed it worthy of being symbolic of ancient Chinese ethics and ideologies and also representative of the progression of Chinese culture . Thus, the earliest jades, of the Neolithic Period, are often quite simple and unornamented ritual and impractical versions of the tools and weapons that were in ordinary use, often much larger than normal examples. These are presumed to have been symbols of political power or possibly religious authority. There have been three main Neolithic jadeworking centers. The first known center is known as the Liangzhu culture (c. 3300 - c. 2200). The jades of this period were primarily small items of personal adornment, such as small discs strung onto necklaces. Typically, the jade was polished on its surface and perforated. This religious nature of jade is often evaluated as connections between spirituality and the Neolithic societal structure that jade was produced in.\n\nDuring Neolithic times, the key known sources of nephrite jade in China for utilitarian and ceremonial jade items were the now depleted deposits in the Ningshao area in the Yangtze River Delta (Liangzhu culture 3400–2250 BC) and in an area of the Liaoning province in Inner Mongolia (Hongshan culture 4700–2200 BC). Archeological finds have also unearthed jade objects in this province in the shapes of dragons and clay-molded human figurines, therefore symbolizing the existence of a developed social group along the Liao River and inner-Mongolia . As early as 6000 BC, Dushan Jade has been mined. In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tombs of the Shang kings.\n\nThe \"bi\" and \"cong\" are types of objects only found in jade in early periods, and probably had religious or cosmic significance. The \"bi\" is a circular disk with a hole, originally usually plain, but increasingly decorated, and the \"cong\" is a vessel, square on the outside but circular inside. In later literature the \"cong\" represents the earth and the \"bi\" the sky.\n\nJades of the Shang, Zhou, and Han dynasties are increasingly embellished with animal and other decorative motifs characteristic of those times, and craftsmen developed great skill in detailed low relief work in objects such as the belt-hooks that became part of elite costume. In later periods ancient jade shapes, derived from bronze sacrificial vessels, and motifs of painting were used to demonstrate the craftsman's extraordinary technical facility.\n\nIn the Chou Dynasty (1122-255 BC), the system of government had been completed and there were varying levels of departments within the government. Buttons of jade were utilized to differentiate the various levels of official society. \n\nJade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects, ranging from indoor decorative items to jade burial suits, reflecting the ancient Chinese belief that jades would confer immortality or prolong life and prevent decay. Jade spoons, spatulas, and pestles were used to make medicine in order for the jade to bestow its special virtues onto the medical compounds. \n\nFrom about the earliest Chinese dynasties until the present, jade was sourced from deposits in western regions like Khotan and other parts of China like Lantian, Shaanxi. In Lantian, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the rivers flowing from the Kun-Lun mountain range northward into the Takla-Makan desert area. River jade collection was concentrated in the Yarkand, the White Jade (Yurungkash) and Black Jade (Karakash) Rivers. From the Kingdom of Khotan, on the southern leg of the Silk Road, yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there transformed into \"objets d'art\" by skilled artisans as jade was considered more valuable than gold or silver, and white more valuable than green. \n\nJade became a favorite material for the crafting of Chinese writing materials, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some opium pipes, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.\n\nThe Qing dynasty was the final dynasty to gain political power within China beginning in 1644 CE until 1911 CE. Emperor Shengzu, who was also known as Kangxi, ruled between circa 1662 CE until 1722 CE. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi, a distinctive pairs of lions or dogs composed of jade were commissioned by the dynastic family.\n\nThe hardness of jade presented an obstacle to those who wanted to carve it and turn it into various objects. In order to quarry nephrite jade, fires were placed next to the jade to heat it and water was thrown against the rock's surface. This rapid temperature change caused the jade to crack and wooden wedges were used to further break it down. However, this quarrying technique also destroyed the jade. The best way to extract jade in terms of it being in the best condition was to remove it from pebbles and boulders that were found in rivers. \n\nNeolithic jade workshops, also known as wasters, have been found in areas where jade usage was evident and popularized . Most evidence of the development of jade technology and tools are taken from wasters and the discards and finished works present in these workshops . From the traces of jade left at these sites, one can see the evolution of crafting procedures from chipping and polishing to more advanced drilling and slicing . Due to the toughness of jade, the chipping and polishing procedures differ drastically from regular stone . The only possible method of altering the shape or texture of this mineral dense rock hasn’t seen much change from its introduction to modern day as both times remain reliant on the abrasion method . In order to override the abrasiveness of jade and subdue it to molding, a jade-worker must use an object of higher abrasive factor . In the early day’s of jade carving, quartz, a mineral with a high hardness level, was the object of choice . At the beginning of the Song dynasty, a time of prolific technology growth, “red sand”, with a hardness level of 7.5 became the dominant tool of the industry . \n\nIn terms of Hongshan (a culture consisting of regions such as Dongjiayingzi, Aohan, and Inner Mongolia) jade, four main tools comprise the basics for jade carving: the string, awl, the hollow drill, and a slow rotating disk . The string tools specifically were involved in the shaping of raw materials and slicing of jade into flat disks . Besides for slicing, this instrument was also responsible for open work, specifically the cutting of slits . Awls and hollow drills were both used to delicately puncture holes into jade material, however, awls were responsible for small pierces in ornaments whereas hollow drills made larger punctures for a variety of purposes . The slow rotating disk, finally, was purposeful in line cutting and preparing jade material for other drilling techniques . Although little is researched regarding the manufacturing techniques of other major Neolithic jade centers Dawenkou or Longshan, the Hongshan culture is quite known for its technical quality in the production of jade products and therefore serves as reliable source when examining the pinnacle of jade crafting during the Neolithic period . \n\nThe introduction of metal tools occurred in the late Zhou period (1050-256 B.C.) . It is likely that the use of copper in these tools preceded the use of iron . \n\nSince jade was considered to be rare and strenuous to work with, pieces of jade were minimally changed and scrap pieces were reused in some way. The coloration of the jade was a factor taken into consideration when deciding what form the piece of jade would take.\n\nJade objects of early ages (Neolithic through Zhou) fall into five categories: small decorative and functional ornaments such as beads, pendants, and belt hooks; weapons and related equipment; independent sculptural, especially of real and mythological animals; small objects of probably emblematic value, including the han (ornaments, often carved in the shape of a cicada, to be placed in the mouth of the dead), and many examples of larger objects — such as the \"cong\" (a hollow cylinder or truncated cone)\n\nThe Six Ritual Jades originating in pre-history were the \"bi\" (a flat disk with a hole in its center), the \"cong (prismatic tube)\", the \"huang (a flat, half-ring pendant), the \"hu\", the flat, bladelike \"gui\", and the \"zhang\". The original names, value and functions of these objects have invited much speculation. The Zhou Li, itself probably compiled in the Han Dynasty, ascribes the circular \"bi\" as representing the heavens, the \"cong\" as representing the earth, the \"gui\" the east, the \"zhang\" the south, the \"hu\" the west and the \"huang\" the north. Although over two millennia old these names and symbolism were given to these objects by much later writers, who interpreted the objects in a way that reflected their own understanding of the cosmos.\n\nThe original use of the \"Six Ritual Jades\" became lost, with such jades becoming status symbols, with utility and religious significance forgotten. The objects came to represent the status of the holder due to the expense and authority needed to command the resources and labour in creating the object. Thus it was as the \"Ceremonial Jades\" that the forms of some of these jades were perpetuated. The \"Zhou Li\" states that a king (wang) was entitled to \"gui\" of the \"zhen\" type, dukes (gong) to the huang, marquis to \"gui\" of the \"xin\" type, earls (bo) to \"gui\" of the \"gong\" type, viscounts (zi) to a \"bi\" of the \"gu\" type and barons (nan) to a \"bi\" of the \"pu\" type.\n\n\n\n"}

The Indian government asserts that it was conducted by the Islamic Fundamentalist militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Mohammad Suhail Malik of Sialkot, Pakistan confessed while in custody about participating in the attacks at the direction of Lashkar-e-Taiba in an interview with Barry Bearak of \"The New York Times\" although Bearak questioned the authenticity of the confession. Suhail Malik is a nephew of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed of Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was however later acquitted of these charges by a Delhi court. Some other observers like Bruce Riedel have also attributed this massacre to Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nAccording to the Indian government, They came wearing Indian Army fatigues to avoid detection, the killers came into the village in two groups at separate ends of the village where the two Gurdwaras were located. They first lined up the Sikhs, who had been celebrating the Holi or Hola Mahalla Festival, in front of their Gurdwaras and opened fire, killing thirty-six people.\n\nThe killings of 36 Sikhs was a turning point in the Kashmir issue, where Sikhs had usually been spared from militant violence. After the massacre hundreds of Kashmiri Sikhs gathered in the village shouting anti Pakistan and anti Muslim slogans and criticizing Indian government for failing to protect the villagers. Sikh protesters shouting \"blood for blood\" marched to the seat of Jammu-Kashmir government to demand retaliation against Pakistan-based Muslim militants.\n\nThe villagers ensured that the local school was up and running just two weeks after the killings. The massacre created tension and distrust between the Sikh and Muslim residents of the area, but no problems developed at the joint Muslim-Sikh village school. After the massacre the residents of the village pointed the police to Mohammad Yakub Magray as one of the suspects.\n\nIn 2005, Sikh organizations such as the Bhai Kanahiya Jee Nishkam Seva Society demanded a deeper state inquiry into the details of the massacre and for the inquiry to be made public. The state government ordered an inquiry into the massacre. \n\nCommenting on this massacre Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal responding to a call for international inquiry into the incident by Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed said that violence will never solve Kashmir problems and rejected the call for international inquiry.\n\nThe massacre coincided with the visit of United States president Bill Clinton to India. In an introduction to a book written by Madeleine Albright titled \"The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs (2006)\", she accused \"Hindu Militants\" of perpetrating the act. This error created a major incident, with both Hindu and Sikh groups expressing outrage at the inaccuracy. Clinton's office did not return calls seeking comment or clarification. In the hours immediately after the massacre in March 2003, the US condemned the killings but refused to accept the Indian government's accusation that it was the work of Pakistani Islamist groups. The publishers, Harper Collins routed a correction through Albright's office. In a public statement they acknowledged the mistake.\n\nPage xi of the Mighty and the Almighty contains a reference to Hindu militants that will be deleted in subsequent printings, both in America and in international editions. This error was due to a failure in the fact-checking process.\nThe massacre was depicted in the commercial Bollywood film Adharm (unholy) directed by Adeep Singh.\n\nIn 2010, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) associate David Headley, who was arrested in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, reportedly confessed to the National Investigation Agency that the LeT carried out the Chittisinghpura massacre. He is said to have identified an LeT militant named Muzzamil as part of the group which carried out the killings apparently to create communal tension just before Clinton’s visit. \n\n"}
{"id": "10510197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10510197", "title": "Criticism of Buddhism", "text": "Criticism of Buddhism\n\nCriticism of Buddhism has taken numerous different forms, including that its practitioners act in ways contrary to Buddhist principles or that those principles systemically marginalize women. There are many sources of criticism, both ancient and modern, stemming from other religions, the non-religious, and other Buddhists.\n\nMost schools of Buddhism have more rules for \"bhikkunis\" (nuns) than \"bhikkus\" (monk) lineages. Theravada Buddhists explain that in the time of the Buddha, nuns had such problems like safety if they were to be ordained the same way as monks who traveled around in the forest and between cities. Thus, more rules have to be created for nuns; for instance: nuns are forbidden to travel alone.\n\nAlexander Berzin referred to the Dalai Lama's statement at the 2007 Hamburg congress:\nThe most criticised doctrine is found in Amida Buddha's vow 35: \"The Buddha established the Vow of transformation [women] into men, Thereby vowing to enable women to attain Buddhahood\". Earlier limitations on attainment of Buddhahood by women were abolished in the Lotus Sutra which opened the direct path to enlightenment for women equally to men. According to Nichiren \n\"Only in the Lotus Sutra do we read that a woman who embraces this sutra not only excels all other women but surpasses all men\".\n\nIn medieval Southeast Asia, there were a number of Buddhist states, including the Pagan Kingdom, the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. In Sri Lanka especially, modern monks frequently involve themselves in nationalist politics. These Buddhist nationalists have been opposed by the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, a self-governance movement led by the Buddhist A. T. Ariyaratne and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn the use of violence and the denial of Human rights to Tamils and other non-Buddhists.\n\nMaung Zarni, a Burmese democracy advocate, human rights campaigner, and a research fellow at the London School of Economics who has written on the violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, states that there is no room for fundamentalism in Buddhism. \"No Buddhist can be nationalistic,\" said Zarni, \"There is no country for Buddhists. I mean, no such thing as ‘me,’ ‘my’ community, ‘my’ country, ‘my’ race or even ‘my’ faith.\"\n\nViolence in Buddhism refers to acts of violence and aggression committed by Buddhists with religious, political, and socio-cultural motivations. Buddhism is generally seen as among the religious traditions least associated with violence, but in the history of Buddhism there have been acts of violence directed, fomented or inspired by Buddhists.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, through Schopenhauer whose pessimism was highly influenced by Buddhist philosophy, interpreted Buddhism as a life-negating philosophy that seeks to escape an existence dominated by suffering. According to Omar Moad, Nietzsche misunderstood the meaning of Buddhist doctrine. The term \"Dukkha\" has different meanings and is neither pessimistic nor optimistic. Dukkha may mean disappointment, desires, cravings, bereavement, unfulfillment, or dissatisfaction.\n\nLama Surya Das emphasizes the matter-of-fact nature of \"dukkha\":\nWhile the Buddha describes the flawed and imperfect nature of life in the first noble truth, he also points to the causes that underlie this imperfection and how to bring these causes to an end.\n\nBuddhism is sometimes seen as antithetical to much of Confucian philosophy. Due to the focus on social roles as the source of ethical obligation in Confucianism compared to the seemingly inherent nonconformity of Buddhism, there was a sustained ethical critique of Buddhism in early Confucianism. While Buddhism entails the belief there is nothing rightfully considered the self, Confucianism emphasized the self a great deal in their doctrines of self-development and societal roles. As a consequence Buddhism was considered by many to be nihilistic.\n\nSam Harris, a prominent proponent of New Atheism and practitioner of Buddhist meditation, claims that many practitioners of Buddhism improperly treat it as a religion, criticizes their beliefs as \"naive, petitionary, and superstitious,\" and claims that such beliefs impede the spread of Buddhist principles. However, he has also underlined that these beliefs stem from the tendency of some Buddhists to not follow a fundamental teaching of Buddhism; namely, to believe a teaching only with sufficient evidence. \n\nStephen Batchelor, author of \"Buddhism without Beliefs\" has written about karma and rebirth, asserting that the Buddha “did not claim to have had experience that granted him privileged, esoteric knowledge of how the universe ticks”. However, his critics point out that his assertion is contrary to the earliest written records of the Buddha's teaching as well as hundreds of years of academic study on the topic. They also point to a lack of scholarly research on Batchelor's part to give credibility to his claims; and suggest that Batchelor may be attempting to reshape Buddhism due to his own discomfort with concepts such as karma and rebirth.\n\n"}
{"id": "998255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=998255", "title": "Dharmaguptaka", "text": "Dharmaguptaka\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka (Sanskrit; ) are one of the eighteen or twenty early Buddhist schools, depending on the source. They are said to have originated from another sect, the Mahīśāsakas. The Dharmaguptakas had a prominent role in early Central Asian and Chinese Buddhism, and their Prātimokṣa (monastic rules for bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs) are still in effect in East Asian countries to this day, including China, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. They are one of three surviving Vinaya lineages, along with that of the Theravāda and the Mūlasarvāstivāda.\n\n\"Guptaka\" means \"preserver\" and \"dharma\" \"law, justice, morality\", and, most likely, the set of laws of Northern Buddhism.\n\nThe Dharmaguptakas regarded the path of a śrāvaka (\"śrāvakayāna\") and the path of a bodhisattva (\"bodhisattvayāna\") to be separate. A translation and commentary on the \"Samayabhedoparacanacakra\" reads:\n\nAccording to the \"Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra\", the Dharmaguptakas held that the Four Noble Truths are to be observed simultaneously.\n\nVasubandhu states that the Dharmaguptakas held, in agreement with Theravada and against Sarvāstivāda, that realization of the four noble truths happens all at once (\"ekābhisamaya\").\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka are known to have rejected the authority of the Sarvāstivāda prātimokṣa rules on the grounds that the original teachings of the Buddha had been lost.\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka used a unique twelvefold division of the Buddhist teachings, which has been found in their \"Dīrgha Āgama\", their \"Vinaya\", and in some Mahāyāna sūtras. These twelve divisions are: \"sūtra\", \"geya\", \"vyākaraṇa\", \"gāthā\", \"udāna\", \"nidāna\", \"jātaka\", \"itivṛttaka\", \"vaipulya\", \"adbhūtadharma\", \"avadāna\", and \"upadeśa\".\n\nBetween 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which described the color of monastic robes (Skt. \"kāṣāya\") utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called \"Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi\" (). Another text translated at a later date, the \"Śāriputraparipṛcchā\", contains a very similar passage with nearly the same information. However, the colors for Dharmaguptaka and Sarvāstivāda are reversed. In the earlier source, the Sarvāstivāda are described as wearing deep red robes, while the Dharmaguptaka are described as wearing black robes. The corresponding passage found in the later \"Śāriputraparipṛcchā\", in contrast, portrays the Sarvāstivāda as wearing black robes and the Dharmaguptaka as wearing deep red robes.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, Chinese Buddhist monastics typically wore grayish-black robes and were even colloquially referred to as \"Zīyī\" (), \"those of the black robes.\" However, the Song dynasty monk Zanning (919–1001 CE) writes that during the earlier Han-Wei period, the Chinese monks typically wore red robes.\n\nAccording to the Dharmaguptaka vinaya, the robes of monastics should be sewn out of no more than 18 pieces of cloth, and the cloth should be fairly heavy and coarse.\n\nA consensus has grown in scholarship which sees the first wave of Buddhist missionary work as associated with the Gāndhārī language and the Kharoṣṭhī script and tentatively with the Dharmaguptaka sect. However, there is evidence that other sects and traditions of Buddhism also used Gāndhārī, and further evidence that the Dharmaguptaka sect also used Sanskrit at times:\nStarting in the first century of the Common Era, there was a large trend toward a type of Gāndhārī which was heavily Sanskritized.\n\nThe Gandharan Buddhist texts, the earliest Buddhist texts ever discovered, are apparently dedicated to the teachers of the Dharmaguptaka school. They tend to confirm a flourishing of the Dharmaguptaka school in northwestern India around the 1st century CE, with Gāndhārī as the canonical language, and this would explain the subsequent influence of the Dharmaguptakas in Central Asia and then northeastern Asia. According to Buddhist scholar A. K. Warder, the Dharmaguptaka originated in Aparānta.\n\nAccording to one scholar, the evidence afforded by the Gandharan Buddhist texts \"suggest[s] that the Dharmaguptaka sect achieved early success under their Indo-Scythian supporters in Gandhāra, but that the sect subsequently declined with the rise of the Kuṣāṇa Empire (ca. mid-first to third century A.D.), which gave its patronage to the Sarvāstivāda sect.\"\n\nAvailable evidence indicates that the first Buddhist missions to Khotan were carried out by the Dharmaguptaka sect:\n\nA number of scholars have identified three distinct major phases of missionary activities seen in the history of Buddhism in Central Asia, which are associated with the following sects, chronologically:\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Xuanzang and Yijing both recorded that the Dharmaguptakas were located in Oḍḍiyāna and Central Asia, but not in the Indian subcontinent. Yijing grouped the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and Kāśyapīya together as sub-sects of the Sarvāstivāda, and stated that these three were not prevalent in the \"five parts of India,\" but were located in the some parts of Oḍḍiyāna, Khotan, and Kucha.\n\nThe Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as Iran, Central Asia, and China, and they had great success in doing so. Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka vinaya and ordination lineage for bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs. According to A. K. Warder, in some ways the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present in those East Asian countries. Warder further writes:\n\nDuring the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian Buddhist sects recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the Dharmaguptakas, Mahīśāsakas, Kāśyapīyas, Sarvāstivādins, and the Mahāsāṃghikas.\n\nBetween 250 and 255 CE, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was established in China when Indian monks were invited to help with ordination in China. No full Vinaya had been translated at this time, and only two texts were available: the Dharmaguptaka Karmavācanā for ordination, and the Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa for regulating the life of monks. After the translation of full Vinayas, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was followed by most monks, but temples often regulated monastic life with other Vinaya texts, such as those of the Mahāsāṃghika, the Mahīśāsaka, or the Sarvāstivāda.\n\nIn the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang'an), and that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangtze area and further south. In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao An (654–717). In the early 8th century, Dao An gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and an imperial edict was issued that the sangha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka vinaya for ordination.\n\nThe Gandhāran Buddhist texts (the oldest extant Buddhist manuscripts) are attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect by Richard Salomon, the leading scholar in the field, and the British Library scrolls \"represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in Nagarāhāra.\"\n\nAmong the Dharmaguptaka Gandhāran Buddhist texts in the Schøyen Collection, is a fragment in the Kharoṣṭhī script referencing the Six Pāramitās, a central practice for bodhisattvas in Mahāyāna doctrine.\n\nIn the early 5th century CE, Dharmaguptaka Vinaya was translated into Chinese by the Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas (佛陀耶舍) of Kashmir. For this translation, Buddhayaśas recited the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya entirely from memory, rather than reading it from a written manuscript. After its translation, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya became the predominant vinaya in Chinese Buddhist monasticism. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, or monastic rules, are still followed today in China, Vietnam and Korea, and its lineage for the ordination of monks and nuns has survived uninterrupted to this day. The name of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in the East Asian tradition is the \"Vinaya in Four Parts\" (), and the equivalent Sanskrit title would be \"Caturvargika Vinaya\". Ordination under the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya only relates to monastic vows and lineage (\"Vinaya\"), and does not conflict with the actual Buddhist teachings that one follows (\"Dharma\").\n\nThe \"Dīrgha Āgama\" (\"Long Discourses,\" 長阿含經 \"Cháng Āhán Jīng\") (T. 1) corresponds to the \"Dīgha Nikāya\" of the Theravada school. A complete version of the \"Dīrgha Āgama\" of the Dharmaguptaka sect was translated by Buddhayaśas and Zhu Fonian (竺佛念) in the Later Qin dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sūtras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin \"Dīgha Nikāya\".\n\nThe \"Ekottara Āgama\" (\"Incremental Discourses,\" 增壹阿含經 \"Zēngyī Āhán Jīng\") (T. 125) corresponds to the \"Anguttara Nikāya\" of the Theravāda school. It was translated into Chinese by Dharmanandi in 384 CE, and edited by Gautama Saṃghadeva in 398 CE. Some have proposed that the original text for this translation came from the Sarvāstivādins or the Mahāsāṃghikas. However, according to A.K. Warder, the \"Ekottara Āgama\" references 250 prātimokṣa rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the Mahāsāṃghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant \"Ekottara Āgama\" is that of the Dharmaguptakas.\n\nThe \"Śāriputra Abhidharma Śāstra\" (舍利弗阿毘曇論 \"Shèlìfú Āpítán Lùn\") (T. 1548) is a complete abhidharma text that is thought to come from the Dharmaguptaka sect. The only complete edition of this text is that in Chinese. Sanskrit fragments from this text have been found in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and are now part of the Schøyen Collection (MS 2375/08). The manuscripts at this find are thought to have been part of a monastery library of the Mahāsāṃghika Lokottaravāda sect.\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka \"Tripiṭaka\" is said to have contained two extra sections that were not included by some other schools. These included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a Mantra Piṭaka ( \"Zhòu Zàng\"), also sometimes called a Dhāraṇī Piṭaka. According to the fifth-century Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas, the translator of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the \"Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka\" ( \"Dàchéng Sānzàng\").\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive of all classical biographies of the Buddha, and is entitled \"Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra\". Various Chinese translations of this text date from between the 3rd and 6th century CE.\n\nIt is unknown when some members of the Dharmaguptaka school began to accept the Mahāyāna sūtras, but the \"Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa\" records that Kaniṣka (127-151 CE) of the Kuṣāṇa Empire presided over the establishment of Prajñāpāramitā doctrines in the northwest of India. Tāranātha wrote that in this region, 500 bodhisattvas attended the council at Jālandhra monastery during the time of Kaniṣka, suggesting some institutional strength for Mahāyāna in the northwest during this period. Edward Conze goes further to say that Prajñāpāramitā had great success in the northwest during the Kuṣāṇa period, and may have been the \"fortress and hearth\" of early Mahāyāna, but not its origin, which he associates with the Mahāsāṃghika branch.\n\nJan Nattier writes that available textual evidence suggests that the Mahāyāna \"Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra\" circulated in Dharmaguptaka communities during its early history, but a later translation shows evidence that the text later circulated amongst the Sarvāstivādins as well. The \"Ugraparipṛcchā\" also mentions a fourfold division of the Buddhist canon which includes a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, and the Dharmaguptaka are known to have had such a collection in their canon. Nattier further describes the type of community depicted in the \"Ugraparipṛcchā:\"\n\nThe Mahāyāna \"Ratnarāśivyākaraṇa Sūtra\", which is part of the \"Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra\", is believed by some scholars to have a Dharmaguptaka origin or background, due to its specific regulations regarding giving to the Buddha and giving to the Saṃgha.\n\nAccording to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the \"Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (25,000 lines) and the \"Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (100,000 lines) have a connection with the Dharmaguptaka sect, while the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (8000 lines) does not. Instead, Guang Xing assesses the view of the Buddha given in the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (8000 lines) as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.\n\nThe translator Buddhayaśas was a Dharmaguptaka monk who was known to be a Mahāyānist, and he is recorded as having learned both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna treatises. He translated the \"Dharmaguptaka Vinaya\", the \"Dīrgha Āgama\", and Mahāyāna texts including the \"Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra\" (虛空藏菩薩經 \"Xūkōngzàng Púsà Jīng\"). The preface written by Buddhayaśas for his translation of the \"Dharmaguptaka Vinaya\" states that the Dharmaguptakas had assimilated the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka.\n\nThe Dharmaguptakas were said to have had two extra sections in their canon:\n\n\nIn the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work \"Abhidharmasamuccaya\", Asaṅga refers to the collection which contains the Āgamas as the \"Śrāvakapiṭaka\", and associates it with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the \"Bodhisattvapiṭaka\", which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.\n\nParamārtha, a 6th-century CE Indian monk from Ujjain, unequivocally associates the Dharmaguptaka school with the Mahāyāna, and portrays the Dharmaguptakas as being perhaps the closest to a straightforward Mahāyāna sect.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept of Helen of Troy's eidolon was explored both by Homer and Euripides. However, where Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death, Euripides entangles it with the idea of kleos, one being the product of the other. Both Euripides and Stesichorus, in their respective works concerning the Trojan Horse, claim that Helen was never physically present in the city at all.\n\nThe concept of the eidola of the dead was explored in various literature regarding Penelope, who in later works was constantly laboring against the eidola of Clytamnestra and later Helen herself.\n\nHomer's use of eidola also extends to the Odyssey where, after the death of the suitors, Theoclymenos notes that he sees the doorway of the court filled with them.\n\nWalt Whitman's poem by the same name in 1876 used a much broader understanding of the term, expanded and detailed in the poem.

The city has 88 ghats. Most of the ghats are bathing and puja ceremony ghats, while two ghats are used exclusively as cremation sites.\n\nMost Varanasi ghats were rebuilt after 1700 AD, when the city was part of Maratha Empire. The patrons of current ghats are Marathas, Shindes (Scindias), Holkars, Bhonsles, and Peshwes (Peshwas). Many ghats are associated with legends or mythologies while many ghats are privately owned. Morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a popular visitors attraction.\n\nThe ghats as named and counted by the city of Varanasi with supplementing links, listed in ascending order according to their location (from Assi Ghat to Adi Keshawa Ghat):\n\nPart 1: from Assi Ghat to Prayag Ghat (1–41)\n\nPart 2: from Prayag to Adi Keshawa Ghat (42–84)\n\nAccording to the puranic sources, there are five key ghats on the riverfront, important because of their association with a defining feature of the holy city of \"Kashi\": Assi Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat, Panchganga Ghat and Adi Keshav Ghat.\n\nThis ghat that used to lie at the confluence of the Ganges with the dry river \"Asi\" marks the traditional southern boundary of the city. \"Asisangameshwar\" Temple at the ghat finds mention in the \"Kashi Khand\" of \"Skandmahapuran\".This ghat is very popular because it is one of the very few ghats that is linked with the city through a wide street.Assi ghat name is given as it is the 80th ghat.PM MODI launched water ATM on 17th sep ,2015 on occasion of PM bithday.\n\nDashashwamedh Ghat is located close to Vishwanath Temple, and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu mythologies are associated with it: According to one, Lord Brahma created it to welcome Lord Shiva. According to another, Lord Brahma sacrificed ten horses, during Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna performed here. A group of priests daily perform in the evening at this ghat \"Agni Pooja\" (Worship to Fire) wherein a dedication is made to Lord Shiva, River Ganges, Surya (Sun), Agni (Fire), and the whole universe.\n\nTwo legends are associated with Manikarnika Ghat. According to one, it is believed to be the place where Lord Vishnu dug a pit with his Chakra and filled it with his perspiration while performing various penances. While Lord Shiva was watching Lord Vishnu at that time, the latter's earring (\"manikarnika\") fell into the pit. According to the second legend, in order to keep Lord Shiva from moving around with his devotees, his consort Goddess Parvati hid her earrings, and asked him to find them, saying that they had been lost on the banks of the Ganges. Goddess Parvati's idea behind the fib was that Lord Shiva would then stay around, searching forever for the lost earrings. In this legend, whenever a body gets cremated at the Manikarnika Ghat, Lord Shiva asks the soul whether it has seen the earrings.\n\nAccording to ancient texts, the owner of Manikarnika Ghat bought King Harishchandra as a slave and made him work on the Manikarnika at Harishchandra Ghat. Hindu cremations customarily take place here, though a majority of dead bodies are taken for cremation to the Manikarnik Ghat.\nAccording to other sources that Manikarnik Ghat is named after Jhansi ki Rani Laxmibhai.\n\nScindia Ghat also known as Shinde Ghat borders Manikarnika to the north, with its Shiva temple lying partially submerged in the river as a result of excessive weight of the ghat’s construction about 150 years ago. Above the ghat, several of Kashi’s most influential shrines are located within the tight maze of alleys of Siddha Kshetra (Field of Fulfillment). According to tradition, Agni, the Hindu God of Fire was born here. Hindu devotees propitiate at this place Vireshwara, the Lord of all heroes, for a son.\n\nMana-Mandir Ghat: Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur built this Ghat in 1770, as well as the Jantar Mantar equipped with ornate window casings along with those at Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, and Mathura. There is a fine stone balcony in the northern part of the ghat. Devotees pay homage here to the lingam of Someswar, the Lord of the Moon.\n\nLalita Ghat: The late King of Nepal built this Ghat in the northern region of Varanasi. It is the site of the Ganges Keshav Temple, a wooden temple built in typical Kathmandu style,The temple has an image of Pashupateshwar, a manifestation of Lord Shiva. Local festivals including musical parties and games regularly take place at the beautiful Assi Ghat which is at the end of the continuous line of ghats. It is a favorite site of painters and photographers. It is here at the Assi Ghat that Swami Pranabananda, the founder of Bharat Sevasharam Sangh,attained 'Siddhi' (fulfilment/success) in his 'Tapasya' (endeavor) for Lord Shiva, under the auspices of Guru Gambhirananda of Gorakhpur.\n\nThe Jain Ghat or Bachraj Ghat is a Jain Ghat and has three Jain Temples located on the banks of the River. It is believed that the Jain Maharajas used to own these ghats.Bachraj Ghat has three Jain temples near the river's banks and one them is a very ancient temple of Tirthankara Suparswanath.\n\n\nIn Hindu traditions, cremation is one of the rites of passage and the Ghats of Varanasi are considered one of the auspicious locations for this ritual. At the time of the cremation or \"last rites\", a \"Puja\" (prayer) is performed. Hymns and mantras are recited during cremation to mark the ritual. The Manikarnika and Harishchandra Ghats are dedicated to the cremation ritual. Annually, less than 2 in 1000 people who die in India, or 25,000 to 30,000 bodies are cremated on various Varanasi Ghats; about an average of 80 per day. This practice has become controversial for the pollution it causes to the river. In 1980s, the Government of India funded a Clean Ganges initiative, to address cremation and other sources of pollution along the Ghats of Varanasi. In many cases, the cremation is done elsewhere and only the ashes are dispersed into the river near these Ghats.\n\nUntreated sewage is a pervasive source of river pollution in India. City municipal waste and untreated sewage is the largest source of pollution of Ganges river near the Ghats of Varanasi.\n\n"}

Legend tells that Hunzahúa fell in love with his sister and made her his wife when he left Hunza for Chipatá. Faravita, the mother of the \"zaque\", disagreed with the marriage of her two children and attacked the couple, spilling a bowl of chicha. This created the Hunzahúa Well.

The party had two major leaders representing its two bases of its support. Abbassi Madani appealed to pious small businessmen, and Ali Belhadj appealed to the angry, often unemployed youth of Algeria.\n\nOfficially made legal as a political party in September 1989, less than a year later the FIS received more than half of valid votes cast by Algerians in the 1990 local government elections. When it appeared to be winning a general election in January 1992, a military coup dismantled the party interning thousands of its officials in the Sahara. It was officially banned two months later.\n\nThe founders and leaders of the FIS did not agree on all issues, but agreed on the core objective of establishing an Islamic State ruled by sharia law. FIS hurriedly assembled a platform in 1989, the \"Projet de Programme du Front Islamique du Salut\", which was widely criticized as vague.\n\nIts 1990 electoral victory, giving it control of many local governments, led to the imposing of the veil on female municipal employees; pressuring of liquor stores, video shops and other establishments perceived as un-Islamic to close; segregation of bathing areas by gender.\n\nElimination of the French language and culture was an important issue for many in the FIS such as co-leader Ali Benjadj, who in 1990 declared his intention \"to ban France from Algeria intellectually and ideologically, and be done, once and for all, with those whom France has nursed with her poisoned milk.\" Devout activists removed satellite dishes of households receiving European satellite broadcast in favor of Arab satellite dishes receiving Saudi broadcasts. Educationally, the party was committed to continue the Arabization of the educational system by shifting the language of instruction in more institutions, such as medical and technological schools, from French to Arabic. Large numbers of recent graduates, the first post-independence generation educated mainly in Arabic, liked this measure, as they had found the continued use of French in higher education and public life jarring and disadvantageous.\n\nFollowing the first National Assembly ballot, the FIS issued a second pamphlet. Economically, it strongly criticized Algeria's planned economy, urging the need to protect the private sector and encourage competition – earning it support from traders and small businessmen – and urged the establishment of Islamic banking. However, from leaders Abbasi Hadani and Abdelkader Hachani both made statements opposed opening the country to competition from foreign business.\n\nSocially, it suggested that women should be given a financial incentive to stay at home rather than working outside, thus introducing sexual segregation (Ali Belhadj called it immoral for men and women to work in the same office) with the supposed goal of increasing the number of jobs available to men in a time of chronic unemployment.\n\nPolitically, the contradiction between Madani and Belhadj's words was noteworthy: Madani condemned violence \"from wherever it came\", and expressed his commitment to democracy and resolve to \"respect the minority, even if it is composed of one vote\".\n\nBelhadj said, \"There is no democracy in Islam\" and \"If people vote against the Law of God... this is nothing other than blasphemy. The ulama will order the death of the offenders who have substituted their authority for that of God\".\n\nIn an interview with Daniel Pipes and Patrick Clawson, Anwar Haddam rejected this view of Belhadj, saying, \"He has been misquoted. He has been accused of things out of bitterness. He wrote a book in which he expressed himself clearly in favor of democracy. In it, he writes on page 91 that \"the West progressed by defeating tyranny and preserving freedoms; this is the secret of the Western world's remarkable progress.\" Belhadj refers many times to the Western world and to those very values that people are trying to deny us within our own borders.\"\n\nSocial conditions that led to formation and popularity of the FIS included a population explosion in the 1960s and 70s that outstripped the stagnant economy's ability to supply jobs, housing, food and urban infrastructure to massive numbers of young in the urban areas; a collapse in price of oil, whose sale supplied 95% of Algeria's exports and 60% of the government's budget; a single-party state ostensibly based on socialism, anti-imperialism, and popular democracy but ruled by high level military and party \"nomenklatura\" from the east side of the country; \"corruption on a grand scale\"; and in response to these issues, \"the most serious riots since independence\" occurred in October 1988 when thousands of urban youth took control of the streets.\n\nEarlier Salafist movements in Algeria included the Association of Muslim Ulemas founded in 1931 by Abdel Hamid Ben Badis, which like the Muslim Brotherhood believed that religion should be the \"absolute focus of private life and society\", preached against the \"superstitions\" of popular Islam and French culture or secularism in Algeria, but did not venture into politics or promotion of an Islamic state.\n\nAfter independence the government of Houari Boumediene began a campaign of Arabization and Islamization against the French language which was still dominant in higher education and the professions. It recruited Egyptians to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system, including a substantial number of Muslim Brothers. Many of the generation of \"strictly Arabphone teachers\" trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of a \"Islamist intelligentsia\" that made up the FIS (Ali Belhadj being a prime example).\n\nIn the 1980s the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, Mohammed al-Ghazali and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, to \"strengthen the religious dimension\" of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party's \"nationalist ideology\". However, both clerics were \"fellow travelers\" of the Muslim Brotherhood, supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and supported \"Islamic awakening\" in Algeria, giving only \"lip service\" to the government.\n\nAnother Islamist, Mustafa Bouyali, a \"gifted inflammatory preacher\" and veteran of the Algerian independence struggle, called for the application of the \"sharia\" and creating of an Islamic state by \"jihad\". After persecution by the security services he founded the \"Mouvement Islamique Arme\" (MIA), \"a loose association of tiny groups\", with himself as \"amir\" in 1982. His group carried out a series of \"bold attacks\" against the regime and was able to carry it fight on underground for five years before Bouyali was killed in February 1987.\n\nAlso in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for camps of Peshawar to fight jihad in Afghanistan. As Algeria was a close ally of the jihadists enemy the Soviet Union, these jihadists tended to consider the Afghan jihad a \"prelude\" to jihad against the Algerian FLN. After the Marxist government in Afghanistan fell, many of the salafist-jihadis returned to Algeria and supported the FIS and later the GIA.\n\nAlso adding to the strength of salafist \"Islamic revivalism\" and political Islam in Algeria was the weakness (or nonexistence) of any alternative in the form of popular Muslim brotherhoods which had been dismantled by the FLN government in retaliation for lack of support and whose land had been confiscated and redistributed by the FLN government after independence.\n\nDuring and after the 1988 October Riots Islamists \"set about building bridges to the young urban poor\". The riots \"petered out\" after meetings between the President Chadli and Islamists Ali Belhadj and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nOn November 3, 1988, the Algerian Constitution was amended to allow parties other than the ruling FLN to operate legally. The FIS was born shortly afterwards in Algiers on February 18, 1989, led by an elderly sheikh, Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic young mosque preacher, Ali Belhadj. Its views ranged across a wide (but not complete) spectrum of Islamist opinion, exemplified by its two leaders. Abbassi Madani, a professor at University of Algiers and ex-independence fighter, represented a relatively moderate religious conservatism and symbolically connected the party to the Algerian War of Independence, the traditionally emphasized source of the ruling FLN's legitimacy. His aim was to \"Islamise the regime without altering society's basic fabric.\" The party came into legal existence in September 1989.\n\nAli Belhadj, a high school teacher appealing to a younger and less educated class. An impassioned orator, he was known for his ability to both enrage and calm at will the tens of thousands of young \"hittiestes\" who came to hear him speak. However, his radical speeches alarmed non-Islamists and feminists. He purportedly represents a Salafi (Sunni) branch. Madani sometimes expressed support for multiparty democracy, whereas Belhadj denounced it as a potential threat to sharia. Their support of free market trading and opposition to the ruling elite also attracted middle class traders, who felt left out of the economy.\n\nAs in other Muslim countries where the political system allowed opposition and free elections for the first time, the FIS benefited from being a religious party. Unlike the secular parties it had \"a coherent network of preachers already in place.\"\nIts support base increased rapidly with the help of activists preaching in friendly mosques.\n\nThe FIS made \"spectactular\" progress in the first year of its existence. The first edition of its weekly publication, \"Al Munqidh\", was distributed to 200,000. The FIS-inspired doctors, nurses and rescue teams showed \"devotion and effectiveness\" helping victims of an earthquake in Tipaza Province. It organized marches and rallies and \"applied steady pressure on the state\" to force a promise of early elections.\n\nIn the first free elections since independence on June 12, 1990, they swept the local elections with 54% of votes cast, almost double that of the FLN and far more than any of the other parties. The FIS took 46% of town assemblies and 55% of wilaya assemblies. Its supporters were especially concentrated in urban areas: it secured 93% of towns/cities of over 50,000. This was the \"high point\" of FIS influence. Its rapid rise alarmed the government, which moved to curtail the powers of local government.\n\nOnce in power in local governments, its administration and its Islamic charity was praised by many as just, equitable, orderly and virtuous, in contrast to its corrupt, wasteful, arbitrary and inefficient FLN predecessors.\n\nThe victory in local elections was the \"high point\" of FIS influence, which benefited from widespread disillusionment with the Algerian ruling party. As time went on non-core supporters began to become disenchanted. The secular, educated, salaried urban middle class began to be concerned over the anti-French language policy.\n\nThe Gulf War energized the party, but brought fissures. The FIS had condemned Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, but once it was apparent that Western intervention was inevitable, public opinion shifted and there were massive demonstrations, blood donation drives. When Binhadj delivered a speech in front of the Ministry of Defense building demanding a corp be sent to fight in Iraq's favor, the military took it as a \"direct affront\" and challenged to the discipline in the armed forces. (Binhadj later appealed unsuccessfully to the armed forces rank and file for a general mutiny.) Furthermore, his co-leader Madani had received much aid from Iraq's direct enemies, Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies, supported them and was unhappy about having to defer to Binhadj and the pro-Sadam position.\n\nIn May 1991, the FIS called for a general strike to protest the government's redrawing of electoral districts, which it saw as gerrymandering directed against it. The strike itself was a failure, but the demonstrations FIS organized in Algiers were huge. Mass sit-ins were held in one of Algiers largest squares for a week, and the FIS succeeded in pressuring the government. It was persuaded in June to call the strike off by the promise of fair parliamentary elections.\n\nHowever, disagreements on the strike provoked open dissension among the FIS leadership (the \"Madjliss ech-Choura\"), and the prolonged demonstrations alarmed the military. Shortly afterwards the government arrested Madani and Belhadj on June 30, 1991, having already arrested a number of lower-ranking members. The party, however, remained legal in the meantime, and passed to the effective leadership of \"djazarists\" led by Abdelkader Hachani after four days of contested leadership by Mohamed Said (who was then arrested).\n\nDespite activists anger that its demands for the leaders' release went unheeded, after some deliberation (and expulsion of dissenters such as Said Mekhloufi and Kamareddine Kherbane who advocated direct action against the government), the FIS agreed to participate in the next elections. On December 26, 1991, the FIS won the first round of parliamentary elections, although with one million fewer votes than in the earlier local elections. It won 48% of the overall popular vote, and 188 of the 231 seats contested in that round, putting them far ahead of rivals.\n\nThe army saw the seeming certainty of resulting FIS rule as unacceptable. On January 11, 1992, it cancelled the electoral process, forcing President Chadli Bendjedid to resign and bringing in the exiled independence fighter Mohammed Boudiaf to serve as a new president. Many FIS members were arrested, including FIS number three leader Abdelkader Hachani on January 22. A state of emergency was declared, and the government officially dissolved FIS on March 4. On July 12, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj were sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\n40,000 FIS militants and elected FIS officials were interned in tents deep in the Sahara. Mosques were placed under \"tight surveillance\". Such activists as remained at large took this as a declaration of war, though FIS would not officially call for armed resistance until 1993, attempting to steer a nuanced course of expressing sympathy for the guerrillas without endorsing their actions.\n\nMany took to the hills and joined guerrilla groups. The country inexorably slid into a civil war which would claim more than 250,000 lives, from which it only began to emerge at the end of the 1990s. Initially, the guerrillas were led by members of non-FIS groups, such as Mustafa Bouyali's supporters and people who had fought in Afghanistan, although FIS itself established an underground network, led by Mohamed Said and Abderrezak Redjam, setting up clandestine newspapers and even a radio station with close links to the MIA. From late 1992, they also began issuing official statements from abroad, led by Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam.\n\nSoon after taking office in 1994, Liamine Zeroual began negotiations with the imprisoned FIS leadership, releasing some prisoners (including such figures as Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham) by way of encouragement. These first negotiations collapsed in March, as each accused the other of reneging on agreements; but further, initially secret, negotiations would take place over the following months.\n\nAs the radical Armed Islamic Group (\"Groupe Islamique Armé\" or GIA), hostile to FIS as well as to the government, rose to the forefront, FIS-loyalist guerrillas, threatened with marginalization, attempted to unite their forces. In July 1994, the MIA, together with the remainder of the MEI and a variety of smaller groups, united as the Islamic Salvation Army (or AIS, a term that had previously sometimes been used as a general label for pro-FIS guerrillas), declaring their allegiance to FIS and thus strengthening FIS' hand for the negotiations. It was initially headed by MIA's Abdelkader Chebouti, who was superseded in November 1994 by MEI's Madani Mezrag.\n\nThe GIA jihad strategy was designed to create an atmosphere of general insecurity, and included attacks on civilians. It rejected all truces and compromises with the government. The AIS favored a long-term jihad directed against the state and its representatives, not civilians. The GIA appealed to the \"hittistes\" urban youth, while the AIS support came from the pious middle class.\n\nBy the end of 1994, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) controlled over half the guerrillas of the east and west, but barely 20% in the center, near the capital, where the GIA were mainly based. Their main leadership was based in the Beni Khettab mountains near Jijel. It issued communiqués condemning the GIA's indiscriminate targeting of women, journalists, and other civilians \"not involved in the repression\", and attacking its school arson campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, following letters from Madani and Belhadj expressing a commitment to pluralistic democracy and proposing possible solutions to the crisis, the government released both from jail to house arrest on September 13. However, no let up was observed in the fighting, and the government was unwilling to allow them to consult with FIS figures that remained in prison; the negotiations soon foundered, and at the end of October the government announced the failure of the second round of negotiations, and published incriminating letters from Belhadj that were allegedly found on the body of GIA leader Cherif Gousmi, who had been killed on September 26.\n\nA few FIS leaders, notably Rabah Kebir, had escaped into exile abroad. During 1994, they carried out negotiations in Italy with other political parties, notably the FLN and FFS, and came out with a mutual agreement on January 14, 1995: the Sant'Egidio platform. This set forth a set of principles: respect for human rights and multiparty democracy, rejection of army rule and dictatorship, recognition of Islam, Arabness, and Berberness as essential aspects of Algerianness, demand for the release of FIS leaders, and an end to extrajudicial killing and torture on all sides. To the surprise of many, even Ali Belhadj endorsed the agreement. However, a crucial signatory was missing: the government itself. As a result, the platform had little if any effect.\n\nDespite the government's extremely hostile reaction to the Rome Platform, though, a third attempt at negotiations took place, starting in April with a letter from Madani condemning acts of violence, and hopes were raised. However, the FIS did not offer enough concessions to satisfy the government, demanding, as usual, that FIS leaders should be released before FIS could call for a ceasefire. In July Zeroual announced that the talks had failed, for the last time.\n\nIn 1995, the GIA turned on the AIS in earnest. Reports of battles between the AIS and GIA increased (resulting in an estimated 60 deaths in March 1995 alone), and the GIA reiterated its death threats against FIS and AIS leaders, claiming to be the \"sole prosecutor of jihad\" and angered by their negotiation attempts. On July 11 Abdelbaki Sahraoui, a co-founder of FIS, was assassinated in Paris; the GIA said that they were responsible, although there was no evidence supporting this.\n\nThe AIS, faced with attacks from both sides and wanting to dissociate itself from the GIA's civilian massacres, declared a unilateral ceasefire on September 21, 1997 (in order to \"unveil the enemy who hides behind these abominable massacres\"), and disbanded in 1999. Thousands of AIS fighters surrendered and handed over their weapons to the authorities. In January 2000 those fighters obtained amnesty under the terms of the \"Civil Concord\" decreed by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after his election in April 1999. Both Mezrag and Benaïcha offered their services to the authorities to fight the GIA and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which has links to al-Qaida.\n\nOn July 2, 2003, Belhadj and Madani were released. (The former had been in jail, the latter had been moved to house arrest in 1997) Foreign media were banned from covering the event locally, and FIS itself remains banned. However, their release has had little apparent impact. After a decade of vicious civil conflict, there was little enthusiasm in Algeria for reopening old wounds.\n\nAs the civil war jihad impoverished the pious middle class, the AIS lost support to the \"moderate\" Islamic parties - especially the Hamas party of Mahfoud Nahnah.\n\n\n\n"}

His mother was a Frenchwoman. His early education was obtained at the Jesuit College at Pont-a-Mousson. While there, at the age of nineteen, he wrote a commentary on the \"Thebaid\" of Statius.\n\nThe Jesuits endeavored to induce him to join their order; but his father refused to give his consent and took him to England in 1603.\nBarclay had persistently maintained his Scottish nationality in his French surroundings, and probably found in James VI and I's accession an opportunity which he would not let slip. In early 1604 John Barclay presented James with a Latin poem, \"Kalendae Januariae\", and afterward dedicated to him the first part of his \"Euphormionis Satyricon\" (\"Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon\") against the Jesuits. He returned to France by 1605, when a second edition of that book appeared in Paris, having spent some time in Angers. He was the husband of a Frenchwoman, Louise Debonaire. Barclay and his wife returned to London in 1606, and there published his \"Sylvae\", a collection of Latin poems. In 1607 the second part of the \"Satyricon\" appeared in Paris. In 1616 he went to Rome and resided there until his death on 15 August 1621, aged 39. His departure from England may have been prompted by the threat that his children would be brought up as Protestants, since they had been born in England. To the Catholic Barclay, this was unacceptable. In addition he may have been seeking a more generous patron that the somewhat parsimonious King James. In fact Barclay received a pension of some 150 pounds from the Pope. He wrote his major novel, Argenis, in Rome and, according to his contemporaries, indulged in gardening. He was a member of several learned and literary societies in Rome, including the Accademia dei Lincei. His wife outlived him and died in 1652. One son became bishop of Toul in France and survived until 1673.\n\nIn 1609 Barclay edited the \"De Potestate Papae\", an anti-papal treatise by his father, who had died in the preceding year. In 1611 he issued an \"Apologia\" or \"third part\" of the \"Satyricon\", in answer to the attacks of the Jesuits. A so-called \"fourth part,\" with the title of \"Icon Animorum\", describing the character and manners of the European nations, appeared in 1614.\n\nHe appears to have been on better terms with the Church and notably with Robert Bellarmine, for in 1617 he issued, from a press at Rome, a \"Paraenesis ad Sectarios\", an attack on the position of Protestantism. Later editions were published in Cologne. The literary effort of his closing years was his best-known work the \"Argenis\", a political romance, resembling in certain respects the \"Arcadia\" of Philip Sidney, and the \"Utopia\" of Thomas More. The book was completed about a fortnight before his death, which has been said to have been hastened by poison.\n\nRichard Crashaw's poem, \"Description of a Religious House and Condition of Life\", beginning, \"No roofs of gold o'er riotous tables shining,/Whole days and suns devour'd with endless dining;\" was translated \"Out of Barclay.\"\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his staunch defense of human rights and critical statements regarding the position of the Church during the period of the Argentine dictatorship during the 1970s. He was also known for his promotion of proper economic management when the nation's economic fortunes dwindled and promoted jobs and strong action for the poor and neglected.\n\nThe cause for Novak's beatification started on 19 August 2017; he is titled now as a Servant of God.\n\nJorge Novak was born on 4 March 1928 to Jorge Novak and Christina Prediger; he was of German descent on his maternal side. He had seven brothers\n\nNovak entered the Divine Word Missionaries and made his initial profession on 1 March 1947 and on 1 March 1953 made his solemn profession into the order. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1954 in Bahía Blanca and in 1958 obtained a doctorate in historical sciences from the Pontifical Gregorian in Rome.\n\nIn 1972 he became the provincial superior for the order and held that appointment until his elevation to the episcopate. Pope Paul VI later created the Quilmes diocese through the papal bull \"Cups Regimini\" on 2 August 1976 and appointed Novak as its first bishop on 7 August. Novak received his episcopal consecration on 19 September from Pio Laghi in the new diocese's Immaculate Conception cathedral. There was initial apprehension surrounding his episcopal appointment due to strong rumors of his authoritative professorship in La Plata.\n\nNovak railed against human rights abuses and criticized the dictatorship and the guerillas for their violence and carnage during the period of civil unrest and conflict. He pleaded for proper negotiations and peace in 1982 during the Falklands War. It was after the disappearances of 30 000 people became public that he served as a sort of 'spokesman' for their next of kin asking for investigations and closure for the families of those lost.\n\nHe co-founded the Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights alongside several others in February 1976. In September 1984 he was on a trip in Costa Rica when he was struck with Guillain-Barré and was recuperating to recover his motor skills until 1985.\n\nTowards the end of his life he wrote to the government demanding greater action for the poor and often used strong language in order to force the point across. He was also seen leading demonstrations for jobs and organized soup kitchens in shanties around urban centers. In 2000 he encouraged one of his priests and the prominent social worker Luis Farinello to go into politics to run for a Senate seat in the October congressional elections. Novak issued a decree that authorized Farinello to pursue politics but removed him from all ecclesial responsibilities from his public announcement of his candidature and for the duration of his mandate if elected. The decree cited canon 904 of canon law which allowed Farinello to \"celebrate Mass without the attendance of faithful\" and exhorted Farinello to adhere to the values of the Gospel and the social teachings of the Church.\n\nOn 28 April 1995 he issued a statement asking for forgiveness for the failure of the Argentine priesthood and episcopate to act during the 1970s when people were disappearing and being killed. Novak pleaded for forgiveness \"for our insensitivities\" while also referring to their collective \"cowardice\" and \"omissions\" which he affirmed made them complicit in the actions of the dictatorship. Back in 1991 he was a sharp critic of President Carlos Saul Menem for his decision to pardon Jorge Videla and other jailed leaders of the dictatorship and referred to the pardon as a \"humiliating defeat\" for those who suffered during the dictatorship. In June 2001 he gave his last sermon and discussed the growing economic crisis in which he asked: \"How is it possible that in this day and age there are still people who die from hunger, condemned to illiteracy, and without a roof over their heads?\"\n\nNovak had an operation for stomach cancer (the disease he kept a close secret) and later died from it at 4:00am on 9 July 2001. Twelve bishops attended his funeral as did the apostolic nuncio (later cardinal) Santos Abril y Castelló; the people shouted \"Viva el Padre Jorge\" and \"Viva Monsignor Novak\" as his casket was carried out of the church.\n\nThe cause commenced on 19 August 2017 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared \"nihil obstat\" (no objections) and titled Novak as a Servant of God.

{"id": "1080712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1080712", "title": "Krishna Janmashtami", "text": "Krishna Janmashtami\n\nKrishna Janmashtami (Devanagari , IAST: ), also known simply as Janmashtami or Gokulashtami, is an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It is observed according to Hindu luni-solar calendar, on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) in the month of Shraavana of the lunar Hindu Calendar and Krishna Paksha in the month of Bhadrapad of the lunisolar Hindu Calendar, which overlaps with August and September of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIt is an important festival particularly to the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. Dance-drama enactments of the life of Krishna according to the \"Bhagavata Purana\" (such as Rasa lila or Krishna Lila), devotional singing through the midnight when Krishna is believed to have been born, fasting (\"upavasa\"), a night vigil (\"jagarana\"), and a festival (mahotsava) on the following day are a part of the Janmashtami celebrations. It is celebrated particularly in Mathura and Brindavan, along with major Vaishnava and non-sectarian communities found in Manipur, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other regions.\n\nKrishna Janmashtami is followed by the festival Nandotsav, which celebrates the occasion when Nanda Baba distributed gifts to the community in honour of the birth.\n\nKrishna was the son of Devaki and Vasudeva and his birthday is celebrated by Hindus as Janmashtami, particularly those of the Vaishnavism tradition as he is considered the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Janmashtami is celebrated when Krishna is believed to have been born according to Hindu tradition, which is in Mathura, at midnight on the eighth day of Bhadrapada month (overlaps with August and 3 September in the Gregorian calendar).\n\nKrishna was born in an era of chaos, persecution was rampant, freedoms were denied, evil was everywhere, and when there was a threat to his life by his uncle King Kansa. Immediately following the birth, his father Vasudeva took Krishna across Yamuna, to foster parents in Gokul, named Nanda and Yashoda. This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fast, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night. After Krishna's midnight hour birth, statues of baby Krishna are washed and clothed, then placed in a cradle. The devotees then break their fast, by sharing food and sweets. Women draw tiny foot prints outside their house doors and kitchen, walking towards their house, a symbolism for Krishna's journey into their homes.\n\nHindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples. Major Krishna temples organize recitation of \"Bhagavata Purana\" and \"Bhagavad Gita\". Many communities organize dance-drama events called Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila. The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in Mathura region, in northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami.\n\nJanmashtami (popularly known as \"Gokulashtami\" as in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai and Pune. \"Dahi Handi\" is celebrated every August/September, the day after Krishna Janmashtami. The term literally means \"earthen pot of yoghurt\". The festival gets this popular regional name from legend of baby Krishna. According to it, he would seek and steal milk products such as yoghurt and butter and people would hide their supplies high up out of the baby's reach. Krishna would try all sorts of creative ideas in his pursuit, such as making human pyramids with his friends to break these high hanging pots. This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on Hindu temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god.\n\nIn Maharashtra and other western states in India, this Krishna legend is played out as a community tradition on Janmashtami, where pots of yoghurt are hung high up, sometimes with tall poles or from ropes hanging from second or third level of a building. Per the annual tradition, teams of youth and boys called the \"Govindas\" go around to these hanging pots, climb one over another and form a human pyramid, then break the pot. Girls surround these boys, cheer and tease them while dancing and singing. The spilled contents are considered as \"Prasada\" (celebratory offering). It is a public spectacle, cheered and welcomed as a community event.\n\nIn contemporary times, many Indian cities celebrate this annual Hindu ritual. Youth groups form \"Govinda pathaks\", which compete with each other, especially for prize money on Janamashtami. These groups are called \"mandals\" or \"handis\" and they go around the local areas, attempting to break as many pots as possible every August. Social celebrities and media attends the festivities, while corporations sponsor parts of the event. Cash and gifts are offered for \"Govinda\" teams, and according to The Times of India, in 2014 over 4,000 \"handis\" in Mumbai alone were high hung with prizes, and numerous Govinda teams participated.\n\nPeople in the city of Dwarka in Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to \"Dahi Handi\", called \"Makhan Handi\" (pot with freshly churned butter). Others perform folk dances at temples, sing bhajans, visit the Krishna temples such as at the Dwarkadhish Temple or Nathdwara. In Kutch district region, farmers decorate their bullock carts and take out Krishna processions, with group singing and dancing.\n\nThe carnival-style and playful poetry and works of Dayaram, a scholar of the Pushtimarg of Vaishnavism, is particularly popular during Janmashtami in Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nJanmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as Mathura where Hindu tradition states Krishna was born, and in Vrindavan where he grew up. Vaishnava communities in these cities in Uttar Pradesh, as well as others in the state, as well locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan north celebrate Janmashtami. Krishna temples are decorated and lighted up, they attract numerous visitors on the day, while Krishna devotees hold bhakti events and keep night vigil.\n\nThe festival typically falls as the monsoons in north India have begun retreating, fields laden with crops and rural communities have time to play. In the northern states, Janmashtami is celebrated with the \"Raslila\" tradition, which literally means \"play (lila) of delight, essence (rasa)\". This is expressed as solo or group dance and drama events at Janmashtami, wherein Krishna related compositions are sung, music accompanies the performance, while actors and audience share and celebrate the performance by clapping hands to mark the beat. The childhood pranks of Krishna, and love affairs of Radha-Krishna are particularly popular. According to Christian Roy and other scholars, these Radha-Krishna love stories are Hindu symbolism for the longing and love of human soul for the divine principle and reality it calls Brahman.\n\nIn Jammu, kite flying from roof tops is a part of the celebration on Krishna Janmashtami.\n\nJanmashtami is widely celebrated in the Hindu Vaishnava communities of eastern and northeastern India. The widespread tradition of celebrating Krishna in these regions is credited to the efforts and teachings of 15th and 16th century Sankardev and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They developed philosophical ideas, as well as new forms of performance arts to celebrate the Hindu god Krishna such as Borgeet, Ankia Naat, Sattriya and Bhakti yoga now popular in West Bengal and Assam. Further east, Manipur people developed Manipuri dance form, a classical dance form known for its Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and which like Sattriya includes love-inspired dance drama arts of Radha-Krishna called Raslila. These dance drama arts are a part of Janmashtami tradition in these regions, and as with all classical Indian dances, there contextual roots are in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text \"Natya Shastra\", but with influences from the culture fusion between India and southeast Asia.\nOn Janmashtami, parents dress up their children as characters in the legends of Krishna, such as gopis and as Krishna. Temples and community centers are decorated with regional flowers and leaves, while groups recite or listen to the tenth chapter of \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Bhagavata Gita\".\n\nJanmashtami is a major festival celebrated with fasts, vigil, recitation of scriptures and Krishna prayers in Manipur. Raslila performances (also referred to as \"Rasleela\" or \"Manipuri Ras\") are a notable annual tradition around Janmashtami. Children play the \"Likol Sannaba\" game in the Meetei Vaishnava community.\n\nThe Shree Govindajee Temple and the ISKCON temples particularly mark the Janmashtami festival. Janmashtami is celebrated in Assam at homes, in community centers called Namghars (Assamese: নামঘৰ), and the temples usually though Janmaashtami. According to the tradition, the devotees sing the \"Nam\", perform pujas and sharing food and \"Prasada\".\n\nIn the eastern state of Odisha, in the region around Puri and in Nabadwip, West Bengal, the festival is also referred to as \"Sri Krishna Jayanti\" or simply \"Sri Jayanti\". People celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" is recited from the 10th chapter, a section dedicated to the life of Krishna. The next day is called \"Nanda Utsav\" or the joyous celebration of Krishna's foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. On this day, people break their fast and offer various cooked sweets after midnight.\n\n Gokula Ashtami (Janmashtami or Sri Krishna Jayanti) celebrates the birthday of Krishna. Gokulashtami is celebrated with great fervor in South India.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the people decorate the floor with kolams (decorative pattern drawn with rice batter). Geetha Govindam and other such devotional songs are sung in praise of Krishna. Then they draw the footprints of Krishna from the threshold of the house till the pooja room, which depicts the arrival of Krishna into the house. A recitation of Bhagwadgita is also a popular practise. The offerings made to Krishna include fruits, betel and butter. Savories believed to be Krishna's favorites are prepared with great care. The most important of them are Seedai, Sweet Seedai, Verkadalai Urundai. The festival is celebrated in the evening as Krishna was born at midnight. Most people observe a strict fast on this day and eat only after the midnight puja. They also dress the youngest of male child in their family like Krishna and perform oonjal, or swing, which is rocked gently and prasadam offered first to them.\nIn Andhra Pradesh, recitation of shlokas and devotional songs are the characteristics of this festival. Another unique feature of this festival is that young boys are dress up as Krishna and they visit neighbors and friends. Different varieties of fruits and sweets are first offered to Krishna and after the puja, these sweets are distributed among the visitors. The people of Andhra Pradesh observe a fast too.Various kinds of sweets are made to offer Gokulnandan on this day. Eatables along with milk and curd are prepared to make offerings to Krishna. Joyful chanting of 's name takes place in quite a few temples of the state. The number of temples dedicated to Krishna are few. The reason being that people have taken to worship him through paintings and not idols.\n\nPopular south Indian temples dedicated for Krishna are Rajagopalaswamy Temple in Mannargudi in the Tiruvarur district, Pandavadhoothar temple in Kanchivaram, Sri Krishna temple at Udupi, and the Krishna temple at Guruvayur are dedicated to the memory of Vishnu's incarnation as Krishna. Legend says that the Sree Krishna Idol installed in Guruvayur is from Dwarka which is believed to be submerged in the sea.\n\nAbout eighty percent of the population of Nepal identify themselves as Hindus and celebrate Krishna Janmashtami. They observe Janmashtami by fasting until midnight. The devotees recite the Bhagavad Gita and sing religious songs called bhajans and kirtans. The temples of Krishna are decorated. Shops, posters and houses carry Krishna motifs.\n\nJanmashtami is a national holiday in Bangladesh. On Janmashtami, a procession starts from Dhakeshwari Temple in Dhaka, the National Temple of Bangladesh, and then proceeds through the streets of Old Dhaka. The procession dates back to 1902, but was stopped in 1948 following the establishment of Pakistan and subsequent attacks by Muslim mobs in Dhaka. The procession was resumed in 1989.\n\nAt least a quarter of the population in Fiji practices Hinduism, and this holiday has been celebrated in Fiji since the first Indian indentured labourers landed there. Janmastami in Fiji is known as \"Krishna Ashtami\". Most Hindus in Fiji have ancestors that originated from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu, making this an especially important festival for them. Fiji's Janmastami celebrations are unique in that they last for eight days, leading up to the eighth day, the day Krishna was born. During these eight days, Hindus gather at homes and at temples with their 'mandalis,' or devotional groups at evenings and night, and recite the Bhagavat Purana, sing devotional songs for Krishna, and distribute Prasadam.\n\nJanmashtami is celebrated by Pakistani Hindus in the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Karachi with the singing of bhajans and delivering of sermons on Krishna.\n\nIn Arizona, United States, Governor Janet Napolitano was the first American leader to greet a message on Janmashtami, while acknowledging ISKCON. The festival is also celebrated widely by Hindus in Caribbean in the countries of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and the former British colony Fiji as well as the former Dutch colony of Suriname. The Hindus in these countries originated from Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh and are the descendants of indentured immigrants from Tamil Nadu, UP, Bihar, Bengal and Orissa.\n\nISKCON temples worldwide celebrate Krishna Janmashtami, as well the birthday of ISKCON founder Swami Prabhupada (1 September 1896).\n\n\n\n"}

Two of his encylicals, \"Mater et magistra\" and \"Pacem in terris\", are especially important. An encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops in a particular area or of the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances on the content and is not necessarily infallible. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.\n\nPope John XXIII's first encyclical, \"Ad Petri cathedram\", was issued eight months into his pontificate and was neither an important social document nor doctrinal exposition. Instead it looked at truth, unity and peace with distinctive familiarity and concern. The second, \"Sacerdotii nostri primordia\", commemorated the 100th anniversary of the death of St. John Vianney, while \"Grata recordatio\" considered the use of the Rosary. \"Princeps pastorum\", his fourth encyclical, used as its biblical text and celebrated Roman Catholic missions.\n\n\"Mater et magistra\", the fifth encyclical, carried forward ideas from Leo XIII's \"Rerum novarum\" (1891), which had been issued 70 years before, and Pius XI's \"Quadragesimo anno\" (1931). It considers social ethics with its most important point being the application of natural law to the international community. It is one of the longest encyclicals, at more than 25,000 words. The sixth encyclical, \"Aeterna Dei sapientia\", commemorated the death of Pope Leo I and called for unity within Christendom from external movements such as Communism and secularism. The penultimate encyclical, \"Paenitentiam agere\", considered penance and the then-upcoming Second Vatican Council. Pope John XXIII's final encyclical, \"Pacem in terris\", was written two months before his death. It is long—over 15,000 words—and is the first in history to have been addressed to \"all men of good will\", rather than only the bishops and laity of the Roman Catholic Church. It was hailed as \"one of the most profound and significant documents of our age.\"\n\n"}

Large churches from other denominations, like catholic, are not included as they are not deemed to belong to the megachurch phenomenon which by definition is part of Protestantism. The list is not exhaustive, there are large annual changes, and there are difficulties to compare the churches as different methods to count can be used.\n\nThe term megachurch is used for churches with regular attendance of 2,000 people. When it has more than 10,000 people who gather together, the term \"gigachurch\" is sometimes used.\n\nChurch Growth Today is a research center who publishes annually lists of evangelical Christian megachurches in USA and the world.\n\nLifeway research is a research center who publishes annually a list of evangelical Christian megachurches in USA.\n\nThe Leadership Network contains a directory of all Christian megachurches of the world (excluding Canada and USA). This global list has over 270 megachurches. The Hartford Institute has compiled directories in Canada and the USA. The US list has more than 1,668 megachurches and the Canadian list 22.\n\nThe numbers reported are not accurate by any means, as attendance and membership may be defined very differently. Attendance may include people that are not legally members of the church, not baptised, non-believers, children, and may even belong to other churches. Some churches include their, sometimes loosely, affiliated churches in other places and even people that attend by electronic media. As many have several services on one day, there may be some overlap, with people attending more than one service. The exact number of people is seldom counted, thus estimation errors can occur. There is an obvious psychological boost from reporting growing numbers, \"success\", for enhanced credibility and motivation to support the work. The megachurches may quite be different from traditional evangelical congregations where clear membership records are maintained, to define who has legal right to vote in the church assembly, who can be appointed to public offices and who belongs to the flock under direct pastoral care, and the pastor can often be replaced. The megachurches are often formed around a strong leader that stays in charge for decades, it is often like his \"own personal enterprise\", many times with limited economic transparency, a tendency that has been questioned in various countries. In notable cases the headship has been passed on from father to son, like in Lakewood Church. Many megachurches have had an affiliation to a denomination, but have become independent, thus outside the denominational supervision that is common for non-independent congregations. Thus, in cases of irregularities, a pastor may continue without disciplinary measures, due to their sheer power, and any disappointed members may leave but new people keep coming in, with reduced effect on attendance.\n\nHence, due to inaccuracies, the same church can sometimes be reported to have attendance and membership counts that differ 5-10 times, depending on how reporting is done and who is doing it, e.g. Yoido Full Gospel Church can sometimes be mentioned with attendance numbers over 800,000.\n\nThe list below is of the largest Evangelical megachurches with weekly attendance of more than 30,000 persons. \n\nContent on this page has been translated from the existing French Wikipedia article at ; see its history for attribution.\n\n\n\n"}

Jesus has come to John the Baptist to be baptized, but John balked at this, saying that he should be the one baptized. In this verse, Jesus explains why it is right that He should be baptized.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibRef Matthew 3:15\n\nThese are the first words spoken by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. Since traditionally the Gospel of Matthew is placed as the first book of the New Testament, these are textually the first words spoken by Jesus in the entire Bible. However they are not very well known or much quoted. Scholars have paid considerable attention to them, mainly because of their vagueness.\n\nAs it was the first Gospel that was written according to general scholarship, the first recorded words of Jesus are actually in Mark 1:15: “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. So mετανοείτε, and believe in the gospel.”\n\nLike the previous verse this one only occurs in Matthew. Many scholars see this section as an add-on attempting to explain why the messiah is baptized by someone much lower than he is. The phrase \"fulfill all righteousness\" is a problematic one. Righteousness is an important concept in Matthew and it generally means obedience to God. Matthew also often uses the word \"fulfill\", almost always referring to an Old Testament prophecy which Jesus is fulfilling. David Hill notes that the phrase could thus be interpreted as Jesus fulfilling divine rules of which only he is aware. Cullman emphasizes the word \"all\" and argues that Jesus' baptism is to obtain righteousness for all humanity. Jesuit theologian Daniel Harrington links the fulfillment not to the Old Testament but to the discussion of fruits of repentance at .\n\nA second important issue is why Jesus, who is sinless, should go through a ritual that is designed to cleanse all sins. There are two main explanations of this. One is that Jesus by being baptized is setting a good example for the rest of humanity, that while he does not himself need the cleansing he is showing how important it is for others. The second view is that Jesus' being baptized is part of the process of taking on the burden of the sins of all humanity. German theologian Heinrich Meyer lists and evaluates a number of reasons offered for why Jesus came to be baptized by John.\n\nThe Book of Mormon provides an additional perspective on these two issues, explaining that Jesus \"fulfilled all righteousness\" by humbly witnessing that he would obey the Father, thus setting an example for how \"the children of men\" should live. \n\nSeveral of the Fathers of the Church infer from the words \"it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness\" that John was afterwards baptized by Jesus.\n"}

{"id": "24136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24136", "title": "Process theology", "text": "Process theology\n\nProcess theology is a type of theology developed from Alfred North Whitehead's (1861–1947) process philosophy, most notably by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000) and John B. Cobb (b. 1925). Process theology and process philosophy are collectively referred to as \"process thought\".\n\nFor both Whitehead and Hartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to affect and be affected by temporal processes, contrary to the forms of theism that hold God to be in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging (immutable), and unaffected by the world (impassible). Process theology does not deny that God is in some respects eternal (will never die), immutable (in the sense that God is unchangingly good), and impassible (in the sense that God's eternal aspect is unaffected by actuality), but it contradicts the classical view by insisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and passible.\n\nAccording to Cobb, \"process theology may refer to all forms of theology that emphasize event, occurrence, or becoming over against substance. In this sense theology influenced by Hegel is process theology just as much as that influenced by Whitehead. This use of the term calls attention to affinities between these otherwise quite different traditions.\" Also Pierre Teilhard de Chardin can be included among process theologians, even if they are generally understood as referring to the Whiteheadian/Hartshornean school, where there continue to be ongoing debates within the field on the nature of God, the relationship of God and the world, and immortality.\n\nVarious theological and philosophical aspects have been expanded and developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000), John B. Cobb, Jr., and David Ray Griffin. A characteristic of process theology each of these thinkers shared was a rejection of metaphysics that privilege \"being\" over \"becoming\", particularly those of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Hartshorne was deeply influenced by French philosopher Jules Lequier and by Swiss philosopher Charles Secrétan who were probably the first ones to claim that in God liberty of becoming is above his substantiality.\n\nProcess theology soon influenced a number of Jewish theologians including Rabbis Max Kadushin, Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky and, to a lesser degree, Abraham Joshua Heschel. Today some rabbis who advocate some form of process theology include Bradley Shavit Artson, Lawrence A. Englander, William E. Kaufman, Harold Kushner, Anton Laytner, Michael Lerner, Gilbert S. Rosenthal, Lawrence Troster, Donald B. Rossoff, Burton Mindick, and Nahum Ward.\n\nAlan Anderson and Deb Whitehouse have applied process theology to the New Thought variant of Christianity.\n\nThe work of Richard Stadelmann has been to preserve the uniqueness of Jesus in process theology.\n\nWhitehead's classical statement is a set of antithetical statements that attempt to avoid self-contradiction by shifting them from a set of oppositions into a contrast:\n\n\n\nHenry Young combines Black theology and Process theology in his book \"Hope in Process\". Young seeks a model for American society that goes beyond the alternatives of integration of Blacks into white society and Black separateness. He finds useful the process model of the many becoming one. Here the one is a new reality that emerges from the discrete contributions of the many, not the assimilation of the many to an already established one.\n\nMonica Coleman has combined Womanist theology and Process theology in her book \"Making a Way Out of No Way\". In it, she argues that 'making a way out of no way' and 'creative transformation' are complementary insights from the respective theological traditions. She is one of many theologians who identify both as a process theologian and feminist/womanist/ecofeminist theologian, which includes persons such as Sallie McFague, Rosemary Radford Ruether, and Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki.\n\nC. Robert Mesle, in his book \"Process Theology\", outlines three aspects of a process theology of liberation:\n\n\nProcess theology affirms that God is working in all persons to actualize potentialities. In that sense each religious manifestation is the Divine working in a unique way to bring out the beautiful and the good. Additionally, scripture and religion represent human interpretations of the divine. In this sense pluralism is the expression of the diversity of cultural backgrounds and assumptions that people use to approach the Divine.\n\nContrary to Christian orthodoxy, the \"Christ\" of mainstream process theology is not the mystical and historically exclusive union of divine and human natures in one hypostasis, the eternal Logos of God uniquely enfleshed in and identifiable as the man Jesus. Rather God is incarnate in the lives of all people when they act according to a call from God. Jesus fully and in every way responded to God's call, thus the person of Jesus is theologically understood as \"the divine Word in human form.\" Jesus is not singularly or essentially God, but he was perfectly synchronized to God at all moments of life. Cobb expressed the Incarnation in process terms that link it to his understanding of actualization of human potential: \"'Christ' refers to the Logos as incarnate hence as the process of creative transformation in and of the world\".\n\nA criticism of process theology is that it offers a too severely diminished conception of God’s power. Process theologians argue that God does not have unilateral, coercive control over everything in the universe. In process theology, God cannot override a person’s freedom, nor perform miracles that violate the laws of nature, nor perform physical actions such as causing or halting a flood or an avalanche. Critics argue that this conception diminishes divine power to such a degree that God is no longer worshipful.\n\nThe process theology response to this criticism is that the traditional Christian conception of God is actually \"not\" worshipful as it stands, and that the traditional notion of God’s omnipotence fails to make sense.\n\nFirst, power is a relational concept. It is not exerted in a vacuum, but always by some entity \"A\" over some other entity \"B\". As such, power requires analysis of both the being exerting power, and the being that power is being exerted upon. To suppose that an entity \"A\" (in this case, God), can always successfully control any other entity \"B\" is to say, in effect, that \"B\" does not exist as a free and individual being in any meaningful sense, since there is no possibility of its resisting \"A\" if \"A\" should decide to press the issue.\n\nMindful of this, process theology makes several important distinctions between different kinds of power. The first distinction is between \"coercive\" power and \"persuasive\" power. Coercive power is the kind that is exerted by one physical body over another, such as one billiard ball hitting another, or one arm twisting another. Lifeless bodies (such as the billiard balls) cannot resist such applications of physical force at all, and even living bodies (like arms) can only resist so far, and can be coercively overpowered. While finite, physical creatures can exert coercive power over one another in this way, God—lacking a physical body—\"cannot\" (not merely \"will\" not) exert coercive control over the world.\n\nBut process theologians argue that coercive power is actually a secondary or derivative form of power, while persuasion is the primary form. Even the act of self-motion (of an arm, for instance) is an instance of persuasive power. The arm may not perform in the way a person wishes it to—it may be broken, or asleep, or otherwise unable to perform the desired action. It is only after the persuasive act of self-motion is successful that an entity can even \"begin\" to exercise coercive control over other finite physical bodies. But no amount of coercive control can alter the free decisions of other entities; only persuasion can do so.\n\nFor example, a child is told by his parent that he must go to bed. The child, as a self-conscious, decision-making individual, can always make the decision to \"not\" go to bed. The parent may then respond by picking up the child bodily and carrying him to his room, but nothing can force the child to alter his decision to resist the parent's directive. It is only the \"body\" of the child that can be coercively controlled by the body of the physically stronger parent; the child's free will remains intact. While process theologians argue that God does not have coercive power, they also argue that God has \"supreme persuasive power\", that God is always influencing/persuading us to choose the good.\n\nOne classic exchange over the issue of divine power is between philosophers Frederick Sontag and John K. Roth and process theologian David Ray Griffin. Sontag and Roth argued that the process God’s inability to, for instance, stop the genocide at Auschwitz meant that God was not worthy of worship, since there is no point in worshipping a God that cannot save us from such atrocities. Griffin's response was as follows:\n\nOne of the stronger complaints from Sontag and Roth is that, given the enormity of evil in the world, a deity that is [merely] doing its best is not worthy of worship. The implication is that a deity that is \"not\" doing its best \"is\" worthy of worship. For example, in reference to Auschwitz, Roth mocks my God with the statement that “the best that God could possibly do was to permit 10,000 Jews a day to go up in smoke.” Roth prefers a God who had the power to prevent this Holocaust but did not do it! This illustrates how much people can differ in what they consider worthy of worship. For Roth, it is clearly brute \"power\" that evokes worship. The question is: is this what \"should\" evoke worship? To refer back to the point about revelation: is this kind of power worship consistent with the Christian claim that divinity is decisively revealed in Jesus? Roth finds my God too small to evoke worship; I find his too gross.\n\nThe process argument, then, is that those who cling to the idea of God's coercive omnipotence are defending power for power's sake, which would seem to be inconsistent with the life of Jesus, who Christians believe died for humanity's sins rather than overthrow the Roman empire. Griffin argues that it is actually the God whose omnipotence is defined in the \"traditional\" way that is not worshipful.\n\nOne other distinction process theologians make is between the idea of \"unilateral\" power versus \"relational\" power. Unilateral power is the power of a king (or more accurately, a tyrant) who wishes to exert control over his subjects \"without\" being affected \"by\" them. However, most people would agree that a ruler who is not changed or affected by the joys and sorrows of his subjects is actually a despicable ruler and a psychopath. Process theologians thus stress that God’s power is relational; rather than being unaffected and unchanged by the world, God is the being \"most\" affected by every other being in the universe. As process theologian C. Robert Mesle puts it:\n\nRelational power takes great strength. In stark contrast to unilateral power, the radical manifestations of relational power are found in people like Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus. It requires the willingness to endure tremendous suffering while refusing to hate. It demands that we keep our hearts open to those who wish to slam them shut. It means offering to open up a relationship with people who hate us, despise us, and wish to destroy us.\n\nIn summation, then, process theologians argue that their conception of God’s power does not diminish God, but just the opposite. Rather than see God as one who unilaterally coerces other beings, judges and punishes them, and is completely unaffected by the joys and sorrows of others, process theologians see God as the one who persuades the universe to love and peace, is supremely affected by even the tiniest of joys and the smallest of sorrows, and is able to love all beings despite the most heinous acts they may commit. God is, as Whitehead says, \"the fellow sufferer who understands.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "507197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507197", "title": "Psychology of religion", "text": "Psychology of religion\n\nStrictly speaking, psychology of religion consists of the application of psychological methods and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of the religious traditions as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the natural-scientific and human-scientific approaches: the first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.\n\nPsychologists of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The psychology of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.\n\nThe challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes—the fruits, as William James put it—of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society. These fruits may be both positive and negative.\n\nThe first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms—above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.\n\nIn the last several decades, especially among clinical psychologists, a preference for the terms \"spirituality\" and \"spiritual\" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from \"religion\" and \"religious.\" Especially in the United States, \"religion\" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; \"spirituality,\" in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities. In fact, \"spirituality\" has likewise undergone an evolution in the West, from a time when it was essentially a synonym for religion in its original, subjective meaning. \nToday, efforts are ongoing to \"operationalize\" these terms, with little regard for their history in their Western context, and with the apparent realist assumption that underlying them are fixed qualities identifiable using empirical procedures.\n\nSchnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also weaved into social communities.\n\nAmerican psychologist and philosopher William James (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field. He served as president of the \"American Psychological Association\", and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His \"Varieties of Religious Experience\" is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.\n\nJames distinguished between institutional religion and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has mystical experience, can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.\n\nIn studying personal religious experiences, James made a distinction between \"healthy-minded\" and \"sick-souled\" religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of Walt Whitman and the \"mind-cure\" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\". In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from Leo Tolstoy and John Bunyan to illustrate the sick soul.\n\nWilliam James' hypothesis of pragmatism stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work The Phenomenology of Spirit was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.\n\nSigmund Freud (1856–1939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In \"Totem and Taboo\", he applied the idea of the Oedipus complex (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.\n\nIn \"Moses and Monotheism\", Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in \"The Future of an Illusion\". When Freud spoke of religion as an illusion, he maintained that it \"is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity.\"\n\nFreud views the idea of God as being a version of the father image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and neurotic. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.\n\nThe Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875–1961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of religious symbolism. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of agnosticism.\n\nJung postulated, in addition to the personal unconscious (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the collective unconscious, which is the repository of human experience and which contains \"archetypes\" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of religious experience and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal symbols, and include his work in comparative mythology.\n\nAustrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his \"Individual Psychology\". One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.\n\nOur ideas about God are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.\n\nAn important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.\n\nCompared to science, another social movement, religion is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.\n\nIn his classic book \"The Individual and His Religion\" (1950), Gordon Allport (1897–1967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways. He makes a distinction between \"Mature religion\" and\n\"Immature religion\". Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is self-serving and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.\nMore recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms \"intrinsic religion\", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout faith, and \"extrinsic religion\", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as church attendance to gain social status. These dimensions of religion were measured on the Religious Orientation Scale of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by Daniel Batson. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\nMore specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\n\nErik Erikson (1902–1994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of identity in personality. His biographies of Gandhi and Martin Luther reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful personality development because they are the primary way that cultures promote the virtues associated with each stage of life. Religious rituals facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.\n\nThe American scholar Erich Fromm (1900–1980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book \"Psychoanalysis and Religion\" he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the Oedipus complex as based not so much on sexuality as on a \"much more profound desire\", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.\n\nAccording to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.\n\nRudolf Otto (1869–1937) was a German Protestant theologian and scholar of comparative religion. Otto's most famous work, \"The Idea of the Holy\" (published first in 1917 as \"Das Heilige\"), defines the concept of the holy as that which is \"numinous\". Otto explained the numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self.\" It is a mystery (Latin: \"mysterium tremendum\") that is both fascinating (\"fascinans\") and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction of wonder drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of grace. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.\n\nIt also sets a paradigm for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.\n\nAutobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as Ralph W. Hood and Donald Capps.\n\nAllen Bergin is noted for his 1980 paper \"Psychotherapy and Religious Values,\" which is known as a landmark in scholarly acceptance that religious values do, in practice, influence psychotherapy. He received the Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge award from the American Psychological Association in 1989 and was cited as challenging \"psychological orthodoxy to emphasize the importance of values and religion in therapy.\"\n\nRobert Emmons offered a theory of \"spiritual strivings\" in his 1999 book, \"The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns\". With support from empirical studies, Emmons argued that spiritual strivings foster personality integration because they exist at a higher level of the personality.\n\nRalph W. Hood Jr.\n\nRalph W. Hood Jr. is a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He is a former editor of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion and a former co-editor of the Archive for the Psychology of Religion and The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion. He is Past President of Division 36 of the American Psychological Association and a recipient of its William James Award. He has published several hundred articles and book chapters on the psychology of religion and has authored, co-authored, or edited thirteen volumes, all dealing with the psychology of religion.\n\nKenneth Pargament is noted for his book \"Psychology of Religion and Coping\" (1997; see article), as well as for a 2007 book on religion and psychotherapy, and a sustained research program on religious coping. He is professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University (Ohio, US), and\nhas published more than 100 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology. Pargament led the design of a questionnaire called the \"RCOPE\" to measure Religious Coping strategies. Pargament has distinguished between three types of styles for coping with stress:\n1) Collaborative, in which people co-operate with God to deal with stressful events;\n2) Deferring, in which people leave everything to God; and\n3) Self-directed, in which people do not rely on God and try exclusively to solve problems by their own efforts. He also describes four major stances toward religion that have been adopted by psychotherapists in their work with clients, which he calls the religiously \"rejectionist\", \"exclusivist\", \"constructivist\", and \"pluralist\" stances.\n\nJames Hillman, at the end of his book \"Re-Visioning Psychology\", reverses James' position of viewing religion through psychology, urging instead that we view psychology as a variety of religious experience. He concludes: \"Psychology as religion implies imagining all psychological events as effects of Gods in the soul.\"\n\nJulian Jaynes, primarily in his book \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\", proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.\n\nThere are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.\n\nThe first hypothesis, secularization, holds that science and technology will take the place of religion. Secularization supports the separation of religion from politics, ethics, and psychology. Taking this position even further, Taylor explains that secularization denies transcendence, divinity, and rationality in religious beliefs.\n\nChallenges to the secularization hypothesis led to significant revisions, resulting in the religious transformation hypothesis. This perspective holds that general trends towards individualism and social disintegration will produce changes in religion, making religious practice more individualized and spiritually focused. This in turn is expected to produce more spiritual seeking, although not exclusive to religious institutions. Eclecticism, which draws from multiple religious/spiritual systems and New Age movements are also predicted to result.\n\nIn response to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges on the premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization due to a lack of need for religion. However, religion continues in the third world where social and economic insecurity is rampant. The overall effect is expected to be a growing cultural disparity.\n\nThe idea that religiosity arises from the human need for security has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by the idea that people are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness\n\nIn the experimental setting, researchers have also tested compensatory control in regard to individuals' perceptions of external systems, such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues found that in a laboratory setting, individuals are more likely to endorse broad external systems (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person's personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.\n\nSince the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of psychometrics to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the Religious Orientation Scale of Allport and Ross, which measures how respondents stand on intrinsic and extrinsic religion as described by Allport.\nMore recent questionnaires include the Age-Universal I-E Scale of Gorsuch and Venable, the Religious Life Inventory of Batson, Schoenrade and Ventis, and the Spiritual Experiences Index-Revised of Genia. The first provides an age-independent measure of Allport and Ross's two religious orientations. The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.\n\nSome questionnaires, such as the Religious Orientation Scale, relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.\n\nWhat we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.\n\nAn objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.\n\nThe Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.\n\nMany have looked at stage models, like those of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.\n\nThe best known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of James W. Fowler, a developmental psychologist at the Candler School of Theology, in his \"Stages of Faith\". He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of faith (or spiritual development) across the lifespan.\n\nThe book-length study contains a framework and ideas which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in religion, so it appears to have face validity. James Fowler proposes six stages of faith development:\n\n1. Intuitive-projective\n2. Symbolic Literal\n3. Synthetic Conventional\n4. Individuating\n5. Paradoxical (conjunctive)\n6. Universalising.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).\n\nFowler's scientific research has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of cognitive development. The tables and graphs in the book were presented in such a way that the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of statistical verification of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of academic religion, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies.\n\nOther theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.\n\nResearchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence. One hypothesis is the correspondence hypothesis, which posits that individuals with secure parental attachment are more likely to experience a gradual conversion experience. Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis, which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. \nResearchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversation experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.\n\nJames Alcock summarizes a number of components of what he calls the \"God engine,\" a \"number of automatic processes and cognitive biases [that] combine to make supernatural belief the automatic default.\" These include magical thinking, agency detection, theory of mind that leads to dualism, the notion that \"objects and events [serve] an intentional purpose,\" etc.\n\nEvolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.\n\nPascal Boyer is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book \"Religion Explained\", Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious consciousness. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists Dan Sperber and Scott Atran, who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.\n\nReligious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.\n\nBoyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream cognitive psychology and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.\n\nFor Steven Pinker the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that adaptationist explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.\n\nReligious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of prayer. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.\n\nPrayer is fairly prevalent in the United States. About 75% of the United States reports praying at least once a week. However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized factor analysis to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka's first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).\n\nDein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.\n\nPrayer appears to have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also positively correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of \"social touch\" actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased blood flow to the head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.\n\nThree main pathways to explain this trend have been offered: placebo effect, focus and attitude adjustment, and activation of healing processes. These offerings have been expanded by Breslan and Lewis (2008) who have constructed a five pathway model between prayer and health with the following mediators: physiological, psychological, placebo, social support, and spiritual. The spiritual mediator is a departure from the rest in that its potential for empirical investigation is not currently feasible. Although the conceptualizations of chi, the universal mind, divine intervention, and the like breach the boundaries of scientific observation, they are included in this model as possible links between prayer and health so as to not unnecessarily exclude the supernatural from the broader conversation of psychology and religion. (However, whether the activation of healing processes explanation is supernatural or biological, or even both, is beyond the scope of this study and this article.)\n\nAnother significant form of religious practice is ritual. Religious rituals encompass a wide array of practices, but can be defined as the performance of similar actions and vocal expressions based on prescribed tradition and cultural norms. Examples include the Jewish Bar Mitzvah, Christian Holy Eucharist, Hindu Puja, and Muslim Salat and Hajj.\n\nScheff suggests that ritual provides catharsis, emotional purging, through distancing. This emotional distancing enables an individual to experience feelings with an amount of separation, and thus less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to catharsis through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression. This focus on connection contrasts to the separation that seems to underlie Scheff's view.\n\nAdditional research suggests the social component of ritual. For instance, findings suggest that ritual performance indicates group commitment and prevents the uncommitted from gaining membership benefits. Ritual may aid in emphasizing moral values that serve as group norms and regulate societies. It may also strengthen commitment to moral convictions and likelihood of upholding these social expectations. Thus, performance of rituals may foster social group stability.\n\nThere is considerable literature on the relationship between religion and health. More than 3000 empirical studies have examined relationships between religion and health, including more than 1200 in the 20th century, and more than 2000 additional studies between 2000 and 2009.\n\nPsychologists consider that there are various ways in which religion may benefit both physical and mental health, including encouraging healthy lifestyles, providing social support networks and encouraging an optimistic outlook on life; prayer and meditation may also help to benefit physiological functioning. Nevertheless, religion is not a unique source of health and well-being, and there are benefits to nonreligiosity as well. The journal \"American Psychologist\" published important papers on this topic in 2003.\nHaber, Jacob and Spangler have considered how different dimensions of religiosity may relate to health benefits in different ways.\n\nSome studies have examined whether there is a \"religious personality.\" Research suggests that people who identify as religious are more likely to be high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low on psychoticism, but unrelated to other Big Five traits. However, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to be low on Openness. Similarly, people who identify as spiritual are more likely to be high on Extroversion and Openness, although this varied based on the type of spirituality endorsed.\n\nTo investigate the salience of religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some studies have shown that greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.\n\nRecently, reparative or conversion therapy, a term used to describe a therapeutic process to change an individuals sexuality has been the subject of scrutiny and has been condemned by some governments, LGBT charities and therapy/counselling professional bodies.\n\nThe American psychologist James H. Leuba (1868–1946), in \"A Psychological Study of Religion\", accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.\n\nWilliam James was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with nitrous oxide and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.\n\nAlthough many researches have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to mental illnesses of various kind (mood disorders, personality disorders, and psychiatric disorders). In 2011, a team of psychiatrists, behavioral psychologists, neurologists, and neuropsychiatrists from the Harvard Medical School published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and hyperreligiosity.\n\nThey compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the Bible (Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Paul) with patients affected by mental disorders related to the psychotic spectrum using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV-TR), and concluded that these Biblical figures \"may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations\", such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depression, delusional disorder, delusions of grandeur, auditory-visual hallucinations, paranoia, Geschwind syndrome (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).\n\nThe research went further and also focused on social models of psychopathology, analyzing new religious movements and charismatic cult leaders such as David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians, and Marshall Applewhite, founder of the Heaven's Gate cult. The researchers concluded that \"If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum.\"\n\nClients' religious beliefs are increasingly being considered in psychotherapy with the goal of improving service and effectiveness of treatment. A resulting development was theistic psychotherapy. Conceptually, it consists of theological principles, a theistic view of personality, and a theistic view of psychotherapy. Following an explicit minimizing strategy, therapists attempt to minimize conflict by acknowledging their religious views while being respectful of client's religious views. This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that \"our biases can only be suspended in the extent to which they are no longer our biases\".\n\nOne application of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the pastoral care provided by pastors and other clergy, especially in how they support ordinary members of their congregations. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of chaplains in healthcare and in the military. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of pastoral counseling. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as \"Pastoral Psychology\", the \"Journal of Psychology and Christianity\", and the \"Journal of Psychology and Theology\". In 1984, Thomas Oden severely criticized mid-20th-century pastoral care and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from Freud, Rogers, and others. More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences a tension between psychology and theology.\n\nA 2012 paper suggested that psychiatric conditions associated with psychotic spectrum symptoms may be possible explanations for revelatory driven experiences and activities such as those of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Saint Paul.\n\n"}
{"id": "79000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79000", "title": "Pyramus and Thisbe", "text": "Pyramus and Thisbe\n\nPyramus and Thisbē are a pair of ill-fated lovers whose story forms part of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". The story has since been retold by many authors.\n\nIn Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Pyramus and Thisbe are two lovers in the city of Babylon who occupy connected houses/walls, forbidden by their parents to be wed, because of their parents' rivalry. Through a crack in one of the walls, they whisper their love for each other. They arrange to meet near Ninus' tomb under a mulberry tree and state their feelings for each other. Thisbe arrives first, but upon seeing a lioness with a mouth bloody from a recent kill, she flees, leaving behind her veil. When Pyramus arrives he is horrified at the sight of Thisbe's veil in which the lioness had torn and left traces of blood behind, as well as its tracks. Assuming that a wild beast has killed her, Pyramus kills himself, falling on his sword, a typical Babylonian way to commit suicide, and in turn splashing blood on the white mulberry leaves. Pyramus' blood stains the white mulberry fruits, turning them dark. Thisbe returns, eager to tell Pyramus what had happened to her, but she finds Pyramus' dead body under the shade of the mulberry tree. Thisbe, after a brief period of mourning, stabs herself with the same sword. In the end, the gods listen to Thisbe's lament, and forever change the colour of the mulberry fruits into the stained colour to honour the forbidden love.\n\nOvid's is the oldest surviving version of the story, published in 8 AD, but he adapted an existing etiological myth. While in Ovid's telling Pyramus and Thisbe lived in Babylon and Ctesias had placed the tomb of his imagined king Ninus near that city, the myth probably originated in Cilicia (part of Ninus' Babylonian empire) as Pyramos is the historical Greek name of the local Ceyhan River. The metamorphosis in the primary story involves Pyramus changing into this river and Thisbe into a nearby spring. A 2nd-century mosaic unearthed near Nea Paphos on Cyprus depicts this older version of the myth.\n\nThe story of \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" appears in Giovanni Boccaccio's \"On Famous Women\" as biography number twelve (sometimes thirteen) and in his \"Decameron\", in the fifth story on the seventh day, where a desperate housewife falls in love with her neighbor, and communicates with him through a crack in the wall, attracting his attention by dropping pieces of stone and straw through the crack.\n\nIn the 1380s, Geoffrey Chaucer, in his \"The Legend of Good Women\", and John Gower, in his \"Confessio Amantis\", were the first to tell the story in English. Gower altered the story somewhat into a cautionary tale. John Metham's \"Amoryus and Cleopes\" (1449) is another early English adaptation.\n\nThe tragedy of Romeo and Juliet ultimately sprang from Ovid's story. Here the star-crossed lovers cannot be together because Juliet has been engaged by her parents to another man and the two families hold an ancient grudge. As in Pyramus and Thisbe, the mistaken belief in one lover's death leads to consecutive suicides. The earliest version of Romeo and Juliet was published in 1476 by Masuccio Salernitano, while it mostly obtained its present form when written down in 1524 by Luigi da Porto. Salernitano and Da Porto both are thought to have been inspired by Ovid and Boccaccio's writing. Shakespeare's most famous 1590s adaptation is a dramatization of Arthur Brooke's 1562 poem \"The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet\", itself a translation of a French translation of Da Porto's novella.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (Act V, sc 1), written in the 1590s, a group of \"mechanicals\" enact the story of \"Pyramus and Thisbe\". Their production is crude and, for the most part, badly done until the final monologues of Nick Bottom, as Pyramus and Francis Flute, as Thisbe. The theme of forbidden love is also present in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (albeit a less tragic and dark representation) in that a girl, Hermia, is not able to marry the man she loves, Lysander, because her father Egeus despises him and wishes for her to marry Demetrius, and meanwhile Hermia and Lysander are confident that Helena is in love with Demetrius.\n\nSpanish poet Luis de Góngora wrote a \"Fábula de Píramo y Tisbe\" in 1618, while French poet Théophile de Viau wrote \"Les amours tragiques de Pyrame et Thisbée\", a tragedy in five acts, in 1621.\n\nIn 1718 Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello wrote his only opera \"La Tisbe\" for Württemberg court. François Francoeur and François Rebel composed \"Pirame et Thisbée\", a lyric tragedy in 5 acts and a prologue, with libretto by Jean-Louis-Ignace de La Serre; it was played at the Académie royale de musique, on October 17, 1726. The story was adapted by John Frederick Lampe as a \"Mock Opera\" in 1745, containing a singing \"Wall\" which was described as \"the most musical partition that was ever heard.\" In 1768 in Vienna, Johann Adolph Hasse composed a serious opera on the tale, titled \"Piramo e Tisbe\".\n\nEdmond Rostand adapted the tale, making the fathers of the lovers conspire to bring their children together by pretending to forbid their love, in \"Les Romanesques\", whose musical adaptation,\nFantasticks, became the world's longest-running musical.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6119559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6119559", "title": "Seuna (Yadava) dynasty", "text": "Seuna (Yadava) dynasty\n\nThe Seuna, Sevuna or Yadavas of Devagiri (c. 850–1334) was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its capital at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in modern Maharashtra).\n\nThe Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the Western Chalukyas. Around the middle of the 12th century, as the Chalukya power waned, the Yadava king Bhillama V declared independence. The Yadava kingdom reached its peak under Simhana II, and flourished until the early 14th century, when it was annexed by the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nThe Seuna dynasty claimed descent from the Yadavas and therefore, its kings are often referred to as the \"Yadavas of Devagiri\". The correct name of the dynasty, however, is Seuna or Sevuna. The inscriptions of this dynasty, as well as those of contemporary kingdoms, the Hoysala, Kakatiya dynasty and Western Chalukyas call them \"Seunas\". The name is probably derived from the name of their second ruler, \"Seunachandra\".\n\nThe \"Sevuna\" (or Seuna) name was brought back into use by John Faithfull Fleet in his book \"The dynasties of the Kanarese districts of the Bombay Presidency from the earliest historical times to the Musalman conquest of A.D. 1318\".\n\nThe earliest historical ruler of the Seuna/Yadava dynasty can be dated to the mid-9th century, but the origin of the dynasty is uncertain. Little is known about their early history: their 13th century court poet Hemadri records the names of the family's early rulers, but his information about the pre-12th century rulers is often incomplete and inaccurate.\n\nThe dynasty claimed descent from Yadu, a hero mentioned in the Puranic legends. According to this account, found in Hemadri's \"Vratakhanda\" as well as several inscriptions, their ancestors originally resided at Mathura, and then migrated to Dvaraka (Dvaravati) in present-day Gujarat. A Jain mythological legend states that the Jain saint Jainaprabhasuri saved the pregnant mother of the dynasty's founder Dridhaprahara from a great fire that destroyed Dvaraka. A family feudatory to the Yadavas migrated from Vallabhi (also in present-day Gujarat) to Khandesh. But otherwise, no historical evidence corroborates their connection to Dvaraka. The dynasty never tried to conquer Dvaraka, or establish any political or cultural connections with that region. Its rulers started claiming to be descendants of Yadu and migrants from Dvaraka after becoming politically prominent. Dvaraka was associated with Yadu's descendants, and the dynasty's claim of connection with that city may simply be a result of their claim of descent from Yadu rather than their actual geographic origin. The Hoysalas, the southern neighbours of the dynasty, similarly claimed descent from Yadu and claimed to be the former lords of Dvaraka.\n\nThe territory of the early Yadava rulers was located in present-day Maharashtra, and several scholars (especially Maharashtrian historians) have claimed a \"Maratha\" origin for the dynasty. However, Marathi, the language of present-day Maharashtra, began to appear as the dominant language in the dynasty's inscriptions only in the 14th century, before which Kannada and Sanskrit were the primary language of their inscriptions. Marathi appears in around two hundred Yadava inscriptions, but usually as translation of or addition to Kannada and Sanskrit text. During the last half century of the dynasty's rule, it became the dominant language of epigraphy, which may have been a result of the Yadava attempts to connect with their Marathi-speaking subjects, and to distinguish themselves from the Kannada-speaking Hoysalas. The earliest instance of the Yadavas using the term \"marathe\" as a self-designation appears in a 1311 inscription recording a donation to the Pandharpur temple, towards the end of the dynasty's rule.\n\nEpigraphic evidence suggests that the dynasty likely emerged from a Kannada-speaking background. Around five hundred Yadava inscriptions have been discovered, and Kannada is the most common language of these inscriptions, followed by Sanskrit. Of the inscriptions found in present-day Karnataka (the oldest being from the reign of Bhillama II), most are in Kannada language and script; others are in the Kannada language but use Devanagari script. Older inscriptions from Karnataka also attest to the existence of Yadava feudatories (such as Seunas of Masavadi) ruling in the Dharwad region in the 9th century, although these feudatories cannot be connected to the main line of the dynasty with certainty. Many of the dynasty's rulers had Kannada names and titles such as \"Dhadiyappa\", \"Bhillama\", \"Rajugi\", \"Vadugi\" and \"Vasugi\", and \"Kaliya Ballala\". Some kings had names like \"Simhana\" (or \"Singhana\") and \"Mallugi\", which were also used by the Kalachuris of Kalyani, who ruled in present-day Karnataka. Records show that one of the early rulers, Seunachandra II, had a Kannada title, \"Sellavidega\". The rulers had very close matrimonial relationships with Kannada-speaking royal families throughout their rule. Bhillama II was married to Lachchiyavve, who was from a Rashtrakuta descendant family in Karnataka. Vaddiga was married to Vaddiyavve, daughter of Rashtrakuta chieftain Dhorappa. Wives of Vesugi and Bhillama III were Chalukya princesess. The early Seuna coins also had Kannada legends engraved on them indicating it was a court language. The early Yadavas may have migrated northwards owing to the political situation in the Deccan region, or may have been dispatched by their Rashtrakuta overlords to rule the northern regions.\n\nThe earliest historically attested ruler of the dynasty is Dridhaprahara (c. 860-880), who is said to have established the city of Chandradityapura (modern Chandor). He probably rose to prominence by protecting the people of Khandesh region from enemy raiders, amid the instability brought by the Pratihara-Rashtrakuta war.\n\nDridhaprahara son and successor was Seunachandra (c. 880-900), after whom the dynasty was called Seuṇa-vaṃśa and their territory was called Seuna-desha. He probably became a Rashtrakuta feudatory after helping the Rashtrakutas against their northern neighbours, the Paramaras. He established a new town called Seunapura (possibly modern Sinnar).\n\nNot much information is available about Seunachandra's successors — Dhadiyappa (or Dadhiyappa), Bhillama I, and Rajugi (or Rajiga) — who ruled during c. 900-950. The next ruler Vandugi (also Vaddiga I or Baddiga) raised the family's political status by marrying into the imperial Rashtrakuta family. He married Vohivayya, a daughter of Dhorappa, who was a younger brother of the Rashtrakuta emperor Krishna III. Vandugi participated in Krishna's military campaigns, which may have resulted in an increase in his fief, although this cannot be said with certainty.\n\nLittle is known about the next ruler, Dhadiyasa (c. 970-985). His son Bhillama II acknowledged the suzerainty of the Kalyani Chalukya ruler Tailapa II, who overthrew the Rashtrakutas. As a Chalukya feudatory, he played an important role in Tailapa's victory over the Paramara king Munja. Bhillama II was succeeded by Vesugi I (r. c. 1005-1025), who married Nayilladevi, the daughter of a Chalukya feudatory of Gujarat. The next ruler Bhillama III is known from his Kalas Budruk grant inscription. He married Avalladevi, a daughter of the Chalukya king Jayasimha II, as attested by a Vasai (Bassein) inscription. He may have helped his father-in-law Jayasimha and his brother-in-law Someshvara I in their campaigns against the Paramara king Bhoja.\n\nThe Yadava power seems to have declined over the next decade, during the reigns of Vesugi II (alias Vaddiga or Yadugi) and Bhillama IV, for unknown reasons. The next ruler was Seunachandra II, who, according to the Yadava records, restored the family's fortunes just like the god Hari had restored the earth's fortunes with his varaha incarnation. Seunachandra II appears to have ascended the throne around 1050, as he is attested by the 1052 Deolali inscription. He bore the title \"Maha-mandaleshvara\" and became the overlord of several sub-feudatories, including a family of Khandesh. A 1069 inscription indicates that he had a ministry of seven officers, all of whom bore high-sounding titles. During his tenure, the Chalukya kingdom saw a war of succession between the brothers Someshvara II and Vikramaditya VI. Seunachandra II supported Vikramaditya (who ultimately succeeded), and rose to the position of \"Maha-mandaleshvara\". His son Airammadeva (or Erammadeva, r. c. 1085-1105), who helped him against Someshvara II, succeeded him. Airammadeva's queen was Yogalla, but little else is known about his reign. The Asvi inscription credits him with helping place Vikramaditya on the Chalukya throne.\n\nAirammadeva was succeeded by his brother Simhana I (r. c. 1105-1120). The Yadava records state that he helped his overlord Vikramaditya VI complete the \"Karpura-vrata\" ritual, by getting him a \"karpura\" elephant. A 1124 inscription mentions that he was ruling the Paliyanda-4000 province (identified as the area around modern Paranda). The dynasty's history over the next fifty years is obscure. The 1142 Anjaneri inscription attests the rule of a person named Seunachandra, but Hemadri's records of the dynasty do not mention any Seunachandra III; historian R. G. Bhandarkar theorized that this Seunachandra may have been a Yadava sub-feudatory.\n\nThe next known ruler Mallugi (r. c. 1145-1160) was a loyal feudatory to the Chalukya king Tailapa III. His general Dada and Dada's son Mahidhara fought with Tailapa's rebellious Kalachuri feudatory Bijjala II. He extended his territory by capturing Parnakheta (modern Patkhed in Akola district). The Yadava records claim that he seized the elephants of the king of Utkala, but do not provide any details. He also raided the kingdom of the Kakatiya ruler Rudra, but this campaign did not result in any territorial gains for him. Mallugi was succeeded by his elder son Amara-gangeya, who was succeeded by his son Amara-mallugi (alias Mallugi II). The next ruler Kaliya-ballala, whose relationship to Mallugi is unknown, was probably an usurper. He was succeeded by Bhillama V around 1175.\n\nAt the time of Bhillama V's ascension in c. 1175, his nominal overlords — the Chalukyas — were busy fighting their former feudatories, such as the Hoysalas and the Kalachuris. Bhillama raided the northern Gujarat Chaulukya and Paramara territories, although these invasions did not result in any territorial annexations. The Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhana, who was a Gujarat Chaulukya feudatory, forced him to retreat. Meanwhile, the Hoysala ruler Ballala II invaded the Chalukya capital Kalyani, forcing Bhillama's overlord Someshvara to flee. Around 1187, Bhillama forced Ballala to retreat, conquered the former Chalukya capital Kalyani, and declared himself a sovereign ruler.\n\nAccording to Hemadri, he then established the Devagiri city, which became the new Yadava capital.\n\nIn the late 1180s, Ballala launched a campaign against Bhillama, and decisively defeated his army at Soratur. The Yadavas were driven to the north of the Malaprabha and Krishna rivers, which formed the Yadava-Hoysala border for the next two decades.\n\nBhillama's son Jaitugi successfully invaded the Kakatiya kingdom around 1194, and forced them to accept the Yadava suzerainty.\n\nJaitugi's son Simhana, who succeeded him around either 1200 or 1210, is regarded as the dynasty's greatest ruler. At its height, his kingdom probably extended from the Narmada River in the north to the Tungabhadra River in the south, and from the Arabian Sea in the west to the western part of the present-day Andhra in the east. He launched a military campaign against the Hoysalas (who were engaged in a war with the Pandyas), and captured a substantial part of their territory. The Rattas of Saundatti, who formerly acknowledged the Hoysala suzerainty, became his feudatories, and helped him expand the Yadava power southwards. In 1215, Simhana successfully invaded the northern Paramara kingdom. According to Hemadri, this invasion resulted in the death of the Paramara king Arjunavarman, although this claim is of doubtful veracity. Around 1216, Simhana defeated the Kohalpur Shilahara king Bhoja II, a former feudatory, who had asserted his sovereignty. The Shilahara kingdom, including its capital Kolhapur, was annexed to the Yadava kingdom as a result of this victory.\n\nIn 1220, Simhana sent an army to the Lata region in present-day Gujarat, whose rulers kept shifting his allegiance between the Yadavas, the Paramaras, and the Chaulukyas. Simhana's general Kholeshvara killed the defending ruler Simha, and captured Lata. Simhana then appointed Simha's son Shankha as a Yadava vassal in Lata. Sometime later, the Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada invaded Lata, and captured the important port city of Khambhat. Simhana's feudatory Shankha invaded Chaulukya-controlled territory twice, with his help, but was forced to retreat. The Chaulukya-Yadava conflict came to end in c. 1232 with a peace treaty. In the 1240s, Lavanaprasada's grandson Visaladeva usurped the power in Gujarat, and became the first Vagehla monarch. During his reign, Simhana's forces invaded Gujarat unsuccessfully, and the Yadava general Rama (a son of Kholeshvara) was killed in a battle.\n\nSeveral Yadava feudatories kept shifting their allegiance between the Yadavas and the Hoysalas, and tried to assert their independence whenever presented with an opportunity. Simhana's general Bichana subdued several such chiefs, including the Rattas, the Guttas of Dharwad, the Kadambas of Hangal, and the Kadambas of Goa. The Kakatiya king Ganapati served him as a feudatory for several years, but assumed independence towards the end of his reign. However, Ganapati did not adopt an aggressive attitude towards the Yadavas, so no major conflict happened between the two dynasties during Simhana's reign.\n\nSimhana was succeeded by his grandson Krishna (alias Kannara), who defeated the invaded the Paramara kingdom, which had weakened because of invasions from the Delhi Sultanate. He defeated the Paramara king sometime before 1250, although this victory did not result in any teritorial annexation. Krishna also attempted an invasion of the Vaghela-ruled Gujarat, but this conflict was inconclusive, with both sides claiming victory. He also fought against the Hoysalas; again, both sides claim victory in this conflict.\n\nKrishna's younger brother and successor Mahadeva curbed a rebellion by the Shilaharas of northern Konkan, whose ruler Someshvara had attempted to assert his sovereignty. He invaded the eastern Kakatiya kingdom, taking advantage of rebellions against the Kakatiya queen Rudrama, but this invasion appears to have been repulsed. He also invaded the southern Hoysala kingdom, but this invasion was repulsed by the Hoysala king Narasimha II. Mahadeva's Kadamba feudatories rebelled against him, but this rebellion was suppressed by his general Balige-deva around 1268.\n\nMahadeva was succeeded by his son Ammana, who was dethroned by Krishna's son Ramachandra after a short reign in 1270. During the first half of his reign, Ramachandra adopted an aggressive policy against his neighbours. In the 1270s, he invaded the northern Paramara kingdom, which had been weakened by internal strife, and easily defeated the Paramara army. The Yadava army was also involved in skirmishes against their north-western neighbours, the Vaghelas, with both sides claiming victory. In 1275, he sent a powerful army led by Tikkama to the southern Hoysala kingdom. Tikkama gathered a large plunder from this invasion, although ultimately, his army was forced to retreat in 1276. Ramachandra lost some of his territories, including Raichur, to the Kakatiyas.\n\nThe Purushottamapuri inscription of Ramachandra suggests that he expanded the Yadava kingdom at its north-east frontier. First, he subjugated the rulers of Vajrakara (probably modern Vairagarh) and Bhandagara (modern Bhandara). Next, he marched to the defunct Kalachuri kingdom, and occupied the former Kalachuri capital Tripuri (modern Tewar near Jabalpur). He also constructed a temple at Varanasi, which suggests that he may have occupied Varanasi for 2-3 years, amid the confusion caused by the Delhi Sultanate's invasion of the local Gahadavala kingdom. He crushed a rebellion by the Yadava feudatories at Khed and Sangameshwar in Konkan.\n\nIn 1278, Ramachandra appears to have defeated the Turkic invaders from the Delhi Sultanate, as a Sanskrit royal inscription of that year glorifies him as a \"Great Boar in securing the earth from the oppression of the Turks\". However, in 1294, Ala-ud-din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate successfully raided Devagiri. Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return for his promise of payment of a high ransom and an annual tribute. However, this was not paid and the Seuna kingdom's arrears to Khalji kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by Malik Kafur, accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. The Muslim governors of Malwa and Gujarat were ordered to help Malik Kafur. Their huge army conquered the weakened and defeated forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Ramachandra was taken to Delhi. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor in return for a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in South India. In 1310, Malik Kafur mounted an assault on the Kakatiya kingdom from Devagiri.\n\nRamachandra's successor Simhana III challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri in 1313. Simhana III was killed in the ensuing battle and Khalji's army occupied Devagiri. The kingdom was annexed by the Khalji sultanate in 1317. Many years later, Muhammad Tughluq of the Tughluq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate subsequently renamed the city Daulatabad.\n\nThe rulers of the Seuna / Yadava dynasty include:\n\nFeudatories\n\n\nSovereigns\n\n\nKhalji tributaries\n\n\nThe Yadavas were the first major dynasty to use Marathi as an official language. Earlier, both Sanskrit and Kannada had been used in present-day Maharashtra; subsequently, at least partly due to the efforts of the Yadava rulers, Marathi became the dominant language of the region. Even if they were not of Marathi origin, towards the end of their reign, they certainly identified with the Marathi language. The early Marathi literature emerged during the Yadava rule, because of which some scholars have theorized that it was produced with support from the Yadava rulers. However, there is no evidence that the Yadava royal court directly supported the production of Marathi literature with state funds, although it regarded Marathi as a significant language for connecting with the general public.\n\nHemadri, a minister in the Yadava court, attempted to formalize Marathi with Sanskrit expressions to boost its status as a court language. Saint-poet Dnyaneshwar wrote \"Dnyaneshwari\" (c. 1290), a Marathi-language commentary on the \"Bhagavad Gita\", during Ramachandra's rule. He also composed devotional songs called \"abhanga\"s. Dnyaneshwar gave a higher status to Marathi by translating the sacred Geeta from Sanskrit. Mukundaraja wrote the Marathi-language philosophical treatises \"Paramamrita\" and \"Vivekasindhu\" during the Yadava period. The Mahanubhava religious sect, which became prominent in present-day Maharshtra during the late Yadava period, boosted the status of Marathi as a literary language. Mahimabhatta wrote \"Lilacharita\", a biography of the sect's founder Chakradhara. The text claims that Hemadri (who was a Brahmanist) was jealous of Chakradhara's popularity, and the Yadava king Ramachandra ordered killing of Chakradhara, who escaped with his yogic powers. The claim is of doubtful historicity.\n\nKannada was one of the court languages during early Seuna times, as is evident from a number of Kannada-language inscriptions (see Origin section). Kamalabhava, patronised by Bhillama V, wrote \"Santhishwarapurana\". Achanna composed \"Varadhamanapurana\" in 1198. Amugideva, patronised by Simhana II, composed many \"Vachanas\" or devotional songs. Chaundarasa of Pandharapur wrote \"Dashakumara Charite\" around 1300.\n\nSimhana patronized Changadeva and the Kannada poet Kamalabhava.\n\nSimhana was a great patron of learning and literature. He established the college of astronomy to study the work of celebrated astronomer Bhaskaracharya. The Sangita Ratnakara, an authoritative Sanskrit work on Indian music was written by Śārṅgadeva (or Shrangadeva) during Simhana's reign.\n\nHemadri compiled the encyclopedic Sanskrit work \"Chaturvarga Chintamani\". He is said to have built many temples in a style known after him – \"Hemadapanti\". He wrote many books on \"vaidhyakshastra\" (medical science) and he introduced and supported bajra cultivation.\n\nOther Sanskrit literary works created during the Seuna period include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6737788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6737788", "title": "Shaman (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)", "text": "Shaman (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)\n\nThe shaman is an alternate playable character class in the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fantasy role-playing game. The shaman has been published or republished many distinct forms over the decades. There are two main shaman concepts in D&D: monsters who cast clerical or druidic spells, and a human or demi-human PC class. The spell-casting monsters are generally treated as primitive or unsophisticated clerics or clerics of uncivilized or inhuman deities. For those iterations that treat the shaman as something other than a priest of uncivilized deities, the shaman gains power from animistic spirits instead of, or in addition to, a deity, force, or philosophy. These spirits may be ancestors, animal spirits, or spirits of the land.\n\nThe PC versions of the shaman class generally present it as a priest of an animistic or spirit-based religion on-par with the deity-based religions found elsewhere in D&D.\n\nThe basic D&D shaman (The Golden Khan of Ethengar) and shamani (The Atruaghin Clans), three second edition shaman classes (Shaman; Complete Barbarian's Handbook; Spells and Magic or Faith and Avatars), two third edition shaman classes (3.0 Oriental Adventures; 3.5 Spirit Shaman in Complete Divine) and one fourth edition shaman (Players Handbook II) are all fully implemented Shaman classes meant for PC use in the game.\n\nThe shaman in D&D covers two notions of Shamanism. The first is as a primitive magician or priest, opposed to a more civilized European priest viewed through the lenses of the Catholic Church or Greco-Roman paganism. The Druid was meant to represent other types of pagan priests, such as a Celtic priest. This version of the shaman is applied to monsters in the basic D&D game, as well as the first and second edition games. Remnants of this point of view can be seen in later edition monsters, which have spellcasting variants labeled shamans.\n\nThe second notion of the shaman is as a priest of an animistic religion. In this interpretation, the shaman is seen as an optional PC class who performs many of the functions of the cleric: healing, divination or oracles, ceremonies, etc. Rather than venerating a deity from the D&D pantheon, however, shamans deal with spirits of nature, ancestors, elemental spirits, animal spirits, and the like.\n\nThe shaman concept was covered numerous times in the late 80s and early 90s for the Master ruleset of the basic \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game. In this line, the Shaman and Wicca are options for monster classes to access cleric or magic-user spells. \"The Orcs of Thar\" (1988) covers orcish shamans, although this shaman is again presented as a magical option for monster classes in \"Top Ballista\" (1989) and was again repeated in The Shadow Elves (GAZ13, 1990).\n\n\"The Golden Khan of Ethengar\" (GAZ12, 1989), however, includes rules for a full-fledged shaman character class. Unlike other classes presented in the Golden Khan, the Shaman is treated as a distinct class which is unlike the use of the term for any primitive or tribal cleric. This may be the first incarnation of the Shaman as a viable PC class. This shaman class is similar to the Cleric though the spell list is different and this shaman does not have the ability to turn undead. Instead, this shaman gains a spirit guide, keen senses, the ability to speak with animals, and the ability to shapeshift into animal form.\n\nA thematically similar, though mechanically different, class is introduced as the Shamani in The Atruaghin Clans (GAZ14, 1991). It does not gain the abilities of the Golden Khan shaman class, but instead has an ability to detect poisons and advances at a faster rate.\n\nDragon Magazine 141 (1989) covers the shaman as a primitive, humanoid priest for the AD&D game. Additionally, the first edition Oriental Adventures book presents the shukenja class, which is the basis for the later third edition Oriental Adventures shaman class.\n\nShaman is a term which often referred to humanoid clerics or priests (i.e. tribal or primitive priests), particularly those of the so-called savage species from \"The Complete Book of Humanoids\". This usage is a holdover from earlier iterations of the shaman concept as NPC primitive spellcasters.\n\nThe Shaman character class was introduced anew in the 2nd Edition Supplement, \"Shaman\" (1995). It used a nonstandard spellcasting mechanic whereby spells are not memorized each day, but can be cast multiple times until a wisdom check is failed. It was not further developed (although it was briefly mentioned as the source of power of one of Ravenlofts minor Darklords on an island of terror). This shaman may have been affiliated with a tribe, a natural hermit, or a social outcast. The tribalist, solitary, and spiritualist had their own spell lists, though shamans could also draw spells from other shaman spell lists or the general priest list. This version of the shaman begins to distance itself from the notion of the tribal or primitive priest (worshiping savage deities instead of civilized ones), though the uncivilized origin is still viewed as an important aspect of the class.\n\nAlso in 1995, the Complete Barbarian's Handbook introduced another shaman class. This one is much closer to priests of a specific mythoi, but still represents an uncivilized or primitive priest class. This shaman gains major access to different spheres that the Cleric does, and shares some features with the Barbarian Fighter, also presented in the book.\n\nAnother Shaman character class was introduced in the \"\" (1995) supplement (an identical version appeared in \"Faiths & Avatars\"), which resembles the standard Cleric, though it draws spells from different spheres and has the ability to contact spirits for aid. In this iteration, the Shaman is a sub-class of the cleric, alongside the crusader, druid, monk, and mystic. These six priest classes are intended to broadly represent the priests of any D&D religion, and complement or even replace the vast multitude of specialty priest classes.\n\nThe Shaman is a character class in the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" 3.0 edition that was introduced in the \"Oriental Adventures\" campaign supplement.\n\nThe shaman in the Third Edition of the game is a variant of the \"shukenja\" of the First Edition \"Oriental Adventures\". (A character class called the shugenja also appears in \"Oriental Adventures\" 3.0 which is a similar spellcasting class but differs because of its elemental theme.) This shaman is more akin to a shinto priest, rather than the real-world shugenja. The shaman is considered the oriental equivalent of the cleric, although it also shares abilities with the monk and druid classes. Like clerics, shamans derive their spells from divine energy in general and from powerful entities; they propitiate spirits of an animistic religious system rather than deities, forces, or philosophies (although deities may also exist as extremely powerful spirits). These spirits embody the domains from which shamans gain powers and domain spells. A few domains are identical to clerical domains listed in the \"Player's Handbook\"; some are unique to the shaman and have no direct equivalent to any clerical domain. Unlike a cleric, at higher levels a shaman can learn a third domain and prepare two domain spells per day for certain spell levels. In general, a shaman's spell list is more nature-oriented than the cleric's. Like the druid, it can gain an animal companion. Its attack progression is identical to a cleric's, while it has a variety of unarmed combat feats similar to the monk. The 3.5 update to the class found in \"Dragon\" magazine issue 318 (April 2004) improves the shaman's combat prowess, such as by granting shamans the ability to inflict extra damage with their unarmed attacks, similar to those of monks.\n\nThe vanara, a monkey-like humanoid race also published in \"Oriental Adventures\", has Shaman as its favored class.\n\nThird edition also released two other shaman-like classes. In 3.5, the \"Complete Divine\" contains the Spirit Shaman class, which spontaneously casts spells, but can still change prepared spells daily. The spirit shaman also has numerous abilities which relate to spirits and incorporeal things, and as such is a much more direct successor to the basic D&D Golden Khan shaman.\n\nThe Dragon Shaman class, however, from the \"Player's Handbook II\" is mechanically related to the Marshal, rather than being a Divine caster class. The Dragon Shaman does not have any relationship to spirits in a general sense, though it does have a totem dragon spirit. As such, it is peripheral to the shaman concept as portrayed in D&D.\n\nGreen Ronin Publishing released a 3.0 Shaman in The Shaman Handbook as part of their Master Class series. They cast divine spells spontaneously, like a sorcerer. The book also contains a number of Prestige Classes.\n\nUKG Publishing released a 3.5 Shaman in The Enduring: Witches & Shaman in June 2007. It uses the same advancement and spellcasting progression as a druid, but (instead of \"wildshape\") gains lycanthropic abilities as it progresses, becoming a were-shaman (a natural lycanthrope) at upper levels.\n\nThe Shaman is among the classes included in the 4th edition \"Player's Handbook 2\" (March 2009). The Shaman class has the Primal power source and the Leader role, and has a clear link with the primal spirits of the earth; most of his/her powers call upon or otherwise make use of spirits. Continuing with this spiritual link, all Shamans receive a Spirit Companion—the class is distinctive for being the first Fourth Edition class to have a companion as a standard feature (The Sentinel Druid also gains an animal companion). While the spirit companion may have any appearance the player wishes, the flavor and artwork included in the book depict it as an animal spirit, and the provided Shaman builds are named after possible appearances (Panther and Bear). Additional builds were added in Primal Power and the Dark Sun Campaign Setting. Many of the Shaman's powers use the Spirit keyword, meaning they use the spirit as their origin point and derive line of sight and effect from it; these are flavored as the Shaman commanding the spirit to attack the Shaman's enemies. The Shaman can even use opportunity actions to attack enemies moving past the spirit, giving it the mechanical feeling of an ally actively engaged in combat.\n\nAlong with damage, Shaman attacks carry some type of rider effect that either benefit allies or harm enemies next to the companion spirit, such as temporary hit points or a bonus to attack rolls. Additionally, allies next to the spirit can gain additional hit points when the Shaman uses his healing abilities. This allows the Shaman to use the spirit as a mobile source of aid, able to be moved to where it is most useful. Since he must consider the positioning of two entities rather than one, and is able to use both ranged and melee attacks from two sources, the Shaman is a complex Leader class to play.\n"}

Shinreikyo believes \"Kyososama is God made flesh.\" The group began in Nishinomiya, but by 1953 a site on a hill in the Akasaka district of Minato, Tokyo would become Shinreikyo headquarters.\n\nLike many Japanese new religions the group is syncretistic. The primary connections are likely Buddhism and Taoism. The idea of \"Kyososoma\" as God made flesh has precedents in various pagan religions, as well as later in Christianity. The sect is dualistic in that it believes in a material and spiritual division, but apparently it values both. The group strongly believes in miracles. They also believe the deceased faithful go to heaven through Sublime Transmigration, leaving bodies without rigor mortis or putrefaction. Also that miracles can occur to animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. That in fact the world is full of miracles.\n\nAdherents believe that their founder knew everything almost at birth due to his connection with/being a Divine Power.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the journal no longer received state support. In the early 1960s, \"Sovetish Heymland\" had a circulation of 25,000, the highest ever circulation for a Yiddish-language periodical. The circulation fell to 16,000 in 1966; to 10,000 in 1971; to 7,000 in 1978; and to 5,000 in 1985. Although the journal's circulation had fallen dramatically, donations solicited from the United States, France and Argentina in the early 1990s enabled Vergelis to continue publishing the journal under the name \"Di Yidishe Gas\" (Yiddish די יידישע גאַס - \"The Jewish Street\") from 1993 until his death in July 1999.\n\n\"Sovetish Heymland\" was developed in the period after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 as a forum for those Yiddish writers who had survived the repressions of Soviet Yiddish which had occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The title referred back to the Moscow-based Yiddish literary periodicals \"Sovetish\" (1934–1941) and \"Heymland\" (1947–1948), indicating a continuity of Yiddish literary output. In addition to being the official Yiddish periodical of the Union of Soviet Writers, one of the main aims of the journal was to disseminate Soviet propaganda among Yiddish-speaking Jewish Communists in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. In addition, the publication of a highly literary Yiddish-language journal was meant to show that Yiddish and Yiddish cultural institutions were not disappearing, but that there was in fact a Yiddish revival occurring in the Soviet Union, and that \"Sovetish Heymland\" in particular was taking the lead in maintaining Yiddish culture. As part of this propaganda, Vergelis published numerous anti-Zionist and anti-Israel articles. Vergelis' controversial reputation as a tool of Leonid Brezhnev and the Communist government is based largely on these articles, as well as several articles attacking his critics from outside the Soviet Union. In addition, the fact that \"Sovetish Heymland\" was authorized by the government indicated to some that Vergelis was merely a mouthpiece for Soviet propaganda.\n\nIn addition to literary articles, the journal published materials on Jewish folklore, history, language and literature in Yiddish, the magazine also collected biographical and bibliographical material about Jewish writers. In the 25th anniversary issue of \"Sovetish Heymland\" in August 1986, Vergelis announced that the journal had published 76 novels, 109 novellas, 1,478 short stories, 6,680 poems, and 1,628 articles dealing with literary\ncriticism and the arts. It was also one of the few periodicals to encourage the younger generation of Soviet Yiddish writers. As the only Yiddish-language journal that was officially allowed by the Soviet authorities from the 1960s through the 1980s, \"Sovetish Heymland\", under the editorship of Vergelis, was connected with almost all of the period's cultural output. Vergelis became an \"unofficial censor of all Yiddish-language literature and the chief Central Committee consultant on matters relating to Soviet Jews.\"\n\n"}

It first appears in Ge Hong's (4th century CE) \"Baopuzi\" 抱朴子 (行品 chapter), which says \"xiuzhen\" practices characterize a \"daoren\" 道人 \"Daoist\". \"Xiushen\" 修身 and \"xiudao\" 修道 are more common synonyms of \"xiuzhen\" that occurred centuries earlier in pre-Han Chinese classic texts.\n\n\"Xiushen\" () is a basic moral principle of Chinese philosophy. In Confucianism, \"xiushen\" is the ethical basis for social order. The \"Great Learning\" (tr. Legge 1893:266) says ancient rulers utilized \"self cultivation\": \"Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.\" In Daoism, \"xiushen\" refers to a supernatural \"self cultivation\". The \"Zhuangzi\" (tr. Mair 1994:96) claims it can result in long life: \"Carefully guard your body, and leave other things to prosper themselves. I guard the one so as to dwell in harmony. Thus have I cultivated my person for one thousand two hundred years and my physical form has still not decayed.\"\n\n\"Xiudao\" () means \"practice a religious regimen; follow religious rules; enter a monastery\". The first sentence in the Confucian \"Doctrine of the Mean\" (tr. Legge 1893:124) associates \"xiudao\" with \"jiao\" \"teach; instruct\": \"What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction.\"\n\nThe \"Xiuzhen tu\" text probably dates \"from the early 19th century\" (Komjathy 2004:53) and exists in several versions, some with variant titles like \"Xiuzhen quantu\" 修真全圖 \"Cultivation of Perfection Complete Diagram\". All editions are associated with the Longmen \"Dragon Gate\" sect of the Quanzhen school of Daoism. Catherine Despeux (2008:770) lists five extant versions: a stele at the Sanyuan Gong 三元宮 \"Three Primes Palace\" in Guangzhou (dated 1812); printed versions from the Wudang Mountains (1924 reprint of 1888), Shanghai (1920), and Chengdu (1922); and a version at the White Cloud Temple in Beijing (undated).\n\nThe \"Xiuzhen Tu\" resembles the better-known \"Neijing Tu\" 內經圖 \"Inner Pathways Diagram\". Both these anatomical charts with Daoist \"Neidan\" symbolism derive from the earliest diagrams attributed to Yanluozi 煙蘿子 (fl. 10th century) and conserved in the 1250 CE \"Xiuzhen shishu\" 修真十書 \"Cultivating Perfection Ten Books\" (Kohn 2000:521).\n\nContrasted with the \"Neijing tu\", the \"Xiuzhen tu\" pictures the meditator's body in a front view rather than side, and includes a longer textual portion, which describes \"Neidan\" practices, lunar phases, and \"Leifa\" 雷法 \"Thunder Rites\" associated with the Zhengyi Dao movement of the Tianshi Dao \"Way of Celestial Masters\".\n\nDespeux summarizes \"Xiuzhen tu\" differences.\nThe elements that distinguish this chart from the \"Neijing tu\" are mainly related to the Thunder Rites (\"leifa\") – in particular, the spiral at the level of the kidneys, the nine \"orifices of hell\" at the base of the spine, and the three curls at the top of the head that represent the three primordial breaths according to the \"Tianxin zhengfa\" tradition. The chart also represents the main parts of the body, including the Cinnabar Fields (\"dantian\"), the Three Passes (\"sanguan\", represented by the three chariots) of the back, the throat, the paradisiacal and infernal worlds, and the body's divinities according to the \"Huangting jing\", and also shows the firing process (\"huohou\"). The whole is reminiscent of a talisman illustrating a divine body that connects to the sacred world. (2008:770)\n\nAt the same time, the \"Xiuzhen tu\" underscores cosmological elements. In particular, the human figure is surrounded by thirty black and white circles that represent the days of the lunar month, one of the models of the Neidan \"fire phases\". The trigrams arranged around the figure (Zhen ☳, Dui ☱, Qian ☰, Xun ☴, Gen ☶, and Kun ☷) represent the six stages of the lunar cycle, each of which is made of five days.\n\n\n"}
