The common name by which it is most often known in English is \"Indian Aconite\". The plant grows abundantly at Sandakphu, which is the highest point of the Darjeeling Hills in the Indian State of West Bengal.\n\nA tuberous-rooted, herbaceous perennial reaching 1.0 metre tall by 0.5 metres wide and tolerant of many soil types, \"Aconitum ferox\" forms the principal source of the Indian poison known variously as \"bikh\", \"bish\", and \"nabee\". It contains large quantities of the extremely toxic alkaloid pseudaconitine (also known as nepaline, after Nepal) and is considered to be the most poisonous plant found in the Himalaya and one of the most poisonous in the world.\n\nThe symptoms of poisoning usually appear 45 minutes to an hour after the consumption of a toxic dose and consist of numbness of the mouth and throat and vomiting. Respiration slows and blood pressure synchronously falls to within 30-40 beats per minute and consciousness characteristically remains unclouded until the end, which consists usually of death by asphyxiation, although occasionally of death due to cardiac arrest.\nMonier-Williams lists it as one of the definitions of <bhRGga> or Bhringa.\n\nAghori, left-hand path, tantric, Shaivites (devotees of the Hindu deity Shiva) smoke the dried roots of \"Aconitum ferox\", combined in a mixture with cannabis flowers, in a practice that is part consciousness-expansion by entheogen, part ordeal by poison. Aghoris, no strangers to the use of all manner of dangerous drugs (such as Datura metel), warn of the extreme danger posed by smoking mixtures containing aconite, and restrict their use to the most experienced adepts of their particular school of Shaivism, as being potentially lethal. Drug-induced, altered states of consciousness comprise at least three elements : the effects of the drug upon the brain and body, set and setting. Given that Aghori tantrics are charnel ground ascetics who pursue moksha (spiritual liberation) in settings of extreme horror, venerate wrathful deities (principally Bhairava, his consort Bhairavi, Dhumavati and Bagalamukhi) and find in \"Aconitum ferox\" a drug with unpleasant somatic effects warning (rightly) of possible death, it is clear that the experience evoked by the smoking of Aconite in such circumstances is likely to be one of dysphoria (albeit dysphoria sought consciously, in pursuit of the deeper euphoria of advaita or realisation of the oneness of all being).\n\nThe use of \"A. ferox\" as a criminal poison recently gained notoriety in the U.K. as a result of the murder trial of a Ms. Lakhvir Singh, a Sikh woman from Southall (a suburban district of the London Borough of Ealing). Ms.Singh was found guilty of the murder of her ex-lover, 'Lucky' Lakhvinder Cheema and the attempted murder of his fiancée, Gurjeet Choongh with a curry spiked with \"bikh\" poison acquired from India. After consuming the poisoned curry, the unfortunate Mr. Cheema began to vomit and over the course of the next hour suffered total paralysis of all four limbs, blindness, a drastic fall in blood pressure and heart failure, leading to his death within an hour of his admission to hospital. Ms. Choongh was more fortunate, having consumed less of the lethal dish, and later recovered, after having been placed in an induced coma.\n"}

In the two accounts that survive from ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the human condition over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value.\n\nThe first extant account of the successive ages of humanity comes from the Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC), in his poem \"Works and Days\" (lines 109–201). His list is:\n\nThe Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC – 1st century AD) tells a similar myth of Four Ages in Book 1.89–150 of the \"Metamorphoses\". His account is similar to Hesiod's, with the exception that he omits the Heroic Age. Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He adds that in this age, men did not yet know the art of navigation and therefore did not explore the larger world, no man had knowledge of any arts but pre agriculture. In the Silver Age, Jupiter introduces the seasons and men consequentially learn the art of agriculture and architecture. In the Bronze Age, Ovid writes, men were prone to warfare, but not impiety. Finally, in the Iron Age, men demarcate nations with boundaries; they learn the arts of navigation and mining; they are warlike, greedy and impious. Truth, modesty and loyalty are nowhere to be found.\n\nThese mythological ages are sometimes associated with historical timelines. In the chronology of Saint Jerome, the Golden Age lasts c. 1710 to 1674 BC, the Silver Age 1674 to 1628 BC, the Bronze Age 1628 to 1472 BC, the Heroic Age 1460 to 1103 BC, while Hesiod's Iron Age was considered as still ongoing by Saint Jerome in the 4th century AD.\n\nSimilar concepts include:\n\n\n"}

His feast day is August 31 in Roman Catholicism and September 13 in Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nVery little is known of Aristides, except for the introductory information given by Eusebius of Caesarea and Saint Jerome. According to their account, Aristides practiced philosophy in Athens, where he lived, prior to and after his conversion to Christianity. Eusebius writes in his \"Ecclesiastical History\" \"Aristides also, a faithful disciple of our religion, has left an Apology of the faith dedicated to Hadrian.\" Eusebius and Jerome both state that the \"Apology\" was given to Hadrian at the same time that Quadratus delivered his own apology. This suggests that Aristides gave his apology during Hadrian's reign (r. 117–138) as emperor of Rome, which supports the theory of Aristides died between the years 133–134 AD. It is also supported by the express language of the \"Apology\" in the Armenian version. It is contradicted only by the second superscription to the Syriac version, which says that the \"Apology\" was given to Emperor Antoninus Pius in the year 140. If this is taken to mean that it was delivered in person by Aristides, it would rule out the dating of Aristides's death in 133-134 AD. It has been suggested that Eusebius was confused by the fact that Antoninus Pius had adopted the name \"Hadrianus\" (Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius) and believed it was Hadrian to whom the \"Apology\" was given, and further that Jerome had never read the \"Apology\" and copied Eusebius's mistake accidentally. But Jerome tells us that the \"Apology\" was extant in his day, and he gives an account of its contents. The testimony of Eusebius and Jerome and the text of the Armenian version are all in favor of its being delivered to Hadrian, probably in circa 124–125 AD.\n\nIn 1878, an Armenian fragment of an apology titled \"To Emperor Hadrian Caesar from the Athenian Philosopher Aristides\" was published by the Mechitarists of San Lazzaro in Venice from a 10th-century manuscript. The Armenian translation was accepted by most scholars as the long lost \"Apology of Aristides\"; however, a few did dispute its authenticity, most notably Ernest Renan. In 1889, the authenticity of the fragment was confirmed with the discovery of a complete Syriac translation of the \"Apology\" by British scholar Rendel Harris in the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. With this new discovery, J.A. Robinson was able to show Aristides's work had been in fact extant and edited in the religious book \"The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat\" since the 7th century. Another fragment of the \"Apology\" containing two portions of original text in Greek was published in 1922 by the British Museum on papyri. The \"Apology\" of Aristides is the oldest extant Christian apology since only a fragment of the older apology of Quadratus exists.\n\nIn the 1889 Syriac translation, Aristides begins his apology by stating his name, where he is from and that he is delivering it to Antoninus Pius. In the first chapter, he proclaims God exists because the world exists and that God is \"eternal, impassible and perfect.\" In the second chapter, he writes that there are four races of the world; (1) Barbarians, (2) Greeks (includes Egyptians and Chaldeans), (3) Jews, and (4) Christians. He then devotes chapters 3-16 to describing the different groups of people and how they practice religion. The Barbarians (chapters 3-7) worship dead warriors and the elements of the Earth, which he claims are the works of God, therefore they do not know who the true God is. The Greeks (chapters 8–13) are next because:\n\n\"...they are wiser than the Barbarians but have erred even more than the Barbarians, in that they have introduced many gods that are made; and some of them they have represented as male and some of them as female; and in such a way that some of their gods were found to be adulterers and murderers, and jealous and envious, and angry and passionate, and murderers of fathers, and thieves and plunderers.\"\n\nIn other words, Aristides is calling the Greek gods corrupt, immoral and guilty of being human. He concludes his chapters on the Greeks by commenting on the religious beliefs of the Egyptians, who he claims are the most ignorant people on earth since they did not accept the beliefs of the Greeks or Chaldeans and instead worshiped gods modeled after plants and animals. The Jews (chapter 14) are only commented on in a concise manner. Aristides commends them for their worship of God as the Creator and almighty but claims they have gone \"astray\" because \"their service is to angels and not to God, in that they observe sabbaths and new moons and the passover and the great fast, and the fast, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats: which things not even thus have they perfectly observed.\" In chapters 15 and 16, Aristides describes the commandments of God and claims Christians \"walk in all humility and kindness, and falsehood is not found among them, and they love one another.\" He explains \"they ask from Him petitions which are proper for Him to give and for them to receive: and thus they accomplish the course of their lives.\" He concludes the \"Apology\" in chapter 17 by requesting the emperor to stop persecuting the Christians and convert to their faith; where he ends with a nice description of the Christian life.\n\nIt has been suggested that Aristides is the author of the \"Epistle to Diognetus\". This theory is supported by similar writing styles, descriptions of Christians, the treatment of Jews, as well as other similarities. Abbé H. Doulcet was primarily the leading voice of this theory in the late 19th century. The \"Epistle to Diognetus\" has been credited to Justin Martyr but without any sufficient evidence. Aristides is also credited with a sermon on Luke 23:43.\n\nAristides is the second Greek Christian apologetic of the 2nd century. His writing style and thesis are very similar to the likes of Quadratus, Aristo of Pella, Justin Martyr and the author of the \"Epistle to Diognetus\". Jerome suggests Aristides's apology was the combined opinions of philosophers at the time and imitated by Justin Martyr afterwards. Negatively, Celsus used the \"Apology\" for his arguments against the Jews and \"also certain features which he used in order to scoff at Providence.\" However, he was easily countered by Origen.\n\nThe \"Apology\" of Aristides was later adapted into the work \"The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat\" during the 7th century. In the book, the \"Apology\" is told by a pagan philosopher by the name of Nachor, a character in the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat. The unknown use of the \"Apology\" in the book, allowed for the text to remain extant the entire time and influence Christian perception of Buddhism. Only with the rediscovery of the \"Apology\" in 1878 and 1889, did it reappear in history books. Rendel Harris, J.A. Robinson and few European scholars provided some commentary and studies of the text in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There has been little revisionist history on the \"Apology\" of late, except for an article by G.C. O'Ceallaigh in 1958. He suggested the \"Apology\" was a Jewish work of the 2nd century and was then edited by a Christian writer in the 4th century to be a Christian apology. W. Fairweather, D.W. Palmer and Massey Hamilton Shepherd Jr. have used the \"Apology\" of Aristides, and other apologists' works, in order to support their theories on early Christian thought and Greek apologists of the 2nd century.\n\n\n"}

The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the pyramid. It is also related to the Obelisk.\n\nIn the Pyramid Texts, e.g. Utterances 587 and 600, Atum himself is at times referred to as \"mound\". It was said to have turned into a small pyramid, located in Heliopolis (Egyptian: \"Annu\" or \"Iunu\"), within which Atum was said to dwell. Other cities developed their own myths of the primeval mound. At Memphis the god Tatenen, an earth god and the origin of \"all things in the shape of food and viands, divine offers, all good things\" was the personification of the primeval mound.\n\nThe Benben stone, named after the mound, was a sacred stone in the temple of Ra at Heliopolis (Egyptian: \"Annu\" or \"Iunu\"). It was the location on which the first rays of the sun fell. It is thought to have been the prototype for later obelisks, and the capstones of the great pyramids were based on its design. The capstone or the tip of the pyramid is also called a \"pyramidion\". In ancient Egypt, these were probably gilded, so they shone in sunlight.\n\nThe pyramidion is also called 'Benben stone'. Many such Benben stones, often carved with images and inscriptions, are found in museums around the world.\n\nThe bird deity Bennu, which was probably the inspiration for the phoenix, was venerated at Heliopolis, where it was said to be living on the Benben stone or on the holy willow tree.\n\nAccording to Barry Kemp, the connection between the benben, the phoenix, and the sun may well have been based on alliteration: the rising, \"weben\", of the sun sending its rays towards the benben, on which the benu bird lives. Utterance 600, § 1652 of the Pyramid Texts speaks of Atum as \"you rose up, as the benben, in the Mansion of the Benu in Heliopolis\".\n\nFrom the earliest times, the portrayal of Benben was stylised in two ways; the first was as a pointed, pyramidal form, which was probably the model for pyramids and obelisks. The other form was round-topped; this was probably the origin of Benben as a free standing votive object, and an object of veneration.\n\nDuring the Fifth Dynasty, the portrayal of benben was formalized as a squat obelisk. Later, during the Middle Kingdom, this became a long, thin obelisk.\n\nIn the Amarna Period tomb of Panehesy, the benben is seen as a large, round-topped stela standing on a raised platform.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "310463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310463", "title": "Church of All Worlds", "text": "Church of All Worlds\n\nThe Church of All Worlds (CAW) is an American Neopagan religious group whose stated mission is to evolve a network of information, mythology, and experience that provides a context and stimulus for reawakening Gaia and reuniting her children through tribal community dedicated to responsible stewardship and evolving consciousness. It is based in Cotati, California.\nThe key founder of CAW is Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, who serves the Church as \"Primate\", later along with his wife, Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart (d. 2014), designated High Priestess. CAW was formed in 1962, evolving from a group of friends and lovers who were in part inspired by a fictional religion of the same name in the science fiction novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961) by Robert A. Heinlein; the church's mythology includes science fiction to this day. \nCAW's members, called \"Waterkin\", espouse Paganism, but the Church is not a belief-based religion. Members experience Divinity and honor these experiences while also respecting the views of others. They recognize \"Gaea,\" the Earth Mother Goddess and the Father God, as well as the realm of Faeries and the deities of many other pantheons. Many of their ritual celebrations are centered on the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece.\n\nCAW began in 1961 with a group of high school friends. One of these was Richard Lance Christie from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Christie was fascinated by the \"self-actualization\" concepts of Abraham Maslow, a renowned American psychologist, and after meeting then-Timothy Zell at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, he began experiments in extrasensory perception. It was during this time that the group they read Heinlein's science fiction novel, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961), which became the inspiration for CAW.\nHeinlein's book, combined with Maslow's self-actualization concepts, led to the formation of a waterbrotherhood that Zell and Christie called Atl, the Aztec word for \"water\", and also meaning \"home of our ancestors\". Atl became dedicated to political and social change and the group grew to about 100 members.\nZell formed CAW from Atl, and filed for incorporation as a church in 1967. It was formally chartered on March 4, 1968, making it the first Earth religion to obtain full United States recognition as a church.\n\nCAW modeled its organization after the group in Heinlein's novel, as a series of 9 nests in circles of advancement that were each named after a planet. The basic dogma of the CAW was that there was no dogma – the basic \"belief\" was a stated \"lack of belief\". Within their religion, the only sin was hypocrisy and the only crime in the eyes of the church was interfering with another person.\n\nMoving toward an emphasis on nature eventually led to a breaking of the relationship between CAW and Atl. By 1974, CAW had nests in more than a dozen states around the United States. That year, Zell married Morning Glory (\"née\" Diana Moore) and in 1976 he and Morning Glory settled in Eugene, Oregon and then at the Coeden Brith land in northern California. \nWhen Zell stepped away from central leadership, the Church of All Worlds suffered internal strife that led to most of the church dissolving. By 1978 the focus and headquarters shifted to California with the Zells and the nine-circle nest structure was revamped. CAW then served for several years as an umbrella organization for its subsidiaries.\n\nMorning Glory Zell founded the Ecosophical Research Association (ERA) in 1977 to research arcane lore and legends. Its first project of note was the creation of living unicorns in 1980, after noting that early art depicts the creatures as being more goat-like than horse-like. The Zells reconstructed what they claimed was an ancient unicorning procedure, a process involving surgically manipulating the horn buds of kids during their first week of life, and created several unicorns, some of which toured with the Ringling Brothers Circus for a time. The ERA sponsored a Mermaid expedition to Papua, New Guinea in 1985 and a later ERA project involved the May 1996 worldwide ritual to draw upon and re-activate the Oracle at Delphi. This rite involved a relatively early attempt at utilizing online community and internet-facilitated virtual community rituals conducted simultaneously across different time zones, led by Maerian Morris, another former High Priestess of CAW, working from Delphi. The reactivation of Delphi was the subject of a series of six editorials in \"Green Egg\" (issues 125 through 130) from November/December 1998 through September/October 1999.\nIn 1978 CAW merged with Nemeton, a Pagan organization founded by Gwydion Pendderwen and Alison Harlow. In 1987 CAW also absorbed Forever Forests, another one of Pendderwen's organizations. An outgrowth of Forever Forests was founded in 1983 by Anodea Judith, past president and High Priestess of CAW, called Lifeways. \nThe Holy Order of Mother Earth (HOME), founded in 1978 by the Zells, is another subsidiary, dedicated to magical living and working with the land.\n\nOberon and Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart have appeared at over 20 Starwood Festivals (and a few WinterStar Symposiums) over the past 25 years; because of this, there has been a Church of All Worlds presence at Starwood, called the CAWmunity, for over a decade.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, CAW had practically ceased operation outside of Ukiah, California where the Zells relocated in 1985. Anodea Judith assumed presidency until 1991, and the structure of the organization was revamped with plans for more nest meetings, training courses, new rituals, and publications. By the late 1980s CAW had increased membership internationally, becoming particularly strong in Australia, where it was legally incorporated in 1992.\nIn 1998 Oberon Zell-Ravenheart took a year-and-a-day sabbatical from his role as Primate, and the church headquarters were moved to Toledo, Ohio.\n\nOn August, 2004, the Board of Directors decided to terminate CAW due to financial and legal struggles. In January, 2006, due to the effort of Jack Crispin Cain to help save the organization, CAW was reestablished with Zells again assuming a leadership role. In 2007, \"Green Egg\", CAW's influential journal, returned to publication in an online format. The \"3rd Phoenix Resurrection of the Church\" continues to the present.\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote for \"In Living Color\", and co-wrote and produced the movie \"Celtic Pride\", which starred Damon Wayans and Dan Aykroyd.\n\nQuinn was hired as a writer and featured player on \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") in 1996 and became a full cast member during the 1997–1998 season. He established himself on the show with recurring characters and segments such as \"Lenny the Lion\", \"Joe Blow\", \"Colin Quinn Explains \"The New York Times\"\", and \"Weekend Update\".\n\nQuinn began hosting \"Weekend Update\" in January 1998 after Norm Macdonald was fired, and anchored the segment until his departure from \"SNL\" in 2000. He commented on a number of highly publicized media circuses, including the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and the Microsoft anti-trust trial.\n\nDuring his tenure on \"SNL\", Quinn turned down an offer for the role of Scott Evil in fellow cast member Mike Myers's film \"\". Quinn has called the role, which was ultimately played by Seth Green, the only project he has regretted turning down.\n\nAfter leaving \"SNL\", Quinn hosted the short-lived \"The Colin Quinn Show\" on NBC in the spring of 2002. The show combined sketch comedy and stand-up in a live-to-tape format. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, it was cancelled after three episodes.\n\nQuinn had greater success with his subsequent show, \"Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn\", which ran on weekdays on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2004. The show featured a panel of four comedians, with Quinn as host, discussing the social and political issues of the day. The show ran for over 200 episodes.\n\nHis stand-up was also used in the animated series \"Shorties Watchin' Shorties\".\nIn 2005, Quinn participated in a USO tour of American military bases around the world, performing stand-up to entertain the troops.\n\nHe was the \"unofficial co-host\" on the Nick DiPaolo show on the now-defunct 92.3 Free FM in New York City, airing Monday–Friday from noon to three. Quinn and DiPaolo were originally slated to host the show together on WJFK-FM, but the station decided not to pick up the show. Quinn was also a regular guest on \"The Opie & Anthony Show\" until its run ended in 2014.\n\nQuinn played Dickie Bailey, the childhood rival to Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler's character) in both \"Grown Ups\" films. He also currently recurs as Hermie on the HBO series \"Girls\".\n\nQuinn wrote and starred in the L/Studio web series \"Cop Show\", which premiered in February 2015. The series stars Quinn as a satirical, pompous version of himself, starring in a New York City-based crime drama. The show's guest stars have included Jerry Seinfield, Dave Attell, Chris Rock, Steve Buscemi, Jim Gaffigan, Michael Che, Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Pat Cooper, Irina Shayk and Amy Schumer.\n\nQuinn had a supporting role in Amy Schumer's film debut, \"Trainwreck\", as her character's father. He was critically praised for his performance.\n\nQuinn made his Broadway debut in 1998 in a one-man show, \"Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake\", co-written with Lou DiMaggio. The show reflected Quinn's upbringing within the Irish-American community of Brooklyn; it was set at a wake in 1976, with Quinn portraying family members and acquaintances who show up for the event.\n\nIn 2009, Quinn premiered his second one-man show \"My Two Cents\", which covers the economic crumbling of the American empire.\n\nIn 2010, Quinn premiered his third one-man show \"Colin Quinn Long Story Short\" on Broadway, directed by Jerry Seinfeld. The show covered world history from prehistoric times to the present, offering satirical takes on the rise and fall of various world empires. Quinn recorded a special performance of the show that aired on HBO on April 9, 2011. A Brazilian version of the show featuring comedian Bruno Motta has the title \"1 Milhao de Anos em 1 Hora\" (\"1 Million Years in 1 Hour\").\n\nIn 2013, Quinn premiered another one-man show on historical themes, \"Unconstitutional\", which covers the United States Constitution, its creation, and its impact on the American psyche.\n\nQuinn starred in his fifth one-man show, \"The New York Story\", in July and August 2015 at the Cherry Lane Theatre. The show was based upon the experiences chronicled in his book, \"The Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America\". It delves into his growing up in the ethnically diverse Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and how it has changed over the years into its current state. Seinfeld, who directed \"Long Story Short\", returned as director.\n\nQuinn has gained attention for his account on the social network Twitter, where he usually posts deliberately vacuous statements, often in the form of either inspirational statements or boasts about his celebrity status, that are intended to provoke his readers.\n\nIn conversation with Judd Apatow in 2015 for the David Lynch Foundation Trainwreck tour, Quinn said he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation for five years.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, Quinn suffered a heart attack in New York. On Twitter several days later, he said he was doing well but if he dropped dead \"you would see a funeral like Al Capone!\"\n\nIn 2004, Quinn was named No. 56 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all-time.\n\nHe was named one of the Top 100 Irish Americans of the year in 2004 and 2011 by the magazine \"Irish America\".\n\n"}

Buddhism is the state religion. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the period covered by this report, and government policy continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion. There were limited reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\nThe country has an area of , and a population of approximately 14.1 million. An estimated 93 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist. The Theravada Buddhist tradition is widespread and strong in all provinces, with an estimated 4,100 pagodas throughout the country. Since the vast majority of ethnic Khmer Cambodians are Buddhist, there is a close association between Buddhism, Khmer cultural traditions, and daily life. Adherence to Buddhism generally is considered intrinsic to the country's ethnic and cultural identity. The Mahayana branch of Buddhism is practiced by approximately 150,000 followers and has 63 temples throughout the country.\n\nThere are approximately 500,000 to 700,000 Muslims (between 3.5 and 5 percent of the population), predominantly ethnic Cham, who generally are found in towns and rural fishing villages on the banks of the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers and in Kampot Province. Some organizations that work with or have contacts in the Cham Muslim population cite lower estimates for the number of Cham Muslims in the country. A nationwide census scheduled for 2008 should provide a more accurate estimate. There are four branches of Islam represented: the Malay-influenced Shafi'i branch, practiced by 88 percent of Cham Muslims; the Saudi-Kuwaiti-influenced Salafi (sometimes called \"Wahhabi\") branch, which claims six percent of the Muslim population although this number is increasing; the indigenous Iman-San branch, practiced by three percent; and the Kadiani branch, which also contributes three percent. There are 200 to 300 mosques of the four main branches and 200 to 300 small Surav mosques, which have congregations of up to 40 persons and do not have a min-bar from which Friday sermons are given. The small, but growing, Christian community constitutes approximately two percent of the population. There are an estimated 100 Christian organizations or denominations that operate freely throughout the country and include approximately 2,400 churches; however, only 900 of these churches are officially registered. Other religious organizations with small followings include the Vietnamese Cao Dai religion and the Baha'i Faith, each with an estimated 2,000 practicing members.\n\nForeign missionary groups operate freely. A June 26, 2007, announcement by the Ministry of Cults and Religions restated a 2003 ban on door-to-door proselytizing and similar proselytizing activities such as using a loudspeaker or directing assistance only to denomination members. However, open-ended assistance activities by missionary groups are encouraged.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. The government does not tolerate abuse of religious freedom, either by governmental or private actors. However, Buddhism is the state religion. The Government promotes national Buddhist holidays, provides Buddhist training and education to monks and others in pagodas, and modestly supports an institute that performs research and publishes materials on Khmer culture and Buddhist traditions. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion.\n\nThe law requires all religious groups, including Buddhist groups, to submit applications to the Ministry of Cults and Religious Affairs if they wish to construct places of worship and conduct religious activities. In their applications, groups must state clearly their religious purposes and activities, which must comply with provisions forbidding religious groups from insulting other religious groups, creating disputes, or undermining national security. However, there is no penalty for failing to register, and in practice some groups do not.\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, there were no reports that any religious groups encountered significant difficulties in obtaining approval for construction of places of worship. The Directive on Controlling External Religions requires registration of places of worship and religious schools, in addition to government approval prior to constructing new places of worship. Places of worship must be located at least 2 kilometers from each other and may not be used for political purposes or to house criminals or fugitives from the law. The distance limitation has begun to be enforced but applies only to new construction of places of worship and not to offices of religious organizations. The order requires that religious teachings respect other religious groups.\n\nGovernment officials continued to organize annual meetings for representatives of all religious groups to discuss religious developments and to address problems of concern.\n\nThe Constitution designates Buddhism as the state religion. The government permits Buddhist religious instruction in public schools as an extension of this constitutional designation.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion. Despite re-issuance in June 2007 of a ban on door-to-door proselytizing, foreign missionary groups generally operated freely throughout the country and did not encounter significant difficulties in performing their work. Government officials expressed appreciation for the work of many foreign religious groups in providing much needed assistance in education, rural development, and training; however, officials also expressed some concern that foreign groups used the guise of religion to become involved in illegal or political affairs. During the reporting period, the Government did not close any Islamic schools (madrassahs) as it had in the past.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nThere were limited reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\nOn the morning of April 26, 2006, a Buddhist mob knocked down and burned an unfinished Christian church in Kandal Province. Reportedly, provincial authorities had denied the Wesleyan Church permission to build a church, so the group built a house for religious teachers to be converted to a church at a later date. The district governor of the area reportedly negotiated a reconciliation agreement between the Buddhists and Christians in the area, whereby the house could be rebuilt and no charges pressed against those who participated in the riot. The local church leader confirmed that the house had not been rebuilt but he planned to turn the property into a school.\n\nMinority religious groups experienced little or no societal discrimination during the period covered by this report; however, Muslims and Christians reported minor conflicts.\n\nOccasional tensions were reported among the branches of Islam that receive monetary support from groups in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Malaysia, or Indonesia, depending on the tenets of the branch. Some Buddhists also expressed concern about the Cham Muslim community receiving financial assistance from foreign countries. However, in general, Cham Muslims were well integrated into society, enjoyed positions of prominence in business and the government, and faced no reported acts of discrimination or abuse during the period covered by this report.\n\nThere are ecumenical and interfaith organizations, which are often supported by funding from foreign public or private groups.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10972528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10972528", "title": "Incident (Scientology)", "text": "Incident (Scientology)\n\nL. Ron Hubbard used the term Incident in a specific context for auditing in Scientology and Dianetics: the description of space operatic events in the Universe's distant past, involving alien interventions in past lives. It is a basic belief of Scientology that a human being is an immortal spiritual being, termed a thetan, trapped on planet Earth in a \"meat body\".\n\nAlthough Incidents can be any incident anywhere, Hubbard's writings described some in particular, set in Earth's prehistory. Many of them first appeared in Hubbard's book \"What to Audit\" (later retitled \"A History of Man\").\n\nIn his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes Incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few trillion years. Most of these followed a consistent pattern, wherein a hostile alien civilization captured and brainwashed free thetans. Often, instances of implantation are termed \"Incidents\", while the subject of the implants are often termed \"Goals\". Some Incidents are simply unusual and traumatic events, whereof the memory is said to linger for trillions of years. According to Hubbard, only Scientology's methods can remove the resulting neuroses.\n\n\"There is a Before Earth and a Before MEST Universe in all banks. The incidents are not dissimilar. They consist of the preclear being summoned before a council, being frowned down, being sent elsewhere than where he was... the council's intent is to reduce the person downscale in order to get a more obedient colonist.\"\n\nThe Body Builder Incident took place around fifty million years ago and variants of it are said by Hubbard to have recurred often, wherein the thetan was forced to fight with his own \"attention units\" and build a MEST body from them.\n\n\"Bodies in pawn result\" from a \"very gruesome experience\" in which:\n\na fellow is grabbed, hypnotized, shoved into an electronic field, and then told he is somewhere else. And so he departs—most of him—and goes to the new location while still being under control of the implanters. He picks up a MEST [physical] body in the new location and starts living a life there, \"while still having a living body somewhere else\". The implanters can keep his original body alive indefinitely, and control the thetan through it. If the thetan tries to flee, the hypnotizers simply cause pain to the original body, still alive in a vat of fluid, and he is immediately recalled. That's a BODY IN PAWN. It's a second body you may have, living somewhere else, right in present time. But the second body is not under YOUR direct control.\n\nThey can apparently cause major problems for people undergoing medical operations, as \"pain, an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shocking impact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the sudden impact\". This gives the patient a repressed feeling of having died and leaves him \"very, very badly disturbed\".\n\nThe Bubble Gum Incident was an important early incident \"where you are hit with a motion and finally develop an obsession about motion\". It was the first incident on the \"whole track\" which included words.\n\nHubbard openly acknowledged the absurdity of the name, ironically noting: \"I wish you to carefully note these very technical terms like \"bubble gum\"\", to which the audience laughs heartily.\n\nIn his book \"A History of Man\", Hubbard referred to the Bubble Gum Incident as \"The Fly Trap\": \"Very, very early on the track, a long time before the present populace came into being, there was a theta trap called the Fly Trap. It was of a gummy material... also called the 'Bubble Gum' incident, because every time a thetan pushes against it, it pushes back and it finally gives him an obsession about motion\".\n\nHubbard gave the name \"The Coffee Grinder\" to the MEST aspect of the Fourth Invader Force's Fac One, which he termed \"an outright control mechanism, invented to cut down rebel raids on invader installations\". It was \"originally laid down in this galaxy about one million years ago\", says Hubbard, and consists of \"a two-handled, portable machine which, when turned, emits a heavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering 'baps'\".\n\n\"The invader gratuitously left these machines around for the yokels. Believing that the treatment was vital to get to heaven or some such thing, the yokels practiced on each other, found new victims and generally spread the implant around.\"\n\nA Xenu-like story in which alien invaders in flying saucers \"plant\" living entities. Says Hubbard in \"A History of Man\": \"Here is an intriguing incident which, if your preclear demands, should be audited. This is evidently a method of transportation of beings to a new area. The being is packed in ice, is taken to the new area and is usually dumped in the ocean. Your preclear, if he has this one in restimulation, has very cold hands and feet chronically\".\n\nHubbard also notes: \"The new crew in the area is later quite surprised to find that their planted beings, so carefully dumped in the sea from a saucer, are being picked up between lives and given \"treatment\" by an old, established invader whose methods of political control are long since established\".\n\nAccording to Hubbard, \"here we have an invader trick, a method of trapping thetans\", wherein the alien invaders trick the thetans into gathering an endless loop of facsimile pictures and confusing themselves, ultimately ending in an explosion. Hubbard warns auditors, \"You will find a preclear with this in restimulation to be very curious about cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes which have pictures of cereal boxes\".\n\nThese incidents are described in the material for Operating Thetan level III and are audited on that level.\n\nIncident I is set four quadrillion years ago, wherein an unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise, followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a chariot followed by a trumpeting cherub. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant opening the gateway to the present universe, separating thetans from their \"static\" (natural/godlike) state. The incident is described in Operating Thetan level III (OT III), written in 1967.\n\nThe R6 Implants were the work of the Galactic Confederacy's tyrannical leader, Xenu, 75 million years ago. According to Hubbard, Xenu destroyed billions of captured subjects during Incident II by dropping them into volcanoes and attacking them with nuclear weapons. The subjects, once disembodied, were forced to watch a \"three-D, super colossal motion picture\" for thirty-six days. This implanted pictures \"contain[ing] God, the Devil, Angels, space opera, theaters, helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinning dancer, trains and various scenes very like modern England.\"\n\nThe Aircraft Door Goals were implanted between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago aboard the fuselage of an aircraft, with the subject thetan held motionless in front of the aircraft door. Hubbard writes that \"the goal items were laid in with explosions\". The specific goals given in this implant were variants of the command \"to create\".\n\nAccording to Scientology, the Gorilla Goals were a series of implants created by invaders from Helatrobus \"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago\". They were\ngiven in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel... The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park. This activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in meat body societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for these implant \"Amusement Parks.\" A pink-striped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment.\n\nThe Hoipolloi used \"fantastic motion\" as well as \"blasts of raw electricity and explosions\" to brainwash the thetans into accepting the Gorilla Goals, with the goals including \"To End\", \"To be Dead\", \"To be Asleep\", \"To be Solid\", \"To be Sexual\" and so on.\n\nThe Bear Goals were very similar to the Gorilla Goals, except that \"instead of a mechanical gorilla a mechanical or live bear was used, and the motion was even more violent\". They were implanted by \"a group called \"The Brothers of the Bear\" and were the ancestors of the Hoipolloi\".\n\nThe Invisible Picture Goals were implanted by an early race of alien implanters some time between \"110,000 trillion trillion years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion years ago\". They comprised brainwashing of captive thetans by showing them pictures of diametrically opposed goals such as \"Wake, Never Wake, Sleep, Never Sleep\", as well as invisible pictures to confuse the thetan. The other pictures would \"consist usually of a scene of a cave, a railway, an airplane, a view of a sun and planets\".\n\nDevised by the Marcabians and implemented between \"hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago\", the Train Goals were a series of implants given in a huge train station. The thetan was put into \"a railway carriage quite like a British railway coach with compartments\" and subjected to a barrage of \"white energy\". During the implant sequence:\na face may come up and say \"You still here? Get out. Get off this train. We hate you.\" And from the speakers \"This happened to you yesterday, tomorrow, now. This is your departure point, keep coming back. You'll be meeting all your friends here. When you're killed and dead keep coming back. You haven't a chance to get away. You've got to report in. This happened to you days ago, weeks ago, years ago. You don't know when this happened to you. We hate you. Get out. Don't ever come back.\" \n\nThe Black Thetan Goals, also known as the Glade Implants, were implanted between \"390 trillion trillion years to 370 trillion trillion years ago\". According to Hubbard, they were \"in a glade surrounded by the stone heads of \"black thetans\" who spat white energy at the trapped thetan\". The goals included such things as \"To End, To be Dead, To be Asleep\" and so on.\n\nThe Heaven Implants were given \"43,891,832,611,177 years, 344 days, 10 hours, 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10: P.M. Daylight Greenwich Time May 9, 1963.\" They comprised two series of views of Heaven, the first of which was quite positive: Hubbard compares Heaven to \"Busch Gardens in Pasadena\". In the second series, Heaven had become a lot shabbier:\n\nThe place is shabby. The vegetation is gone. The pillars are scruffy. The saints have vanished. So have the Angels. A sign on one (the left as you \"enter\") says \"This is Heaven\". The right has a sign \"Hell\" with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archaeological diggings with raw terraces, that lead to \"Hell\".\n\nHubbard reported that he had encountered no \"devils or satans\". Heaven was, however, not quite as conventionally depicted, and took the form of a town which \"consisted of a trolley bus, some building fronts, sidewalks, train tracks, a boarding house, a bistro in a basement where there is a 'bulletin board' well lighted, and a BANK BUILDING.\" Hubbard described how the second series of Heaven implants depicts:\n\na passenger getting on the trolley bus, a \"workman\" halfway down the first stairs of To Forget \"eating lunch\" and in To Be in Heaven a gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind a hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming.(\"Heaven\", HCOB May 11, 1963)\n\nAfter being ridiculed in the Anderson Report (an Australian public inquiry into Scientology), this bulletin was withdrawn from circulation.\n\nThese were implanted by the inhabitants of the planet Helatrobus, some \"382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago\". The Helatrobans were motivated by a fear of free thetans and sought to restrain them by capturing and brainwashing thetans in order to weaken them. In a series of lectures, Hubbard goes into some detail about how this was done:\nPlanets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses. And very often a long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people, waves of radioactive clouds, Magellanic clouds, black and gray, would sweep over and engulf the planet, and it would be living in an atmosphere of radioactivity, which was highly antipathetic to the living beings, bodies, plants, anything else that was on this planet.\nAnd so planetary systems would become engulfed in radioactive masses, gray and black. And the earmarks of such a planetary action was gray and black – gray towering masses of clouds. These Magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come anywhere near a planetary system.(\"State of OT\")\n\nWhen a planet had been engulfed, the Helatrobans would attack it with \"little orange-colored bombs that would talk\" and the clouds themselves would talk: \"And here you'd have a gray cloud going by and it'd be saying, 'Hark! Hark! Hark!' you see? 'Watch out! Look out! Who's there? Who's that?'\"\n\nHapless people on the planet's surface would be kidnapped using a small capsule \"placed at will in space. It shot out a large bubble, the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule. Then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft.\" A victim would then be implanted for up to six months and the Helatrobans would \"fix him on a post in a big bunch of stuff ... put him on a post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on a little monowheel. Little monowheel pole trap. And it had the effigy of a body on it.\" (\"State of OT\")\n\nIn the \"Assists\" lecture of October 3, 1968, Hubbard described a surreal cosmological event said to take place shortly after Incident I (the creation of the universe): \"There's the incident called \"The Obscene Dog\" with its just a little bit later than Incident One. And sometimes actually by running it, why you can get the PC into Incident One. The Obscene Dog was a sort of a brass dog in a sitting position and anybody who got around to the front of the dog got caught in some electronic current and passed through the dog to the dog's rear end and spat out. Thetans didn't like this.\"\n\n\nNote: HCOB refers to \"Hubbard Communications Office Bulletins\", HCOPL refers to \"Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letters\", and SHSBC refers to \"Saint Hill Special Briefing Courses\". All have been made publicly available by the Church of Scientology in the past, both as individual documents or in bound volumes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jivaka built a monastery on the location and also donated it to the samgha. The Buddha is said to have been treated once in the monastery, after having been injured by Devadatta.\n\nThe initial monastery was formed of two long parallel and oblong halls, large dormitories where the monks could eat and sleep, in conformity with the original regulations of the samgha, without any private cells. Other halls were then constructed, mostly long, oblong building as well, which remind of the oblong construction of several of the Barabar caves.\n\nThe archaeological evidence point to a very early construction for this vihara, probably circa 530-400 BCE. This vihara is very different from the later quadrangular vihara built from the 1st century CE in Gandhara. The absence of stupa is also noticeable, contrary to the viharas built with stupas at a later date.

In 1941, Pope Pius XII designated the feast day as an official feast of the Catholic liturgical calendar.\n\nIn 1973, following the Second Vatican Council, the Chinese Bishops conference, upon approval from the Holy See, placed the feast day on the vigil (day preceding) of Mothers Day (the second Sunday of May).\n\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, a great number of soldiers attacked the village of Donglu, Hebei. The village consisted of a small community of Christians founded by the Vincentian Fathers. The Virgin Mary appeared in white, and a fiery horseman (believed to be St Michael) chased away the soldiers. The pastor, Fr Wu, commissioned a painting of Mary with Christ child dressed in golden imperial robes. This painting became the image of Our Lady, Queen of China. Donglu became a place of pilgrimage in 1924. The image was blessed and promulgated by Pope Pius XI in 1928.\n\nThere is a mosaic of Our Lady of China in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC, established and dedicated in 2002 under the Most Rev. Michael J. Bransfield There has been some controversy because the image used in the mosaic is not the officially approved image of Our Lady of China, but instead uses the image of Our Lady of China and Baby Jesus painted by John Lu Hung Nien. The late Cardinal Thomas Tien Keng-Hsin, the first Chinese Cardinal, used this image for the prayer card for the persecuted in China, which was widely promoted in the U.S.A. and Canada.\n\nSeveral churches, chapels, and pastoral centers around the world, predominantly those focused on ministry to Chinese-speaking Catholics, have adopted the name, including a mission in Washington, DC. St. Genevieve's Chinese Roman Catholic Church, Fresno, California also honors Our Lady of China. There is a Chapel of Our Lady of China in the Diocese of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn the Philippines where the Chinese and Chinese-Filipinos comprise the biggest ethnic community, the Santa Maria Parish of the Jesuit Fathers, located at the old Ateneo campus in Iloilo City, is the only church in the country dedicated to Our Lady of China that is duly recognized by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). The Archdiocesan Shrine of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in D. Jakosalem, Cebu City, still by the Jesuits, also houses an image of Our Lady of China. It used to be dedicated to this title of Our Lady until the patronage was changed to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Although Binondo in Manila is the country's Chinese capital, both the Minor Basilica of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz (Filipino Parish) and the Binondo Chinese Parish does not house an image of the Chinese Madonna (as clarified by representatives of both parishes). As of April 2015, images of Our Lady of China (sometimes referred to as Our Lady of Sheshan) can be found at the following Chinese-Filipino Catholic communities: Santa Maria Parish-Our Lady of China, Iloilo City; Archdiocesan Shrine of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Cebu City; Saint Peter the Apostle Parish, Paco, Manila; Lorenzo Ruiz Mission Society Seminary, Manila; Saint Jude Catholic School (National Shrine of Saint Jude Thaddeus), Manila and Queen of Peace Parish, Bacolod City.\n\nThe Our Lady of Sheshan is another, similar apparition which has attained like acclamation and fame among Chinese Christians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35859960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35859960", "title": "Our Lady of Salvation", "text": "Our Lady of Salvation\n\nOur Lady of Salvation (), also known as Our Lady of Light, is a Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The devotion to Our Lady of Salvation is based on a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary that was first venerated in Joroan (now part of Tiwi, Albay) in the Philippines. The image was canonically crowned by the Catholic Church on 25 August 1976, as the heavenly patroness of the province of Albay.\n\nThe original, 18th-century image of Our Lady of Salvation reflects her role, according to Catholic doctrine, as Co-Redemptrix. The Virgin is portrayed as carrying the Christ Child in her left arm, while her right arm grasps a man by the wrist as he is about to fall into a gaping Hellmouth. An angel kneels at the foot of the Virgin, offering a basket of burning hearts to Christ, who holds a burning heart in his right hand, while his left hand is stretched in a gesture of accepting the hearts.\n\nMuch of the history regarding the statue of the Lady of Salvation and the Marian devotion centered on it rely heavily on the written accounts, based on tradition, of the first parish priest of Joroan, Rev Lamberto S. Fulay (1919–1935), in his booklet \"An Kasaysayan Kan Ladawan Ni Birhen de Salvacion\".\n\nAccording to the Fulay account, in the 1770s a certain \"haciendero\" named \"Don\" Silverio Arcilla of Buhi, assigned a tenant farmer called Mariano Dacoba, to one of his vast estates in Joroan (once known as Cagnipa), which was a satellite \"barrio\" of Buhi. While Dacoba was clearing parts of Arcilla's \"hacienda\" one day, he chopped down a big \"Calpi\" tree. Although already severed at the base, the tree's leaves did not wilt and maintained its life and freshness. The tenant informed Arcilla about it, and the latter consulted with the pastor of Buhi.\n\nA certain sculptor called Bagacumba was commissioned by the pastor of Buhi to carve an image from the Calpi trunk that Dacoba had found. Three images were carved out of the wood: that of Our Lady of Salvation, one of Our Lady of Solitude, and that of Saint Anthony of Padua. On 25 August 1776, the image of Our Lady of Salvation was lent to Joroan on condition that the village's residents build a chapel at the centre of their \"barrio\". Consequently, a certain Sotera Cababag was assigned as the chapel's \"Hermana Mayor\", in charge of caring for the image.\n\nBuhi was initially the image's rightful owner as Arcilla (who owned the land the statue's wood came from), the parish priest who had it commissioned, and the sculptor were all from the town. On 21 January 1853, Buhi and Joroan had an agreement transferring rights over the image to the latter. Buhi's parish priest and \"Gobernadorcillo\", Rev Antonio Guadalajara and Mariano Buenaflor, respectively, made the pact with Joroan's barrio lieutenants. In accordance with the agreement, Buhi surrendered all its rights over the image if the people of Joroan made an offering of fifty pesos, and an additional twenty-five for a bell.\n\nJoroan, according to Fulay, was often the target of Muslim marauders due to its proximity to the sea. During an attack, the people of Joroan would flock to the image and pray to the Virgin for protection. Tradition notes that Muslims pillaging Joroan would constantly fail to ignite houses, and this was attributed to the Virgin.\n\nThe second miracle was when a \"Hermana Mayora\" known only as Tiray was captured in a Moro raid. After a year of being held captive in Sulu, Tiray fell into a deep sleep and upon waking up, had realised that she was not in her quarters but was standing in an unknown forest. She then saw in a strange, white deer in the woods, which she, out of curiosity, followed through the mountains until she lost sight of it. Tiray discovered that she had already been miraculously transported to Legazpi, and was now only 38 km away from Joroan. After this incident, the people of Joroan moved the chapel further away from the sea to a higher location in the mountains, in order to avoid its desecration by raiders.\n\nThe third miracle was an apparition of Our Lady of Salvation. Four devotees from the island of Catanduanes went on a pilgrimage to Joroan, bringing along with them a set of beeswax candles which they intended to offer at the shrine. Upon reaching shore, three of them made a detour to Buhi to light candles for Saint Anthony, while the fourth pilgrim was left to guard their boat. As the fourth man strolled along the beach at dusk, he met a woman carrying her child. The woman asked him for a candle that she may light her way home to the mountains, as it was almost dark. The man refused since the candle was not his, but the woman was insistent and promised that she would return the candle the next morning if he would come to her house uphill. Out of generosity, the man acquiesced to the lady, who told him he can the next day enquire where she lived from the town lieutenant of Joroan, so that she can return him his candle.\n\nThe next day, the man did as he was told, but the town lieutenant did not know where the mysterious lady lived. The lieutenant referred the pilgrim to the \"Hermana Mayor\", who was also of no help, save for advising the man to seek divine guidance at the chapel of Our Lady of Salvation. Upon arriving at the chapel, the pilgrim was surprised when, at the foot of the image, lay unused and unlit exactly the same candle which he had lent the mysterious lady the day before. Upon seeing that the image resembled the mysterious woman, the man was filled with compunction. and after leaving the candle alone, prostrated and asked the Virgin to pray for his sins.\n\nThe fourth miracle attributed to Our Lady of Salvation occurred during the years that a Dominga de los Reyes succeeded Tiray as \"Hermana Mayor\". While on one of their raids, the Moro pirates were said to have retreated almost immediately after seeing a vision of heavily armed men. The vision was said to have traumatised the raiders so much that it was the last Muslim attack on the shores of Joroan.\n\nOn the eve of the feast of Our Lady of Salvation in 1884, a group from the Partido was sailing to Joroan when a whirlwind attacked the boat. Giant waves almost capsized their boat, which suddenly regained its balance. Even though they were almost dumped into the water, the passengers' clothes were completely dry as though freshly ironed. The people in the boat attributed their escape from death to Our Lady of Salvation.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a territorial dispute arose over whether Joroan was governed from Buhi in Ambos Camarines, or Tiwi in Albay. A Captain Vera of Albay, however, argued that Tiwi's proximity to Joroan gave it rightful jurisdiction. Vera won the case, and Joroan was annexed by Tiwi.\n\nJoroan became very peaceful in the 1860s, as the boundary dispute was resolved, and the Muslims no longer attacked the \"barrio\". During this time, \"Doña\" Clara de Vera, the wife of a certain landlord named \"Don\" Vicente de Vera, became the image's \"Hermana Mayor\". \"Doña\" Clara vowed to care for the image until her death, and financed its silver and gold plating.\n\nUnsatisfied with her lifetime service, De Vera initiated constriction of a new church at the centre of the Joroan. In her eagerness to construct, she sought the help of her friend, \"Doña\" Saturnina de Bayot of Tabaco, to finance the project. Another acquaintance, \"Don\" Manuel Casa of Manila, also contributed greatly, sending the needed materials and an architect. During the long trip to Joroan, the architect Casa had dispatched fell seriously ill, and men had to support him as he supervised construction. After a great deal of pain, the architect was suddenly cured on the ninth day of his work.\n\nAfter the church was finished, the image was translated from the mountain chapel to the new shrine, beginning the annual custom of the image's \"traslación\" to Tiwi.\n\nThe people of Tiwi were also ardent devotees of Our Lady of Salvation. Tradition gives account that whenever the fiesta in Tiwi was approaching, the parish priest would personally retrieve the image from Joroan. The arrival of the image in Tiwi was a moment of great rejoicing, and a band would accompany its entry into the town.\n\nThe practice was cut short by the typhoon that devastated Joroan in 1895. The chapel was completely destroyed, but the image was miraculously still standing intact on its pedestal. The people of Joroan reconstructed half of the chapel from the debris, but later on everything deteriorated. A long and bitter rift between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi began, and since the former was under the rule of the latter, Rev Francisco Borondia took the image to Tiwi until a proper chapel was built in Joroan.\n\nThis meant that the direction of the \"traslación\" was reversed, and it was now the people of Joroan who borrowed the image during fiestas— an arrangement they greatly resented. They almost lost their right to it; that is why they had spent a lot of time, effort, and money to recover it, and had to inevitably incur the ire of the people of Tiwi.\n\nIn 1917, Joroan planned to hold a grand celebration from the beginning of the novena honouring the image up to a few days after the fiesta. On the ninth day, the people of Joroan requested of Rev Ricardo Sayson, the Tiwi parish priest, that the image be allowed to stay a little longer in Joroan so that might make further homage to the Virgin. Sayson refused, and arrogantly taunted the people, daring them to file a complaint at court.\n\nThe people of Joroan drafted a letter to Most Rev John Bernard McGinley, Bishop of Nueva Cáceres, requesting designation of a separate pastor for Joroan. Pedro Colar I and Lino Clutario were tasked to deliver the request, and immediately set out for the see in Naga, but turned back since McGinley was visiting Albay. The emissaries overtook McGinley in Iriga, but the bishop refused to discuss the matter there, suggesting that they talk about it in Malinao on 17 November 1917. On the appointed date, Joroan again sent Clutario, this time with Miguel Diolata, and the brothers Felipe and Lorenzo Clutario.\n\nLino Clutario was the group's spokesman, as he had the best command of English. During their audience, Clutario told Bishop McGinley that Joroan wanted a separate pastor for their barrio, and that the image of Our Lady of Salvation be ordered returned to them. The Bishop declined the first request due to a lack of priests in his diocese, but contemplated on the second with the order of the verification of the origin of the image. Another audience was set for two days later, this time with Tiwi as the venue, but nothing favourable for the people of Joroan resulted from the conference. The issue was brought to court, with Narciso Cultivo spearheading the case of the real owner of the image, and Domingo Imperial as lawyer. The civil court however deemed it an ecclesiastical matter and soon dropped it, endorsing the case to Bishop McGinley.\n\nIn 1918, Rev. Tomás Bernales succeeded Sayson as pastor of Tiwi. Bishop McGinley authorised him to settle the dispute with Joroan. In May of that year, Councilor Alfajara and Lieutenant Cultivo of Joroan met with Bernales, and both sides agreed that Joroan was to become a separate parish covering Sogod, Matalibong, Bariis, Maynonong, Misibis, Dapdap, and Mayong. Bishop McGinley was informed of the agreement, and named Rev. Lamberto S. Fulay as its first parish priest. The Parish of Joroan was canonically erected on 18 September 1919, with Fulay assuming duties as curé on 8 October.\n\nThe image of the Lady of Salvation was still in Tiwi, so in accordance with the 1918 agreement, another \"Traslación\" was scheduled for 20 November 1919. Joroan Church had no proper paraphernalia for the time being, so Bernales lent some of his things, while donations began to pour in from all over Albay to the newly established parish.\n\nThe images was greeted with fireworks as its boat docked at Joroan, and there great jubilation among the townsfolk. Early the next morning, a solemn High Mass was celebrated with a huge number of pilgrims from all over the Bicolandia in attendance. Also present were the Vicar Forane; the pastors of Tiwi, Tabaco, and Nabua; the Governor of Albay; the board members of the Provincial Government; the Municipal President; the Municipal Council; and other prominent people.\n\nAmong the terms of agreement made when Joroan was raised to the status of parish was the Episcopal Decree \"Constandoonos\" of 18 September 1919. The decree states that:\n\nAlthough already a parish by now, Joroan still had several issues. The Decree was no guarantee that the image was now fully in Joroan's possession, so a committee was organised with the purpose of appealing to Bishop McGinley for the Decree's revision and removal of the clause “except for a span of fifteen days”. McGinley rejected the request by further stating that the Decree is part of the terms of agreement for the elevation of Joroan to the status of a parish, and that its representatives signed it.\n\nIn 1920, Joroan was reminded to comply with the Decree. The people however, were still adamant for fear that something unfavourable might happen and majority of the people, especially the women, no longer favoured the idea of lending the image of the Lady of Salvation to Tiwi. This prompted Bishop McGinley to dispatch to Joroan Fr. Luis Dimaruba, a priest vested with ecclesiastical authority, to advise the people regarding their insolence, and to persuade them about the urgency of lending the image to Tiwi since the fiesta was approaching. However, it was only after the encouragement and assurance of the image’s return by their parish priest that led the people to reluctantly lend Tiwi the image.\n\nOn 6 August 1920, a cohort with Bernales leading them, arrived in Joroan to take the image. Before the image was taken, Bernales reassured the people that the image shall be returned after fifteen days. The absence of the image in the altar of their church made the people of Joroan so anxious that they never lost track of the fifteen-day promise. However, realizing that Tiwi had not yet returned the image even though the fifteen-day agreement had already expired, the people dispatched a big boat to Tiwi so that they could remind Bernales that the agreement had already expired and also to personally get the image.\n\nWhen Fulay greeted Bernales, the later was compelled to return the image. A huge number of people from Tiwi were present in the church to bid the image farewell. However, when the image was about to be handed over to Fulay, one of the onlookers screamed and seized the image from Bernales. The visitors from Joroan cried foul and rioting ensued.\n\nThe message was clear: the people of Tiwi refused to give back the image by violently declaring that the image was theirs. This claim is backed by the alleged testimony of the elders of Tiwi that the image in question was just a copy of the original: the copy belonged to Tiwi, while the original was Joroan’s. Folklore held that in those days there was an antique image of Our Lady of Salvation, and that the image’s Hermana Mayor was a certain Mitay. When it was still in a good condition it used to be brought down to the chapel whenever the image was in Tiwi, but that this has already been deteriorated with age. The people of Joroan abandoned it, and that the title of Our Lady of Salvation which the present image now bears originated from this antique image.\n\nFulay, seeing that the brawl would do no good, advised his parishioners to go home instead. He then wrote a letter to Bishop McGinley about the heightened tensions between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi. In response, McGinley reassured Joroan that the image will be returned to them. Owing to the previous rioting, the image was kept in the house of Vicente Vera for more than a month, and it was only on 28 September of that year that the image was returned to Joroan.\n\nTo prevent future violence, Bishop McGinley on 18 August 1920 declared that:\n\nTo keep the ardour of the same Marian devotion in Tiwi and to prevent further tensions, McGinley also permitted the creation of a replica for Tiwi. The original image has been permanently enshrined in Joroan since 1920.\n\nOn 8 December 1975, Teotimo Pacis, the Bishop of Legazpi, formally declared the Virgin Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Salvation, as the heavenly patroness of Albay. In 1976, the Diocese formally celebrated the Bicentennial Jubilee of its patroness. One of the projects during the Bicentennial was the completion of the shrine. The original design of the shrine was the handiwork of Juanito Pelea of Tiwi, but was later redesigned and finished under the supervision of Fidel Siappo of Legazpi City. After its completion, Bishop Pacis blessed the shrine on 21 August 1976.\n\nOn 25 August, as a culmination to its Bicentennial year, Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, crowned Our Lady of Salvation, while the Joroan Church was proclaimed a Diocesan shrine.\n\nEvery year, during the month of August until September, devotees from all over the Bicol Region visit the shrine of the Lady of Salvation in Joroan. The last Saturday of August is traditionally reserved as a special day of veneration wherein pilgrims would walk in a procession for 9 km from the St. Lawrence Church of Tiwi to the Diocesan Shrine in Joroan.\n\nIn Barangay Pasadena, San Juan, Metro Manila, the image is fêted on the third weekend of May with a Mass and procession.\nIn Caridad, Culasi, Antique, the barrio fiesta is celebrated every end of the month of May. It starts on the \"bisperas\" mass or the eve of the fiesta mass on May 28 and the fiesta proper is on May 29. The new image of Nuestra Senora de Salvacion was donated by the Cadiena-Española Family.\n\nIn the little barrio of Guinbanga-an, Laua-an also in the province of Antique the people of the barrio celebrated their yearly fiesta every month of November 25-26, they celebrated the fiesta with a procession and fiesta mass every November 26. The new Images of Nuestra Señora de Salvacion was donated by the Heirs of Tongcua-Luces Family, by their apos in the 4th and 5th Generation the Berte-Dolendo-Pepatco-Samillano Family of Barangay Guinbangga-an, Laua-an, Antique\n\n"}

{"id": "8265729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8265729", "title": "Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat", "text": "Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat\n\nThe Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat Kuntsevych (SSJK) is a society of traditionalist priests and seminarians originating from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church which is led by the excommunicated priest Basil Kovpak. It is based in Riasne, Lviv, Western Ukraine. In Lviv, the society maintains a seminary, at which currently thirty students reside, and takes care of a small convent of Basilian sisters. The SSJK is affiliated with the Society of St. Pius X and Holy Orders are conferred by the latter society's bishops in the Roman Rite. The SSJK clergymen, however, exclusively follow a version of Slavonic Byzantine Rite in the Ruthenian recension. According to senior officials of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic hierarchy, the society operates in direct defiance of the hierarchy.\n\nThe seminary of the SSJK is dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady and currently is attended by thirty seminarians. The seminary, the society says, is intended to be a modest support in the conversion to Catholicism not only of Ukraine, but of Russia as well. Devotion to Our Lady of Fatima and fidelity to traditional Catholic theology (with an emphasis on pre-conciliar theological emphases) are considered important.\n\nThe SSJK rejects the de-Latinization reforms currently being strongly enforced within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which is in full communion with Rome. These reforms began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. According to his biographer Cyril Korolevsky, however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of force against liturgical Latinizers. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the 1666 Schism in the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe de-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\" of the Second Vatican Council) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the Ukrainian diaspora. The Soviet occupation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be used in the underground. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity.\n\nIn his memoir \"Persecuted Tradition\", Basil Kovpak has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinize. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinizations since the days of the underground, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinized liturgy.\n\nThe SSJK for instance opposes the removal of the stations of the cross, the rosary, and the monstrance from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In rejecting these reforms, they also reject the right of the Church authorities to make these reforms; thus who controls the formate of liturgy becomes an important point of debate.\n\nCritics of the SSJK point out that their liturgical practice favours severely abbreviated services and imported Roman Rite devotions over the traditional and authentic practices and ancient devotions of Eastern Tradition and particularly the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Proponents counter that these \"Latin\" symbols and rituals, borrowed from their Latin Catholic Polish neighbours, have long been practised by Ukrainian Greek Catholics, in some cases for centuries, and that to suppress them is to deprive the Ukrainian Catholic faithful of a part of their own sacred heritage. The central point in the dispute is over what constitutes 'organic development'. \n\nThe Holy See, however, has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that Latinization was not an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are Pope Leo XIII's 1894 encyclical \"Orientalium dignitas\" and Saint Pius X's instructions that the priests of the Russian Catholic Church should offer the Liturgy, \"No More, No Less, and No Different,\" than the Orthodox and Old Ritualist clergy.\n\nThe SSJK also opposes the abandonment of Church Slavonic, the traditional liturgical language of the Slavic Churches (both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) in favour of the modern Ukrainian in the Liturgy of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. The society holds that Church Slavonic is essential to stress necessary Catholic unity among all Slavic peoples, and to avoid nationalism which has for a long time divided Slavic Christians.\n\nHowever, critics claim that the essence of Eastern liturgical practice is to pray in a language which is understood by the people, and that Church Slavonic has ceased to be such a language, becoming a pale imitation of the Western practice of using Latin to promote unity. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church has a large presence in many non-Slavic countries, with numerous eparchies and parishes in the diaspora, exacerbating the problem of parishioners not understanding what is being celebrated as well as raising issues of assimilation.\n\nThe Society of Saint Josaphat condemns ecumenism with the Orthodox currently practised by both the Holy See and the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Instead the society promotes Catholic missionary activities among the Orthodox, who are not in communion with the Holy See. In \"Persecuted Tradition\", Basil Kovpak cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.\n\nIn 2003, Cardinal Lubomyr Husar excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the Roman Rota in Vatican City and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.\n\nOn 22 November 2006 Bishop Richard Williamson who was then a member of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), illicitly ordained two priests and seven deacons in Warsaw, Poland, for the SSJK, in violation of canon 1015 §2, and of canons 1021 and 1331 §2 of the Code of Canon Law, and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. An SSPX priest who was present remarked, \"We were all very edified by their piety, and I myself was astonished by the resemblance of the atmosphere amongst the seminarians with that which I knew in the seminary – this in spite of the difference of language, nationality and even rite.\"\n\nArchbishop Ihor Vozniak of Lviv (the archdiocese in which Kovpak is incardinated) denounced Williamson's action as a \"criminal act\" and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests that Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy. Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face excommunication, and that \"'he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,' while supporting a group [SSPX] that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See.\" Accordingly, Kovpak's excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and confirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 23 November 2007.\n\nJohn Jenkins, a member of the Society of St. Pius X, said in 2006 that the new archbishop of Lviv declared that his main task for the following year was to eradicate the \"Lefebvrists\" from his territory.\n\nAlthough the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, with the backing of the Holy See, had thus declared Kovpak excommunicated and the Society of St. Josaphat lacking faculties for a ministry within the Catholic Church, they themselves maintain that, though they are in dispute with Lubomyr and, presumably, with his successor, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, and through their association with the Society of St Pius X, indirectly in dispute with the church hierarchy, they are loyal to the Pope and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and are merely resisting what they consider to be modernism, indifferentism, and liberalism.\n\n"}

Ramasamy\n\nThe religious views of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy resulted in him being considered the Voltaire of South India. Both opposed religion virulently because, in their views, the so-called men of religion invented myths and superstitions to keep the innocent and ignorant people in darkness and to go on exploiting them. Periyar has been a harsh critic of the Aryan influenced Hinduism in Tamil Nadu, more than the faiths of Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. He has spoken appreciatively of these other faiths in India finding in their ethics principles of equality and justice, thus advocating them if they can prove an alternative to Brahamanic Hinduism. With regards to institutionalized religion being used for personal gain, Periyar stated that \"religion goes hand in hand with superstition and fear. Religion prevents progress and suppresses man. Religion exploits the suppressed classes.\" As religions, however, they are prone to be hit by accusation of superstition, exploitation and irrationalism.\n\nIn periyar's school of thought, there was no religion by name Vedic Hinduism derived from the name of a place. With no distinct doctrines and no particular sacred book, it was said to be an imaginary religion preaching the superiority of the Brahmin the inferiority of the Shudra, and the untouchability of the Panchama.\n\nMaria Misra compares him to the philosophes, \n\nThrough the Self-Respect Movement,Periyar preached that compared to other religions, Hinduism placed many restrictions on men by prohibiting all except a small minority of Brahmins from reading the religious texts or discusing religious matters and by evolving a caste system in the name of divine law, and by creating several gods and festivals to provide an assured income and prosperity to the small Brahmin group at the expense of all others.\n\nVaikkam Periyar Ramasamy and Mahatma Gandhi—the former on a mission to destroy the essential practices perpetuated under Hinduism and the latter on a mission to protect, safeguard and rejuvenate the essence of Hindu religion—agreed on the basic point of the need to remove many evils practiced in the form of religion. Gandhiji aspired to 'reform' the religion by rejecting its formalities and moving out of it. Both believed that the Hindus should realize that Hinduism was not a religion and whatever they practiced in the name of Hindu religion had no religious basis or sanction. Both were of the opinion that religious faith was used to perpetuate inequalities on the basis of birth and ideas of purity and pollution.\n\nWhen the ideal of Dravidian nationalism was projected in the 1940s, Periyar's religious philosophy also underwent a modification to assert that Hinduism was not the religion of the Dravidians. There was no Dravidian \"Veda\" and the Aryan \"Vedas\" prevalent among Dravidians were said to be the sacred books which prescribed how Dravidians should be treated but put a bar on Dravidians from acquiring a knowledge of these texts. In his Presidential Address at the Justice Confederation in 1940 EVR said:\n\n\"We have to bring about certain reforms in our religion. Many of our countrymen think that they are Hindus. When you call yourself a Hindu you admit Aryan principles. The words Hindu and Hinduism were not used by our forefathers in any of their works. Historians of world religions say that the sacred books of the Hindus are the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Agamas, the Puranas and the Itihasas. You will notice that none of the ancient religious works of the Dravidians have been included among those religious books. A careful study of the Vedas, etc., proves beyond doubt that they were written with a view to disgrace, enslave and exploit the Dravidians. It is this Hinduism which says that we are Sudras and Rakshasas. Again it is this Hinduism which is responsible for the introduction of caste distinction and growth of feud among the sons of the soil. All our superstitions and meaningless and absurd rituals and ceremonies are the result of following the tenets of Hinduism. In addition to our social subjugation and enslavement it paved the way for our political enslavement also by Aryans. If we think calmly we shall see that it is as necessary to be free from Hinduism in the field of religion as it is to be separated from Aryavarta in the field of politics.\"\n\nThanthai Periyar, even while upholding rationalism, executed his duties of a `dharmakartha' of a temple at Erode, to everybody's appreciation. \n\nMarai Malai Adigal is an eminent Tamil Saivite scholar who founded Saiva Siddhantha Association. He lived as a Saiva saint.This orthodox Saiva scholar was once invited by Thanthai Periyar to stay in his place or ashram. Maraimalai Adigal agreed to stay with Periyar for a month. In that one month, Periyar respected the orthodoxy of Adigal and ordered not to cook non-vegetarian food in the ashram and instructed his aides not to do anything that would offend the saiva practices of Adigal. Periyar respected true believers.\n\nRamasamy said \"Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans\". In his book \"Vedangalin Vandavalangal\", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible.\n\nIn the early days of the Self-Respect Movement when Periyar was vociferous that Hindu religion, Manudharma and the Congress should be destroyed, he was inclined to play a political game by expressing an opinion that Islam alone was the religion that carried political weight and those depressed in the Hindu order could consider conversion to Islam.\n\nFor eradicating the evil of 'shudrahood', the threat of conversion was occasionally exercised. The Dravidian movement repeatedly complained about the imposition of Aryan religion on Dravidians. \"Unless we become either the Panchama, i.e., Adi Dravida or Muslims, we will not get respect, justice and progress,\" said EVR. He clarified that the idea was not to place the Dravidian people under the authority of Muslim religious leaders abroad but to practice the tenets of equality, righteous conduct and mutual respect. He emphasized that he was not an advocate of Islam but was only trying to find a remedy to the sufferings under Aryan, brahminical system and to find a rightful place for Dravidians in the independent country.\n\nPeiyar found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion as self-respect movement. The search for basis began in the course of the movement and was intensified soon after independence. It was again an experiment in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the shudrahood of Hinduism. A conference to propagate Buddhism was convened in Erode on January 31, 1954. Later that year, he and his wife [He married Maniammai when he was 74 years old] went to Burma to attend the celebration of the 2500th anniversary of Buddha.\n\nPeriyar stated that what he was propagating could be found in the teachings of Buddha given 2000 years ago and wanted to revive them as the independent government had accepted the wheel of the Buddha and Hindus have regarded Buddha as an \"avatar\". Brahmins were accused of covering Buddha within the Aryan religion as they had been hiding Tiruvalluvar within the Aryan fold. EVR pointed out that Buddha also laid stress on rationalism, on intellect as the precept, and on thought process for accepting anything. The persecution of Buddha by Brahmins, the burning of Buddhist institutions and teachings and the 'export' of Buddhism to China, Japan and Ceylon were recalled at the conference and Periyar observed that Buddha Vihars at Srirangam, Kanchi, Palani and Tirupati were converted as Hindu temples.\n\nPeriyar said \"Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans\". In his book \"Vedangalin Vandavalangal\", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible.\n\nHe was against evangelical movement of DGS Dinakaran and fought with him on this issue. In Periyar's publication, Naathigan, he used to vehemently oppose and criticize Dinakaran calling him fraud.\n\nChristianity was viewed by Periyar similar to monotheistic faith of Islam. He stated that, \"So far as god is concerned we find the Christians and Muslims, somewhat reformed from the olden days of barbarians. They say that there can be only one God. They say that it is beyond human comprehension. They say that God does good to those who are good and punishes those who are bad. They say that God has no name or shape. They talk of good qualities\". He took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer.\n\n\n"}

He is known as the Tiferes Shlomo after the title of his \"sefer\", which is considered a classic in Hasidic literature.\n\nRabinowicz's year of birth is variously cited as 1795, 1796, 1800, 1801, or 1803. He was born in Włoszczowa, Poland to Rabbi Dov Zvi (d. 1839), the \"av beis din\" (head of the rabbinical court) of Włoszczowa. Like most of the Jews of Poland, Rabbi Shlomo was called by his first name and patronymic; his children were the first to begin using the surname Rabinowicz. He was a descendant of Rabbi Nathan Nata Spira (1585 – 1633), a leading Polish Kabbalist and author of \"Megaleh Amukos\".\n\nRabinowicz studied in the yeshiva in Piotrków Trybunalski, where he was regarded as a prodigy. By his bar mitzvah he knew the entire \"Urim Ve'umin\" of Rabbi Yonatan Eibeshutz by heart and had composed his own \"chiddushim\" (novel Torah thoughts). Late at night, he would study Kabbalah texts.\n\nLater he became a \"talmid\" of Rabbi Meir of Apta, who was in turn a disciple of the Chozeh of Lublin. He became a Hasid of Rabbi Meir of Apta, Rabbi Fishele of Strikov, and Rabbi Yehoshua of Pshedburz. He also traveled to the Modzitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yechezkel of Kuzmir, and Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz. Though he was born 14 years after the death of Rebbe Elimelech of Lizhensk, he also considered himself a disciple of the latter and visited his grave every year. Since as a Kohen he was not allowed to come in contact with graves, he had a wall built around the area so that he could pray there.\n\nRabinowicz married Gitele, a pious woman who fasted every Monday and Thursday. She lived to the age of 92. After his marriage, he studied in the beth midrash in Włoszczowa while his wife ran a small store to support them. The store was not successful, however, and for this reason, when Rabinowicz was offered the position of Rav of the small Polish town of Radomsko (Radomsk), his rebbe, Rabbi Meir of Apta, advised him to accept. Rabinowicz became Rav of Radomsk in 1834. His weekly salary was 15 Polish gulden (2 rubles and 25 kopeks), an apartment, and an etrog for Sukkot. Later his salary increased to 6 rubles per week, and his wife was allowed to run her own business.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Jewish community of Radomsk grew in prestige and population. Rabinowicz founded the Radomsk Hasidic dynasty in 1843. When Rabbi Moshe Biderman of Lelov moved to Jerusalem in 1850 and instructed his Hasidim to follow Rabinowicz, the latter's influence as a Rebbe grew significantly. He went on to attract thousands of Hasidim and Radomsk grew into a major center of Hasidut. The masses revered their Rebbe for his lofty prayers, beautiful singing voice, and benevolence towards their needs, while the more scholarly Hasidim admired his profound discourses in Halakha and Kabbalah. Rabinowicz was a master at interpreting Torah verses through gematria and Hebrew letter permutations. Among his Hasidim were philosopher Aaron Marcus Verus and physician Chaim David Bernard of Piotrków.\n\nEven as he served as a Rebbe to thousands, Rabinowicz paid special attention to the needs of the Jews of Radomsk proper. When local Jews were conscripted by the Czar's army, he and his gabbai went door to door, collecting money to bribe the officials to release them. He also collected money for the poor to buy firewood in the winter, and to make matzos at Pesach. He spoke out often on the challenges facing the Jewish people of his day, including assimilation. In 1862 he pronounced a ban on the wearing of hoop skirts by Jewish women.\n\nRabinowicz had a beautiful singing voice and was renowned as a chazzan and composer of Hasidic music. His prayers were infused with both great emotion and great joy. He composed and sang new \"nigunim\" (melodies) each year for the High Holy Days and Jewish holidays. He also had a practice of visiting a different tzadik every Shavuot. On one such occasion, he visited the Tzadik of Kuzmir, Rabbi Emanuel of Pashdeborz, and was asked to lead the Akdamut piyyut. Rabinowicz requested the accompaniment of 80 singers, and the resulting choir, with his voice soaring over all, had a powerful effect. Rabinowicz used his soul-stirring \"nigunim\" to rouse his Hasidim to great fervor on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. He sent money to one of his Hasidim in Safed, Israel so that the latter would organize a Radomsker Shalosh Seudos meal every Shabbat at which his \"niggunim\" would be sung.\n\nRabinowicz died after reciting the \"Tikkun Chatzot\" prayers in the early-morning hours of Friday, 16 March 1866 (29 Adar 5626). He was buried later that day in an \"ohel\" on the grounds of the Jewish cemetery in Radomsk. His son and grandson were later buried in the same \"ohel\". His death was part of a triple loss for Polish Jewry, as he, the Chiddushei Harim, and the Tzemach Tzedek died within a month of each other.\n\nHe left three sons and three daughters. His sons were: Aryeh Leibusz (1823–1890), a Torah scholar and businessman; Hirsz (Zvi) Meir (d. 1902), who presided as \"av beis din\" of Radomsk and succeeded his father as Rav of the town; and Avraham Yissachar Dov, the \"Chesed LeAvraham\" (1843–1892), who succeeded his father as Radomsker Rebbe.\n\nRabinowicz's discourses on the Chumash and \"chagim\" (Jewish festivals) were published posthumously in Warsaw in 1867–1869 as the two-volume \"Tiferes Shlomo\". This work, considered a textbook of Hasidic thought, met with widespread acclaim and has been continuously reprinted.\n\n\n"}

In the 1930s it was settled by Mormon fundamentalists, who remain there to this day.\n\nIn May 1935, members of the Council of Friends, a breakaway group from the Salt Lake City-based The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), sent a handful of followers to the Short Creek Community with the express purpose of building \"a branch of the Kingdom of God.\" Barlow believed that the isolated Creek could provide a place of refuge for those engaging in the covert practice of polygamy, a felony; within a month, the town's population more than doubled. The Council of Friends membership desired a remote location where they could practice plural marriage, which had been publicly abandoned by the LDS Church in 1890.\n\nOn July 26, 1953, Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle sent troops into the settlement to stop polygamy in what became known as the Short Creek raid. The two-year legal battle that followed became a public relations disaster that damaged Pyle's political career and set a hands-off tone toward the town in Arizona for the next 50 years. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) later developed in the same geographical region and changed the name to Colorado City and Hildale to eliminate any ties to the Short Creek raids.\n\nThe concept of a Council of Friends or Priesthood Council was central to the Mormon fundamentalist theology developed by Lorin C. Woolley and others in the Short Creek Community. The Short Creek Community\nwas home to this council starting in the late 1920s. Since the authority of the Council of Friends pertained to the Priesthood and not to the Church, early Mormon fundamentalists, most of the residents of Short Creek Community had been excommunicated from the LDS Church. They felt that the existence of the Council of Friends gave them the right to continue solemnizing plural marriages even after Church President Wilford Woodruff's 1890 Manifesto discountenancing the practice.\n\nThe following are the leaders of the Council of Friends, and as such were also leaders in the Short Creek Community.\n\n, the descendants of the Short Creek Community are reported to have a high rate of cases of fumarase deficiency, an otherwise extremely rare genetic condition that causes severe physical and mental disability. The high rate of genetic disease is attributed to the inbreeding caused by generations of polygamy.\n\n"}

In response to his request, the Buddha gave the first Kalachakra tantra initiation and teachings at Amaravati, a small town in Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India, supposedly emanating at the same time he was also delivering the Prajñā-Pāramitā Sūtras at Vulture Peak Mountain at Rajgir in North India. Along with King Suchandra, 96 minor kings and emissaries from Shambhala are also said to have received the teachings.\n\nSuchandra is considered to be an emanation of Vajrapani, and a bodhisattva on the 10th ground. By practicing the Kalachakra, the whole of Shambhala became an enlightened society, with Suchandra as the ruler. King Suchandra wrote down the Kalachakra teachings he received, composing the 12,000-verse \"Mula\" or root text, which has not survived. He also built a huge three-dimensional Kalachakra mandala in the center of the kingdom. Suchandra is said to have died only two years after receiving the teachings. The six kings who followed him were known as \"dharmarajas\" or \"truth kings,\" and each is said to have reigned for over 100 years. The twenty-five rulers that follow them are known as Kalki kings.\n\nFrom the website www.kalachakra.org (by Kalachakra scholar Edward Smith):\n\n″The following is taken from \"dpal dus kyi 'khor lo'i chos bskor gyi byung khungs nyer mkho\", by Tāranātha:\n\nOn the full moon of the month Caitra in the year following his enlightenment, at the great stupa of Dhānyakaṭaka (dpal ldan 'bras dpung kyi mchod rten), the Buddha emanated the mandala of \"The Glorious Lunar Mansions\". In front of an audience of countless Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, vīras, ḍākinīs, the twelve great gods, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, spirits and fortunate people gathered from the 960 million villages north of the river Śītā, was requested by the emanation of Vajrapani, the king Sucandra (zla ba bzang po), to teach the tantra. \n\nHe taught not just this tantra, but all tantras. Countless men and non-humans achieved the realisations of their desires. Some teachings were taken to other human realms, and the Dharma king Sucandra wrote the Tantras in textual form in his land of Sambhala. He composed the explanatory Tantra in 60,000 verses to the Mūlatantra of 12,000. (Both of these are now lost.)\n\nHe had divine workers construct from jewels a maṇḍala palace of Kālacakra, 400 cubits across. He taught the mantrayāna to many humans and many of them achieved the highest realisation. In the second year after the teaching of the Mūlatantra, having installed as regent his son, the emanation of Kṣitigarbha, Sureshvara (lha'i dbang po), he passed on.\n\nAfter him came other emanations of tenth level Bodhisattvas: Sureśvara (lha dbang), Tejī (gzi brjid can), Somadatta (zla bas byin), Sureśvara (lha'i dbang phyug), Viśvamūrti (sna tshogs gzugs) and Sureśāna (lha'i dbang ldan). They also spread the teachings as did Sucandra.″\n\n"}

It is a common Islamic Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims; in formal prayer, in the call for prayer (adhān), as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress, or to express resolute determination or defiance.\n\nThe form ' is the nominative of \"Allah\", meaning \"God\". In the context of Islam, it is the proper name of the Abrahamic god. The form ' is the elative of the adjective ', meaning \"great\", from the Semitic root '. As used in the it is usually translated as \"greatest\", but some authors prefer \"greater\". The phrase is often transliterated less accurately as \"Allah akbar\". The term ' itself is the stem II verbal noun (') of the triliteral root \"\", meaning \"great\", from which \"akbar\" \"greater\" is derived.\n\nThe phrase is well known for its common use in Islamist protests, and as a battle cry in Islamic extremism and Islamic terrorism.\n\nThis phrase is recited by Muslims in many different situations. For example, when they are very happy, to express approval, to prevent a Muslim from becoming prideful by reminding them that Allah is their source of success, or as a battle cry, during times of extreme stress. The phrase is not found in the Quran, which does not refer to God as \"akbar\", but uses the name \"al-Kabīr\" \"The Great\" or \"Kabīr\" \"Great\", commonly translated as \"Most Great\" (13:9, 31:30, 22:62, 34:23, 40:12, 4:34).\n\nThe phrase is said during each stage of both salah (obligatory prayers, performed five times a day), and nafl (supererogatory prayers performed at will). The Muslim call to prayer (\"adhan\") by the \"muezzin\" and to commence prayer (\"iqama\") also contains the phrase.\n\nThe phrase is sometimes used during distress.\n\nJust before Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed into the jungle near Medan, Indonesia, the pilot screamed \"Aaaaaaah! \"Allāhu akbar\" into his radio. According to a radio communication transcript, the pilot's conversation with the air controller had been in English, but his last words were the takbir as the plane crashed on September 26, 1997, killing all 234 people aboard in Indonesia's deadliest crash. It was suspected that the crash may have been due to either disorientation or turbine engine failure caused by local dense smog resulting from forest fires.\n\nWhen Reshma Begum was discovered alive 17 days after the 2013 Savar building collapse in Bangladesh which killed 1129 people, crowds jubilantly cried \"Allāhu akbar\"\" to express their joy and gratitude that she had survived.\n\nAs a multi-purpose phrase, it is sometimes used by Arab football commentators as an expression of amazement.\n\nThe phrase is used after the birth of a child as a means of praising God.\n\nIn the hadith, Muhammad is reported to have spoken the Takbīr after a funeral.\n\nDuring the festival of Eid al-Adha and the days preceding it, Muslims recite the Takbīr. This is particularly the case on the Day of Arafah.\n\nIt has been used historically as a battle cry during war.\n\nDuring the Iranian Revolution of 1979, it was shouted from rooftops in Iran during the evenings as a form of protest. This practice returned in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, which protested the election results. Many people shouted it from 22:00–22:30 every night after the 2009 Iranian election to protest the result.\n\nIn videos released during the course of the Syrian Civil War, Free Syrian Army, Al-Nusra Front, other rebel and Islamist groups and ISIL forces are heard shouting \"Takbir\" and \"Allāhu akbar\" in the background while fighting. Even more \"secular\" groups such as the Free Syrian Army - Operation Southern Storm have been heard yelling the phrase before the firing of heavy weapons.\n\nDuring the Iraqi insurgency (2011–13), Islamist fighters were seen and heard shouting \"\"takbīr\" and \"Allāhu akbar\"\".\n\nJihadist and the Islamic extremist videos have also shown its fighters making \"takbīr\" with the index finger up.\n\nThe phrase is well known among Western non-Muslims for its common use as a battle cry in Islamist extremism and Islamist terrorism.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, the FBI released a letter reportedly handwritten by the hijackers and found in three separate locations on the day of the attacks—at Dulles International Airport, at the Pennsylvania crash site, and in hijacker Mohamed Atta's suitcase. It included a checklist of final reminders for the 9/11 hijackers. An excerpt reads: \"When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, 'Allāhu akbar,' because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers.\" Also, in the cockpit voice recorders found at the crash site of Flight 93, the hijackers are heard reciting the Takbīr repeatedly as the plane plummets toward the ground and the passengers attempt to retake control of the plane.\n\nWhen in March 2002 Maryam Mohammad Yousif Farhat of Hamas, popularized as \"Umm Nidal\" (and subsequently elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council), learned that her 17-year-old son had died during a suicide attack in which he killed five teenagers, she celebrated by proclaiming \"Allāhu akbar\" and giving out boxes of halva and chocolates. Imam Samudra, who was sentenced to death for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, chanted the phrase upon hearing his sentence.\n\nIn the video of Nick Berg being beheaded in Iraq in 2004, the perpetrators can be heard shouting \"Allāhu akbar\". And in the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, a group of radical Islamists who were convicted of plotting an attack on the Fort Dix military base in New Jersey had videotaped themselves shooting weapons and shouting \"Allāhu akbar\". In 2008, Aafia Siddiqui is alleged to have fired at US interrogators while yelling \"Allāhu akbar\".\n\nDuring the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, witnesses reported that gunman Nidal Malik Hasan shouted \"Allāhu akbar\" before opening fire, killing 13 people and wounding 30 others. Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad smiled and said \"Allāhu akbar\" after receiving a life sentence in 2010 for his attempted bombing.\n\nDuring the incident aboard American Airlines Flight 1561 in 2011, the person attempting to bash his way into the cockpit was heard shouting \"Allāhu akbar\". Mohammed Merah recorded himself shouting \"Allahu akbar\" as he killed three French paratroopers in the 2012 Midi-Pyrénées shootings. In the 2014 Jerusalem synagogue attack witnesses reported that the perpetrators screamed \"Allāhu akbar\" as they axed and shot at the worshippers. The killers in the January 2015 \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in Paris shouted \"Allāhu akbar\" during their attack. During the November 2015 Paris attacks, witnesses reported hearing gunmen shouting \"Allāhu akbar\" before opening fire in the Bataclan theatre, killing 89 people.\n\nWhen Russian ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov was assassinated on 19 December 2016 at Ankara, the capital of Turkey, after shooting the ambassador the shooter shouted \"Allāhu akbar\" and \"Do not forget Aleppo\", referring to Russia helping the Syrian government conquer the eastern part of the city of Aleppo only a few days prior to the assassination.\n\nFollowing the 2017 Barcelona attacks, the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, has said that anyone shouting \"Allāhu akbar\" in St Mark's Square will be shot by snipers within a few paces.\n\nThe phrase \"Allāhu akbar\" is written on the center of the flag of Iraq, 22 times along the borders of the central white stripe on the flag of Iran, and beneath the shahada in the flag of Afghanistan in white script on the central red background as determined by the 2004 draft constitution.\n\nDuring the Gulf War in January 1991, Saddam Hussein held a meeting with top military commanders, where it was decided to add the words \"Allāhu akbar\" (described as the Islamic battle cry) to Iraq's flag to boost his secular regime's religious credentials, casting himself as the leader of an Islamic army. Hussein described the flag as \"the banner of jihad and monotheism\".\n\nIn 2004, the US-picked Iraqi Governing Council approved a new flag for Iraq that abandoned symbols of Hussein's regime, such as the words \"Allāhu akbar\". In January 2008, however, Iraq's parliament passed a law to change the flag by leaving in the phrase, but changing the calligraphy of the words \"Allāhu akbar\", which had been a copy of Hussein's handwriting, to a Kufic script. The Iraqi flag under Hussein had each of the two words of the phrase written in one of the spaces between the stars on the central band; the 2008 flag, while leaving the phrase in, removes the stars.\n\nThe phrase \"Allāhu akbar\" is written on the flag of Iran, as called for by Article 18 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The phrase appears 22 times on the flag.\n\nThe Afghan constitution that came into force on January 4, 2004, required that \"Allāhu akbar\" be inscribed on Afghanistan's national flag.\n\nA resistance movement that fought British rule in Waziristan, Pakistan, in the 1930s used a red flag bearing \"Allāhu akbar\" in white letters.\n\nOne of the variants of the flag of Pashtunistan features the takbir.\n\n\n\n"}

The archaeological survey of the site shows that it had no buildings.\n\nThe Tarentum gave its name to the \"ludi tarentini\" (\"Tarentine Games\"), the archaic \"ludi\" that became the Secular Games; the name is perhaps less likely to have come from the place Tarentum in Apulia. The location of the Tarentum is indicated primarily by the discovery in 1930 of the inscribed record of the Saecular Games \"(acta)\" held in 17 BC, which traditionally took place there. It was the precinct within which the underground Altar of Dis and Proserpina was located.\n\nThe Tarentine Games were presented most notably in 249 BC, as a \"crisis ritual\" during the First Punic War, in accordance with the Sibylline Books. The \"ludi\" took the form of three-night rites and horse races to honor Dis and Proserpina, the divine couple who had an underground altar at the site. In a common version of the myth, Proserpina (Greek Persephone) was abducted by the ruler of the underworld and driven underground in his chariot to become his bride and queen. Some scholars think that the Roman \"Dis pater\" (\"Rich Father\") is a Latin translation of the Greek \"Plouton\" (Pluto) and that his cult was established among the Romans with the celebration of the games in 249 BC. Varro regarded the nocturnal theatrical performances that took place during the games as a seminal event in the history of Roman drama.\n\nHendrik Wagenvoort argued that these ceremonies had originated with the cult of Maris, an Etruscan \"daimon\" of death later identified with Mars in a chthonic form, along with Ferona as the consort of Maris. According to Calvert Watkins, the word \"tarentum\" in reference to the Roman site most likely means \"tomb\" or \"sepulcher,\" or more fundamentally, \"a place for crossing,\" that is, a liminal place.\n"}

Scholars Bakó and Hubbes (2011) have defined Zalmoxianism, like the other ethnic religious revivals of Europe, as a reconstructionist ethno-paganism.\n\nThe reconstruction of ancient Dacian and Thracian religion and mythology has been strictly connected with the field of dacology. Amongst contemporary supporters of Zalmoxianism, the emigrant dacologist Octavian Sărbătoare even proposed to make it the official religion of Romania.\n\nThe \"Gebeleizis Association\" (Romanian: \"Societatea Gebeleizis\"), though far from being the only Zalmoxian group in Romania, has been the most studied formation. It has 500 members split into 15 branches. The core values of the organisation are expressed by its motto \"One Family, One Nation, One Territory\" (Romanian: \"O Familie, Un Neam, Un Teritoriu\"); for the ideas promoted, the Gebeleizis Association has been subject of media scandal, and accused of extremism. \"Gebeleizis\" was the same as Zalmoxis among the Thracians.\n\nAnother group is the \"Zamolxe\", based in Bucharest, whose high priest is Alexandru Mihail.
