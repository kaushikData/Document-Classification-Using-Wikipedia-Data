Jenkins was an American diplomat, lecturer and author, born September 14, 1916 in Manchester, Georgia. He was a political authority on Chinese-American relations and served under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. Jenkins has been called \"Mr. China\" and participated in Sino-American relations for more than twenty years.\n\nJenkins graduated from Emory University in 1938 and Duke University with an M.Ed. in 1976. He was also a student at the University of Chicago's National War College and attended the National College of Chiropractic in 1986.\n\nHe served in the American Foreign Service from 1946 to 1974 before becoming a freelance writer. Jenkins served in China from 1946 to 1955. He was a member of the U.S. National Security Council from 1966 to 1969. Jenkins was the senior inspector of the U.S. State Department Foreign Service and a member of the National Security Council senior staff of President Lyndon B. Johnson. He often submitted memos directly to the President and was, at times, critical of current American policy towards China which was focused on trade, travel and U.N. representation rather than its possible involvement in the Asia–Pacific region (including Vietnam).\n\nUnder the Nixon administration he was the director of the State Department's Office of Asian Communist Affairs. In 1970 he traveled to Paris to exchange information with the French and British concerning affairs with China. He traveled with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on an unpublicized diplomatic mission to China in October 1971. Jenkins advised Kissinger and President Nixon on all Chinese diplomatic relations and was instrumental in planning the U.S.’s Chinese missions. His insights into Chinese-American relations gave him a key role in Nixon’s historical diplomatic mission and visit to China in February 1972. Jenkins was considered Kissinger's \"right-hand man\" and had final responsibility for drafting the secret \"Talking Papers\", which served as a guide for U.S. negotiations with China.\n\nIn 1972 Jenkins was a speaker at a symposium held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and hosted by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He was given the Superior Service Award by the U.S. State Department in 1973. Jenkins was the chief liaison officer in Peking, China, from 1973 to 1974 before becoming a professional lecturer and writer. In 1975 he appeared on the NBC TV show \"Tomorrow\" and channel KSCI in Los Angeles, California, to discuss Transcendental Meditation. He served as chairman of the board of trustees of Maharishi International University for three years.\n\nAfter retiring from the Foreign Service, due to the influence of Joseph Janse, D.C., N.D., a well-known and revered figure in natural medicine and longtime President of National College of Chiropractic (now National University of Health Sciences) in Lombard, IL, in 1981 Jenkins began his studies toward a Doctorate of Chiropractic and graduated shortly before his 70th birthday. He practiced natural medicine as a primary care physician in Gleneden Beach, Oregon for a number of years, but retired when his wife Martha died. Jenkins returned to Alexandria, VA where he lived out his final years.\n\nIn 1993 Jenkins published an autobiography called \"Country, Conscience and Caviar: A Diplomat's Journey in the Company of History\".\n\n"}
{"id": "143433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143433", "title": "Angel (1999 TV series)", "text": "Angel (1999 TV series)\n\nAngel is an American television series, a spin-off from the television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". The series was created by \"Buffy\"s creator, Joss Whedon, in collaboration with David Greenwalt. It aired on The WB from October 5, 1999, to May 19, 2004, consisting of five seasons and 110 episodes. Like \"Buffy\", it was produced by Whedon's production company, Mutant Enemy.\n\nThe show details the ongoing trials of Angel, a vampire whose human soul was restored to him by gypsies as a punishment for the murder of one of their own. After more than a century of murder and the torture of innocents, Angel's restored soul torments him with guilt and remorse. Angel moves to Los Angeles, California, after it's clear that his doomed relationship with Buffy, the vampire slayer, cannot continue. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a private detective in L.A, where he and a variety of associates work to \"help the helpless\", restoring the faith and saving the souls of those who have lost their way. Typically, this involves doing battle with evil demons or humans allied to them, primarily related to Wolfram & Hart, a law firm supported by occult practices which is an extension of otherworldly demonic forces, which Angel takes over in the final season. He must also battle his own demonic nature.\n\nThe series focuses around Angel (David Boreanaz), an Irish vampire who is over 200 years old. Angel was known as Angelus during his rampages across Europe, but was cursed with a soul, which gave him a conscience and guilt for centuries of murder and torture. He left \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" at the end of Season 3 to move to Los Angeles in search of redemption.\n\nHe soon finds himself assisted by Allen Francis Doyle (Glenn Quinn), another Irish character who is a half-human, half-demon who, although he comes across as a ne'er-do-well hustler, has a heroic side. Doyle serves to pass along the cryptic visions from The Powers That Be to Angel. They're soon joined by Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), also a previous cast member of \"Buffy\". Formerly a popular high school cheerleader, Cordelia starts her tenure on the show as a vapid and shallow personality, but grows over the course of the series into a hero. Cordelia acquires Doyle's visions via a shared kiss prior to Doyle's death. With the death of Doyle in the early episodes of the show's first season, another character from the \"Buffy\" series makes the jump to its spin-off: Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) joins the team under the brave guise of \"rogue demon hunter\", acting as comic relief and initially not well-accepted. Over time, Wesley shows bravery and strength, as well as some cold blooded killing cruelty, like his colleague Rupert Giles, and grows into a leader.\n\nIn Season 2 of the show, the trio are joined by Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), a young demon hunter who must initially adjust to working with and for a vampire. At the end of Season 2, they travel to the demon world Pylea, where they save Winifred \"Fred\" Burkle (Amy Acker), a young Texan physicist whose social skills have become stunted after five years' captivity; she later grows to become more outspoken. Season 3 saw the introduction of Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), the \"miracle\" human child of two vampires, Angel and Darla. Abducted into a Hell dimension as a baby, he is raised by Angel's enemy Daniel Holtz, and only a few weeks after he left comes back as a teenager and reluctantly comes to accept his lineage. Although introduced during Season 2, Lorne (Andy Hallett) joins the team during Season 4. An outgoing, pacifistic demon, Lorne's role is predominantly to support the team.\n\nSeason 5, the show's final season, introduces several new cast members, chief amongst them Spike (James Marsters), an old vampire ally/foe of Angel's who also starred in \"Buffy\". In this series, Spike reluctantly fights beside Angel as their rivalry continues – now tinged with Spike existing as another vampire with a soul, and by the romantic feelings that both of them have for Buffy Summers. One of the legendary Old Ones, Illyria (Amy Acker) starts off as an adversary of the team after taking over Fred's body, but comes to join the team as she must learn to cope with the changed world and the new emotions she feels as a result of taking over a human. Finally, there's Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), another \"Buffy\" alumna and former friend of Cordelia who was turned into a vampire. Resembling the old personality of Cordelia, Harmony is grudgingly accepted by Angel as his secretary when he takes over the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram & Hart.\n\nMany characters on \"Angel\" made recurring appearances. The two longest-running recurring characters are Lilah Morgan (Seasons 1–4) and Lindsey McDonald (Seasons 1, 2 and 5), appearing in 36 and 21 episodes, respectively; Lindsey is the only character besides Angel to appear in both the first and last episode of the series. Angel's sire Darla (Julie Benz), first seen in \"Buffy\", plays in an expanded role on \"Angel\" and appears in 20 episodes over the course of the series. Elisabeth Röhm appears in 15 episodes (Seasons 1–2) as LAPD Detective Kate Lockley, a woman with an often-strained relationship with Angel.\n\nThroughout the series, there were also guest appearances from \"Buffy\" characters, including main cast members Buffy Summers, Willow Rosenberg and Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne. The rogue slayer Faith played an important part in episodes of Seasons 1, 2, and 4; Anne Steele and Andrew Wells also originated on \"Buffy\" and appeared in two or more \"Angel\" episodes. Whedon also used two actors from his cancelled television series \"Firefly\", Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin, to play Jasmine and Marcus Hamilton, respectively.\n\nMuch of \"Angel\" was shot on location in Los Angeles, California. The show is set in the city of Los Angeles. \"Los Angeles\" are the first words spoken in the premiere episode, and the cityscape is the first image seen in the opening credits. Joss Whedon said, \"It is set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told.\" Producer Marti Noxon has expanded on this explanation: \"Los Angeles was the place that Joss Whedon picked for very specific reasons. There's a lot of preconceptions about what the place is, but there are a lot of truths. It's a pretty competitive, intense town, where a lot of lonely, isolated, and desperate people end up. It's a good place for monsters.\" Many episodes feature references to the city, and the opening episode of the second season features Lorne offering this observation of the city:\n\nIn the essay, \"Los Angeles: The City of Angel\" (from the essay collection, \"\"), Benjamin Jacob explores why Los Angeles in particular should be important to the series. Jacob suggests several explanations: first, the name connection ('City of Angels'); second, the double-sided nature, the \"other side of the stereotypical sunshine city, Beach Boys and Walt Disney\", \"the place of pain, anonymity, alienation and broken dreams\".; third, American noir was originally a \"Los Angelian genre\". \"Angel\" was originally conceived as supernatural noir. Noir had continued investigation of the \"dark city, a place of regression and darkness as a counterpoint to the city's promise of progress and civilization\" that had begun under William Blake and Charles Dickens.\n\nDuring Season One, Angel Investigations is based in Angel's apartment. Actor Alexis Denisof, who played Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, said: \"Angel had this dark, foreboding, underground cellar apartment with columns, with this antique furniture all around, and this pokey little office upstairs\" These offices were blown up at the climax of the first season, and Angel Investigations found a new base in the episode \"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been\".\n\nProduction designer Stuart Blatt outlined the new base: \"An old hotel, something [the writers] could use to evoke the past of Los Angeles and some of Angel's history, something kind of creepy and spooky but not too dark because they didn't want something depressing, it's called the Hyperion Hotel. It's based on many hotels in Los Angeles... Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and get away from it all, do a little pondering, a little brooding, and a little research. Every once in a while, someone will come up to have a little conversation.\" In the final season, the team moves to the evil law firm, Wolfram & Hart.\n\nMuch like \"Buffy\", \"Angel\" is told in a serialized format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger storyline. Unlike \"Buffy\", however, the season-long narratives are not marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful antagonist, commonly referred to as the \"Big Bad\" in the parent series. Instead, the overarching story of all five seasons of the series pitted Angel as the central player in a battle between the \"good\" Powers That Be and the \"evil\" law firm Wolfram & Hart and his possible role in a prophesied apocalypse. It mixes the complex, series-long storyline along with more stand-alone, villain-of-the-week episodes. The show blends different genres, including horror, fantasy, supernatural, and a combination of comedic and dramatic content.\n\nThe first season is mainly told in a \"monster of the week\" format, with each episode creating a self-contained story that took place around the title character. Later seasons became more serialized, where the majority of episodes contribute to a larger story arc that unfolded over many episodes. The most extreme example of this is season four, in which almost every episode contributed to the main storyline, and often picked up exactly where the previous episode ended.\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Angel and his colleagues, collectively making up the detective agency Angel Investigations, who fight against supernatural evils and work to \"Help the helpless\". A typical episode contains one or more villains, or supernatural phenomena that is thwarted or defeated, and one or more people in need of help, a few of them Angel and associates not being able to (including some main characters) since from episode one. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses centrally on Angel and his road to redemption.\n\nThe most prominent monsters in the \"Angel\" bestiary are vampires, which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. Angel and his companions fight a wide variety of demons, as well as ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and ethically unsound humans. They sometimes even save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, magic, and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. Visions from higher powers guide the group, and are received by Doyle and later Cordelia. Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Angel and later Gunn, though every member of Angel Investigations is combat ready to some degree. Lorne is able to read peoples' destinies and intentions. Fred uses her scientific knowledge to contribute, whilst Wesley contributes his extensive knowledge of demonology and supernatural lore.\n\nAt the start of the series, Angel has just moved to Los Angeles. He is soon visited by Doyle, a messenger sent to him on behalf of The Powers That Be. Doyle receives visions that can guide Angel on his mission as a champion of humankind. Angel also encounters Cordelia Chase, who is trying to launch an acting career. The three group together to form Angel Investigations, a detective agency that hopes to \"help the helpless.\" When Doyle dies in the episode \"Hero\", he passes on his 'visions' to Cordelia with a kiss. Shortly thereafter, the ex-Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, joins the group. Meanwhile, the evil law firm Wolfram & Hart pay increasing attention to Angel. They tempt him toward darkness when they resurrect Darla, Angel's ex-lover and sire — killed by Angel in the first season of \"Buffy\" in the episode \"Angel\".\n\nCharles Gunn, who was introduced toward the end of the first season in the episode \"War Zone\", is a street-tough leader of a gang of vampire hunters. He is initially determined to kill Angel, but slowly comes to accept him and join his cause throughout season two. Wolfram & Hart's star lawyer Lindsey McDonald primes Darla as its weapon to bring down Angel. However, Darla is brought back as a human, not a vampire. But as a human, she suffers from a terminal case of syphilis — which she had contracted in her original life before being sired. Lindsey brings in Drusilla, a vampire originally sired by Angelus, to restore Darla to the cause of evil. Enraged by this, Angel begins to grow darker. He cuts himself off from his staff (secretly to keep them away from this kind of dark territory for their own sake) and attempts to go after the pair himself. In despair, Angel sleeps with Darla (cf. \"Reprise\"), but the next morning, he has an epiphany; seeing the error of his ways, he banishes Darla and reunites with his group. When Cordelia vanishes, Lorne, the flamboyant demon owner of karoake bar Caritas, reluctantly takes Angel and his crew to his home dimension, Pylea, to rescue her. They return with Winifred \"Fred\" Burkle, a former physics student who has been trapped in the dimension for five long years.\n\nTo get over news of the death of his ex-girlfriend, Buffy, Angel spends three months in a monastery, where he encounters some demon monks and goes home frustrated in season three. He returns to Los Angeles, as does Darla — now bearing his child. Daniel Holtz, an old enemy of both Angel and Darla, is resurrected by a demon to take revenge on the vampires that killed his family. The group is puzzled over what might be the first vampire birth. Darla sacrifices her life to save the life of her child, Connor. The gang is eager to care for the infant, but Wesley soon learns of a (false) frightening prophecy that suggests that Angel will murder his son. Feeling disconnected from the group, Wesley does not share this information, and quietly kidnaps Connor. This backfires as he is attacked and the child is seized by Holtz and his protégée Justine. Wanting Angel to suffer the loss of a child as he did, Holtz escapes through a rip in the fabric of space to the dimension of Quor'Toth, and raises the boy as his own. Angel feels that his son is lost forever, and tries to murder Wesley. Though he survives, Wesley is banished from the group. Weeks later, Connor returns, but because time moves faster in Quor'Toth, he is now a teenage boy, having been raised by Holtz. Tricking Angel into believing he needs to be the one to take Connor in, Holtz gives Angel a letter letting Connor know that he will be leaving and to trust Angel. Holtz gets Justine to kill him, but ends up making it look like a vampire attack so Connor will assume the worst. Connor imprisons his birth father, Angel, in a casket and drops it to the bottom of the ocean. Cordelia's visions have been progressively getting worse, and she becomes part demon to make them easier on herself. Her old lover, the Groosalugg, comes back from Pylea to be with her, but leaves her when he discovers that she instead loves Angel.\n\nDespite his exile from his old friends, Wesley locates and frees Angel at the beginning of season four. A hellish Beast emerges and blocks out the sun over L.A. He then proceeds to kill the staff at Wolfram & Hart. Although the city survives, the sunlight seems to be blotted out permanently. The team resorts to releasing Angel's soul, believing Angelus knows helpful information about the beast. Although the team takes safety precautions, Angelus is released from his cell by Cordelia, who is at the time under the influence of the soon to be born Jasmine. Luckily they manage to restore Angel's soul, thanks to help from Faith and Willow. Their efforts, however, do not prevent the coming of Jasmine, who was indirectly responsible for the work of the Beast. Jasmine, it turns out, was formerly one of the Powers That Be and plans to solve all the world's problems by giving humanity total happiness through spiritual enslavement to her. She arrives in our world through manipulation of Cordelia and Connor, using them as a conduit into our world, eventually forcing Cordelia to fall into a coma. Fred is accidentally inoculated against Jasmine's spell by contact with her blood and frees the rest of the gang though they remain hopelessly outnumbered by thousands already entranced by Jasmine. Angel travels through a magic portal into a world previously visited by Jasmine to find a way of breaking her power over L.A.'s populace. By revealing her true name, they are able to break Jasmine's spell over everyone. Jasmine confronts Angel, but is then killed by Connor. Connor is revealed never to have been under Jasmine's influence, but he went along for the sake of having a semblance of family and happiness. In the season finale, they are met by Lilah Morgan, the resurrected Head of Wolfram & Hart's Special Project Division, who congratulates them on preventing world peace, and says that as a token of their appreciation, Wolfram & Hart would like to give them the Los Angeles branch. To help save Cordelia and Connor, who has gone mad with confusion over losing everything, Angel reluctantly agrees.\n\nIn season five, the gang begins to settle into their new lives at Wolfram & Hart. Gunn undergoes a special cognitive procedure that transforms him into a brilliant lawyer. The group receives an amulet that resurrects a past companion of Angelus, the en-souled vampire Spike, initially as a ghost-like presence but later regains corporeal status due to the machinations of Lindsey McDonald in a surprise return. Cordelia, who has been in a coma, has \"The Powers That Be\" grant her one last request, in which she helps Angel get \"back on track\", then dies. Angel is briefly reunited with his son Connor, now in a new identity thanks to the agreement between Angel and Wolfram & Hart at the end of Season Four. Connor regains the memories of his former identity, but doesn't acknowledge this to protect his new parents (though he later reveals to Angel that he does in fact remember his previous life). Fred finally declares her affections to Wesley, but shortly after is possessed by an ancient and powerful demon called Illyria. Wesley is devastated by the loss of Fred, but agrees to help Illyria adjust to her new form and the unfamiliar world she's in. Angel, after getting one last vision from Cordelia before her death, infiltrates the Circle of the Black Thorn, a secret society responsible for engineering the Apocalypse, and plans to take them all out in a simultaneous, hard-hitting strike. Because this is probably a suicide mission, he tells each of his friends to spend the day as if it were their last. That night, the team launches its attack on the Circle, dividing up their targets. When Wesley is fatally stabbed, Illyria, concerned for his safety, arrives at his side after killing her targets, but is unable to save him. Illyria asks Wesley if he'd like her to assume the form of Fred, and Wesley agrees, allowing him to say goodbye to the woman he loved. Lorne leaves and disappears into the night, his innocence destroyed, after fulfilling Angel's last order to kill Lindsey, the former Wolfram & Hart lawyer who had turned his back on the firm. Angel confronts Senior Partners' new liaison Marcus Hamilton, and defeats him with help from Connor.\n\nOnce the Circle has been dismantled, Angel and the surviving members of his gang rendezvous in the alley behind the Hyperion Hotel. Illyria arrives with news of Wesley's death and feels the need to lash out her anger/grief. Spike too arrives, triumphant about his successful mission and hungry for further violent fighting. Gunn emerges, staggering from a serious stomach wound, but ready to fight. The survivors wait as the Senior Partners' army of warriors, giants, and a dragon approaches. Angel and his crew prepare for the upcoming battle, with Angel saying, \"Personally, I kind of want to slay the dragon\". The series then ends with Angel saying, \"Let's go to work\", after which he and his team attack the army of monsters head on.\n\nCo-producer Greenwalt points out, \"There's no denying that \"Angel\" grew out of \"Buffy\".\" Several years before \"Angel\" debuted, Joss Whedon developed the concept behind \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\" The character Angel was first seen in the first episode and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by \"Buffy\", the 'Buffyverse', Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually set out on a path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In \"Buffy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that \"Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero.\" Whedon has compared the series to its parent, \"It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a little bit more of a guys' show.\"\n\nWhile the central concept behind \"Buffy\" was \"high school as a horror movie\" in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make \"Angel\" into a different \"gritty, urban show.\" Whedon explained, \"We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different.\"\nWhedon and Greenwalt prepared a six-minute promotional video pitch, often called the \"Unaired \"Angel\" pilot\" for the WB Network. Some shots from this short were later used in the opening credits.\n\nEarly during the life of the series, some effort was made to slightly soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, \"City of,\" in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, \"Corrupt\", was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explained, \"The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This is way too dark.' We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days.\" Instead, the tone was lightened and the opening episodes established Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation.\n\nA first draft script reveals that \"Angel\" was originally intended to include the character Whistler, played by Max Perlich, who had already been featured in two \"Buffy\" episodes, \"Becoming, Part One\" and \"Part Two\". In an interview, Perlich said, \"I never got called again. If they had called, I would have probably accepted because it was a great experience and I think Joss is very original and talented.\" Instead, the producers created a Whistler-like character, Doyle. Cordelia Chase, also from the original Sunnydale crew, joined Angel and Doyle.\n\nJoss Whedon is credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series. Alongside \"Angel\", he was also working on a series of other projects such as \"Buffy\", \"Fray\", \"Astonishing X-Men\" and \"Firefly\", which would later also lead to the film \"Serenity\".\n\nFor the first three seasons, David Greenwalt, who co-created the series with Whedon, was also credited as executive producer; during this time, he also took on the role of show runner. He left to oversee \"Miracles\", but continued to work on \"Angel\" as a consulting producer for the final two seasons. Tim Minear also served as an executive producer during the second season, contributing heavily to the season's story arc. At the start of the fourth season, David Simkins was made show runner and executive producer, but after three months, he left the show due to \"creative differences\" and is not credited in any episodes. Established \"Angel\" writer Jeffrey Bell took over for the balance of season 4 and became executive producer for season 5. After \"Buffy\" concluded, writer David Fury joined the staff as executive producer for the final season.\n\nFran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, Kaz Kuzui, were also credited as executive producers throughout \"Angel\", but were not involved in any writing or production for the show. Jeffrey Bell mentions in his DVD commentary during the closing credits of the \"Angel\" series finale \"Not Fade Away\" that two people were credited and paid for \"Angel\" without needing to ever step on the set. \"Angel\" crew member Dan Kerns also revealed in an essay that two executive producers \"received credit and sizeable checks for the duration of \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\" for doing absolutely nothing\". Their credit, rights and royalties for the whole \"Buffy\" franchise, which includes spin-off \"Angel\", relate to their funding, producing and directing of the original movie version of \"Buffy\".\n\nScript-writing was done by Mutant Enemy, a production company created by Joss Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits for the series include: Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, Jeffrey Bell, David Fury, Steven S. DeKnight, Mere Smith, and Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain. Other authors with writing credits include: Shawn Ryan, Ben Edlund, Drew Goddard, Jeannine Renshaw, Howard Gordon, Jim Kouf, Jane Espenson, Doug Petrie, Tracey Stern, David H. Goodman, Scott Murphy, Marti Noxon and Brent Fletcher.\n\nJane Espenson has explained how scripts came together for Mutant Enemy Productions series \"Buffy\", \"Angel\" and \"Firefly\": a meeting was held and an idea was floated (generally by Whedon) and the writers brainstormed to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the staff meet in the anteroom to Whedon's office to begin \"breaking\" the story into acts and scenes; the only one absent would be the writer working on the previous week's episode.\n\nNext, the writers developed the scenes onto a marker-filled whiteboard, featuring a \"brief ordered description of each scene.\" A writer was then selected to create an outline of the episode's concept– occasionally with some dialogue and jokes– in one day. The outline was then given to the show runner, who revised it within a day. The writer used the revised outline to write the first draft of the script while the other writers worked on developing the next. This first draft was usually submitted for revision within 3–14 days; afterward, a second (and sometimes third) draft was written. After all revisions were made, the final draft would be produced as the \"shooting draft\".\n\n\"Angel\" features a mix of original, indie, rock and pop music.\n\nThe opening theme was composed by Holly Knight and Darling Violetta, an alternative rock group that performed two songs during the third season of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". Holly Knight was the music producer of the track. The next year, \"Angel\" invited bands to submit demos for the theme music to the show. They asked bands to use \"dark superhero ideas\" and \"Cello-rock\". Darling Violetta watched pivotal Angel-related episodes of \"Buffy\" such as \"Passion\", \"Becoming, Parts One and Two\" for inspiration. Eventually, Whedon accepted Darling Violetta's interpretation of an \"Angel\" theme as that most suitable to the show. The theme has a slower tempo than the \"Buffy\" theme, as well as heavier use of acoustic instruments such as cello. In 2005, the band composed an extended version of the \"Angel\" theme called \"The Sanctuary Extended Remix\", which featured on the soundtrack of the series \"\".\n\nThe demon karaoke bar, Caritas, is frequently used to spotlight pop hits. There has also been a soundtrack album, \"Angel: Live Fast, Die Never\". The soundtrack mostly consists of scores created for the show by Robert J. Kral along with a remixed theme and four other songs from the show. Douglas Romayne scored 33 episodes of \"Angel\" in seasons 4 and 5, along with series lead composer, Rob Kral.\n\nOn February 14, 2004, the WB Network announced that \"Angel\" would not be brought back for a sixth season. The one-paragraph statement indicated that the news, which had been reported by an Internet site the previous day, had been leaked well before the network intended to make its announcement. Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site, The Bronze: Beta, in which he expressed his dismay and surprise, saying he was \"heartbroken\" and described the situation as \"Healthy Guy Falls Dead From a Heart Attack.\" Fan reaction was to organize letter-writing campaigns, online petitions, blood and food drives, advertisements in trade magazines and via mobile billboards, and attempts to lobby other networks (UPN was a favorite target, as it had already picked up \"Buffy\"). Outrage for the cancellation focused on Jordan Levin, WB's Head of Entertainment. It was the second highest-rated program to be canceled on the WB.\n\nHead writer David Fury \"guaranteed\" that if Joss Whedon had not requested an early renewal, \"Angel\" would have been back for a Season 6:\n\nThe only reason that \"Angel\" didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our critical attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who was the head of The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [would] wait so long to give \"Angel\" a pick-up [and] a lot of us [would] turn down jobs hoping that \"Angel\" will continue– he [Joss] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [Joss] just asked Jordan, \"Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not,\" and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, \"Okay, we're cancelling you.\" Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel \"Angel\". There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [the WB] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [Levin] made the decision to cancel us.\n\nI guarantee that, if we waited as we normally did, by the time May had come around they would have picked up \"Angel\". I can guarantee that.\n\"Angel\"'s final episode, \"Not Fade Away\", aired on the WB on May 19, 2004. The ambiguous final moments left some fans hoping for the continuation of \"Angel\" and the Buffyverse in the future, hopes that came to fruition in November 2007 with the publication of the first issue of the comic book series \"\". The series is Joss Whedon's official continuation of the \"Angel\" television series and follows in the footsteps of the comic book \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\", whose first issue was published in March 2007.\n\nWhile \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" was built around the angst of adolescence, \"Angel\" chronicles the different stages of adulthood after one leaves home and begins working. Cordelia Chase, who had been the most popular and superficial girl in Sunnydale High on \"Buffy\", develops over the course of the series from an insecure young woman struggling in a daunting real world into an unexpectedly mature woman. Similarly, Wesley, the once uptight and bookish Watcher, becomes a man of quiet confidence and often ruthless action.\n\nIn much the same way as \"Buffy\" had been both a homage and parody of traditional horror films, \"Angel\" gave the same treatment to the classical \"film noir\". Producer Kelly Manners said \"\"Angel\" is a dark show about a man looking for redemption... We have an alcoholic metaphor with \"Angel\". Angel is a guy who is one drink away from going back to his evil roots\" He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives. The first episode even included a Philip Marlowe-style voiceover. Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters. In this case, the \"underworld\" is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings. In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe. Many traditional \"noir\" stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops. These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.\n\nThe style and focus of the show changed considerably over its run, and starting late in season two the original noir idea was mostly discarded in favor of more large-scale supernatural-themed conflicts. In later seasons, the mythology and stories became increasingly complex; in Season Four, one of the characters on the show itself described the storyline as \"a turgid supernatural soap opera.\" Whereas the show initially dealt with the difficulty of being kind to people on a personal basis, the show ultimately focused on Angel's status as an archetypal Champion for humanity, and explored ideas such as moral ambiguity, the spiritual cost of violence, and the nature of free will. The enduring theme throughout the series was the struggle for redemption.\n\n\"Angel\" explored trust motifs as an increasingly central focus of the show. In the first two seasons, there were sprinklings of deceit and treachery, but in the last three seasons duplicity began to pervade the thematic structure, culminating in Season Five when almost every episode included some kind of double-cross, trickery, or illusion. An idea presented in Season Three was that even prophecy can betray, as they are often deceiving if not plain lies. In Season Five, it is repeatedly emphasized that the characters can trust no one in their new situation. The series is also notable for harsh betrayals within the cast of main characters; such events often having lethal consequences.\n\n\"Angel\" depicted the feelings of loneliness, danger, and callousness often attributed to the urban Los Angeles megalopolis. The divisions between the ordered world of the day and the chaotic world of the night have been trademark themes of \"noir\" and by depicting a protagonist who literally has no daytime life, the series was able to explore these same themes in more dramatic, metaphorical ways. As the series progressed, the creators were able to explore darker aspects of the characters, particularly Angel, who commits a number of morally questionable actions, and periodically reverts to his evil persona Angelus.\n\nThe series was released to DVD, produced by 20th Century Fox, from 2001 to 2005.\n\nIn 2009, the DVDs were repackaged into slimmer cases, which resemble regular DVD packaging.\n\nCriticisms of \"Angel\" are often put into the context of it being a spin-off to popular show \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", and will at times refer to it being \"better than\" or \"lesser than\" its parent show. For example, an article in \"The Independent\" states, \"The LA-set spin-off to \"Buffy\" was initially dismissed as the original's poor cousin but gradually developed into a darkly entertaining show in its own right.\"\n\nIn two of the four seasons when both shows were in production, \"Buffy\"s overall yearly ratings were higher than \"Angel\"s.\n\n\"Angel\" gathered a number of awards and nominations. It won the International Horror Guild Award for Best Television in 2001. It received many awards and nominations from the Saturn Awards which are presented annually by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films: it won Best Network TV Series in 2004 and David Boreanaz won Best TV Actor in 2000, 2003, and 2004. Specific episodes, \"Waiting in the Wings\", \"Smile Time\", and \"Not Fade Away\", were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005.\n\n\"Angel\", itself a spin-off from \"Buffy\", has in turn inspired a whole \"industry\" of books, comics, and merchandise.\n\nOutside of the TV series, \"Angel\" has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse Expanded Universe\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\nMany of these works are set at particular times within the Buffyverse. For example, Joss Whedon has written an \"Angel\" mini-series of comics, \"Long Night's Journey\", which was specifically set in early \"Angel\" Season Two. \"Angel\" comics were originally published by Dark Horse Comics, which published them from 2000 until 2002. IDW Publishing obtained rights to publish \"Angel\" comics in 2005 and has been releasing them since. Spinning off from the \"Angel\" comics comes an entire series of \"Spike\" comics, using the \"Angel\" logo's typeface in its depiction of the name \"Spike\", among these are the comics \"Spike vs. Dracula\", \"\" and \"\". As of November 2007 to February 2009, the story of the series was continued canonically in lieu of a Season Six in a 17-issue maxi-series titled \"\", written by Brian Lynch and plotted by both Lynch and Joss Whedon. This spun off into numerous \"Angel\" titles set after the television series, of which all are now considered canon, until 2011 when \"Angel\" rights revert to Dark Horse Comics who began to publish \"Angel\" comics under the banner of \"Angel & Faith\".\n\nFollowing their success with a series of \"Buffy\" novels, Pocket Books purchased the license to produce novels for \"Angel\". Twenty-four \"Angel\" novels were published. Jeff Mariotte became the most successful \"Angel\" novelist, publishing eleven \"Angel\" novels. They also published seven \"Buffy\"/\"Angel\" crossover books that featured settings and characters from both series.\n\nIn March 2006, Joss Whedon still talked of the possibility of a TV movie involving Spike to be written and directed by Tim Minear.\n\n\"Angel\" has inspired magazines and companion books, as well as countless websites, online discussion forums, and works of fan fiction. Eden Studios have published an \"Angel\" role-playing game.\n\n\n"}

He was sworn in at a 2 May 2008 ceremony at the State House in Entebbe before President Yoweri Museveni and Chief Justice Benjamin Odoki. On 5 March 2008, Choudry was approved to become a High Court Judge and the first Sikh and Asian born Uganda appointed to the bench in that country.\n\nHe has written several books, notably \"Sikh Pilgrimage to Pakistan\".\n\nAnup Singh Choudry is an Ugandan-born Sikh of Punjabi ancestry. His grandfather Hari Singh had migrated from Rawalpindi to Uganda in the early 1900s serving in the then Crown Colony's civil service system. His late father Tarlok Singh had also served in Uganda's civil service, retiring shortly before 1972 when Idi Amin seized the properties and businesses of all the country's Asians and European citizens and forced around 30,000 Asians holding British passports to flee to Britain.\n\nAfter being schooled in Uganda he travelled to England to study at the University of London and the University of Cambridge.

{"id": "2905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2905", "title": "Artemis", "text": "Artemis\n\nArtemis (; Artemis, ), in the ancient Greek religion and myth, is the goddess of the hunt, the wilderness, wild animals and chastity. \n\nArtemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She was the patron and protector of young girls, and was believed to bring disease upon women and relieve them of it. In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the role of Eileithyia in aiding women during childbirth. Much like Athena and Hestia, Artemis preferred to remain a maiden and is sworn never to marry. \n\nArtemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities and her temple at Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Artemis' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver and hunting knives and the deer and the cypress were sacred to her. The goddess Diana is her Roman equivalent. \n\nThe name Artemis (\"noun\", \"feminine\") is of unknown or uncertain etymology, although various sources have been proposed.\n\nAccording to J. T. Jablonski, the name is also Phrygian and could be \"compared with the royal appellation \"Artemas\" of Xenophon. According to Charles Anthon the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *\"arta\", *\"art\", *\"arte\", all meaning \"great, excellent, holy,\" thus Artemis \"becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus\". Anton Goebel \"suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, \"to shake,\" and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter\".\n\nThe name may be possibly related to Greek \"árktos\" \"bear\" (from PIE *\"h₂ŕ̥tḱos\"), supported by the bear cult the goddess had in Attica (Brauronia) and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave, as well as the story of Callisto, which was originally about Artemis (Arcadian epithet \"kallisto\"); this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger bear cult found further afield in other Indo-European cultures (e.g., Gaulish Artio). It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshipped in Minoan Crete as the goddess of mountains and hunting, Britomartis. While connection with Anatolian names has been suggested, the earliest attested forms of the name \"Artemis\" are the Mycenaean Greek , \"a-te-mi-to\" /Artemitos/ and , \"a-ti-mi-te\" /Artimitei/, written in Linear B at Pylos. R. S. P. Beekes suggested that the \"e\"/\"i\" interchange points to a Pre-Greek origin. Artemis was venerated in Lydia as \"Artimus\". Georgios Babiniotis, while accepting that the etymology is unknown, also states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of Pre-Greek origin.\n\nAncient Greek writers, by way of folk etymology, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric \"Artamis\") to ἄρταμος, \"artamos\", i.e. \"butcher\" or, like Plato did in \"Cratylus\", to , \"artemḗs\", i.e. \"safe\", \"unharmed\", \"uninjured\", \"pure\", \"the stainless maiden\".\n\nVarious conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology regarding the birth of Artemis and Apollo, her twin brother. However, in terms of parentage, all accounts agree that she was the daughter of Zeus and Leto and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.\n\nAn account by Callimachus has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of Delos disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.\n\nAccording to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis the island where Leto gave birth was Ortygia.\n\nIn ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at Phaistos and, in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as Paximadia.\n\nA \"scholium\" of Servius on \"Aeneid\" iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a quail (\"ortux\") in order to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.\n\nThe myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.\n\nThe childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The \"Iliad\" reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by Hera, climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.\n\nA poem by Callimachus to the goddess \"who amuses herself on mountains with archery\" imagines some charming vignettes. Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her several wishes:\n\n\nArtemis believed that she had been chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo. All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.\n\nOceanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited Pan, the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.\n\nAs a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, Orion, won her heart. Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.\n\nThe river god Alpheus was in love with Artemis, but as he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart, he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant Arethusa. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, Artemis Alphaea in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.\n\nBouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetus, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.\n\nMultiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, Actaeon who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs. Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.\n\nAccording to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's \"The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies\", the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this hubris, he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman Ovid having accidentally seen Artemis (Diana) on Mount Cithaeron while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds. Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele.\n\nIn some versions of the story of Adonis, Artemis sent a wild boar to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than her.\n\nIn other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of Aphrodite, and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of Hippolytus, who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus’s death.\n\nIn yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.\n\nOrion was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a scorpion sent by Gaia. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis, one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him. In a version by Aratus, Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in self-defense.\n\nIn yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to Hyginus Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as Eos did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was \"protective\" of his sister's maidenhood.\n\nThe twin sons of Poseidon and Iphidemia, Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the Aloadae never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.\n\nCallisto was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo gained her confidence and took advantage of her or, according to Ovid, raped her. As a result of this encounter, she conceived a son, Arcas.\n\nEnraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the Ursa Minor and Ursa Major constellations.\n\nArtemis punished Agamemnon after he killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.\n\nA Queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.\n\nChione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, Hermes and Apollo, and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.\n\nArtemis saved the infant Atalanta from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. In some stories, Artemis later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because others claimed Atlanta was a superior hunter.\n\nAmong other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King Oeneus had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis.\n\nMeleager was a hero of Aetolia. King Oeneus had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian Boar. After the death of Meleager, Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the Meleagrids into guineafowl that Artemis loved very much.\n\nIn Nonnus \"Dionysiaca\", Aura was the daughter of Lelantos and Periboia. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked Nemesis for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iacchus, was saved by Artemis. Iacchus later became an attendant of Demeter and the leader of Eleusinian Mysteries.\n\nPolyphonte was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite. As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the entire family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.\n\nArtemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother Apollo was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the \"Iliad\" she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.\n\nArtemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.\n\nAeneas was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.\n\nArtemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout ancient Greece. Her best known cults were on the island of Delos\n(her birthplace), in Attica at Brauron and Mounikhia (near Piraeus), and in Sparta. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer.\n\nThe ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new military campaign.\n\nAthenian festivals in honor of Artemis included Elaphebolia, Mounikhia, Kharisteria, and Brauronia. The festival of Artemis Orthia was observed in Sparta.\n\nPre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as \"arktoi\", or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls \"act the bear\" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.\n\nVirginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating Ilithyia, since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin. During the Classical period in Athens, she was identified with Hecate. Artemis also assimilated Caryatis (Carya).\n\nAs Aeginaea, she was worshipped in Sparta; the name means either huntress of chamois, or the wielder of the javelin ().\nAlso in Sparta, Artemis \"Lygodesma\" was worshipped. This epithet means \"willow-bound\" from the Gr. \"lygos\" (λυγός, willow) and \"desmos\" (δεσμός, bond). The willow tree appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.\n\nShe was worshipped at Naupactus as Aetole; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin. This \"Aetolian Artemis\" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of Ozolian Locris, until it was awarded to the Aetolians by Philip II of Macedon. Strabo records another precinct of \"Aetolian Artemos\" at the head of the Adriatic. As Agoraea she was the protector of the agora.\n\nAs Agrotera, she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local Aeginian goddess, Aphaea. As Potnia Theron, she was the patron of wild animals; Homer used this title. As Kourotrophos, she was the nurse of youths. As Locheia, she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.\n\nShe was sometimes known as Cynthia, from her birthplace on Mount Cynthus on Delos, or Amarynthia from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in Euboea.\n\nShe was sometimes identified by the name Phoebe, the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet Phoebus.\n\nAlphaea, Alpheaea, or Alpheiusa (Gr. , , or ) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god Alpheius, who was said to have been in love with her. It was under this name that she was worshipped at Letrini in Elis, and in Ortygia. Artemis Alphaea was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of Alpheius, she and her nymphs escaped him by covering their faces.\n\nAs Artemis Anaitis, the 'Persian Artemis' was identified with Anahita. As Apanchomene, she was worshipped as a hanged goddess.\n\nShe was also worshiped as Artemis Tauropolos, variously interpreted as \"worshipped at Tauris\", \"pulled by a yoke of bulls\", or \"hunting bull goddess\". A statue of Artemis \"Tauropolos\" in her temple at Brauron in Attica was supposed to have been brought from the Taurians by Iphigenia. Tauropolia was also a festival of Artemis in Athens. There was a \"Tauropolion\", a temple in a \"temenos\" sacred to Artemis Tauropolos, in the north Aegean island of Doliche (now Ikaria). There is a Temple to 'Artemis Tauropolos' (as well as a smaller temple to an unknown goddess about south, on the beach) located on the eastern shore of Attica, in the modern town of Artemida (Loutsa). An aspect of the Taurian Artemis was also worshipped as Aricina.\n\nArtemis was born on the sixth day, which made it sacred for her.\n\nAn important aspect of Artmeis' persona and worship was her virginity, which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth. It is likely that the idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess is related to her primary role as a huntress. Hunters traditionally abstained from sex prior to the hunt as a form of ritual purity and out of a belief that the scent would scare off potential prey. The ancient cultural context in which Artemis' worship emerged also held that virginity was a prerequisite to marriage, and that a married woman became subservient to her husband. In this light, Artemis' virginity is also related to her power and independence. Rather than a form of asexuality, it is an attribute that signals Artemis as her own master, with power equal to that of male gods. It is also possible that her virginity represents a concentration of fertility that can be spread among her followers, in the manner of earlier mother goddess figures. However, some later Greek writers did come to treat Artemis as inherently asexual and as an opposite to Aphrodite.\n\nDespite her virginity, both modern scholars and ancient commentaries have linked Artemis to the archetype of the mother goddess. Artemis was traditionally linked to fertility and was petitioned to assist women with childbirth. According to Herodotus, the Greek playwright Aeschylus identified Artemis with Persephone as a daughter of Demeter. Her worshipers in Arcadia also traditionally associated her with Demeter and Persephone. In Asia Minor, she was often conflated with local mother goddess figures, such as Cybele, and Anahita in Iran. However, the archetype of the mother goddess was not highly compatible with the Greek pantheon, and though the Greeks had adopted worship of Cybele and other Anatolian mother goddesses as early as the 7th century BCE, she was not directly conflated with any Greek goddesses; instead, bits and pieces of her worship and aspects were absorbed variously by Artemis, Aphrodite, and others as Eastern influence spread.\n\nAt Ephesus in Ionia, Turkey, her temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through \"interpretatio graeca\" was worshipped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess Cybele, in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the \"Lady of Ephesus\" adorned with multiple large beads. Excavation at the site of the \"Artemision\" in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had been hung on the original wooden statue (\"xoanon\"), and these were probably carried over into later sculpted copies. In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “\"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\"” Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location.\n\n\nAccording to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was Khryselakatos (\"of the Golden Shaft\") and Iokheira (\"showered by arrows\"). The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.\nArtemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi). The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.\n\nAlthough quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis, while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing. As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.\nDeer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called Elaphoi Khrysokeroi and harnessed them to her chariot. The third labour of Heracles, commanded by Eurystheus, consisted of catching the Cerynitian Hind alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive. Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.\nArtemis got her hunting dogs from Pan in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one – these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.\nThe sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').\nThe boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame. In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her. Oineus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis' boar.\nArtemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother, Meleagor, so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.\nHawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.\n\nThe oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as \"Potnia Theron\" (\"Queen of the Beasts\"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as Artemis Orthia, with a sanctuary close by Sparta.\n\nIn Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of Niobe.\n\nArtemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the crescent moon, such as also found on Luna and others.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of \"Artemis and the Stag\" was sold at Sotheby's auction house in New York state by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for $25.5 million.\n\n105 Artemis, the Artemis (crater), the Artemis Chasma and the Artemis Corona have all been named after the goddess.\n\nArtemis is the acronym for \"Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol\", a large bolometer camera in the submillimeter range that was installed in 2010 at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.\n\nThe taxonomic genus \"Artemia\", which entirely comprises the family Artemiidae, derives from Artemis. \"Artemia\" are aquatic crustaceans known as brine shrimp, the best known species of which, \"Artemia salina\", or Sea Monkeys, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his \"Systema Naturae\" in 1758. \"Artemia\" live in salt lakes, and although they are almost never found in an open sea, they do appear along the Aegean coast near Ephesus, where the Temple of Artemis once stood.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "252251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252251", "title": "Automatic writing", "text": "Automatic writing\n\nAutomatic writing or psychography is a claimed psychic ability allowing a person to produce written words without consciously writing. The words purportedly arise from a subconscious, spiritual or supernatural source. Scientists and skeptics consider automatic writing to be the result of the ideomotor effect and even proponents of automatic writing admit it has been the source of innumerable cases of self-delusion. Automatic writing is not the same thing as free writing.\n\nAn early example of the practice is the 16th century Enochian language, allegedly dictated to John Dee and Edward Kelley by Enochian angels and integral to the practice of Enochian magic.\n\nParapsychologist William Fletcher Barrett wrote that \"automatic messages may take place either by the writer passively holding a pencil on a sheet of paper, or by the planchette, or by a 'ouija board'.\" In spiritualism, spirits are claimed to take control of the hand of a medium to write messages, letters, and even entire books. Automatic writing can happen in a trance or waking state. The Surrealist poet Robert Desnos claimed he was among the most gifted in automatic writing. Some psychical researchers such as Thomson Jay Hudson have claimed no spirits are involved in automatic writing and the subconscious mind is the explanation.\n\nAutomatic writing as a spiritual practice was reported by Hyppolyte Taine in the preface to the third edition of his \"De l'intelligence\", published in 1878. Besides \"ethereal visions\" or \"magnetic auras\", Fernando Pessoa claimed to have experienced automatic writing. He said he felt \"owned by something else\", sometimes feeling a sensation in the right arm he claimed was lifted into the air without his will. Georgie Hyde-Lees, the wife of William Butler Yeats, also claimed she could write automatically. Sri Aurobindo as well as The Mother (Mirra Alfassa) regularly practiced Automatic writing.\n\nA prominent alleged example of automatic writing is the Brattleboro hoax. When Charles Dickens died in 1870 he left The Mystery of Edwin Drood unfinished. According to the itinerant printer T. P. James this angered Dicken's spirit so much that he channeled the rest of the novel through James's hand. This is supposed to have begun on Christmas Eve 1872 and continued in thrice weekly sessions until completion.\n\nShortly after his 1917 marriage to Georgie Hyde-Lees the poet W. B. Yeats came to be heavily influenced by her delving into what they referred to as \"the automatic script\".\n\nThe medium Pierre L. O. A. Keeler had an alleged spirit writing communication from Abraham Lincoln currently exhibited at the Lily Dale Museum. Despite Lincoln being a well known skeptic and Keeler having been known to employ magician's tricks this is used as one of the many examples of skeptics purportedly endorsing spiritualism—posthumously. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell who made a detailed examination of the \"spirit\" writing concluded it had no resemblance to Lincoln's handwriting and described the message as \"bogus\".\n\nArthur Conan Doyle, in his book \"The New Revelation\" (1918), wrote that automatic writing occurs either by the writer's subconscious or by external spirits operating through the writer. Doyle and his wife led an automatic writing séance with Harry Houdini where Lady Doyle wrote fifteen pages of purported messages from Houdini's mother although this information was immediately discounted as fraudulent by Houdini.\n\nParanormal investigator Harry Price exposed the supposed automatic writing in the Borley Rectory as the wall-scrawling of a housewife attempting to hide an extramarital affair.\n\nThere was an apocalyptic cult led by a lapsed Scientologist named Keech. He and his followers were waiting for an alien ship to take them to the nonexistent planet Clarion and save them from a worldwide flood that was to commence at midnight on December 20, 1954. When that didn't occur Keech allegedly got an automatic writing message from God calling the whole thing off.\n\nIn 1975, Wendy Hart of Maidenhead claimed she wrote automatically about Nicholas Moore, a sea captain who died in 1642. Also in 1975 the CIA attempted to employ remote viewing through the Stargate Project. In the spring of 1989 Defense Intelligence Agency's remote viewing unit was called in to assist in locating the fugitive Charlie Jordan. One Angela Dellafiora employed a form of automatic writing she called written remote viewing. Although there are conflicting accounts of exactly where she claimed Jordan was she was apparently able to describe his location \"somewhere in northern Wyoming, near a campground\" accurately.\n\nDavid Icke claims to have been alerted he was a \"Son of the Godhead\" through his automatic writing. Vassula Ryden claims to receive and transcribe messages from her guardian angel Daniel, Jesus, Yahweh. She has provoked both skepticism and credulity from Catholic laity and clergy, as well as the skeptical community at large. Alleged cases of automatic writing have included Joseph Smith, Patience Worth, Aleister Crowley, Jane Roberts, Helen Schucman and Neale Donald Walsch.\n\nScientists and skeptics consider automatic writing to be the result of the ideomotor effect.\n\nAccording to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, \"automatic writing is produced while one is in a dissociated state. It is a form of motor automatism, or unconscious muscular activity.\" Neurologist Terence Hines has written \"automatic writing is an example of a milder form of dissociative state\".\n\nParanormal researcher Ben Radford writes in his 2017 book \"Investigating Ghosts\" that there is no real way to know if the writing is coming from \"outside their bodies,\" you \"must take their word for it. Because the source of the information is at issue and the medium cannot be validated, we must turn to the content of the material.\" Various psychic mediums have claimed to channel famous dead people like Susan Lander who claimed that Betsy Ross contacted her to say, \"I am gay and I fly the flag of pride and liberty for all of us.\" Radford states that historians say that there is \"no credible historical evidence that Ross ... either made or had a hand in designing the American flag.\" Without some kind of validation, \"anyone can claim to communicate with the spirit of anyone.\" Radford states that it would seem to be easier for the ghost to communicate by voice than by controlling a pen, considering spelling and grammar are more difficult. \"Automatic writing should logically hinder, not help spirit communication.\"\n\nIn an 1890 paper on hypnotism Morton Prince claims, \"automatic writing is not a purely unconscious reflex act, but, the product of conscious individuality,\" and further claims that the hand that is writing is under the control of a separate hypnotic personality during trances. Physician Charles Arthur Mercier in the \"British Medical Journal\" (1894) criticized the spiritualist interpretation of automatic writing, concluding, \"there is no need nor room for the agency of spirits, and the invocation of such agency is the sign of a mind not merely unscientific, but uninformed.\"\n\nPsychology professor Théodore Flournoy investigated the claim by nineteenth-century medium Hélène Smith (Catherine Müller) she did automatic writing to convey messages from Mars in Martian language. Flournoy concluded her \"Martian\" language had a strong resemblance to Ms. Smith's native language of French and her automatic writing was \"romances of the subliminal imagination, derived largely from forgotten sources (for example, books read as a child).\" He invented the term cryptomnesia to describe this phenomenon.\n\nIn 1927, psychiatrist Harold Dearden wrote that automatic writing is a psychological method of \"tapping\" the unconscious mind and there is nothing mysterious about it.\n\nIn 1986, A. B. Joseph investigated two female patients who were found to exhibit ictal hypergraphia.\n\nAutomatic writing behavior was discovered by Dilek Evyapan and Emre Kumral in three patients with right hemispheric damage.\n\nA 2012 study of ten psychographers using single photon emission computed tomography showed differences in brain activity and writing complexity during alleged trance states vs. normal state writing.\n\nIn an interview in \"GQ\", David Byrne indicates an interest in automatic writing due to the influence of Brian Eno.\n\nAutomatic writing is touted by medium Bonnie Page in a \"Sentinel and Enterprise\" article as a method of accessing claircognizance abilities.\n\nPortions of Van Morrison's album \"Astral Weeks\" supposedly are inspired by dreams, reveries, and automatic writing.\n\nCzech director Jan Svankmajer claims he concocted the screenplay for his hybrid film \"Insect (Hmyz)\" in a fit of automatic writing.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs has described his book \"Naked Lunch\" as \"automatic writing gone horribly wrong\" and believed he found his subconscious taken over by a hostile entity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "264061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264061", "title": "Bill Maher", "text": "Bill Maher\n\nWilliam Maher (; born January 20, 1956) is an American comedian, political commentator and television host. He is known for the HBO political talk show \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" (2003–present) and the similar late-night show called \"Politically Incorrect\" (1993-2002), originally on Comedy Central and later on ABC.\n\nMaher is known for his sarcastic attitude, political satire and sociopolitical commentary. He targets many topics including religion, politics, bureaucracy, political correctness and the mass media.\n\nMaher supports the legalization of cannabis and same-sex marriage. His critical views of religion were the basis for the 2008 documentary film \"Religulous\". He is a supporter of animal rights, having served on the board of PETA since 1997 and is an advisory board member of Project Reason. In 2005, Maher ranked at number 38 on Comedy Central's 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time. He received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star on September 14, 2010.\n\nMaher was born in New York City. His father, William Aloysius Maher Jr., was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (née Berman), was a nurse. He was raised in his Irish-American father's Roman Catholic religion. Until his early teens, he was unaware that his mother, whose family was from Hungary, was Jewish. Owing to his disagreement with the Catholic Church's doctrine about birth control, Maher's father stopped taking Maher and his sister to Catholic church services when Maher was thirteen.\n\nMaher was raised in River Vale, New Jersey, and graduated from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale in 1974. He then attended Cornell University, where he double majored in English and history, and graduated in 1978. Maher has said: \"selling pot allowed me to get through college and make enough money to start off in comedy.\"\n\nMaher began his career as a comedian and actor. He was host of the New York City comedy club Catch a Rising Star in 1979. Maher began appearing on Johnny Carson's and David Letterman's shows in 1982. He made limited television appearances including on \"Sara\" (1985), \"Max Headroom\" (1987), \"Murder, She Wrote\" (1989, 1990), and \"Charlie Hoover\" (1991). His feature film debut was in \"D.C. Cab\" (1983). He later appeared in \"Ratboy\" (1986), \"\" (1987), \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\" (1988), and \"Pizza Man\" (1991).\n\nMaher assumed the host role on \"Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher\", a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on ABC from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions. Jerry Seinfeld, a regular guest on the show, stated that \"Politically Incorrect\" reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and '60s \"when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host\".\n\n\"Politically Incorrect\" won an array of awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Technical Direction, two CableACE awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing, and hosting of \"Politically Incorrect\", including ten Emmy nominations, two TV Guide nominations, and two Writers Guild nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for \"Politically Incorrect\" in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the September 11 attacks. He agreed with his guest, conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush's statement calling them cowards). Maher said, \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right.\" Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military. After receiving complaints, FedEx and Sears Roebuck pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.\n\nMaher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on \"Politically Incorrect\". In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children. The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group had dropped the show from its ABC-affiliated stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of \"Politically Incorrect\", Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for \"championing free speech\"). Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award.\n\nIn 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer, and co-writer of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network HBO. In 2016, HBO renewed \"Real Time\" through 2018, for its 15th and 16th seasons. During an interview, Maher told Terry Gross (on NPR's \"Fresh Air\") that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on \"Politically Incorrect\".\n\nAs with his previous show, \"Politically Incorrect\", Maher begins \"Real Time\" with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with two or three panelists, usually consisting of pundits, authors, activists, actors, politicians, and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events.\n\n\"Real Time\" has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime Emmy Awards and six Writer's Guild awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America. Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for \"Politically Incorrect\", while nine were for \"Real Time\". The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: \"I'm Swiss\" and \"\".\n\nIn late May 2005, Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus sent a letter to Time Warner's board of directors requesting \"Real Time\" be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous. Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem.\n\nOn September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell from the October 29, 1999 episode of his old show \"Politically Incorrect\" on his current show \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", where she mentioned that she had \"dabbled in witchcraft\". This was one of the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O'Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle.\n\nIn February 2017, Maher invited Milo Yiannopoulos to be interviewed on \"Real Time.\" Yiannopoulos accepted, despite protests from some commentators and fans. The appearance on Maher's show harmed Yannopoulos's career due to comments in the interview in which he seemed to express sympathy toward perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In the days following the interview, Yiannopoulos had his invitation to speak before the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, as well as a book deal with Simon & Schuster, cancelled. Yiannopoulos subsequently resigned as an editor at Breitbart News. When asked whether Yiannopoulos's interview on his show was among the causes of his resignation, Maher concurred, saying, \"As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You're welcome.\" Later in June 2017, Maher came under criticism for saying \"I'm a house nigger\" on Real Time with calls being made by people to HBO to fire him. Following the episode, HBO sent a statement to media outlets, calling Maher's remarks \"inexcusable and tasteless\" and said the cable network will remove that segment from future airings of the show. Maher also issued a statement apologizing for the remarks.\n\nMaher is a frequent commentator on various cable news networks, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and HLN. Maher has regularly appeared on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\" and has also been a frequent guest on MSNBC's \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\", \"The Rachel Maddow Show\", and \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\". Maher has also appeared as a guest on HLN's \"The Joy Behar Show\". He wrote the foreword for the 2002 book, \"Spin This!: All the Ways We Don't Tell the Truth\" by show host Bill Press.\n\nMaher hosted the January 13, 2006 edition of \"Larry King Live\", on which he was a frequent guest. Maher appeared as a special guest on the June 29, 2010 edition of the show, on which CNN anchor Larry King announced his retirement. Maher co-emceed the final show of \"Larry King Live\" on December 16, 2010 with Ryan Seacrest.\n\nIn 2004 Maher appeared on stage as Satan in The Steve Allen Theater production of \"Hollywood Hell House\", a spoof of the Christian-run hell houses. The show was a faithful reproduction of an evangelistic scare-experience written by Reverend Keenan Roberts to terrify teenagers into declaring themselves Christians. \"Our faith is that putting this up as itself, it will hoist itself on its own petard, that it's comical just as it is,\" explained producer Maggie Rowe. The show featured a rotating cast of over 160 celebrities, including Andy Richter (Jesus), Richard Belzer, Dave Thomas, Traci Lords, Craig Bierko, Sarah Silverman, and Julia Sweeney.\n\nMaher and director Larry Charles teamed up to make the movie \"Religulous\", described by trade publication \"Variety\" as a documentary \"that spoofs religious extremism across the world\". It was released on October 3, 2008.\n\nIn 2013 Maher became one of the executive producers for the HBO newsmagazine series \"Vice\". Also in 2013, Maher appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and offered to pay $5 million to a charity if Donald Trump would produce his birth certificate to prove that Trump's mother had not mated with an orangutan. Maher said this reportedly in response to Trump having previously challenged President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate, and having offered $5 million payable to a charity of Obama's choice if Obama would produce his college applications, transcripts, and passport records.\n\nIn response to Maher's offer, Trump produced his birth certificate, and then Trump launched a lawsuit after Maher was not forthcoming, claiming that Maher's $5 million offer was legally binding. \"I don't think he was joking\", Trump said. \"He said it with venom.\" Trump withdrew his lawsuit against the comedian after eight weeks.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Maher and his friend Michael Moore announced on YouTube that they are going to make a movie called \"The Kings of Atheism\".\n\nMaher eschews political labels, referring to himself as \"practical\". In the past, he has described himself as a libertarian, and has also referred to himself \"as a progressive, as a sane person\". He has referred to himself as a \"9/11 liberal\", noting that his formerly liberal view of Islam changed as a result of the attacks on September 11, 2001, and he differentiates himself from liberals of the opinion that all religions are alike.\n\nMaher favors ending corporate welfare and federal funding of non-profits as well as the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and cannabis. Maher is a member of the advisory boards for both the NORML and Marijuana Policy Project, organizations that support regulated legalization of cannabis, and has been called \"one of the brightest torches for sensible marijuana policy\" and \"a contemporary cannabis statesman\".\n\nMaher describes himself as an environmentalist, and he has spoken in favor of the Kyoto treaty on global warming on his show \"Real Time\". He often criticizes industry figures involved in environmental pollution. He is a board member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The comedian has noted the paradox of people claiming they distrusted \"elite\" politicians while at the same time wanting elite doctors to treat them and elite lawyers to represent them in court. Maher supports the death penalty.\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks, he has endorsed certain uses of profiling at airports, saying that \"Places like Israel, where they have faced terrorism for a long time, of course understand that profiling is part of all detective work. It's part of all police work. If they stop calling it profiling and start calling it high-intelligence screening or something, people would go, it's about time.\"\n\nHe opposed the Iraq War from the beginning, and has summarized his opinion by saying that the United States and the world have had to pay too high a price for the war. He is skeptical of Iraq surviving without civil war.\n\nIn the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Maher announced his support for U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). Although Maher welcomed Obama's electoral victory, he subjected him to criticism after he took office for not acting more boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues.\n\nOn February 23, 2012, after his 'Crazy Stupid Politics' special streamed on Yahoo! Screen, Maher announced that he was contributing $1 million to Priorities USA, the Obama SuperPAC.\n\nOn the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Maher says he is \"more on the side of the Israelis\" and doesn't consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that \"Palestinians do have gripes\", and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying \"they don't need our money, they can handle it themselves.\" Maher also notes that most Israelis would prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their Israeli government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel's military actions against Palestinian militants amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza war. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led \"to their slaughter\", can't understand why they are defending themselves now.\n\nMaher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013 appearance on the late night TV talk show \"Conan\" that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a \"proud\" gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to \"saying I'm a 'proud remote control owner'\". Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both Democrats and Republicans favor guns.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Bill Maher expressed on his show limited support for the NSA's PRISM intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA's access to private data as a \"slippery slope\", and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2014 midterm elections, Maher conducted a \"Flip a District\" contest on his HBO show. His audience was asked to select one \"terrible, entrenched\" member of Congress in a close election race—\"the loserest loser of all\"—to remove from office. Maher aimed to help oust that representative by shining a \"national spotlight\" on the politician during segments of his show and stand-up comedy appearances in that member's district during the Fall election.\n\nMaher endorsed a 2014 Maine referendum to ban the use of bait, traps, and dogs to hunt bears in Maine. He specifically criticized the use of bait, referring to its use as \"nothing but an execution\".\n\nIn the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Maher initially endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders on February 5, 2016. Maher later announced his support for Hillary Clinton after Sanders had lost the Democratic Party primary elections. In October 2016, Maher criticized WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for publishing leaks from the DNC's emails, saying: \"I really feel like he's lost his way a little, and he hates Hillary.\"\n\nMaher is highly critical of all religion and views it as highly destructive. He has been described, or self-identified, variously as an agnostic, atheist, and apatheist, while objecting to having his views defined by a single label. In his 2008 feature film \"Religulous\", he refers to himself as agnostic. He has rejected being grouped with explicit atheists, saying in 2002, \"I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need, but I'm not an atheist, no.\" Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an apatheist, saying in 2011 \"I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care.\" When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being \"absolutely certain there is no god\"), he was only at 6.9, like Richard Dawkins, \"because we just don't know ... but we just don't think about it.\" He added, \"There's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team.\" Several months later on a 2012 episode of his HBO show, Maher declared that \"idiots must stop claiming that atheism is a religion. [...] believe it or not, I don't really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it's not even my hobby, and that's the best thing about being an atheist. It requires so little of your time.\" He has reiterated his stance during other interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, \"I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings.\"\n\nWhile critical of all organized religions, saying \"they're all stupid and dangerous\", Maher says all religions are not alike, and has drawn comparisons and contrasts between them. He has said, \"By any standard, Mormonism is more ridiculous than any other religion.\" He has referred to tenets of Judaism as \"insane\" and \"funny\", and has said Buddhism \"includes crazy whack shit that doesn't exist, that somebody made up, like reincarnation\". He has described Christianity and Islam as more \"warlike\", and has asserted that, like historic Christianity, present-day Islam needs to undergo its own reformation and enlightenment.\n\nIn defense of his criticism of Islam, Sharia law and Muslim culture, Maher says he is \"... someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don't have them... It's better ... I would like to keep those values here.\" Citing studies and poll results by Pew Research Center, the World Economic Forum and others, Maher says the human rights violations and \"illiberal ideas\" found in Islam are not extremist views held by a small minority, but are supported by a majority of citizens in Muslim countries. Maher has criticized liberals as hypocritical for defending these core liberal values and ideals only at home, while not condemning the oppression of these values and groups in Muslim culture. Regarding the more recent publicity generated by his stance in the ongoing debate, Maher says he thinks people are finally paying closer attention to a conversation that they need to have. \"I'm just shining a light on the reality of the situation. I don't even understand why this is so controversial.\"\n\nMaher received the 2009 Richard Dawkins Award from Atheist Alliance International. He is an advisory board member of author Sam Harris's Project Reason, a foundation that promotes scientific knowledge and secular values within society.\n\nMaher has stated that the American Medical Association is a powerful lobbying group and one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform. On the topic of getting health care reform legislation passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, \"he only needs 51.\" \"Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent—sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country—he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them.\" On Fox News in a televised debate with Bill O'Reilly, Maher said that \"if Jesus was in charge of the country we'd probably have health care for everybody.\"\n\nMaher has expressed the view that a lot of illness is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine is often not the most appropriate way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that \"the answer isn't another pill.\" He also has said: \"If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!\" He has expressed his distaste for the pharmaceutical and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming unhealthy food that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of high-fructose corn syrup is a contributor to the rise in frequency of obesity in the United States.\n\nIn a discussion with Michael Moore about the film \"Sicko\", Maher said, \"The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit.\"\n\nTara Parker-Pope and former Senator (R-TN) Dr. Bill Frist, a physician, have called his criticism of the H1N1 flu vaccinations unscientific. Infectious diseases expert Paul Offit has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher has put children at unnecessary risk. Offit says that celebrities like Maher are seen as \"less credible\" and would still be considered just \"great entertainment\" if they weren't joined by the former Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Bernadine Healy and influential pediatrician, Dr. Robert Sears.\n\nOncologist David Gorski criticized Maher's claims about vaccines several times in ScienceBlogs, and when Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award in 2009, Gorski wrote it was inappropriate. Skeptics, including mathematician and science writer Martin Gardner, neurologist Steven Novella, and magician Jamy Ian Swiss have also strongly rebuked Maher, characterizing him as anti-science, uninformed and potentially endangering the health of fans who take his \"non-medical\" advice. Maher responded to the criticism, saying, \"What I've read about what they think I'm saying is not what I've said. I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No.\"\n\nMaher has been a critic of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several 9/11 truthers and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience. The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic John Gibson.\n\nMaher has said his influences include Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, Lenny Bruce, Steve Allen, Mort Sahl, and George Carlin. Comedians who have said they were influenced by Maher are Chris Rock and Seth MacFarlane.\n\nMaher has never married. Regarding marriage, Maher is quoted on his website as saying, \"I'm the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives—they don't want them playing with me. I'm like the escaped slave—I bring news of freedom.\"\n\nIn 2003, he began dating former Playboy Cyber Girl Coco Johnsen. In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, Johnsen sued Maher for US$9 million for \"pain and suffering\" for alleged \"insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments\". Her suit stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially and buy a house in Beverly Hills. Johnsen's suit also alleged that she quit her job as a flight attendant and occasional model to be with him. Maher's lawyers in their response, filed on November 23, 2004, in Los Angeles Superior Court said Maher is a \"confirmed bachelor, and a very public one at that\" who \"never promised to marry [Johnsen] or to have children with her\". Maher's filing stated that, after the relationship had ended, Johnsen \"launched a campaign to embarrass, humiliate, and extort ridiculous sums of money from Bill Maher\". Johnsen had previously accused another former boyfriend of rape and kidnapping in 1997, and the charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 2, 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Maher began dating Karrine Steffans, best-selling author and former hip hop model.\n\nWhen commentators suggested there was a pattern to his dating because both his girlfriend and former girlfriend were black, Maher said, \"People say I'm into black women. Robert De Niro is into black women. I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black.\" From 2009-11, Maher dated former adjunct professor, science educator, and current \"Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" co-host Cara Santa Maria. In 2014, Maher was dating Ontario-born singer Anjulie Persaud.\n\nIn 2012, Maher purchased a minority ownership interest in the New York Mets.\n\n\n"}

The Buddhist population mainly consists of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean immigrants, with a substantial minority of native French converts and \"sympathizers.\" The rising popularity of Buddhism in France has been the subject of considerable discussion in the French media and academy in recent years.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the French Buddhist Union (UBF, founded in 1986) estimated there to be 600,000 to 650,000 Buddhists in France, with 150,000 French converts among them. In 1999, sociologist Frédéric Lenoir estimated there are 10,000 converts and up to 5 million \"sympathizers,\" although other researchers have questioned these numbers. A 1997 opinion poll counted as sympathizers young people who feel \"an intellectual affinity with Buddhism or expressed a sympathy to a Buddhist worldview.\"\n\nAlexandra David-Néel was an important early French Buddhist. She is best known for her 1924 visit to the forbidden (to foreigners) city of Lhasa, capital of Tibet, and wrote more than 30 books about Buddhism, philosophy, and her travels. In 1911 Alexandra traveled to India, to further her study of Buddhism. She was invited to the royal monastery of Sikkim, where she met Maharaj Kumar (crown prince) Sidkeon Tulku. She became Sidkeong's \"confidante and spiritual sister\" (according to Ruth Middleton), and perhaps his lover (Foster & Foster). She also met the thirteenth Dalai Lama twice in 1912, and had the opportunity to ask him many questions about Buddhism—a feat unprecedented for a European woman at that time.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Buddhist teachers of various traditions began to visit France, as detailed below.\n\nTaisen Deshimaru was a Japanese Zen Buddhist who founded numerous zendos in France. Thich Nhat Hanh Vietnamese-born Zen Buddhist nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, founded the Unified Buddhist Church (Eglise Bouddhique Unifiée) in France in 1969. Plum Village, a monastery and retreat center in the Dordogne in southern France, is his residence and the headquarters of his international sangha.\nBy the late 1990s, it has been estimated that there are more than 140 Tibetan Buddhist meditation centers in France. The first Tibetan Buddhist communities in France were established in the early 1970s. The highest-ranking head of schools to reside in France, H.E. Phendé Khenchen, established his temple of E Wam Phendé Ling in 1973. He is of the Ngor school of Buddhism. Buddhism in France's growth was catalyzed by visits, in 1975 of the Karmapa , head of the Kagyü school, Dudjom Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, also very high lamas, who visited Dordogne, where they established retreat centers with the help of Pema Wangyal Rinpoche. Pema Wangyal Rinpoche is the son of Kangyur Rinpoche, another high lama who was among the first to take western disciples. Dudjom Rinpoche later moved to France, where he passed away.\n\nKalu Rinpoche, also a highly esteemed lama, visited France in 1971, 1972 and 1974 and in 1976 led the first traditional three-year retreat for westerners in France. In the Kagyu lineage such retreats confer the title \"lama\" on those who complete them. It is estimated that sixty percent of the centers and monasteries in France are affiliated with the Kagyu school.\n1982 the Dalai Lama visted France. \n\nThere are about twenty retreat centres representing all the different schools as well as many town-based centres which are under the direction of great Tibetan Buddhist masters. Dhagpo Kundreul Ling in Auvergne is said to be the biggest Buddhist monastery outside Asia.\n\nSome of the larger retreat centers are:\n\n\nMonasticism has traditionally been the bedrock of Tibetan Buddhism, but there were only a few dozen ordained French monks and nuns until the mid-1990s. However, there are now at least 300, most of whom were trained at the two monasteries in Auvergne.\n\nThe most famous French monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is Matthieu Ricard, a longtime student of Dilgo Khyenste Rinpoche who is the son of famous philosopher Jean-Francois Revel. He has published books on Buddhism which have contributed to interest in Buddhism and French Buddhists among the intelligentsia.\n\n\"Wisdom of Buddhism\", a weekly French TV program, draws about 250,000 viewers, according to the Buddhist Union of France.\n\nPhilosopher Luc Ferry, appointed Minister of Youth and Education in 2002, published an article in Le Point magazine in which he asked, \"Why this Buddhist wave? And why particularly in France, a very Catholic country in the past? ... In this time of de-Christianization, Buddhism has furnished to the West a rich and interesting alternative.\"\n\n\n"}

Hinduism is one of the fastest growing religions in Australia mostly through immigration. Hinduism is also one of the most youthful religions in Australia, with 34% and 66% of Hindus being under the age of 14 and 34 respectively.\n\nIn the 19th century, the British first brought Hindus from India to Australia to work on cotton and sugar plantations. Many remained as small businessmen, working as camel drivers, merchants and hawkers, selling goods between small rural communities. These days Hindus are well educated professionals in fields such as medicine, engineering, commerce and information technology, constituting a model minority. The Hindus in Australia are mostly of Indian, Sri Lankan, Fijian, Malaysia, Singapore, Nepali, and Bangladesh origin, with some originating from other parts of the Indian subcontinent including Sindh. \n\nThe majority of Australian Hindus live along the Eastern Coast of Australia and are mainly located in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney. According to the , the Hindu population numbered 440,310 individuals, of whom 39% lived in Greater Sydney, 29% in Greater Melbourne, and 8% each in Greater Brisbane and Greater Perth. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Hindus are the Australian Capital Territory (2.57%) and New South Wales (2.43%), whereas those with the lowest are Queensland (0.98%) and Tasmania (0.50%). As a community Hindus live relatively peacefully and in harmony with the local populations. They have established a number of temples and other religious meeting places and celebrate most Hindu festivals.\n\nThe following dates briefly outline the arrival of Hinduism.\n\nData from the 2011 Census showed that all states(and A.C.T and the Northern Territory) apart from New South Wales had their Hindu population double from the 2006 census. New South Wales has had the largest number of Hindus since at least 2001.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Census, 44.16% of all Australians who were born in India were Hindu, so were 47.20% of those born in Fiji, 1.84% born in Indonesia, 3.42% from Malaysia, and 18.61% from Sri Lanka.\nMany local Australians are interested in learning Hinduism. Hinduism is also more popular among the Anglo-Australians. Many Caucasians in Australia also visit the Hindu temple at Carrum Downs (Shri Shiva Vishnu Temple) and learn Vedic Hindu scriptures in Tamil.The ISKCON Hindu community in Australia has 60,000 members - 70% of whom are Hindus from overseas, with the other 30% being Anglo Australians. The 2016 Census noted 415 Hindus belonging to the indegenous community of Australia (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people). \nLess than 17% of the Australian Hindus use English as their home language.

It offered the enslaved hope and reassurance. Slaves were forced to organize and conduct these meetings in secret because the idea of slaves assembling without supervision left the owners in fear. The meetings were held after dark, once field and house chores were completed, and carried on late into the night.\n\nChristianity was the prominent religion forced on the African Slaves after being transported to the Americas. After being exposed to Christian ideas, the slaves began to understand them more. Slaves discovered promising stories and passages in the Bible that offered hope. The story of Jesus Christ suffering on the cross drew attention because of the similar, harsh treatment they both received.\n\nThe hush harbors served as the location where slaves could combine their African religious traditions with Christianity. It was safe to freely blend the components of each religion in these meetings. The slaves could let go of all their hardships and express their emotions. Here is where Negro spirituals originated. The songs created by slaves were known to contain a double meaning, revealing the ideas of religious salvation and freedom from slavery. The meetings would also include practices such as dance. African shouts and rhythms were also included.\n\nSlaves would suffer severe punishments had they been caught in a hush harbor meeting. Slave owners were confident that they would compare treatment, working conditions, and punishments, leaving them worried about revolts and riots. The most common price would be a whipping. African American churches taught that all people were equal in God's eyes and viewed the doctrine of obedience to one's master taught in white churches as hypocritical. Instead the African American church focused on the message of equality and hopes for a better future.\n"}

Aristotle relates that, according to tradition, Italus converted the Oenotrians from a pastoral society to an agricultural one and gave them various ordinances, being the first to institute their system of common meals.\n\nWriting centuries later, the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his \"Rhomaike Archaiologia\" (\"Antiquitates romanae\", \"Roman Antiquities\"), cites Antiochus of Syracuse for the information that Italus was an Oenotrian by birth and relates the tradition that Italia was named after him, as well as another account that derives the name \"Italia\" from a word for calf, an etymology also stated by Timaeus, Varro, and Festus.\n"}
{"id": "12053944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12053944", "title": "Kayanian dynasty", "text": "Kayanian dynasty\n\nThe Kayanians, also Kays, Kayanids or Kaianids, or Kiani, are a semi-mythological dynasty of Persian tradition and folklore which supposedly ruled after the Pishdadids, and before the historical Achaemenids. Considered collectively, the Kayanian kings are the heroes of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, and of the \"Shahnameh\", Iran's national epic. \n\nAs an epithet of kings and the reason the dynasty is so called, Middle 𐭪𐭣 and New Persian کی \"kay(an)\" originates from Avestan \"𐬐𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬌‎\" \"kavi\" (or \"kauui\") \"king\" and also \"poet-sacrificer\" or \"poet-priest\". The word is also etymologically related to the Avestan notion of \"kavaēm kharēno\", the \"divine royal glory\" that the Kayanian kings were said to hold. The Kiani Crown is a physical manifestation of that belief.\n\nThe earliest known foreshadowing of the major legends of the Kayanian kings appears in the \"Yashts\" of the Avesta, where the dynasts offer sacrifices to the gods in order to earn their support and to gain strength in the perpetual struggle against their enemies, the \"Anaryas\" (non-Aryans, sometimes identified as the Turanians).\n\nIn \"Yasht\" 5, 9.25, 17.45-46, Haosravah, a Kayanian king later known as Kay Khosrow, together with Zoroaster and Jamasp (a premier of Zoroaster's patron Vishtaspa, another Kayanian king) worship in Airyanem Vaejah. The account tells that King Haosravah united the various Aryan (Iranian) tribes into one nation (\"Yasht\" 5.49, 9.21, 15.32, 17.41).\n\nTowards the end of the Sassanid period, Khosrow II (590-628, named after the Kay Khosrow of legend) ordered a compilation of the legends surrounding the Kayanians. The result was the \"Khwaday-Namag\" or \"Book of Lords,\" a long historiography of the Iranian nation from the primordial Gayomart to the reign of Khosrow II, with events arranged according to the perceived sequence of kings and queens, fifty in number.\n\nThe compilation may have been prompted by concern over deteriorating national spirit. There were disastrous global climate changes of 535-536 and the Plague of Justinian to contend with and the Iranians would have found much-needed solace in the collected legends of their past. \n\nFollowing the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and the subsequent rise of Islam, the Kayanian legends fell out of favour until the first revival of Iranian culture under the Samanids. Together with the folklore preserved in the Avesta, the \"Khwaday-Namag\" served as the foundation of other epic collections in prose, such as those commissioned by Abu Mansur Abd al-Razzaq, the texts of which have since been lost. The Samanid-sponsored revival also led to the resurgence of Zoroastrian literature, such as the Denkard, book 7.1 of which is also a historiography of Kayanians. The best known work of the genre is however Firdowsi's Shahnameh \"Book of Kings (Firdusi)\", which - though drawing on earlier works - is entirely in verse.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2860526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2860526", "title": "Kenneth Gentry", "text": "Kenneth Gentry\n\nKenneth L. Gentry, Jr. (3 May 1950) is a Reformed theologian, and an ordained minister in the Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly. He is particularly known for his support for and publication on the topics of orthodox preterism and postmillennialism in Christian eschatology, as well as for theonomy and six-day creation. He holds that each of these theological distinctives are logical and theological extensions of his foundational theology, which is Calvinistic and Reformed.\n\nGentry was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He is married (since July 1971) and has three children and six grandchildren.\n\nHe received his B.A. in Biblical Studies from Tennessee Temple University (1973, cum laude). After graduating he enrolled at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana. After two years at Grace Seminary (1973–1975) he left dispensationalism, having become convinced of a covenant and Reformed theology. He transferred to Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi (1975–1977). Upon completing studies at Reformed Theological Seminary he was awarded the M.Div. in 1977. After several years of pastoral ministry, he earned a Th.M. (1986) and a Th.D. (1987, magna cum laude) from Whitefield Theological Seminary, both in the field of New Testament.\n\nWhile at Reformed Theological Seminary he studied under Greg L. Bahnsen, a leading presuppositional apologist. Though Gentry initially resisted the distinctive ethical and eschatological views of Bahnsen, he was eventually persuaded of both theonomic ethics and postmillennial eschatology and became a staunch co-defender of them with Bahnsen. Over the years he developed a close friendship with Bahnsen, often lecturing with him in conferences, co-writing a book with him (\"House Divided: The Break-up of Dispensational Theology\"), eventually joining the staff of Bahnsen's Southern California Center for Christian Studies, and finally contributing to the festschrift in honor of Bahnsen, titled: \"The Standard Bearer.\"\n\nGentry retired from full-time pastoral ministry in 2015 after serving thirty-five years in three conservative and Reformed denominations: The Presbyterian Church in America, The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and The Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Assembly. He is the Director of GoodBirth Ministries, a non-profit religious educational ministry, \"committed to sponsoring, subsidizing, and advancing serious Christian scholarship and education\" (GoodBirth website: www.GoodBirthMinistries.com).\n\nGentry is the leading contemporary theological expositor of the first century for the date when the Apostle John's Revelation content preponderantly transpired. The first century tribulation paradigm is a profoundly different eschatology than that held by most American evangelical Christians that the tribulation and rapture haven't yet occurred.\n\nKenneth Gentry's works \"The Beast of Revelation\" and \"He Shall Have Dominion\" attempt to explain the identity of the Beast and what God's true redemptive plan for humanity are. Gentry's work is considered by his followers to be important for soteriological reasons.\n\nGentry's work enfilades the error of much contemporary Christian pre-trib eschatology, also serving to argue that incorrect interpretation of the Bible is possible even by sincere experts.\n\nGentry is perhaps best known for his book \"Before Jerusalem Fell\", which argues that the Book of Revelation was written before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. He holds that many of the dramatic events in Revelation correspond to the persecution of Christians under the Roman imperium as well as to the Jewish War against Rome which resulted in the destruction of Jewish temple. This book is the published version of his doctoral dissertation in 1986 under the title \"The Dating of the Book of Revelation: An Exegetical, Theological and Historical Argument for a Pre-A.D. 70 Composition.\"\n\nGentry has completed a two-volume academic commentary on Revelation titled: \"The Divorce of Israel: A Redemptive-Historical Interpretation\". It is currently being proofed and typeset by Tolle Lege Press and is scheduled for release in 2018. According to preliminary studies he has released (\"The Wrath of God and Israel\", Fountain Inn, SC: 2007), he will be presenting evidence that \"Babylon\" () is a metaphor for 1st century Jerusalem, and that the book's author John is following the pattern of the Old Testament prophets in denouncing Jerusalem's unfaithfulness by such images (see especially and ).\n\nGentry holds that the theme of Revelation is Christ's judgment coming against those who pierced him (), and presents the \"slain Lamb\" (; etc.) as wreaking vengeance upon 1st-century Jerusalem. He argues that the seven-sealed scroll is God's divorce decree against his unfaithful Old Testament wife (Israel) so that he might take a new bride, the Church (Rev. 21-22). Thus, Revelation dramatizes the transition from the old covenant, Temple-based, Judaic economy to the New Covenant, spiritual economy that includes all ethnicities, not just Jews (compare supersessionism).\n\nAccording to his research updates, Gentry sees strong similarities between Revelation and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Both works seek to demonstrate Christianity's superiority to Judaism by showing New Covenant Christianity supplanting Old Covenant Judaism (Heb. 8:13; Rev. 2:9; 3:9; 11:1-2). He notes that both documents even end up pointing the reader to the New Jerusalem from heaven (Heb.12:22; Rev. 21:2), which represents Christianity. He also draws parallels in thought between the Gospel of Matthew and Revelation. He sees evidence for this in Matthew's strong imagery regarding old covenant Judaism's demise in the rise of Christianity (Matt. 8:10-12; 21:33-46; 22:1-13; 23:29-38).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1354220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1354220", "title": "Kriyananda", "text": "Kriyananda\n\nKriyananda (born James Donald Walters; May 19, 1926, Azuga – April 21, 2013, Assisi) was a direct disciple of the yogi Paramahansa Yogananda and the founder of Ananda, a worldwide movement of spiritual intentional communities based on Yogananda's World Brotherhood Colonies ideal. Yogananda made Walters a minister for his organization, the Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF). He authorized him to teach Kriya Yoga while with SRF, and appointed him the head monk for the SRF Mount Washington monks only. After Yogananda's death, Walters was given final vows of sannyas in 1955 by then SRF President Daya Mata and given the name Kriyananda. In 1960, upon the passing of M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors elected Kriyananda to the Board of Directors and to the position of Vice President. In 1962, the SRF Board of Directors voted unanimously to request his resignation.\n\nKriyananda is the author of about 150 published books/booklets and the composer of over 400 pieces of music, which altogether have sold over three million copies. A few of the books have been published in 28 languages and a few are sold in 90 countries. He lectured in different countries throughout the world. In addition to English, he spoke Italian, Romanian, Greek, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Indonesian. He established a new Swami order in 2009: the Nayaswami Order.\n\nJ. Donald Walters was born on May 19, 1926, in Teleajen, Romania to American parents, Ray P. and Gertrude G. Walters. His father was an oil geologist with the Esso Corporation (since renamed Exxon in the United States) who was then assigned to the Romanian oilfields. He received an international education in Romania, Switzerland, England, and the United States. He attended Haverford College and Brown University, leaving the latter with only a semester left before graduation to dedicate his life to searching for God.\n\nIn September 1948, in New York, Walters read Yogananda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", a book he says transformed his life. By September 12, Walters had decided to leave his old life behind, and soon afterwards traveled cross-country by bus to southern California to become one of Yogananda's disciples. In Hollywood, California, Walters first met Yogananda at the Self-Realization Fellowship temple there and was accepted as a disciple.\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, \"The New Path\", Walters, twenty-two years old at this point, took up residence with other monks at SRF's mother center headquarters located on top of Mount Washington, Los Angeles. A year later, Yogananda had put Walters in charge of the monks there, asked him to write articles for the SRF magazine, had him lecture at various SRF centers, ordained him a minister, and appointed him to initiate students into Kriya Yoga. In their three and one half years (9/1948–3/1952) together, Walters took extensive notes of his many conversations with his master, which he later published in \"The Essence of Self-Realization\" and \"Conversations with Yogananda\".\n\nOn March 7, 1952, Paramahansa Yogananda was a speaker at a banquet for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Binay Ranjan Sen, and his wife at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. While giving his speech, Yogananda suddenly dropped to the floor and died. Walters was present in the hall, and this was a pivotal moment for the young monk.\n\nIn 1953, the SRF published Walter's book, \"Stories of Mukunda\", and in 1960 an LP album with him singing Yogananda's \"Cosmic Chants\", entitled \"Music for Meditation\". In 1955, Walters was given his final vows of sannyas into the order of Shankaracharya swamis, by Daya Mata, SRF president from 1955 until her death in 2010, and took the monastic name of \"Kriyananda\". Yogananda stated in his \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" regarding this order:\nEvery swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in its present form by Shankara. Because it is a formal order, with an unbroken line of saintly representatives serving as active leaders, no man can give himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from another swami; all monks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one common guru, Lord Shankara. By vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the spiritual teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the Order of Swamis.\n\nHe was made the director of the SRF Center Department, which guides SRF's meditation groups and centers, and was made a minister of Yogananda's Hollywood temple. He lectured for SRF in the United States, as well as in Canada, Mexico, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and India. In 1958, when Daya Mata, then President of SRF, traveled to India with Ananda Mata and another nun, he came along as well. In 1960, upon the death of Board member and Vice President of SRF, M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors, who were direct disciples appointed to the board by Yogananda, elected Kriyananda as a member and Vice President of the Board. He served in that capacity until dismissed in 1962.\n\nKriyananda remained in India, serving the SRF until 1962, when the SRF's board of directors voted unanimously to request his resignation. SRF said that the reasons for his dismissal had to do with specific actions of his – his basic pattern of behavior and being self-serving. \"Kriyananda constantly argued that his dismissal was unjust.\"\n\nKriyananda established Ananda Village as a World Brotherhood Colony in 1968 on 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land near Nevada City, California – his portion of a 160-acre (0.6 km2) parcel acquired with Richard Baker, Gary Snyder, and Allen Ginsberg. The village was actually founded with the signing of the first purchase agreement of a larger parcel of land on July 4, 1969. According to Kriyananda, these communities provide a supportive environment of “simple living and high thinking” where 1,000 full-time residents live, work, and worship together. The establishment of World Brotherhood Colonies was one of Yogananda's central \"Aims and Ideals\" published in his \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" until 1958.\n\nKriyananda founded various retreat centers: The Expanding Light Yoga and Meditation Retreat and nearby Ananda Meditation Retreat, both located near Nevada City, California, U.S.A.; Ananda Associazione near Assisi, Italy; and Ananda Gurgaon, India.\n\nThere are over 125 Ananda Meditation groups in 19 countries, all of which were inspired in one way or another by Kriyananda. \n\nKriyananda stated that at Yogananda's request he devoted his life to teaching. Over the course of sixty years, he lectured on four continents in five languages. He gave thousands of lectures and continued lecturing in Asia, Europe, and America until his death.\n\nKriyananda met a number of well-known spiritual teachers: Anandamayi Ma; Sivananda Saraswati and his disciples Chidananda and Satchidananda; Muktananda; Satya Sai Baba; Neem Karoli Baba; the 14th Dalai Lama; A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada; Ravi Shankar; Vicka Ivankovic, visionary of Medjugorje; and a few others.\n\nIn the early 1960s, one of Kriyananda's inter-religious projects near New Delhi, India, received personal support from India's Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. He also had personal contact with Indira Gandhi; with India's Vice President Radhakrishnan; and, in 2006, with India's President, Abdul Kalam.\n\nIn following his guru's guidance that his task would be \"writing, editing, and lecturing\", Kriyananda wrote about 150 books, each of which he stated was intended to help individuals expand their awareness. By the application of Yogananda's teachings, they expand on such varied topics as marriage, education, leadership and success, spiritual communities, yoga, self-healing, art, architecture, astrology, and philosophy, as well as Yogananda's teachings on the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and other scriptures.\n\nOne of Kriyananda's books is \"The Path\" (revised as \"The New Path\" in 2009), which among other things contains details of the three and a half years he spent as Yogananda's direct disciple in Los Angeles. In 2010, \"The New Path\" received the Eric Hoffer Award in the Self-Help section, given with the statement, in part: \"... The author begins with a history of his own life, an outstanding, engrossing narrative rich in vivid detail. An American youth with an early, unrelenting desire to find truth in spiritual experience, he eventually discovers his attraction to Eastern yogic science. A growing fascination and ardor culminate in his becoming a dedicated, chosen disciple of Yogananda.\"\n\nKriyananda started Crystal Clarity Publishers and the East-West book shops in Sacramento and Mountain View, California, and Seattle, Washington.\n\nKriyananda's plays include \"The Peace Treaty\" and \"The Jewel in the Lotus\". He wrote his first play at age fifteen and worked and studied with the Dock Street Theater in Charleston, South Carolina, in his early 20s. Rome's famous Teatro Valle (its oldest still-active theater, built in 1726) hosted \"The Peace Treaty\" in June 2009.\n\nKriyananda won poetry and essay contest prizes at Haverford College and also studied under the poet W.H. Auden at Bryn Mawr College.\n\nIn 1973, Kriyananda developed a system for educating children called Education for Life. Education for Life schools state that they offer character development, strong academics, and development of moral strength. The school curriculum is ecumenical; students from all religious backgrounds may attend. There are schools in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Palo Alto and Nevada City, California (all U.S.A.); in Italy near Assisi; and one was recently (2009) started in Gurgaon, India. Other schools are adopting the curriculum and ideals of Education for Life. Kriyananda's educational ideas also inspired Ananda College, a yoga university as envisioned by Paramahansa Yogānanda, located near Nevada City, California.\n\nKriyananda created Ananda Yoga. Yogananda had asked him often to perform the asanas for visiting guests, in his presence. This inspired him to create Ananda Yoga. It is designed to uplift consciousness, and to prepare the student for meditation. Its distinguishing features are the affirmations associated with postures.\n\nKriyananda took over 15,000 photographs, many of which he said captured the consciousness of human beings behind the image. His photos have been used on inspirational posters, on album covers, for slideshows, in film productions, and in books.\n\nKriyananda created several paintings, which have been used on book covers and on posters.\n\nHe also produced films, as follows:\n\n\nSelf-Realization Fellowship filed suit against James Donald Walters (a.k.a. Kriyananda) and Walters' (then-called) Church of Self-Realization regarding the changing of the name to the Church of Self-Realization and on issues regarding specific writings, photographs and recordings of Paramahansa Yogananda. The litigation lasted for around twelve years (1990–2002). SRF claimed Yogananda wanted SRF to maintain the copyrights to his works and to publish them. SRF also claimed exclusive and sole rights (trademark and service mark) to the names \"Self-Realization Fellowship\", \"Self-Realization Fellowship Church\", and \"Paramahansa Yogananda\", as well as all images of Yogananda and the term \"Self-Realization\".\n\nSRF lost some copyright and trademark claims in the federal court in Sacramento, California, but prevailed on its claim that Yogananda repeatedly stated his intentions for SRF to maintain copyrights to his works and to publish them. Both SRF and Ananda had wins and losses. SRF won the service marks to \"Self-Realization Fellowship\" and \"Self-Realization Fellowship Church\". SRF lost its service marks to the names \"Paramahansa Yogananda\" and \"Self-realization\", its claim of Unfair Competition, and its claim to own copyrights on ten photos of Yogananda. Ananda submitted the following counterclaim and lost all four claims: (1) Violation of the Sherman Act, (2) Libel, (3) Slander, and (4) Unfair Business Practices. In 1992, the court dismissed the second and third counterclaims on 1st Amendment grounds, and Ananda subsequently withdrew the other two counterclaims.\n\nAt the jury trial in 2002, SRF won the claim that Ananda violated SRF's copyrights to magazine articles written by Yogananda. Another issue on which the jury found in SRF's favor was its claim that Ananda violated SRF copyrights to recordings of Yogananda's voice. In mid-litigation, Ananda began publication of Yogananda's first, 1946 edition of \"Autobiography of a Yogi\".\n\nIn 2002, the long litigation was completed with a jury verdict. As reported in \"The Union\", a newspaper located in Grass Valley, California, on October 30, 2002:\n\nIn 1997–98, Anne-Marie Bertolucci, a former resident of Ananda, filed suit against Ananda, Ananda minister Danny Levin, and J. Donald Walters (Kriyananda).\n\nThe jury found the church (Ananda) and Kriyananda liable for \"constructive fraud\", with a finding of \"malice\" and \"fraudulent conduct\". The church, Kriyananda and Levin were found liable for \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" with a finding of \"malice\" and a finding of \"despicable conduct\" against the church. The church was found liable for \"negligent supervision\" of Kriyananda, with a finding of \"malice and fraud\" on the part of the church.\n\nKriyananda was judged to have misrepresented himself as a monk and to have caused emotional trauma, and was ordered to pay $685,000 in compensatory damages, and another $1 million in punitive damages. The jury also found that Levin had made \"unwelcome sexual advances\". The punitive damages were reduced by $400,000 on appeal. The Ananda Church responded to the million-plus-dollar judgment by filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. That allowed Ananda to settle the lawsuit by paying $1.8 million to Bertolucci and her attorneys. They presented, according to Kriyananda, \"lies and complete distortions of the truth.\" Ananda hired a private investigator who was caught rummaging in the trash of opposing counsel. The judge's sanctions of Ananda included disallowing the questioning of the women alleging sexual misconduct.\n\nIn March 2004, Italian authorities raided the Ananda colony in Assisi, responding to allegations of a former resident who accused Ananda Assisi of fraud, usury and labor law violations. Nine residents were detained for questioning. They also had a warrant for Kriyananda's detention, but he was in India. A seven-year-long investigation followed. In March 2009, the judge ruled that the case was \"non luogo a procedere perché il fatto non sussiste\" (not to be continued as the matter is without substance).\n\nKriyananda married in 1981, and publicly renounced his monastic vows in the Shankaracharya order on the occasion of his second marriage in 1985 and returned to using his birth name, James Donald Walters. He was later divorced. In 1995, on his own, he resumed his monastic name and vows.\n\nFrom 1996, as Kriyananda, he lived and taught for seven years at the Ananda Italy center, near Assisi.\n\nIn 2003, he moved to India, where he began an Ananda center in Gurgaon, near Delhi. For five years (until May 1, 2009) he appeared on Sadhna TV and Aastha TV, television channels that were broadcast throughout India, Asia, Europe, and the United States. Since his 2003 move to India, Ananda teachers have been giving classes on meditation and Kriyā Yoga in many major Indian cities. In 2009, at age 83, he moved to Pune to start a new community.\n\nIn 2009, he established a new swami order, different from Yogananda's lineage in the Giri branch of the Swami Order of Shankara. According to Kriyananda, he believed that in this new age (Kali Yuga) not all old patterns remained valid, some reformation was necessary. Some of the features of the newly formed Nayaswami order are: (1) Nayaswamis can be single or married. (2) They can be freely creative, if the purpose is to serve others. (3) A new Nayaswami is named not by one Nayaswami (which had been the tradition), but by three. (4) A Nayaswami of this new order is called \"Nayaswami\", with \"naya\" meaning \"new\". Hence, he initiated himself and gave himself the title Nayaswami.\n\nOn April 21, 2013, he died in his home in Assisi. His remains were brought back to Ananda Village in May 2013.\n\n"}

Abstaining from Kutha meat is one of the requirements for a Sikh to be an initiated Khalsa or Sahajdhari according to the code of conduct (\"Rehat Maryada\") of Sikhism.\n\nBoth the Hindu and the Sikh communities view slow methods of killing animals negatively and forbid adherents from consuming such meat. The objection to Kutha meat has been the belief that the slow death by bleeding the animal is an inhumane way of killing animals to prepare meat. The Sikh tradition recommends the \"jhatka\" method instead, where the animal is killed in a single strike.\n\nKutha meat is any meat produced by slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals. For a Khalsa (baptised Sikh), eating Kutha meat is considered sinful. These four sins are part of the Sikh Code of Conduct (\"Sikh Rehat Maryada\"). These four transgressions (taboo practices) must be avoided:\n\nAccording to Singha, the \"Kutha\" meat is forbidden in Sikhism as one of the \"kurahits\", though there is no clarity on encouraging or discouraging meat consumption in general. The rejection of \"Kutha\" meat was initiated by Sikh Gurus:\n\nWhile \"jhatka\" meat is acceptable in Sikhism, not all sources of meat is acceptable. According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, the cow, the buffalo and the ox are an integral part of rural Sikh livelihoods, and these are never slaughtered for consumption by any method, treated with respect and beef is strictly avoided.\n\n\n"}

In this article, it means any building that was built for the primary purpose of weekly public Christian worship. The list does include at least one building—the Hagia Sophia—that was originally a church but later became a mosque and is now a museum. The list does not include some buildings from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Two of their buildings are significantly larger than any buildings on the list - the Conference Center in Salt Lake City is 130,000 square meters and the Salt Lake Temple is over 23,500 square meters. However neither of those buildings are used for public worship weekly. They also have scores of other temples that are large enough to be included, but are similarly not used for public worship, which are found at List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nWhilst claims are made about the relative size of churches many of these claims are not easily substantiated. \"Largest\" is at best a vague term, which is often not qualified by claimants. Accepted measures of largeness could include area, volume, length, width, height, and/or capacity, although the last is far more subjective. It is important to note therefore that churches may claim to be \"the largest\" based on only one of these measurements; and thus that there may be several churches that have claims to be \"the largest church\". Since there is no official body governing these claims, there is no generally accepted criterion for being \"the largest church\".\n\nThe list below attempts to rank churches by different (more-or-less) objective criteria, and thus may generate different orders depending on the measure used. Churches for which claims are made but dimensions cannot be found are not included on the below lists.\n\nFor length, width and height, there is usually a definitive statistic for each church, which can easily be compared. However, for area and volume, the situation is often more complex. It is often possible to find multiple values quoted for the area/volume of a church in references. Many values appear to be estimates or approximations (especially for volume), or may have been calculated by multiplying lengths, widths and heights. In the latter case, the exact dimensions used (internal vs. external, etc.) may give very different figures. Therefore, although area and volume are the most common 'largeness' measures, they are also apt to be the least reliable. This should be borne in mind when comparing church sizes.\n\n"}
{"id": "157531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157531", "title": "Maiden Castle, Dorset", "text": "Maiden Castle, Dorset\n\nMaiden Castle is an Iron Age hill fort south west of Dorchester, in the English county of Dorset. Hill forts were fortified hill-top settlements constructed across Britain during the Iron Age.\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the site consists of a Neolithic causewayed enclosure and bank barrow. In about 1800 BC, during the Bronze Age, the site was used for growing crops before being abandoned. Maiden Castle itself was built in about 600 BC; the early phase was a simple and unremarkable site, similar to many other hill forts in Britain and covering . Around 450 BC it was greatly expanded and the enclosed area nearly tripled in size to , making it the largest hill fort in Britain and, by some definitions, the largest in Europe. At the same time, Maiden Castle's defences were made more complex with the addition of further ramparts and ditches. Around 100 BC, habitation at the hill fort went into decline and became concentrated at the eastern end of the site. It was occupied until at least the Roman period, by which time it was in the territory of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe.\n\nAfter the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, Maiden Castle appears to have been abandoned, although the Romans may have had a military presence on the site. In the late 4th century AD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th century AD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.\n\nMaiden Castle has provided inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations were carried out under Niall Sharples, which added to an understanding of the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.\n\nBefore the hill fort was built, a Neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site. Dating from around 4000 BC, it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches, It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps. These gaps, and the bank being only high, indicate the site would not have been defensive. Instead the ditches may have been symbolic, separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside. Archaeologist Niall Sharples, who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s, has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure's position. Situated on the side of the hill, it would have been visible from several miles away, and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside. The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming. The site does not appear to have been inhabited, although a grave containing the remains of two children, aged 6–7, has been discovered. The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site.\n\nThe purpose of Neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear, and they probably had a variety of functions. In addition to the burials, which indicate the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west was found here, indicating that the site was a meeting place that attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end.\n\nWithin a period of about 50 years, a bank barrow was built over the enclosure. It was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side; the parallel ditches were apart. Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased, but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials, scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker. This would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 years after the bank barrow's construction. Around 1,800 BC, during the early Bronze Age, the hill was cleared and used to grow crops, but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned. This period of abandonment lasted until the Iron Age, when the hill fort was built. The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound, and throughout this period construction over it was avoided.\n\nHill forts developed in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture. \n\nSince the 1960s, the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze. As a result, trading patterns shifted, and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. \n\nArchaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that \n\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\".\n\nThere are around 31 hill forts in Dorset; archaeologist Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.\n\nConstructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 BC, the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch. The hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the South Winterborne valley, which feeds the River Frome. At the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level, the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge. The highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill, which is only higher. The hill projects about above the surrounding countryside, which is about above sea level. The defences were high and consisted of the V-shaped ditch and a rampart. The rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances. Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors. The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east. The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles. The reason for a double entrance is unclear; however, archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation. It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances.\n\nThe defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion; the ditch was deepened by . The spoil from re-digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart. At the same time, the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex. A bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances, and a bank was erected between them. The bank had a wall faced with limestone, which was brought from more than away. Sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement's high status. The Early Iron Age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site. However, nearby Poundbury and Chalbury date to the same period, so through comparison it is possible to infer the Early Iron Age activity at Maiden Castle. From parallels at these sites, Sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied, with separate areas for habitation and storage. Not much is known about the material culture and economy of the Early Iron Age, and the paucity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site.\n\nIn the Early Iron Age, Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional; it was one of over 100 hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. In the Middle Iron Age, Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is, by some definitions, the largest in western Europe. In about 450 BC, Maiden Castle was expanded from . The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch, with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow. The hill fort's expansion was not unique; it was one of a series of \"developed hill forts\" in southern England. As some hill forts were expanded, many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use, as was the case in Dorset. The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart. This, and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built, indicates that these developed hill forts were important. The developed hill forts of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart, with roughly equal access to resources such as water.\n\nThe emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex. The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade. This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the technical term for which is \"multivallate\") were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority. Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated. While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal. Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.\nMaiden Castle expanded westwards, and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On the south of the fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill, the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.\n\nThe four-post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle. Their purpose on this site is uncertain however, since at square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings; as a result, it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries. The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area's food supply. Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the site's reconstruction in the 5th century BC; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence. It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete. Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in roundhouses. The later houses appear to be organised in rows, and to be roughly similar in size, a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society.\n\nBronze objects such as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this demonstrates long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, there is evidence of it being reworked. Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production. Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally – within about  – however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around Poole Harbour, more than away. This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities. Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage, Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as \"town-like settlements\", a form of proto-urbanism.\n\nAcross Britain, many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 years around the turn of the millennium. It has been suggested that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.\n\nAround 100 BC, Maiden Castle's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort. Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery. On the industrial site, more than of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around of iron. The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the Weald, south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.\n\nThere is little evidence for burial in the Iron Age until late on in the period, and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by excarnation. Wheeler's excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52 burials, but only part of the cemetery was investigated, so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure. One area of the cemetery featured burials of 14 people who had died in violent circumstances, including one body with a Roman catapult bolt in its back. Wheeler used the \"war cemetery\", as he described it, as evidence of a Roman attack on Maiden Castle.\n\nIn AD 43, the Roman conquest of Britain began. Vespasian's subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the Atrebates, Dumnonii, and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD 43–47. Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces. He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site, butchering men, women, and children, before setting fire to the site and slighting its defences. However, there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events, or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans. Although there is a layer of charcoal, it is associated with the iron works, and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort. Although 14 bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death, there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle. \n\nThe eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of Vespasian's campaign in the region; there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset, Hembury in Devon, and Hodd Hill in Dorset.\n\nMaiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century, a time when \"Durnovaria\" (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the \"civitas\", or regional capital, of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England. However, in July 2015 archaeologists from Bournemouth University discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of Duropolis and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site. According to the ancient geographer Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century AD, \"Dunium\" was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although \"Dunium\" has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for \"Dunium\". \"Dunium\" may have derived from British \"duno-\" which meant \"a fort\". Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort. The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring square, was surrounded by a passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a circular building that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort's eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.\n\nThe 4th-century temple gradually fell into disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture. There is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post-Roman or Anglo Saxon burials, some possibly Christian, but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a barn was built over the \"war cemetery\". The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century, as demonstrated by traces of ridge and furrow caused by ploughing.\n\nThe modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as \"Mayden Castell\"; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and is widely taken to mean a \"fortification that looks impregnable\" or one that has never been taken in battle. Alternatively, the name may derive from the Brittonic \"mai-dun\", meaning a \"great hill\". A more recent explanation has been advanced by Richard Coates suggesting that the name is only of medieval origin, and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of identically named locations around the country.\n\nOver the following centuries, the site was abandoned completely and became open pasture, although it was of interest to antiquarians. Thomas Hardy, who built his house within sight of it, described the castle in a short story, \"Ancient Earthworks and What Two Enthusiastic Scientists Found Therein\" (1885) about a local antiquarian who spent much time investigating the site. In 1921, composer John Ireland wrote \"Mai-Dun\", a symphonic rhapsody, about the hill fort in Dorset. John Cowper Powys wrote a novel titled \"Maiden Castle\" in 1936, which was set in Dorset.\n\nThe first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of Augustus Pitt-Rivers, but it was not until the 1930s that Maiden Castle was methodically investigated, the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort. Between 1934 and 1937, Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler excavated both the interior and the defences, work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public. Wheeler's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in Maiden Castle becoming well known. It was one of about 80 hill forts to have been excavated by 1940, in a period known as \"hill fort mania\" during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort's deteriorating condition, partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site. Under the auspices of English Heritage, repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently. Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler, allowing the site to be dated. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1981, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change; it is now maintained by English Heritage. With parking facilities and information boards for visitors, Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round. Today, the site is in the civil parish of Winterborne Monkton at .\n\nin 1921, the English composer John Ireland (18791962) wrote the tone poem \"Mai-Dun, A Symphonic Rhapsody\" about the place, adopting Hardy's name for it. In 1931, Ireland arranged his piece for piano four hands.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56781957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56781957", "title": "Mesopotamian myths", "text": "Mesopotamian myths\n\nMesopotamian mythology refers to the myths, religious texts, and other literature that comes from the region of ancient Mesopotamia in modern-day West Asia. In particular the societies of Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria, all of which existed shortly after 3000 BCE and were mostly gone by 400 CE. These works were primarily preserved on stone or clay tablets and were written in cuneiform by scribes. Several lengthy pieces have survived, some of which are considered the oldest stories in the world, and have given historians insight into Mesopotamian ideology and cosmology.\n\nThere are many different accounts of the creation of the earth from the Mesopotamian region. This is because of the many different cultures in the area and the shifts in narratives that are common in ancient cultures due to their reliance on word of mouth to transmit stories. These myths can share related themes, but the chronology of events vary based on when or where the story was written down.\n\n\"See main article: Atra-Hasis\"\n\nAtra-Hasis refers both to one of the Mesopotamian myths focusing on the earth’s creation, and also the main character of that myth. The myth possibly has Assyrian roots, as a fragmented version may have been found in the library of Ashusbanipal, though translations remain unsure. Its most complete surviving version was recorded in Akkadian. The myth begins with humans being created by the mother goddess Mami to lighten the gods' workload. She made them out of a mixture of clay, flesh, and blood from a slain god. Later in the story though, the god Enlil attempts to control overpopulation of humans through various methods, including famine, drought, and finally, a great flood. Humankind is saved by Atrahasis, who was warned of the flood by the god Enki and built a boat to escape the waters, eventually placating the gods with sacrifices.\n\n\"See main article: Sumerian Creation Myth\"\n\nEridu Gensis has a similar plot to that of the Akkadian myth, Atra-Hasis, though it is harder to tell what happens exactly in Eridu Gensis because the tablet upon which it was recorded is badly damaged. The two stories share the flood as the major event however, although the hero who survives in Eridu Gensis is called Zi-ud-sura instead of Artahasis. Eridu Gensis was recorded around the same time as Atra-Hasis, however the fragmented tablet that held it was found in Nippur, located in modern-day east Iraq, while the version of Atra-hasis that came from the same time was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in modern-day north Iraq.\n\n\"See main article: Enuma Elis\"\n\nEnuma Elis (also spelled Enuma Elish) is a Babylonian creation myth with an unclear composition, though it possibly dates back to the Bronze Age. This piece was thought to be recited in a ritual celebration of the Babylonian new year. It chronicles the birth of the gods, the world, and man, whose purpose was to serve the gods and lighten their work load. The focus of the narrative is on praising Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, who creates the world, the calendar, and humanity.\n\nThese stories tended to focus on a great hero, following their journey through trials or simply important events in their life. Stories like these can be found in many different cultures around the world, and often give insight into the values of those societies. For example, in a culture that celebrated a hero that was devout to the gods or respecting their father, it can be inferred that the society valued those traits.\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the most well known Mesopotamian myths, and is often regarded as the oldest known piece of literature in the world. It was initially a number of individual short stories, and was not combined into one cohesive epic until the 18th century. The story follows the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, typically regarded as a historical figure, and his good friend, Enkidu through various adventures and quests that eventually lead to Enkidu's death. The second half of the epic deal with Gilgamesh, distressed about the death of his friend and his own impending mortality, as he searches for immortality. In the end he fails, but he comes to terms with the fact that he is eventually going to die and returns to his city of Uruk a wiser king.\n\nThe earliest record of myth of Adapa is from the 14th century. Adapa was a Sumerian citizen who was blessed by the god Enki with immeasurable intelligence. However, one day Adapa was knocked into the sea by the south wind, and in a rage he broke the south wind’s wings so that it could no longer blow. Adapa was summoned to be judged by An, and before he left Enki warned him not to eat or drink anything offered to him. However, An had a change of heart when he realized just how smart Adapa was, and offered him the food of immortality, which Adapa, dutiful to Enki, turned down. This story is used as an explanation for humankind’s mortality, it is associated with the fall of man narrative that is also present in Christianity.\n\nImmortality is a constant goal of the characters in Mesopotamian epics. No matter the version of the story, the man who survives the flood, whether Atrahasis, Zi-ud-sura, or Utnapishtim, is granted immortality by the gods. This character then makes a reappearance in the Epic of Gilgamesh, when Gilgamesh is searching for immortality after coming to fear death and the underworld after hearing stories from his friend, Enkidu, about what awaits humanity after death. Enkidu says:On entering the House of Dust, everywhere I looked there were royal crowns gathered in heaps, everywhere I listened, it was the bearers of crowns, who, in the past, had ruled the land,but who now served Anu and Enlil cooked meats,served confections, and poured cool water from waterskins.Upon hearing that his position in life did not matter in the underworld, Gilgamesh is terrified and seeks out Utnapishtim, who has achieved immortality after surviving the flood sent by the gods to wipe out humanity. Immortality is also touched on in the myth of Adapa. Adapa’s accidental refusal to eat the food of immortality offered to him by the gods is used as an explanation for the fact that humans die.\n\nAlso common in Mesopotamian myths is the reoccurring concept that humanity’s purpose is to serve the gods. In all of the creation myths, humans are only made by the gods in order to help in the fields or offer sacrifices. When they get too be too numerous, loud, or otherwise bothersome, the gods attempt to control the population through plagues, droughts, and most famously, the great flood. This disregard for human life emphasizes the hierarchy that existed in the Mesopotamian consciousness, with humans existing as subjects to the will of the gods.\n\nModern understanding of Mesopotamian mythology has been provided through archeological excavations of West Asia and the recovery of many stone and clay tablets, some of which contained the records of many myths. There have been different versions of each myth found in various locations across the region, with inconsistencies between each but maintaining overall common themes and narratives. These versions were written in different languages, including Akkadian, Sumerian, and Old Babylonian, and were often translated from one to another, leading to further inconsistencies due to the inherently imperfect nature of these translations.\n"}
{"id": "20700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20700", "title": "Mordecai Kaplan", "text": "Mordecai Kaplan\n\nMordecai Menahem Kaplan (June 11, 1881 – November 8, 1983), was a rabbi, essayist and Jewish educator and the co-founder of Reconstructionist Judaism along with his son-in-law Ira Eisenstein.\n\nKaplan was born in Švenčionys, Lithuania, to Rabbi Israel and Haya (Anna) Kaplan. In 1889, he emigrated to the United States with his mother and sisters to join his father in New York City who was working with the Chief Rabbi Jacob Joseph. He attended Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Manhattan for a short period. In 1895 Kaplan attended the City College of New York. From 1893 to 1902 he also studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. After graduating from CCNY in 1900 he went to Columbia University studying philosophy, sociology and education receiving a master's degree and a Doctorate. Majoring in philosophy, he wrote his Masters thesis on the ethical philosophy of Henry Sidgwick. His lecturers included the philosopher of ethical culture Felix Adler and the sociologist Franklin Giddings.\n\nIn July 1908 he married Lena Rubin. He received \"semikhah\" from Rabbi Isaac Jacob Reines while on his honeymoon. Kaplan began his career as an Orthodox rabbi at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, a synagogue in New York. In 1912, he was an advisor to the creators of the Young Israel movement of Modern Orthodox Judaism, together with Rabbi Israel Friedlander. He was a leader in creating the Jewish community center concept, and helped found the Society for the Advancement of Judaism.\n\nHe held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in the United States, for his daughter Judith Kaplan, on March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City. Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing.\n\nFrom 1934 until 1970 Kaplan wrote a series of books in which he expressed his Reconstructionist ideology, which centred on the \"concept of Judaism as a civilization\". He was a prolific writer, keeping a journal throughout most of his life.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1958, he married Rivka Rieger, an Israeli artist. \nHe died in New York City in 1983 at the age of 102. He was survived by Rivka and his daughters Dr. Judith Eisenstein (formerly Judith Kaplan), Hadassah Musher, Dr. Naomi Wenner and Selma Jaffe-Goldman.\n\nKaplan began his career as an Orthodox rabbi at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in New York City, assisted in the founding of the Young Israel movement of Modern Orthodox Judaism in 1912, and was the first rabbi hired by the new (Orthodox) Jewish Center in Manhattan when it was founded in 1918. He proved too radical in his religious and political views and resigned from the Jewish Center in 1921. He was the subject of a number of polemical articles published by Rabbi Leo Jung (who became the rabbi of the Jewish Center in 1922) in the Orthodox Jewish press.\n\nHe then became involved in the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, where on March 18, 1922, he held the first public celebration of a Bat Mitzvah in America, for his daughter Judith. This led to considerable criticism of Kaplan in the Orthodox Jewish press.\n\nKaplan's central idea of understanding Judaism as a religious civilization was an easily accepted position within Conservative Judaism, but his naturalistic conception of God was not as acceptable. Even at JTS, as \"The Forward\" writes, \"he was an outsider, and often privately considered leaving the institution. In 1941, the faculty illustrated its distaste with Kaplan by penning a unanimous letter to the professor of homiletics, expressing complete disgust with Kaplan's \"The New Haggadah\" for the Passover Seder. Four years later, seminary professors Alexander Marx, Louis Ginzberg and Saul Lieberman went public with their rebuke by writing a letter to the Hebrew newspaper \"Hadoar\", lambasting Kaplan's prayer book and his entire career as a rabbi.\" In 1945 the Union of Orthodox Rabbis \"formally assembled to excommunicate from Judaism what it deemed to be the community's most heretical voice: Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the man who eventually would become the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. Kaplan, a critic of both Orthodox and Reform Judaism, believed that Jewish practice should be reconciled with modern thought, a philosophy reflected in his \"Sabbath Prayer Book\"...\" Due to Kaplan's evolving position on Jewish theology and the liturgy, he was also condemned as a heretic by members of Young Israel, which he had assisted in founding. His followers attempted to induce him to formally leave Conservative Judaism, but he stayed with JTS until he retired in 1963. Finally, in 1968, his closest disciple and son-in-law Ira Eisenstein founded a separate school, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC), in which Kaplan's philosophy, Reconstructionist Judaism, would be promoted as a separate religious movement.\n\nKaplan wrote a seminal essay \"On the Need for a University of Judaism,\" in which he called for a University setting that could present Judaism as a deep culture and developing civilization. His proposal included programs on dramatic and fine arts to stimulate Jewish artistic creativity, a college to train Jews to live fully in American and Jewish culture as contributing citizens, a school to train Jewish educators, and a rabbinical seminary to train creative and visionary rabbis. In 1947, with the participation of Rabbi Simon Greenberg his efforts toward that end culminated in the establishment of the American Jewish University, then known as the University of Judaism. His vision continues to find expression in the graduate, undergraduate, rabbinical, and continuing education programs of the University.\n\nKaplan's theology held that in light of the advances in philosophy, science, and history, it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's traditional theological claims. Kaplan's naturalistic theology has been seen as a variant of John Dewey's philosophy. Dewey's naturalism combined atheism with religious terminology in order to construct a religiously satisfying philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional religion. Kaplan was also influenced by Émile Durkheim's argument that our experience of the sacred is a function of social solidarity. Matthew Arnold and Hermann Cohen were among his other influences.\n\nIn agreement with prominent medieval Jewish thinkers including Maimonides, Kaplan affirmed that God is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of God are, at best, imperfect metaphors. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that God is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled:\n\nTo believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.\n\nNot all of Kaplan's writings on the subject were consistent; his position evolved somewhat over the years, and two distinct theologies can be discerned with a careful reading. The view more popularly associated with Kaplan is strict naturalism, à la Dewey, which has been criticized as using religious terminology to mask a non-theistic (if not outright atheistic) position. A second strand of Kaplanian theology exists, which makes clear that God has ontological reality, a real and absolute existence independent of human beliefs, while rejecting classical theism and any belief in miracles. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The possible depiction of this species in the 6,000-year-old Selva Pascuala rock art suggests that it might have been used in ancient religious rituals—the oldest evidence of such usage in prehistoric Europe.\nThe species was described by Mexican mycologist Gastón Guzmán in a 2000 publication, based on specimens collected by Ignacio Seral Bozal near Huesca in northern Spain in 1995. \"Psilocybe hispanica\" is classified in the section \"Semilanceata\" of the genus \"Psilocybe\" because of its thick-walled spores and fruit body that bruises blue with handling. The specific epithet \"hispanica\" is Latin for \"Spanish\".\n\nThe cap ranges in shape from somewhat conical to convex, and reaches diameters of . Its surface is smooth, somewhat sticky to dry, and brown to brownish-yellow. The gills are somewhat adnate, and brown-violaceous with whitish edges. The stem is long by thick, cylindrical, and slightly bulbous at the base. It is whitish-yellow, with vinaceous or blue-green to blackish tones towards the base. Mature specimens do not have a veil on the stem. The flesh is whitish, but like most psilocybin-containing species, stains blue when injured.\n\nThe spores are ellipsoid and measure 12–14.5 by 6.5–8 μm. They have a brownish-yellow wall greater than 1 μm thick and a broad apical germ pore with an acute hilar appendix at the base (a region where the spore was once attached to the sterigma). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32–44 by 8–12 μm. The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130–150 μm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1.5–4 μm broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5–8 μm broad, with a brownish incrusting pigment. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.\n\n\"Psilocybe semilanceata\" is roughly similar in appearance to \"P. hispanica\", but may distinguished by its mycenoid (\"Mycena\"-like) appearance and acute umbonate cap. Although the grassland habitat of the two species is similar, \"P. semilanceata\" does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots. \"P. fimetaria\" also resembles \"P. hispanica\", but it also has a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, \"P. fimetaria\" has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20–32 by 4–8 μm. \"P. hispanica\" differs from \"P. liniformans\" var. \"liniformans\" in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. \"P. liniformans\" var. \"americana\" has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9 μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. \"Deconica coprophila\" (formerly known as \"Psilocybe coprophila\") is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.\n\n\"Psilocybe hispanica\" is a coprophilous fungus (dung-loving), and produces fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in dense groups on horse dung; sometimes more than 25 fruit bodies can arise from the same dung. In Guzmán's original report, they were found in a Pyrenean meadow in Aragon, at an elevation of . In 2003, the species was reported from Tramacastillo de Tena, a small village in the Pyrenees; it was also reported to have \"penetrated the French part of the Pyrenees\". Within its restricted range, the mushroom is \"very common\" at altitudes of .\n\nThe mushroom is consumed recreationally by Spanish youths for its mind-altering effects; other mushrooms used recreationally in Spain include \"P. semilanceata\" and \"P. gallaeciae\". Guzmán and Castro report that a 17th-century medallion found in Tena Valley in the southern Pyrenees had images of a devil and mushrooms carved on it. The mushrooms—possibly either \"P. semilanceata\" or \"P. hispanica\", according to Guzmán and Castro—were used in witchcraft, a common practice in the valley during the Middle Ages.\n\nIt has been argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo offers evidence that \"P. hispanica\" was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago. The rock shelter at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which previously had been described as \"mushrooms\", matched the general morphology of \"P. hispanica\": the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic \"P. hispanica\". Although the hallucinogenic species \"P. semilanceata\" is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely papillate) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi. The only older example is from Tassili n'Ajjer, in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria. In 1992, the Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms, later tentatively identified as \"Psilocybe mairei\", a species known from Algeria and Morocco.\n\n\n"}

Goddesses known to have been referred to by the title include Inanna, Anat, Isis, Astarte, and possibly Asherah (by the prophet Jeremiah). In Greco-Roman times Hera, and her Roman aspect Juno bore this title. Forms and content of worship varied. In modern times, the title \"Queen of Heaven\" is still used by contemporary pagans to refer to the Great Goddess, while Catholics, Orthodox, and some Anglican Christians now apply the ancient title to Mary, the mother of Jesus.\n\nInanna was the Sumerian goddess of love and war. Despite her association with mating and fertility of humans and animals, Inanna was not a mother goddess, and is rarely associated with childbirth. Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet Venus.\n\nAlthough the title of Queen of Heaven was often applied to many different goddesses throughout antiquity, Inanna is the one to whom the title is given the most number of times. In fact, Inanna's name is commonly derived from \"Nin-anna\" which literally means \"Queen of Heaven\" in ancient Sumerian (It comes from the words NIN meaning \"lady\" and AN meaning \"sky\"), although the cuneiform sign for her name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 𒈹) is not historically a ligature of the two.\nIn several myths, Inanna is described as being the daughter of Nanna, the ancient Sumerian god of the Moon. In other texts, however, she is often described as being the daughter of either Enki or An. These difficulties have led some early Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have been originally a Proto-Euphratean goddess, possibly related to the Hurrian mother goddess Hannahannah, accepted only latterly into the Sumerian pantheon, an idea supported by her youthfulness, and that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she at first had no sphere of responsibilities.\nThe view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists. In Sumer Inanna was hailed as \"Queen of Heaven\" in the third millennium BC. In Akkad to the north, she was worshipped later as Ishtar. In the Sumerian \"Descent of Inanna\", when Inanna is challenged at the outermost gates of the underworld, she replies:\n\nHer cult was deeply embedded in Mesopotamia and among the Canaanites to the west. F. F. Bruce describes a transformation from a Venus as a male deity to Ishtar, a female goddess by the Akkadians. He links Ishtar, Tammuz, Innini, Ma (Cappadocia), Mami, Dingir-Mah, Cybele, Agdistis, Pessinuntica and the Idaean Mother to the cult of a great\nMother-goddess.\n\nThe goddess, the Queen of Heaven, whose worship Jeremiah so vehemently opposed, may have been possibly Astarte.\nAstarte is the name of a goddess as known from Northwestern Semitic regions, cognate in name, origin and functions with the goddess Ishtar in Mesopotamian texts. Another transliteration is \"‘Ashtart\"; other names for the goddess include Hebrew עשתרת (transliterated \"Ashtoreth\"), Ugaritic \"‘ṯtrt\" (also \"‘Aṯtart\" or \"‘Athtart\"), Akkadian \"As-tar-tú\" (also \"Astartu\") and Etruscan \"Uni-Astre\" (Pyrgi Tablets).\nAccording to scholar Mark S. Smith, Astarte may be the Iron Age (after 1200 BC) incarnation of the Bronze Age (to 1200 BC) Asherah.\n\nAstarte was connected with fertility, sexuality, and war. Her symbols were the lion, the horse, the sphinx, the dove, and a star within a circle indicating the planet Venus. Pictorial representations often show her naked. Astarte was accepted by the Greeks under the name of Aphrodite. The island of Cyprus, one of Astarte's greatest faith centers, supplied the name Cypris as Aphrodite's most common byname. Asherah was worshipped in ancient Israel as the consort of El and in Judah as the consort of Yahweh and Queen of Heaven (the Hebrews baked small cakes for her festival):\n\nWorship of a \"Queen of Heaven\" (Hebrew מלכת השמים, \"Malkath haShamayim\") is recorded in the Book of Jeremiah, in the context of the Prophet condemning such religious worship as blasphemy and a violation of the teachings of the God of Israel. In Jeremiah 7:18:\n\nIn Jeremiah 44:15-18:\nThere was a temple of Yahweh in Egypt at that time, the 6th-7th centuries BC, that was central to the Jewish community at Elephantine in which Yahweh was worshipped in conjunction with the goddess Anath (also named in the temple papyri as Anath-Bethel and Anath-Iahu).\n\nThe goddesses Asherah, Anath and Astarte first appear as distinct and separate deities in the tablets discovered in the ruins of the library of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria). Some biblical scholars tend to regard these goddesses as one, especially under the title \"Queen of heaven\".\n\nJohn Day states that \"there is nothing in first-millennium BC texts that singles out Asherah as 'Queen of Heaven' or associates her particularly with the heavens at all.\" F. F. Bruce, an evangelical (Biblical) scholar differentiates between Astarte and Asherah as two distinct feminine deities.\n\nIsis was venerated first in Egypt. As per the Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, Isis was the only goddess worshiped by all Egyptians alike, and whose influence was so widespread by that point, that she had become completely syncretic with the Greek goddess Demeter. It is after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, that she eventually became known as 'Queen of Heaven'.\nLucius Apuleius confirms this in Book 11, Chap 47 of his novel, \"The Golden Ass\", in which his character prays to the \"Queen of Heaven\". The goddess herself responds to his prayer, delivering a lengthy monologue in which she explicitly identifies herself as both the Queen of Heaven and Isis. \n\nThen with a weeping countenance, I made this orison to the puissant Goddess, saying: O blessed Queen of Heaven...\nThus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile Arabia, disdained not with her divine voice to utter these words unto me: Behold Lucius I am come, thy weeping and prayers has moved me to succor thee. I am she that is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of Heaven... and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis.\n"}

The category \"other\" includes 29,026 Rastas, an estimated 5,000 Muslims, 3,000 Buddhists 1,453 Hindus, and approximately 200 Jews. The census reported 21% who claimed no religious affiliation. The largest religion indigenous to Jamaica is Rastafari.\n\n62% of the Jamaican population are Protestants. Jamaican Protestantism is composed of several denominations: 24% Church of God, 11% Seventh-day Adventist, 10% Pentecostal, 7% Baptist, 4% Anglican, 2% United Church, 2% Methodist, 1% Moravian and 1% Brethren Christian.\n\nThe Church of God has 111 congregations in six regions:\n\nThere are about 50,000 (2%) Catholics in Jamaica, which is divided into three dioceses, including one archdiocese:\n\nThe Missionaries of the Poor monastic order originated in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reports 5,891 members living in Jamaica.

Its adherents worship Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia (ruled 1930–1974), as God incarnate, the Second Advent of Jesus Christ or as Christ in his Kingly Character, depending on their views on the Emperor. The 2001 census counted 29,026 Rastafari.\n\nOther popular religions in Jamaica include Islam, Bahá'í Faith with perhaps 8000 Bahá'ís and 21 Local Spiritual Assemblies, Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism. There is also a small population of around 200 Jews forming the Shaare Shalom Synagogue in Kingston, who describe themselves as Liberal-Conservative. The first Jews in Jamaica trace their roots back to early 15th-century Spain and Portugal. There are an estimated 5,000 Muslims in Jamaica.\n\nJamaica's constitution provides for freedom of religion, and its laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The government generally respects religious freedom in practice. In 2008, the U.S. government learned of no reports of societal abuses or discrimination in Jamaica based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.\n"}

Section 29 is not the source of these rights but instead reaffirms the pre-existing special rights belonging to Roman Catholics and Protestants, despite freedom of religion and religious equality under sections 2 and 15 of the \"Charter\". Such rights may include financial support from the provincial governments. In the case \"Mahe v. Alberta\" (1990), the Supreme Court of Canada also had to reconcile denominational school rights with minority language educational rights under section 23 of the \"Charter\".\n\nThe section reads:\n\nThe Constitution of Canada contains a number of denominational school rights. They usually belong to Catholics and Protestants wherever they form the minority population of the relevant province. The current Chief Justice of Canada Beverley McLachlin once referred to this as an early form of freedom of religion in Canada.\n\nSection 93 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" awards jurisdiction over education to the provincial governments, with a few exceptions. Catholics have denominational school rights in Ontario. Both Catholics and Protestants had these rights in Quebec, until abrogated by the \"Constitution Amendment, 1997 (Québec)\". Quebec was and is predominantly Catholic (though the effects this has had on the province's politics have changed over the years; see Quiet Revolution). Section 17 of the Alberta Act, 1905 also guarantees denominational school rights for Catholics in Alberta. While the rights for Catholics and Protestants seem to contradict \"Charter\" values of equality, section 29 clarifies the privileges cannot be challenged on \"Charter\" grounds. It was inserted because the authors of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\" did not want to be held responsible for challenging the old system.\n\nAs noted in the Supreme Court case \"\"Reference re Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.)\"\" [1987] 1 SCR 1148 (SCC), this clarification is really the only function of section 29. Section 29 does not itself shield the rights of denominational schools from the \"Charter\", since the rights are themselves a part of the Constitution and thus cannot be unconstitutional or subject to \"Charter\" review. This line of thinking was confirmed by the Supreme Court in \"Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)\" (2005).\n\nIn the case \"Adler v. Ontario\" (1996) religious freedoms under sections 2 and 15 of the \"Charter\" were used to argue that lack of government funding for Jewish Canadian schools and certain Christian schools in Ontario was unconstitutional, since by contrast Catholic schools received government money. The majority of the Supreme Court, however, dismissed the argument, noting section 93's importance as an agreement made between the founders of the nation to make Confederation possible. Since it was a political deal and not based upon the principle of freedom, section 2 of the \"Charter\" could not extend section 93 rights to other religions. Moreover, to find that section 2 could extend denominational school rights would contradict the specificity of section 93, and section 29 indicates such a contradiction cannot exist and that denominational schools are not \"Charter\" issues.\n\nIn \"Mahe v. Alberta\", the Court found that minority language rights of French Canadians in Alberta required that the French community be represented on the school board. While this seemed to border on altering denominational school rights and raised section 29 concerns, since the school board in this case was a religious one, the Court justified it since the religious content of the education was unchanged, and the powers of the school board were merely \"regulated\" so that the religious teachings could be provided in French.\n"}
{"id": "6755924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6755924", "title": "Shavei Israel", "text": "Shavei Israel\n\nShavei Israel (, \"Returners of Israel\") is an Israeli-based Jewish organization that encourages people of Jewish descent to strengthen their connection with Israel and the Jewish people. Founded by Michael Freund in 2002, \"Shavei Israel\" locates lost Jews and hidden Jewish communities and assists them with returning to their roots and, sometimes, with aliyah (immigration to Israel). The organization’s team is composed of academics, educators and rabbis.\n\nThe Shavei Israel organization was founded to help people whose ancestors had become separated from Judaism (including alleged descendants of the Lost tribes of Israel, crypto-Jews, hidden Jews, and Jewish forcibly assimilated under Communist rule,) reconnect with the Jewish people, and in the second decade of this century also became active in helping individuals and groups of converts become part of the mainstream Jewish and Israeli communities. Shavei Israel sponsors rabbis and teachers to work with groups of \"lost Jews,\" provide them the Jewish education and assist them in aliyah if they choose. Its affiliated rabbis are posted in Palma de Mallorca, Barcelona, Valencia, Granada, and Sevilla in Spain; Belmonte in northern Portugal, San Nicandro in southern Italy, Brazil, Krakow and Wroclaw in Poland; and in Mizoram and Manipur, in North-East India. In December 2010, Rabbi Shlomo Zelig Avrasin was sent to work with the Subbotnik Jewish communities in Russia, particularly Vysoky.\n\nIn Jerusalem, it operates Machon Miriam, a Spanish-language \"conversion and return institute.\" Dozens of Spanish and Portuguese crypto-Jews graduate from Machon Miriam each year, and undergo formal conversion by Israel's Chief Rabbinate. \n\nAmishav is an organisation distinct from Shavei Israel, which it predates and to whose creation it contributed. It was founded in 1975 by Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail and follows goals similar to those of Shavei Israel. Several years after founding Amishav, Rabbi Avichail stepped aside as leader of the organisation in favour of Michael Freund. Freund went on to found Shavei Israel in 2002.\n\nMichael Freund, founder and director of Shavei Israel, was reared in Mahhattan and immigrated to Israel 1995. In 1996 he became deputy director of communications under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. It was while serving in this post that he first learned of the Bnei Menashe when a letter arrived from the Bnei Menashe community in India beseeching the Prime Minister to enable them to make aliyah. Freund is the largest single funder of Shavei Israel.\n\nThe organization supported the Bnei Menashe of India in being recognized as \"descendants of Israel\" by the Israeli Chief Rabbi in March 2005. Shavei Israel assisted with teachers in India. As of 2013, a total of 2,000 Bnei Menashe have made aliyah. The organization assists immigrants with their integration into Israeli society. \n\nAs part of its educational efforts, the organization has published a series of books on Judaism in a dozen languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Mizo, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and German.\n\nIn March 2005 Rabbi Shlomo Amar announced the recognition of the Bnei Menashe by Israel and their possibility of immigration under the Law of Return. Those who wanted to immigrate were required to undergo a formal, full conversion as their people had been separated from Judaism for so long. In June 2005 the Bnei Menashe completed the construction of a mikvah in Mizoram under the supervision of Israeli rabbis to start the process of conversion to Judaism. \nFreund supported the resettlement of 218 Bnei Menashe in Upper Nazareth and Karmiel in November 2005. A total of 1,700 Bnei Menashe moved to Israel, mainly settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (until the disengagement in 2005).\n\nIn 2013 Freund learned of a large groups of Latin Americans from Christian families who were converting to orthodox Judaism, thousands or tens of thousands of whom wanted to immigrate to Israel. Freund began working with Israeli authorities and with the Latin American converts, and the first, small group of converts moved to Israel in June 2015.\n\nShavei has been criticised for offending followers of non-Orthodox spiritual traditions and favoring Orthodox Israeli Judaism.\n\nThe mass conversion of Mizo-Kuki peoples aroused the concern of the Indian government, as it prohibits proselytizing. In November 2005 Israel recalled the Rabbinic Court teams which had been preparing several hundred Bnei Menashe for conversion to calm the concerns of the Indian government. At the time, some Hindu groups complained that the government had paid more attention to Christian complaints of proselytizing than to their own about Christian missionaries.\n\nAfter suspending the issuance of visas to Bnei Menashe for a few years, in January 2010 the Israeli government announced that the remaining 7,200 Bnei Menashe could make aliyah within a period of 1–2 years after completing conversion at facilities in Nepal. This allowed them to avoid problems with India.\n\n"}
{"id": "2214780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214780", "title": "Suppressive Person", "text": "Suppressive Person\n\nSuppressive Person, often abbreviated SP, is a term used in Scientology to describe the \"antisocial personalities\" who, according to Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard, make up about 2.5% of the population. A statement on a Church of Scientology website describes this group as including notorious historic figures such as Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe term is often applied to those whom the Church perceives as its enemies, such as those whose \"disastrous\" and \"suppressive\" acts are said to impede the progress of individual Scientologists or the Scientology movement.\n\nOne of the reasons Scientology doctrines portray Suppressive Persons as such a danger is that they are supposed to make people around them become Potential Trouble Sources (abbreviated PTS). Scientology defines a PTS as \"a person who is in some way connected to and being adversely affected by a suppressive person. Such a person is called a potential trouble source because he can be a lot of trouble to himself and to others.\" Hubbard suggested that Potential Trouble Sources make up 17.5% of the population.\n\nAs with most Scientology terminology, \"Suppressive Person\" was coined by L. Ron Hubbard. In her book \"Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement\", Ruth A. Tucker wrote that the concept appeared to have first been introduced into Scientology in the 1960s \"as membership grew and as authoritarian control [by Hubbard] increased.\" Tucker notes that many of those who joined Scientology during this period were \"well-educated people who prided themselves in independent thinking [who] struggled with the idea of allowing any other individual to completely dominate their opinions.\" Many of Hubbard's early writings on Suppressive Persons focus on their alleged responsibility for poor management within the Church of Scientology.\n\nThe Church's official glossary defines a Suppressive Person as being:\n\nThe Church regards these \"antisocial personalities\" as being those \"who possess characteristics and mental attitudes that cause them to violently oppose any betterment activity or group,\" This concern with \"groups\" continues in the official \"Scientology Handbook\", which states the corollary: \"The antisocial personality supports only destructive groups.\"\n\nAccording to the Hubbard textbook \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\" (\"the Ethics book\"), when an individual is found to be under the influence of a Suppressive Person, it is believed that this will affect their general well-being. An individual with an SP in their vicinity is likely to be under stress or frequently upset, and this would potentially jeopardize the stability of any treatment or education. Therefore, a parishioner who is found to have such suppressive connections is not permitted to participate in certain Scientology classes and counseling until the situation has been adequately resolved.\n\nThe Ethics book provides a guideline for use in sorting out such a condition. A first step is always to educate the person about the phenomenon of the Suppressive Person and the effects this is believed to have on the individuals close to the SP. Once the education step is completed, the person can further follow the guidelines to sort out the situation so that the parishioner is no longer negatively affected.\n\nScientology Security checks are also common for SP and PTS situations. If reasonable attempts have been made to \"handle\" the situation to no avail, the parishioner may take the option of \"disconnecting\" from the SP. In \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\", \"disconnection\" is defined as a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another. It is a severing of communication by one individual against the other.\n\nThe concept of the Suppressive Person in Scientology has been the source of some controversy, due in some part to aversion to the idea of \"disconnecting\" from close family members and friends.\n\nAnother source of controversy related to the Suppressive Person doctrine is the formal administrative judgment that labels an individual a \"Suppressive Person.\" This is known as an \"SP Declare,\" and has been issued as a \"Flag Ethics Order\" since 1976. This is because presently, an SP Declare needs to be approved by the \"International Justice Chief\" (IJC), who resides at Gold Base, which is not a formal Scientology office and thus not authorized to issue Ethics Orders.\n\nNon-Scientologists can be and have been labelled Suppressive Persons. A Suppressive Person is anyone who has been responsible for \"suppressive acts,\" defined by Hubbard as being \"the overt or covert actions or omissions knowingly and willfully undertaken to suppress, reduce, prevent or destroy case gains, and/or the influence of Scn on activities, and/or the continued Scn success and actions on the part of organizations actions and Scientologists.\" Similarly, entire groups can be declared Suppressive; Suppressive Groups, in Hubbard's view, are \"those which seek to destroy Scn or which specialize in injuring or killing persons or damaging their cases or which advocate suppression of mankind.\" Under this broader definition, suppressiveness included more than just publicly opposing Scientology; it also included any group supporting activities to which Hubbard was strongly opposed, especially psychiatry. Specifically, Hubbard considered reporters and government agents to be members of Suppressive Groups: \"There are no good reporters. There are no good government or SP group agents. The longer you try to be nice, the worse off you will be. And the sooner one learns this, the happier he will be.\"\n\nThe Church of Scientology maintains a central list of ex-members and splinter groups formally declared to be Suppressive. In an executive directive of 1992, the Church's \"International Justice Chief\" lists over 400 groups and over 2,300 individuals considered to be Suppressive. The list includes individual ex-Scientologists and breakaway groups regarded as hostile or heretical, such as Erhard Seminars Training (EST).\n\nIn a lecture he made on 19 July 1966, L. Ron Hubbard expressed concern about the possible abuse of the \"Suppressive Person\" label in respect of those who are otherwise good citizens and contribute to civil society:\n\nSome former Scientologists have alleged that there has indeed been such abuse. For example, Bent Corydon describes seeing Scientology franchise holder Gary Smith declared Suppressive on the spot during the October 1982 Mission Holders' Conference, simply for not obeying a shouted order to change his seat.\nThere are also instances where SP declarations have disrupted families and businesses.\n\nAccording to a 2006 \"St. Petersburg Times\" article entitled \"SP profiles\", one Scientologist found himself declared an SP after he repeatedly challenged the validity of a \"patter drill\" in which he was instructed to read passages of a course to a wall. He insisted the drill was not based on Hubbard teachings and stated that he had been previously threatened with an SP declare after a run-in with a Scientology attorney on an unrelated issue.\n\nThose who communicate with Suppressive Persons can face being branded SPs themselves by Scientology. Associates of the branded SP are ordered to disconnect from that person. Religious scholars have taken a negative view of Scientology's disconnection policies, which includes many who have previously testified on behalf of Scientology. For example, religious scholar J. Gordon Melton stated, \"I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it. The policy hurts everybody.\"\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians.\n\nHe was born on October 19, 1898, on the Otoe-Missouria reservation in Oklahoma Territory. His father, George Washington Dailey, was a member of the Eagle Clan of the Missouria and belonged to a traditionalist group within the combined Otoe-Missouria tribe called the \"Coyote Band.\" As a result, Truman Dailey was well-versed in the traditional lore of his people. Dailey attended Oklahoma A&M College until 1922. While at Oklahoma A&M, Dailey performed in the college band and was made a member of Kappa Kappa Psi band fraternity. In 1928, he married Lavina Koshiway, daughter of Jonathan Koshiway, who was one of the founders of the Native American Church. By 1938, Truman and Lavina were conducting their own church services, where he was considered a Road Man (ceremonial leader). During the next decade Dailey served in administrative offices in the Native American Church of Oklahoma and the newly formed Native American Church of the United States.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Dailey worked at Disneyland as the announcer for the American Indian programs. When Walt Disney hired him, he allowed Dailey to use one of his own Indian names in the show, simply changing it to \"Chief White Horse\". During this time he also appeared on \"The Steve Allen Show\". After leaving California, he and Lavina returned to Oklahoma in 1970, where he taught the Otoe-Missouria language in tribal classes and later served as a consultant for the University of Missouri native language project, in order to record Otoe-Missouria for posterity. Dailey remained a vocal advocate of Native American ceremonial rights. In 1974, he testified in Washington, DC, and in Omaha, NE, regarding the ceremonial use of feathers and other natural objects in opposition to the Migratory Bird Law. Dailey also testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs in 1978 (Senate Joint Resolution 102). The resulting legislation, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, was signed into law by President Carter but was only partially successful, so that in 1992, Dailey, now 93 years of age, was called upon once again to give testimony to the Senate committee. This time the subject was the Native American Church's most notable characteristic, the ceremonial use of peyote. The resulting amendment to the Act legalized the use of peyote for official Native American religious purposes. The following year, the University of Missouri at Columbia awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. Lavina Koshiway Dailey had died in 1988. Truman Dailey died on December 16, 1996, and was buried next to her in the Otoe-Missouria Tribal Cemetery.\n\n"}

{"id": "10254657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10254657", "title": "War in Heaven", "text": "War in Heaven\n\nThe Book of Revelation describes a war in heaven between angels led by the Archangel Michael against those led by \"the dragon\", identified as the devil or Satan, who are defeated and thrown down to the earth. Revelation's war in heaven is related to the idea of fallen angels, and possible parallels have been proposed in the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nThe Christian tradition has stories about angelic beings cast down from heaven by God, often presenting the punishment as inflicted in particular on Satan. As a result of linking this motif with the cited passage of the Book of Revelation, the casting of Satan down from heaven, which other versions of the motif present as an action of God himself, has become attributed to the archangel Michael at the conclusion of a war between two groups of angels, of whom (because of the mention of the dragon's tail casting a third of the stars of heaven to the earth) one third are supposed to have been on the side of Satan, in spite of the fact that the casting down of the stars () is recounted as occurring before the start of the \"war in heaven\" ().\n\nCommentators have attributed Satan's rebellion to a number of motives, all of which stem from his great pride. These motives include:\n\nJonathan Edwards states in his sermon \"Wisdom Displayed in Salvation\": \"Satan and his angels rebelled against God in heaven, and proudly presumed to try their strength with his. And when God, by his almighty power, overcame the strength of Satan, and sent him like lightning from heaven to hell with all his army; Satan still hoped to get the victory by subtlety\".\n\nIn the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1911) article \"St. Michael the Archangel\", Frederick Holweck wrote: \"St. John speaks of the great conflict at the end of time, which reflects also the battle in heaven at the beginning of time.\" He added that Michael's name \"was the war-cry of the good angels in the battle fought in heaven against the enemy and his followers\".\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that Revelation 12 concerns an actual event in the pre-mortal existence of man. The Book of Moses, included in the LDS \"standard works\" canon, references the War in Heaven and Satan's origin as a fallen angel of light. The concept of a war in heaven at the end of time became an addendum to the story of Satan's fall at the genesis of time - a narrative which included Satan and a third of all of heaven's angels. Evidence for this interpretation comes from the phrase \"the dragon and his angels\"; this specific phrasing became paramount to the reinforcement of the notion that people associated angels with the devil preceding the writing of Revelation.\n\nSeveral modern Bible-commentators view the \"war in heaven\" in Revelation 12:7–13 as an eschatological vision of the end of time or as a reference to spiritual warfare within the church, rather than (as in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\") \"the story of the origin of Satan/Lucifer as an angel who rebelled against God in primeval times.\" Some commentators have seen the \"war in heaven\" as \"not literal\" but symbolic of events on earth.\n\nParallels are drawn to the passage in that mentions the \"son of the morning\" that had \"fallen from heaven\" and was \"cast down to the earth\". In verse 12 of this passage, the Hebrew word that referred to the morning star was translated into Latin as Lucifer. With the application to the Devil of the morning star story, \"Lucifer\" was then applied to him as a proper name. The name Lucifer, the Latin name (literally \"Light-Bearer\" or \"Light-Bringer\") for the morning star (the planet Venus in its morning appearances), is often given to the Devil in these stories. The brilliancy of the morning star—which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night—may be what gave rise to myths such as the Babylonian story of Ethana and Zu, who was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods (an image present also in ), but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus. Stars were then regarded as living celestial beings. The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" states that the myth concerning the Morning star was transferred to Satan by the first century before the Common Era, citing in support of this view the \"Life of Adam and Eve\" and the Slavonic Book of Enoch 29:4, 31:4, where Satan-Sataniel is described as having been one of the archangels. Because he contrived \"to make his throne higher than the clouds over the earth and resemble 'My power' on high\", Satan-Sataniel was hurled down, with his angels, and since then he has been flying in the air continually above the abyss. According to Jewish thought, the passage in \"Isaiah\" was used to prophesy the fate of the King of Babylon, who is described as aiming to rival God.\n\nSome scholars discern the concept of a war in heaven in certain Dead Sea Scrolls, namely, the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, also known as the War Scroll (1QM and 4Q491-497), the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, Song 5 (4Q402), and the Melchizedek document (11Q13).\n\nIn the War Scroll, according to Menahem Mansoor, the angels of light, who are identified with Michael, the prince of light, will fight in heaven against the angels of darkness, who are identified with Belial, while the Sons of Light fight the Sons of Darkness on earth, and during the last of the seven battles described in the scroll will come and help the Sons of Light win the final victory.\n\nJames R. Davila speaks of Song 5 of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as describing \"an eschatological war in heaven similar to that found in 11Q13 and to traditions about the archangel Michael in the War Rule and the book of Revelation\". He suggests that Melchizedek, who is mentioned both in the Melchizedek document and the fifth of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, may be a divine warrior who is involved in the conflict with the archangel Michael in the futurist sense.\n\nThat the Melchizedek document (11Q13) concerns a war in heaven is denied by Fred L. Horton, who remarks that \"there is no hint in the extant portion of the 11Q Melchizedek of a revolt of heavenly beings against the heavenly council, and the only dissenting spirit is the traditional Belial\"; the view of Davila, however, is that the document originally was about an eschatological war in heaven, with Melchizedek as angelic high priest and military redeemer.\n\nThe motif of the fall of Satan and his angels can be found in Christian angelology and Christian art, and the concept of fallen angels (who, for rebelling against God, were downgraded and condemned to being earthbound) is widespread.\n\nAnatole France in the 1914 novel \"\" adapted the Christian references to make a parable about revolts and revolutionary movements.\n\nIn Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (1674), the angel Lucifer leads a rebellion against God before the Fall of Man. A third of the angels, including pagan angels such as Moloch and Belial, are hurled by God from Heaven.<ref>\n"}
{"id": "9256811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9256811", "title": "Yatiri", "text": "Yatiri\n\nYatiri are medical practitioners and community healers among the Aymara of Bolivia, Chile and Peru, who use in their practice both symbols and materials such as coca leaves. Yatiri are a special subclass of the more generic category Qulliri, a term used for any traditional healer in Aymara society.\n\nAs a result of current events in Bolivia, Yatiris and anything related to their practices have become quite popular, as a reaction against perceived threats from globalization and Western culture, especially anything related to the USA. El Diario, Bolivian newspaper, mentions offerings made to the Pachamama and other such deities at most contemporary 2007 government events led by President Evo Morales.\n\nAs a result of Spanish colonization and the influence of Western culture, the Yatiri face pressure from the Western notion of individualism, as opposed to the traditional Aymara concept of community. The Christian church has also often ostracised the Yatiri, perceiving their role to be superfluous in modern religious practice, and a form of paganism.\nThis has changed as current government officials openly support Yatiri presence in events that formerly might have had a Catholic chaplain under the terms and practice of the Concordat with the Holy See.\nNevertheless, normal practice for most Andean people mixes practices from both traditions, for example in the \"'cha'lla\", a blessing bestowed on any form of property, often done with both sacrifices to the Pachamama and Catholic prayers.\n\nThe Western educational system has introduced to the Aymara people a strong Western orientation that often alienates younger generations from appreciation of the Yatiri.\n\nWhereas the Aymara perceive 'health' to be a relationship with nature, with members of the community, and with ancestors; and the Yatiri play a vital role in strengthening and repairing these relationships, Western medicine treats health as an isolated problem within an individual and does not have a place for the role of community healers.\n\nSeveral Aymara words and phrases are indispensable for an understanding of the role of Yatiri within the Aymara community. As these concepts are unique to the Aymara setting, there is no adequate English translation.\n\"Qulliri\" are healers associated with medicinal herbs, and require no special initiation to take up their vocation.\n\"Layqa\", traditionally marginalized and shunned, live on the outskirts of Aymara communities and use frogs and snakes in rituals to do harm to others. One becomes a \"layqa\" by agreeing (usually for a price) to do these rituals to harm a person, on behalf of a client.\n\"Rayu\" refers to lightning and its physical manifestations. Those who have been struck by lightning are often called \"rayun purita\" (\"struck by lightning\") or \"purita\" (\"arrived\"). It is these \"purita\" who have been called to become \"yatiri\". In their healing ceremonies, \"yatiri\" interact with (among other things) \"achachilas\" and \"ruwitus\". \"Achachilas\" are ancestors different from biological ancestors, and \"ruwitus\" are human skulls that are considered to be dead elders in either a generational or a cultural sense. \"Ch'amakani\" (\"someone who has or owns the darkness\") is an elder \"yatiri\" who undertakes the training of an apprentice \"yatiri\"-to-be.\n\nOutsiders have often referred to the Yatiri as 'shamans;' however the role of the Yatiri differs markedly from that of the Central Asian shamans. Shamans typically live and practice in isolation, undergo private and individual initiations to their roles, and practice ecstatic techniques in conjunction with their work. They also typically learn to heal by learning to heal themselves after a near-death experience. In contrast, the Yatiri are full members of Aymara communities who participate in the regular lifestyle of the Aymara, and learn their trade from masters. Like shamans, Yatiri can be both female and male.\n\nThe word \"yatiri\" comes from the verb \"yatiña\" 'to know.' Thus a yatiri is literally 'someone who knows.' The thing that distinguishes yatiri from others in the community is that they have been struck by lightning, and have become yatiri. The lightning strike is a sign of having been called, but it does not automatically make one a yatiri. In modern times, because qulliri is a neutral term, not associated by Westerners with sorcery, many yatiri have been called qulliri when outsiders inquire as to their status. Strictly speaking, yatiri \"are\" qulliri, but they are a special class of qulliri who have also experienced the lightning strike and undergone initiation to become yatiri. Yatiri are never called 'yatiri' to their face, but rather are referred to as ak'ulliri \"\"someone who chews coca\", aytiri \"someone who picks up the coca\" or uñiri \"someone who reads coca\".\"\n\nThere are many factors at play in a person's calling to become a yatiri. Who a person will become is affected by the season in which she is born, by her patron saint, and by her ichutata ichumama (a specific kind of godparent). The confirmation of this calling, however, is marked by the lightning strike, which typically happens to an unmarried Aymara out herding the flocks. The lightning strike marks her as purita, \"one who is struck.\" However, occasionally lightning will strike somebody who is not called, making her a pantata \"one who has been struck mistakenly.\" At the lightning strike, the purita is said to have died and passed from death to rebirth; in fact if anyone else witnesses this strike it is believed that the purita will die. If a person has the signs of a yatiri, and has been struck by lightning, she is a purita and cannot refuse the call to become a yatiri. Likewise, a person who does not have the signs and has not been struck, may not seek to become a yatiri. Once a yatiri-to-be has aged a few years, she undertakes a journey to find her ch'amakani, the senior yatiri who will train her. Hilario, the yatiri interviewed by Tomas Huanca in his 1987 thesis traveled three times to his ch'amakani's homeland, each time as a traveling musician, and once there received tutoring from Hilario, his ch'amakani. When the candidate is ready to become a yatiri, she will ask permission of the achachila (spiritual ancestor) through her ch'amakani.\n\nA yatiri is a full participant in the Aymara community; her special role does not relieve her from the social and agricultural duties shared by all community members. She never makes the first move in healing, but always waits for someone who has a complaint or a problem to consult her. Just as she is obliged to wait for requests, the yatiri is likewise obliged to treat all who do come to her. She typically exercises her role at home in the presence of either the patient or someone who is acting on the patient's behalf. Occasionally, the yatiri's ritual helpers will indicate that she must treat the patient in person, or travel to a ritual place in order to give an offering. She will also practice outside her home if the patient requests such. The principal helper in the yatiri's curing ceremony is the riwutu or human skull. Riwutu are ancestors who have been killed, usually by \"robbers,\" and are seen as an intermediary between the world of humans and that of the dead. The riwutu is placed together with saxra bullets (small pieces of metal or stone that have been fused together by lightning), as well as with tari llama wool, coca, and sculptures of the saints. If the yatiri has been asked to discover a lost object or one taken by thieves, she may use candles in her ceremony. If she is to heal somebody ill, she may use a piece of cloth-- isi-- that has touched the patient.\n"}

More than a gender label for all things yogi, \"yogini\" represents both a female master practitioner of yoga and a formal term of respect for female Hindu or Buddhist spiritual teachers in India, Nepal and Tibet.\n\nIn the Hindu tradition, \"yogini\" has referred of women who are part of the Yoga school of Hindu traditions and to the women who were part of the Gorakshanath founded Nath Yogi tradition. A Yogini, in some contexts, refers to the sacred feminine force made incarnate, as an aspect of Parvati, and revered in yogini temples of India as the Eight Matrikas or the Sixty-four Yoginis. \n\nYogini also refers to women who are a part of Hindu and Buddhist tantra traditions. In Tantric Buddhism, Miranda Shaw states that a large number of women like Dombiyogini, Sahajayogicinta, Lakshminkara, Mekhala, Kankhala Gangadhara, Siddharajni, and others, were respected yoginis and advanced seekers on the path to enlightenment.\n\nIn the Tibetan Buddhism and Bön tradition, some ngagmas are comparable, in practice, to the Mahasidda yoginis of Indian Buddhism.\n\nYogini (jogan) is a term that finds reference in ancient and medieval texts in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, typically in the context of and as aspect of Devi. The \"Devi Sukta\" of the Rigveda 10.125.1 through 10.125.8, is among the most studied hymns declaring that the ultimate metaphysical reality (Brahman) is a Devi,\n\nThe Vedas include numerous goddesses including Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, and Mahi among others are mentioned in the \"Rigveda\". However, the women are not discussed as frequently as men. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts, particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Universal Absolute, the Supreme power, Para Brahman.\nThe earliest evidence of Yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Kesin hymn of the Vedas, where these yogins are praised. However, there is no mention that these Vedic era Yogi included women. Scholars note that some ancient Vedic sages (Rishis) were women. A female rishi is known as a \"rishika\".\n\nThe term \"yogini\" has been in use in medieval times to refer to a woman who belongs to the Gorakshanath-founded Nath Yogi tradition. They usually belong to Shaiva tradition, but some Natha belong to the Vaishnava tradition. In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice Yoga and their principal God tends to be \"Nirguna\", that is a God that is without form and semi-monistic, influenced in the medieval era by the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices. Female yoginis were a large part of this tradition, and many 2nd-millennium paintings depict them and their Yoga practices. David Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era tales and stories about Nath yogis continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.\n\nIn medieval mythology such as Kathāsaritsāgara, \"yogini\" is also the name of a class of females with magical powers, fairies who are sorceresses sometimes enumerated as 8, 60, 64 or 65. The \"Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika\" text mentions Yogini.\n\nIn real life, historical evidence on \"Yogini Kaulas\" suggests that yogini tradition in Hinduism, who practiced Yoga philosophy and Tantra, were well established by the 10th century. This development was not limited to Hinduism, and included Yogini in Buddhist tantra traditions.\n\nThere are four major extant shrines of the Sixty-four Yogini (\"Chausathi jogan\"), among other spellings) in India (named for 64 legendary yogini), two in Odisha and two in Madhya Pradesh. One of the most impressive yogini temples in Odisha is the ninth century CE hypaethral Chausathi Jogini Temple located at Hirapur in Khurda district, 15 km south of Bhubaneshwar. Another hypaethral sixty-four yogini temple in Odisha is the Chausathi Yogini Pitha in Ranipur-Jharial, near Titilagarh in Balangir district. Two images of the Sixty-four Yogini are missing from this temple.\n\nTwo notable yogini temples in Madhya Pradesh are the ninth-century Chaunsath Yogini Temple to the southwest of the western group of temples in Khajuraho, near Chhatarpur in Chhatarpur District, and the 10th century CE Chaunsath Yogini Mandir in Bhedaghat, near Jabalpur in Jabalpur district.\n\nThe iconographies of the yogini images in four yogini temples are not uniform. In the Hirapur temple, all yogini images are with their \"vahanas\" (vehicles) and in standing posture. In Ranipur-Jharial temple the yogini images are in dancing posture. In Bhedaghat temple, yogini images are seated in \"Lalitasana\".\n\nThe Sixty-four yogini (Jogan) depicted in the complete Hirapur shrine are:\n\nOften the Matrikas are confused with the legendary yoginis, who may number sixty-four or eighty-one. In Sanskrit literature, the \"yoginis\" have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal yoginis are identified with the Matrikas. Other yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of 64 yogini from eight Matrikas became a tradition. By mid-11th century, the connection between yoginis and Matrikas had become common lore. The mandala (circle) and chakra of yoginis were used alternatively. The 81 yoginis evolve from a group of nine Matrikas, instead eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani (Aindri) and Chamundi) joined by Candika and Mahalakshmi form the nine-Matrika cluster. Each Matrika is considered to be a yogini and is associate with eight other yoginis resulting in the troupe of 81 (nine times nine).

The temple, whose name literally means \"Temple of the Calm Cantonese Sea\", was the first stop for Chinese immigrants to Singapore in the early 19th century.\n\nThe early history of Yueh Hai Ching temple is obscured. Multiple narratives provide conflicting accounts on the date the temple was first constructed. Some traced the history of the temple to as far back as to 1738. The general consensus is that the temple was first put up in 1820 as a simple wood and attap temple. In 1826, pioneer of Man Say Soon Company, Lim Poon erected a shrine on the same site on Phillip Street with a 999-year lease. It was managed by a board of trustees consisting of 14 members. The shrine was constructed so that sailors sailing between Singapore and China during the 19th century could offer their prayers and gratitude for their safe journey. This is reflected in the temple’s name, which translates as “Temple of the Calm Sea Built by the Guadong People”. Phillip Street was once near the sea, so that sailors could head to the temple immediately after docking. Due to land reclamation, the temple was effectively distanced from the shore.\n\nWhen Ngee Ann Association was formed in 1845, it took over the management from Many Say Soon Company. Between 1852 and 1855, the present temple was constructed. In 1895, Ngee Ann Association submitted a building plan which called for substantial rebuilding of the temple. By the late 19th century, was the second largest and most influential of the Chinese dialect groups after Fujian. Besides being a place of worship, Yueh Hai Ching Temple also acted as a community centre and a meeting place. According to historian Pan Xing Nong, on 26 June 1994, the president of Ngee Ann Association then called for prayers at the temple for the impending World War I. As such, the temple played an important role in the everyday life of the Teochew community. It was where people socialized and exchanged news. It served as a place of congregation for immigrants from the same province to provide mutual support for each other.\n\nFurther restoration was carried out between 1995 and 1997 (URA, 1997). The latest round of restoration was officially carried out from 2011 to 2014. However, study of the temple structure for restoration purposes commenced a few years before 2011 (Personal interview with Dr. Yeo Kang Shua). This restoration is highly acclaimed. It is given an Award of Merit for 2014 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation, 2014 Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Architectural Heritage Awards and 2013 National Architecture Institute of China’s Vernacular Architecture Award \n\nCovering a total floor area of 1440 square metres, the Yueh Hai Ching Temple was divided into two temples, each with its own entrance. The right temple is dedicated to Xuan Tian Shang Di, otherwise known as Duo Lau Yah. The left temple is dedicated to Tian Hou Sheng Mu, otherwise known as Ma Zu. The Xuan Tian Shang Di is a god worshipped by the Taoist. It is very much respected and worshipped by the secret societies in 19th Century. Mazu is worshipped as she guides ships to safety in times pf peril.\n\nThe Yueh Hai Ching Temple is an expression of a Taoist temple of Chinese architecture.\n\nAn important feature of classical Chinese architecture is its attention to the concept of orientation, which is developed into a special branch of art called Feng Shui. Buildings invariably face south or a little to the east. Yueh Hai Ching Temple is orientated to the southeast (Figure 6), which allows it to take advantage of the southeasterly winds and sunshine to provide the people living in the halls and courtyards with a pleasant micro-climate.\n\nOne of the characteristics of classical Chinese architecture is the symmetrical structuring of the plan and elevation. Yue Hai Ching Temple has asymmetrical layout.\n\nCourtyards and gardens as visual components of Chinese architecture. Upon passing through the front entrance gate, the large forecourt gives visitors a paronamic view of the entire temple. The courtyard of Yueh Hai Ching Temple are enclosed by the walls and buildings around it, takes on a special introverted quality. The seclusion of the courtyard, separated from the outside world, forms a world by itself. The stone-paved courtyard provides abundant supplies of air and light for interior space.\n\nThe roof of the temple of Xuan Tian Shang Di has ridge ornaments over the nave in the form of two dragons flanking a blazing pearl, which is lifted on a metal rod. To the ancient Chinese, the dragon is the emblem of guardianship and vigilance and the symbol of strength, authority and justice. The roof of the temple of Mazu has a ridge design composed of dragons guarding the city against evil influences and were emblematic of geomantic power to revert evil forces into beneficial energy.\n\nBoth roofs have the most unusual ornaments of complicated layouts of one- and two-storey mini-structures and human figurines. They are laid in such a way as to depict clusters of buildings within a Chinese town. In this temple, not only is the ridge extremely crowded with dragons and miniature models of dwellings, the copings, gable ends and hips are also adorned with all kinds of structures of pagodas, sheds, dwellings and niches. Human figurines area displayed everywhere, depicting scenes from Chinese operas which illustrate the courageous and meritorious deeds of the gods and ancient heroes of Chinese legend.\n\nThese figures were created using a traditional technique known as cut-and paste porcelain shard work (嵌瓷 or 剪瓷雕). Wires and rods are used to form armatures around which a cement-like lime base is formed of either limestone powder or seashell powder. The limp is mixed with sand and helpwool to form the substance onto which porcelain shards are set, providing a glazed sheen which gives a smooth and vibrant aesthetics.\n\nThe support system of the massive roof timbering is visible in Yueh Hai Ching Temple. The exposed wooden structural truss are of highly decorated elements. The carvings on the beams are engraved in many different layers, with the most dramatic being the pierced-relief carvings. This style of carving is more three-dimensional. Not only the wood carvings are exceptionally detailed, they are also decorated in gold foil and paint.\n\nYellow is the symbol of earth, the property of the Emperor. As such, it is often regarded as a symbol of grandeur, power and state. In the temple, gold (instead of yellow) is used on roof trusses, brackets, eaveboards, Door Gods and he Chinese characteristics of plaques.\n\nBlue, the colour of sky, is also an Imperial colour which signifies the colour of the east. In the temple, blue is used for decorative painted patterns on beams and background colours of plaques.\n\nRed is associated with prosperity and good fortune. It is also associated with the ‘yang’ principle of the sun. happiness and the south. In the temple, red is used on roof purlins, trusses and doors.\n\nGreen, which signifies the officials of lower rank, is associated with the water element. In the temple, green is used on roof rafters, roof tiles of the boundary walls and background colour of the plaques.\n\nYueh Hai Ching Temple contains 19 temple plaques, 11 sets of couplets, 2 stone inscriptions, 1 bronze inscriptions, 2 bronze bells, 5 inscribed beams, 2 ceremonial placards and 1 “cloud coard” wooden chime.\n\nFour censers and one plaque are in the collection of Ngee Ann Kongsi. One of the stone censor may date to 1819.\n\nThe temple is presented with an imperialplague from Emperor Guangxu in 1907. Yueh Hai Ching Temple is one of the only two temples being given this honour. The signboard which reads “Auspicious Clouds above the Sea at Dawn”, is now hung at the Mazu temple.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68823", "title": "Zedekiah", "text": "Zedekiah\n\nZedekiah (), also written Tzidkiyahu, originally called Mattanyahu or Mattaniah, was a biblical character, the last king of Judah before the destruction of the kingdom by Babylon. Zedekiah had been installed as king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, after a siege of Jerusalem in 597 BC, to succeed his nephew, Jeconiah, who was overthrown as king after a reign of only three months and ten days.\n\nWilliam F. Albright dates the start of Zedekiah's reign to 598 BC, while E. R. Thiele gives the start in 597 BC. On that reckoning, Zedekiah was born in c. 617 BC or 618 BC, being twenty-one on becoming king. Zedekiah's reign ended with the siege and fall of Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar II, which has been dated to 587 or 586 BC.\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah was his counselor, yet he did not heed the prophet and his epitaph is \"he did evil in the sight of the Lord\". (; )\n\nWhen Babylon rose against Assyria it caused upheavals that led to the destruction of Judah. Egypt, concerned about the new threat, moved northward to support Assyria. It set on the march in 608, moving via Judah. King Josiah attempted to block the Egyptian forces, and fell mortally wounded in battle at Megiddo. Josiah's younger son Jehoahaz was chosen to succeed his father to the throne. Three months later the Egyptian pharaoh Necho, returning from the north, deposed Jehoahaz in favor of his older brother, Jehoiakim. Jehoahaz was taken back to Egypt as a captive.\n\nAfter the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II then besieged Jerusalem. Jehoiakim changed allegiances to avoid the destruction of Jerusalem. He paid tribute from the treasury, some temple artifacts, and some of the royal family and nobility as hostages. The subsequent failure of the Babylonian invasion into Egypt undermined Babylonian control of the area, and after three years, Jehoiakim switched allegiance back to the Egyptians and ceased paying the tribute to Babylon. In 599 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II invaded Judah and again laid siege to Jerusalem. In 598 BC, Jehoiakim died during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah (also known as Jehoiachin). Jerusalem fell within three months. Jeconiah was deposed by Nebuchadnezzar, who installed Zedekiah, Jeconiah's uncle, in his place.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Zedekiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II in 597 BC at the age of twenty-one. This is in agreement with a Babylonian chronicle, which states, \"The seventh year: In the month Kislev the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu. He encamped against the city of Judah and on the second day of the month Adar he captured the city (and) seized (its) king. A king of his own choice he appointed in the city (and) taking the vast tribute he brought it into Babylon.\"\n\nThe kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar II. Despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah, Baruch ben Neriah and his other family and advisors, as well as the example of Jehoiakim, he revolted against Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar responded by invading Judah (). Nebuchadnezzar began a siege of Jerusalem in December 589 BC. During this siege, which lasted about thirty months, \"every worst woe befell the city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs\" (; , , ).\n\nAt the end of Zedekiah's eleven-year reign, Nebuchadnezzar succeeded in capturing Jerusalem. Zedekiah and his followers attempted to escape, making their way out of the city, but were captured on the plains of Jericho, and were taken to Riblah.\n\nThere, after seeing his sons put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive to Babylon (; ; ; ; ; ; ), where he remained a prisoner until he died.\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaradan was sent to destroy it. The city was plundered and razed to the ground. Solomon's Temple was destroyed. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ().\n\nGedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, was made governor to rule over the remnant of Judah, the Yehud Province (, ). On hearing this news, all the Jews that were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and in other countries returned to Judah (). However, before long Gedaliah was assassinated, and the population that was left in the land and those that had returned fled to Egypt for safety (, ) In Egypt, they settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros. ().\n\nThe Babylonian Chronicles give 2 Adar (16 March), 597 BC, as the date that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, thus putting an end to the reign of Jehoaichin. Zedekiah's installation as king by Nebuchadnezzar can therefore be firmly dated to the early spring of 597 BC. Historically there has been considerable controversy over the date when Jerusalem was captured the second time and Zedekiah's reign came to an end. There is no dispute about the month: it was the summer month of Tammuz (Jeremiah 52:6). The problem has been to determine the year. It was noted above that Albright preferred 587 BC and Thiele advocated 586 BC, and this division among scholars has persisted until the present time. If Zedekiah's years are by accession counting, whereby the year he came to the throne was considered his \"zero\" year and his first full year in office, 597/596, was counted as year one, Zedekiah's eleventh year, the year the city fell, would be 587/586. Since Judean regnal years were measured from Tishri in the fall, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of the city in the summer of 586 BC. Accession counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Judah, whereas \"non-accession\" counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Israel.\n\nThe publication of the Babylonian Chronicles in 1956, however, gave evidence that the years of Zedekiah were measured in a non-accession sense. This reckoning makes year 598/597 BC, the year Zedekiah was installed by Nebuchadnezzar according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar, to be year \"one,\" so that the fall of Jerusalem in his eleventh year would have been in year 588/587 BC, i.e. in the summer of 587 BC. The Babylonian Chronicles allow the fairly precise dating of the capture of Jehoiachin and the start of Zedekiah's reign, and they also give the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar's successor Amel-Marduk (Evil Merodach) as 562/561 BC, which was the 37th year of Jehoiachin's captivity according to 2 Kings 25:27. These Babylonian records related to Jehoiachin's reign are consistent with the fall of the city in 587 but not in 586, as explained in the Jehoiachin/Jeconiah article, thus vindicating Albright's date. Nevertheless, scholars who assume that Zedekiah's reign should be calculated by accession reckoning will continue to adhere to the 586 date, and so the infobox contains this as an alternative.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Zedekiah's son Mulek escaped death and traveled across the ocean to the Americas, where he founded a nation, the Mulekites, which later merged with another Israelite splinter group, the Nephites, to form one nation who retained the name Nephites.\n\nZedekiah was the third son of Josiah, and his mother was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, thus he was the brother of Jehoahaz (, , , ).\n\nHis original name was Mattanyahu (, \"Mattanyāhû\", \"Gift of God\"; ; ; traditional English: Mattaniah), but when Nebuchadnezzar II placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin, he changed his name to Zedekiah ().\n\n"}
