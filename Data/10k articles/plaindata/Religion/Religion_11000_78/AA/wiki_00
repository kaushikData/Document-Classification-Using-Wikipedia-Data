It was launched on 1 February 2015 and almost immediately shut down. The channel was owned by Saudi prince and entrepreneur Al-Waleed bin Talal, and was based in Manama, Bahrain.\n\nIn July 2010, Prince Al-Waleed, owner of a stake in News Corporation, planned to collaborate with News Corp to launch a 24-hour Arabic-language news channel. After a year of deliberation, Al-Waleed announced on 13 September 2011 the launch of Alarab as a personal private venture. He said the channel's editorial stance would be \"inspired by the recent political events that have transformed the region, with particular attention to be paid to freedom of speech.\" The channel was supposedly entirely privately funded, with Al-Waleed insisting that it would not receive instructions from the Saudi government. At the time of the launch, no mention was made of News Corp's involvement.\n\nIn December 2011, Manama, Bahrain, was chosen as the network's headquarters. Doha, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Beirut were also among the cities considered to host the network. Prince Al-Waleed retained close ties with the Bahraini royal family while his Kingdom Holding Company maintains a presence in the country through indirect investments in the banking sector.\n\nAl-Arab was launched on 1 February 2015.\n\nAl-Arab's regional competitors were Qatari-owned Al Jazeera and Saudi-government-owned Al Arabiya, along with BSkyB's Sky News Arabia. In a January 2012 interview, Al-Waleed described Al Jazeera as the \"masses channel\" while implying that Al Arabiya is the \"government channel\" among the two main news channels in the Middle East. He stated his goal for Al-Arab to \"takes the centre’s point of view\" between the two networks.\n\nAl-Arab was privately owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, independent from Kingdom Holding Company and Rotana Group, two corporations controlled by the prince. It was headquartered in Manama's Media City complex. The channel was based outside Saudi Arabia as the country does not allow independent news channels to operate within its borders.\n\nThe channel's director was Jamal Khashoggi, former editor of \"Al Watan\", a newspaper in Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was removed as editor in 2010 after \"Al Watan\" published an article criticizing Salafism, the fundamentalist Islamic movement that is Saudi Arabia's official state religion.\n\nThe channel partners with US financial news channel Bloomberg Television, which would have provided five hours of daily programming, including financial bulletins, analysis, reports on regional business leaders, and global financial news. The partnership would have brought al-Arab into direct competition with Arabic-language financial news channel CNBC Arabiya.\n\nOn 1 February 2015, al-Arab's first day of programming included an interview with Bahraini Shi'a politician and former member of the Council of Representatives, Khalil al-Marzooq, who discussed the cancelling of 72 Bahrainis' citizenship. Broadcasting was suspended after the interview. Al-Arab stated that the suspension was for \"technical and administrative reasons\", while the newspaper \"Akhbar al-Khaleej\" attributed the suspension to al-Arab \"not adhering to the norms prevalent in Gulf countries\".\n\nThe shutdown of Al Arab TV was a result of the poor understanding of the market environment on behalf of the station's management. According to several marketing analysts, the senior managers of the station did not properly evaluate the political environment of Bahrain and the limitations that it has, hence their decision to interview a prime Bahraini opposition personality - something which the Bahraini government would not accept.\n"}

According to legend, one divine shield fell from heaven during the reign of Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome. He ordered eleven copies made to confuse would-be thieves, since the original shield was regarded as one of the \"pignora imperii\", sacred guarantors that perpetuated Rome as a sovereign entity.\n\nThe \"ancilia\" were in the keeping of the Salii, a body of twelve priests instituted for that purpose by Numa. The Salii wielded them ritually in a procession throughout March.\n\nAncient sources give varying etymologies for the word \"ancile\". Some derive it from the Greek \"ankylos\" (ἀγκύλος), \"crooked\". Plutarch thinks the word may be derived from the Greek \"ankōn\" (ἀγκών), \"elbow\", the weapon being carried on the elbow. Varro derives it \"ab ancisu\", as being cut or arched on the two sides, like the bucklers of the Thracians called peltae.\n\nWhen the original \"ancile\" fell, a voice was heard which declared that Rome should be mistress of the world while the shield was preserved. The Ancile was, as it were, the palladium of Rome.\nNuma, by the advice, as it is said, of the nymph Egeria, ordered eleven others, perfectly like the first, to be made. This was so that if anyone should attempt to steal it, as Ulysses did the Palladium, they might not be able to distinguish the true Ancile from the false ones.\n\n"}
{"id": "68676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68676", "title": "Anointing", "text": "Anointing\n\nAnointing is the ritual act of pouring aromatic oil over a person's head or entire body. By extension, the term is also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person or object with any perfumed oil, milk, butter, or other fat. Scented oils are used as perfumes and sharing them is an act of hospitality. Their use to introduce a divine influence or presence is recorded from the earliest times; anointing was thus used as a form of medicine, thought to rid persons and things of dangerous spirits and demons which were believed to cause disease.\n\nIn present usage, \"anointing\" is typically used for ceremonial blessings such as the coronation of European monarchs. This continues an earlier Hebrew practice most famously observed in the anointings of Aaron as high priest and both Saul and David by the prophet Samuel. The concept is important to the figures of the Messiah and the Christ (Hebrew and Greek for \"The Anointed One\") who appear prominently in Jewish and Christian theology and eschatology. Anointing—particularly the anointing of the sick—may also be known as unction; the anointing of the dying as part of last rites in the Catholic church is sometimes specified as \"extreme unction\".\n\nThe present verb derives from the now obsolete adjective \"anoint\", equivalent to \"anointed\". The adjective is first attested in 1303, derived from Old French , the past participle of \"enoindre\", from Latin , an intensified form of (\"to anoint\"). It is thus cognate with \"unction\".\n\nThe oil used in a ceremonial anointment may be called \"chrism\" (from Greek , \"khrîsma\", \"anointing\"), although Christianity usually distinguishes a particularly sanctified chrism from other oils which might also be used. Several related words such as \"chrismation\" (anointing with oil) and \"chrismarium\" (a vessel containing chrism or another holy oil) derive from the same root.\n\nAnointing served and serves three distinct purposes: it is regarded as a means of health and comfort, as a token of honor, and as a symbol of consecration. It seems probable that its sanative purposes were enjoyed before it became an object of ceremonial religion, but the custom appears to predate written history and the archaeological record, and its genesis is impossible to determine with certainty.\n\nUsed in conjunction with bathing, anointment with oil closes pores. It was regarded as counteracting the influence of the sun, reducing sweating. Aromatic oils naturally masked body and other offensive odors, and other forms of fat could be combined with perfumes.\n\nApplications of oils and fats are also used as traditional medicines. The Bible records olive oil being applied to the sick and poured into wounds. Known sources date from times when anointment already served a religious function; therefore, anointing was also used to combat the malicious influence of demons in Persia, Armenia, and Greece. It was more recently used in traditional Indian medicine to remove illness, \"bad luck\", and \"demonic possession\". Anointing was also understood to \"seal in\" goodness and resist corruption, probably via analogy with the use of a top layer of oil to preserve wine in ancient amphoras, its spoiling usually being credited to demonic influence.\n\nFor sanitary and religious reasons, the bodies of the dead are sometimes anointed. In medieval and early modern Christianity, the practice was particularly associated with protection against vampires and ghouls who might otherwise take possession of the corpse.\n\nAnointing guests with oil as a mark of hospitality and token of honor is recorded in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as in the Hebrew scriptures. It was a common custom among the ancient Hebrews and continued among the Arabs into the 20th century.\n\nFor about 3,000 years, Persian Zoroastrians honor their guests with rose extract (\"golab\") while holding a mirror in front of their guest's face. The guests hold their palms out, collect the rose water, and then spread the perfumed liquid upon their faces and sometimes heads. The words of \"rooj kori aka\" (similar to Have a nice day) might be said as well.\n\nIn the sympathetic magic common to prehistoric and primitive religions, the fat of sacrificial animals and persons is often reckoned as a powerful charm, second to blood as the vehicle and seat of life. East African Arabs traditionally anointed themselves with lion's fat to gain courage and provoke fear in other animals. Australian Aborigines would rub themselves with a human victim's caul fat to gain his powers.\n\nIn religions like Christianity where animal sacrifice is no longer practiced, it is common to consecrate the oil in a special ceremony.\n\nIn inscriptions from Ancient Egypt, especially from the New Kingdom onward, anointing is often depicted in intimate scenes between husband and wife, where the wife is shown anointing her spouse as a sign of affection. The most famous example of this is on the throne of Tutankhamun. Anointment of the corpse with sweet-smelling oils was an important part of mummification. The completed mummy would also receive a final anointing before the sealing of its coffin.\n\nIn Indian religion, late Vedic rituals developed involving the anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are now known as abhisheka. The practice spread to Indian Buddhists. In modern Hinduism and Jainism, anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or yoghurt, milk, or (particularly) butter from the holy cow, rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed as an act of consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying birthing, educational enrollments, religious initiations, and death. New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed, and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the \"direction\" of the smearing. People are anointed from head to foot, downwards. The water may derive from one of the holy rivers or be scented with saffron, turmeric, or flower infusions; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when writing certain verses of scripture may also be used. Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered sandalwood, or herbal pastes.\n\nBuddhist practices of anointing are largely derived from Indian practices but tend to be less elaborate and more ritualized. Buddhists may sprinkle assembled practitioners with water or mark idols of Buddha or the Bodhisattvas with cow or yak butter. Flower-scented water is also used, as are ink-water and \"saffron water\" stained yellow using saffron or turmeric.\n\nIn antiquity, use of a holy anointing oil was significant in the Hebrews' consecration of priests, the Kohen Gadol (High Priest), and the sacred vessels. Prophets and the Israelite kings were also anointed as well, the kings from a horn. Anointment by the chrism prepared according to the ceremony described in the Book of Exodus was considered to impart the \"Spirit of the Lord\". It was performed by Samuel in place of a coronation of either Saul or David. The practice was not always observed and seems to have been essential only at the consecration of a new line or dynasty.\n\nBecause of its importance, the High Priest and the king were sometimes called \"the Anointed One\". The term—, \"Mashiaẖ\"—gave rise to the prophesied figure of the Messiah (\"q.v.\") and a long history of claimants.\n\nThe expression \"anoint the shield\" which occurs in Isaiah is a related or poetic usage, referring to the practice of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield to keep it supple and fit for war. The practice of anointing a shield predates the anointing other objects in that the \"smearing\" (Hebrew \"mashiach\") of the shield renewed the leather covering on a wooden shield. A victorious soldier was elevated on his shield by his commrades after a battle or upon his selection as a new king. The idea of protection and selection arose from this and was extended to the idea of a \"chosen one\" thus leading to the modern concept of a Messiah (Hebrew for the one who was anointed.)\n\nChristianity developed from the association of Jesus of Nazareth with the Jewish prophesies of an \"Anointed One\". His epithet \"Christ\" is a form of the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew title. He was not anointed by the High Priest in accordance with the ceremony described in Exodus, but he was considered to have been anointed by the Holy Spirit during his baptism. A literal anointing of Jesus also occurs when he was lavishly oiled by Mary of Bethany. Performed out of affection, the anointment is said by Jesus to have been preparation for his burial.\n\nIn the New Testament, John describes \"anointing from the Holy One\" and \"from Him abides in you\". Both this spiritual anointment and literal anointment with oil are usually associated with the Holy Spirit. Eastern Orthodox churches in particular attach great importance to the oil said to have been originally blessed by the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe practice of \"chrismation\" (baptism with oil) appears to have developed in the early church during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration. The earliest surviving account of such an act seems to be the letter written \"To Autolycus\" by Theophilus, bishop of Antioch. In it, he calls the act \"sweet and useful\", punning on \"khristós\" (, \"anointed\") and \"khrēstós\" (, \"useful\"). He seems to go on to say \"wherefore we are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God\", and \"what person on entering into this life or being an athlete is not anointed with oil?\" The practice is also defended by Hippolytus in his \"Commentary on the Song of Songs\" and by Origen in his \"Commentary on Romans\". Origen opines that \"all of us may be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches\".\n\nAnointing was particularly important among the Gnostics. Many early apocryphal and Gnostic texts state that John the Baptist's baptism by water was incomplete and that anointment with oil is a necessary part of the baptismal process. The Gospel of Philip claims that chrism is superior to baptism, for it is from the word \"chrism\" that we have been called \"Christians\", certainly not from the word \"baptism\". And it is from the \"chrism\" that the \"Christ\" has his name. For the Father anointed the Son, and the Son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses the Resurrection, the Light, the Cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber; he merely accepted the gift. The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is the Kingdom of Heaven. In the Acts of Thomas, the anointing is the beginning of the baptismal ritual and essential to becoming a Christian, as it says God knows his own children by his seal and that the seal is received through the oil. Many such chrismations are described in detail through the work.\n\nIn medieval and early modern Christianity, the oil from the lamps burnt before the altar of a church was felt to have particular sanctity. New churches and altars were anointed at their four corners during their dedication, as were tombs, gongs, and some other ritual instruments and utensils.\n\nIn particular, James 5:14-15 illustrates that anointing oil, applied in faith, is a powerful weapon against a spiritual attack of the enemy, which can translate into a disease designed to destroy the body.\n\nThe Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran Churches bless three types of holy oils for anointing: \"Oil of the Catechumens\" (abbreviated OS, from the Latin , meaning holy oil), \"Oil of the Infirm\" (OI), and \"Sacred Chrism\" (SC). The first two are said to be blessed, while the chrism is consecrated. \n\nThe Oil of Catechumens is used to anoint the catechumens (adults preparing for reception into the church) just before their receipt of the Sacrament of Baptism. Infants receiving the Sacrament of Baptism are also anointed with that same oil during the rite of Baptism, just before receiving the Sacrament. In the early Church converts seeking baptism underwent a period of formation known as catechumenate, and they received one or more anointings with the oil of cathecumens during this period of instruction, with the purpose of expelling evil spirits. The oil of catechumens is also used in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite to anoint the hands of a newly ordained Priest during the rite of Ordination to the presbyterate (whereas the head and the hands of a Bishop are anointed with Sacred Chrism during the rite of Episcopal Consecration). In the newer, ordinary form of the Roman Rite, both Priests and Bishops are anointed with Chrism, and the oil of catechumens ceased to be used for ordinations: in the rite of priestly ordination the hands are anointed with Chrism and in the rite of episcopal ordination only the head is anointed with Chrism. The Roman Pontifical of the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite also contemplates the use of the oil of Catechumens for the anointing of Kings and Queens during a rite of Coronation (although some countries were allowed to use different rites of Coronation other than the rite contained in the Roman Pontifical, and some of those rites prescribed the use of Chrism for the anointing of the monarch. This was the case, for instance, of the old French ritual).\n\nOil of the Infirm is used for administration of the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick (known as Extreme Unction in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite), the ritual treatment of the sick and infirm through anointment. \n\nSacred Chrism is used in the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders. It is also used in the dedication of new Churches, new Altars, and in the consecration of new patens and chalices for use in Mass. In the case of the Sacrament of Baptism, it must be noted that the subject receives two distinct unctions: one with the oil of catechumens, prior to being baptized, and then, after baptism with water is performed, the subject receives an unction with Chrism. In the case of the Sacrament of Confirmation, anointing with Chrism is the essential part of the Rite.\n\nAny bishop may consecrate the holy oils. They normally do so every Holy Thursday at a special \"Chrism Mass\". In the Gelasian sacramentary, the formula for doing so is:\nSend forth, O Lord, we beseech thee, thy Holy Spirit the Paraclete from heaven into this fatness of oil, which thou hast deigned to bring forth out of the green wood for the refreshing of mind and body; and through thy holy benediction may it be for all who anoint with it, taste it, touch it, a safeguard of mind and body, of soul and spirit, for the expulsion of all pains, of every infirmity, of every sickness of mind and body. For with the same thou hast anointed priests, kings, and prophets and martyrs with this thy chrism, perfected by thee, O Lord, blessed, abiding within our bowels in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, confirmation is known as chrismation. The Mystery of Chrismation is performed immediately after the Mystery of Baptism as part of a single ceremony. The ritual employs the sacred \"myron\" (, \"chrism\"), which is said to contain a remnant of oil blessed by the Twelve Apostles. In order to maintain the apostolic blessing unbroken, the container is never completely emptied but it is refilled as needed, usually at a ceremony held on Holy Thursday at the Patriarchate of Constantinople or the patriarchal cathedrals of the autocephalous churches. At the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the process is under the care of the \"Archontes Myrepsoi\", lay officials of the Patriarchate. Various members of the clergy may also participate in the preparation, but the Consecration itself is always performed by the Patriarch or a bishop deputed by him for that purpose. The new \"myron\" contains olive oil, myrrh, and numerous spices and perfumes. This \"myron\" is normally kept on the Holy Table or on the Table of Oblation. During chrismation, the \"newly illuminate\" person is anointed by using the \"myron\" to make the sign of the cross on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, lips, both ears, breast, hands, and feet. The priest uses a special brush for this purpose. Prior to the 20th century, the \"myron\" was also used for the anointing of Orthodox monarchs.\n\nThe oil that is used to anoint the catechumens before baptism is simple olive oil which is blessed by the priest immediately before he pours it into the baptismal font. Then, using his fingers, he takes some of the blessed oil floating on the surface of the baptismal water and anoints the catechumen on the forehead, breast, shoulders, ears, hands, and feet. He then immediately baptizes the catechumen with threefold immersion in the name of the Trinity.\n\nAnointing of the sick is called the \"Sacred Mystery of Unction\". The practice is used for spiritual ailments as well as physical ones, and the faithful may request unction any number of times at will. In some churches, it is normal for all of the faithful to receive unction during a service on Holy Wednesday of Holy Week. The holy oil used at unction is not stored in the church like the \"myron\", but consecrated anew for each individual service. When an Orthodox Christian dies, if he has received the Mystery of Unction and some of the consecrated oil remains, it is poured over his body just before burial. It is also common to bless using oils which have been blessed either with a simple blessing by a priest (or even a venerated monastic), or by contact with some sacred object, such as relics of a saint, or which has been taken from an oil lamp burning in front of a wonderworking icon or some other shrine.\n\nIn the Armenian Church, crosses are traditionally not considered holy until they have been anointed and prayed over, thus introducing the Holy Spirit into them. The same ritual was formerly observed in the other Orthodox churches.\n\nOwing to their particular focus upon the action of the Holy Spirit, Pentecostal churches sometimes continue to employ anointing for consecration and ordination of pastors and elders, as well as for healing the sick.\n\nThe Pentecostal expression \"the anointing breaks the yoke\" derives from a passage in Isaiah which discusses the power given the prophet Hezekiah by the Holy Spirit over the tyrant Sennacherib.\n\nThe Doctrine and Covenants of the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) contains numerous references to the anointing and healing of the sick by those with authority to do so. Joseph Smith instituted anointing for other purposes on 21 January 1836, during the rites of sanctification and consecration preparatory to the endowment rites practiced in the Kirtland Temple. At the present time, any holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood may anoint the head of an individual who is ill upon request. Olive oil must be used if available, and it must have been consecrated earlier in a short ordinance that any holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood may perform.\n\nIn addition to its use for the Israelite kingship, anointing has been an important ritual in Christian rites of Coronation, especially in Europe.\n\nLater French legend held that a vial of oil—the Holy Ampulla—descended from Heaven to anoint Clovis I as King of the Franks following his conversion to Christianity in 493. The Visigoth Wamba is the earliest Catholic king known to have been anointed, although the practice apparently preceded him in Spain. The ceremony was performed in 672 by Quiricus, the archbishop of Toledo; despite the king's strongly antisemitic laws, the ceremony hewed closely to the rite described by the Old Testament. It was apparently copied a year later when Flavius Paulus defected and joined the Septimanian rebels he had been tasked with quieting. The rite epitomized the Catholic Church's sanctioning the monarch's rule; it was notably employed by usurpers such as Pepin, whose dynasty replaced the Merovingians in France in 751. While it might be argued that the practice subordinated the king to the church, in practice the sacral anointing of kings was seen as elevating the king to priestly or even saintly status. It provided a directly religious aspect to Europe's regimes apart from the church hierarchy and, for political and practical reasons, was seldom performed by the popes. Instead, the anointment was usually administered by a bishop from a major see of the realm, often the national primate. Lupoi argues that this set in motion the conflicting claims that developed into the Investiture Crisis. At the same time, royal unction recontextualized the elections and popular acclamations still legally responsible for the elevation of new rulers. They were no longer understood as autonomous authorities but merely agents in service of God's will. The divine right of kings was thus gradually recreated in a Christian context, continuing even when monarchs might choose to forgo the anointment ceremony altogether. The supposedly indelible nature of anointment was alluded to in Shakespeare's \"Richard II\":\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy, the anointing of a new king is considered a Sacred Mystery. The act is believed to empower him—through the grace of the Holy Spirit—with the ability to discharge his divinely appointed duties, particularly his ministry in defending the faith. The same \"myron\" used in Chrismation is used for the ceremony. In Russian Orthodox ceremonial, the anointing took place during the coronation of the tsar towards the end of the service, just before his receipt of Holy Communion. The sovereign and his consort were escorted to the Holy Doors (Iconostasis) of the cathedral and jointly anointed by the metropolitan. Afterwards, the tsar was taken alone through the Holy Doors—an action normally reserved only for priests—and received communion at a small table set next to the Holy Table.\n\nIn the present day, royal unction is less common, being practiced only upon the monarchs of Britain and of Tonga. The utensils for the practice are sometimes reckoned as regalia, like the ampulla and spoon used in the former Kingdom of France and the anointing horns used in Sweden and Norway. The Biblical formula is not necessarily followed. For the 1626 coronation of King Charles I of England, the holy oil was made of a concoction of orange, jasmine, distilled roses, distilled cinnamon, and ben oil.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "700568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700568", "title": "Answers in Genesis", "text": "Answers in Genesis\n\nAnswers in Genesis (AiG) is a fundamentalist Christian apologetics parachurch organization. It advocates a literal or historical-grammatical interpretation of the Book of Genesis, with a particular focus on a pseudoscientific promotion of young Earth creationism, which rejects those results of scientific investigation which do not conform to their literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative. The organization sees evolution as incompatible with the Bible and believes anything other than the young Earth view is a compromise on biblical inerrancy.\n\nAiG began as the Creation Science Foundation in 1980, following the merger of two Australian creationist groups. Its name changed to Answers in Genesis in 1994, when Ken Ham founded the organization's United States branch. In 2006 the branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa split from the US and UK to form Creation Ministries International. In 2007, AiG opened the Creation Museum, a facility that promotes young Earth creationism, and in 2016 the organization opened the Ark Encounter, a Noah's Ark themed amusement park. AiG also publishes websites, magazines, and journals.\n\nAnswers in Genesis resulted from the merging of two Australian creationist organizations in 1980, one led by John Mackay and Ken Ham and the other by Carl Wieland. The organization later become known as Answers in Genesis. Following turmoil in 2005, the AiG network split in 2006. The US and UK branches retained the AiG name and control of the AiG website under Ham's leadership. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and South African branches rebranded themselves as Creation Ministries International (CMI). In 2007, CMI filed suit against AiG-USA alleging a variety of wrongdoings, including publicly defaming their organization.\n\nIn June 2006, Answers in Genesis launched \"Answers\" magazine in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by the \"Answers Research Journal\" in 2008, which was widely criticized in the media and scientific circles. Also in 2006, the National Religious Broadcasters awarded Answers in Genesis their Best Ministry Website award. In May 2007, AiG launched the Creation Museum in the United States. The museum received criticism from the National Center for Science Education and petitions of protest from the scientific community.\n\nFrom the outset, Ken Ham did not share the interest of other creation science groups in aiming to produce science supporting young Earth creationism, instead Answers in Genesis presents evangelicalism as an all-out battle of their biblical worldview against a naturalistic scientific worldview. Ham's message has had three central points. Firstly, teaching of evolution is an evil causing terrible damage to society, secondly, the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis give direct instruction on the creation of the universe and human social behavior, and thirdly that proper Christians must engage in a total conflict battling against atheistic humanism. Answers in Genesis promotes central young Earth creationist doctrines, including literal Creation of the Earth in six 24-hour days and effects of the global flood, but their main focus is acceptance of the authority of their particular literal reading of the Bible as a precondition for eternity in heaven. They present this as a choice between the word of God and human reason, with those choosing the latter liable to dire eternal punishment.\n\nAnswers in Genesis rejects key scientific facts and theories as established by archeology, cosmology, geology, paleontology and evolutionary biology and argues that the universe, the Earth and life originated about 6,000 years ago. Since their beliefs reject natural causes and events in scientific explanations of nature and the origin of the universe in favor of the supernatural, creation science is considered to be a religion by the National Academy of Sciences. \n\nA book published by one of AiG's employees in 2006 accused Hollywood of using subtle tactics to slip \"evolutionary content\" into \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Lilo & Stitch\" and \"Finding Nemo\", affirming that \"As Christians we need to reflect the Bible's standards and not Hollywood's perverted version of reality.\"\n\nAiG's Creation Museum is a museum displaying a Young Earth creationist worldview and pseudoarchaeology. The facility has received much criticism from the scientific and religious communities, as well as cultural commentators. The Creation Museum opened May 27, 2007, at a cost of $27 million raised entirely by private donations. The displays were created by Patrick Marsh, known for work on Universal Studios Florida attractions for King Kong and Jaws.\n\nA. A. Gill, a British writer and critic, described the museum as \"battling science and reason since 2007\", writing: \"This place doesn't just take on evolution—it squares off with geology, anthropology, paleontology, history, chemistry, astronomy, zoology, biology, and good taste. It directly and boldly contradicts most -onomies and all -ologies, including most theology.\"\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that the \"public fascination\" with the Creation Museum was \"fading.\" In November 2012, the AiG reported that attendance for the year ended June 30 came to 254,074, which was a 10 percent drop from the previous year and is the attraction's \"fourth straight year of declining attendance and its lowest annual attendance yet.\" By mid-2015, 2.4 million people had visited the museum [about 340,000 visitors over seven years].\n\nAnswers in Genesis opened the Ark Encounter theme park in Grant County, Kentucky on July 7, 2016. The centerpiece of the park is a full-scale model of Noah's Ark at long and high. After his visit to Ark Encounter, Bill Nye, who had previously debated Ham, described his experience as \"much more troubling or disturbing than [he] thought it would be\" and stated that \"on the Ark's third deck, every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong\". In December 2016, for the holiday season, AiG lit the Ark with rainbow colors, the purpose being to \"reclaim the symbol from the gay rights movement\" and remind viewers of the Noahic covenant.\n\nBy late October 2016, over 400,000 people visited the attraction, continuing to exceed projections. This is in contrast to a state study that projected the attraction to receive 325,000 to under 500,000 visitors in the first year. In its first year of operation, AiG reported that the Ark Encounter attracted over 1 million visitors and 1.5 million total visitors for both the Ark and the Creation Museum.\n\nCreation science, which is promoted by AiG, is a pseudoscience that \"lacks the central defining characteristic of all modern scientific theories\". Scientific and scholarly organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, Paleontological Society, Geological Society of America, Australian Academy of Science, and the Royal Society of Canada have issued statements against the teaching of creationism. The National Center for Science Education, a science advocacy group, criticize AiG's promotion of non-science. In direct response to AiG, No Answers in Genesis is a website maintained by members of the Australian Skeptics and retired civil servant John Stear for the purpose of rebutting claims made by AiG.\n\nAstronomer Hugh Ross's organization Reasons To Believe, a progressive creationist organization, is a critic of Answers in Genesis. The BioLogos Foundation, which promotes evolutionary creationism, has stated that the views of Answers in Genesis have \"force[d] many thoughtful Christians to lose their faith,\" while The Biologos Foundation \"protect[s the Christian] faith.\".\n\nIn 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an interview with Richard Dawkins, a prominent evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website. Dawkins addressed it in the essay: \"The 'Information Challenge'\", published in \"A Devil's Chaplain\" in 2003. The \"suspiciously amateurish\" interview included, according to Dawkins, \"the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way\" (namely, to \"give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome\"). Realising that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his own admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: \"My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!\"\n\nThe Australian Skeptics wrote that the film was edited to give the appearance that Dawkins was unable to \"give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome\" and that a segment that shows him pausing for 11 seconds was film of him considering whether to expel the interviewer from the room for not revealing her creationist sympathies at the outset. Dawkins reported to the Australian Skeptics that the interviewer shown in the finished film was not the same person as the person who had originally asked the questions. Dawkins and Barry Williams also said that the question had been subsequently changed to make it look like Dawkins, who was answering the original question put to him, was unable to answer. Dawkins discussed the interview in the essay published in \"A Devil's Chaplain\".\n\nOn May 31, 2007, Creation Ministries International filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court of Queensland against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis seeking damages and accusing him of \"unbiblical/unethical/unlawful behaviour\" in his dealings with the Australian organization. Prior to the split, the Australian group had been producing periodicals, \"Creation\" magazine and \"Journal of Creation\", which were then distributed within other countries by local groups. The Australian group had no access to the list of subscribers in the US. AiG discontinued the distribution arrangement, and produced a new magazine of their own, called \"Answers\", and represented that to subscribers as a replacement. Creation Ministries International was claiming $252,000 (US) in damages for lost revenue by misleading and deceptive conduct in relating to lost subscriptions.\n\nIn comments to news reporters, Ken Ham dismisses CMI's accusations as \"totally preposterous and untrue\". Creation Ministries has made a large collection of documents available detailing their side of the case. An editorial analysis of the situation, including reference to estranged co-founder John Mackay's allegations in 1986 of necrophilia and witchcraft against Ken Ham's personal secretary is offered in an account in the \"Reports of the National Center for Science Education\". In February 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered Australian-based Creation Ministries International into arbitration with Answers in Genesis over copyrights and control of affiliates in other countries. In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Answers in Genesis posted a billboard in Texas with a young boy aiming a gun towards the camera with the words \"If God doesn't matter to him, do you?\" The same image was used in a TV ad. In 2014, the organization purchased space in Times Square to run a 15-second video advertisement addressed \"To all of our intolerant liberal friends\". According to AiG, the goal of the billboard was to \"challenge the secularists who are increasingly intolerant of the Christian message\". The Christian \"Relevant Magazine\" described the ad as \"passive-aggressive\" and \"weirdly combative\".\n\nIn March 2011, the Board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (a young Earth Christian group) voted to disinvite Ken Ham and AiG from future conventions due to Ham's words about other Christians making \"unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst\". The controversy stemmed from Ham's commentary on the position expressed by Peter Enns, of The BioLogos Foundation, who advocated a symbolic, rather than literal interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve. Writing on his blog, Ham accused Enns of espousing \"outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God\", which led to his invitation being revoked.\n\nIn 2007 about 160 people including a chaplain worked at the Creation Museum (a division of AiG, so these were AiG employees) and another 140 people worked at the attached AiG headquarters. Each permanent employee of AiG including people who work at the museum must sign a statement of faith \"in order to preserve the function and integrity of the ministry\", indicating that he or she believes in young Earth creationism and the other teachings of Answers in Genesis. These include \"Scripture teaches a recent origin for man and the whole creation\", \"the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman\", \"the great Flood of Genesis was an actual historic event\" and \"no apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record\". When applying for work a written statement of one's beliefs is required along with résumé and references. In 2007, \"The Kentucky Post\" reported that the Creation Museum employed between 10 and 20 security guards armed with .40 caliber Glock handguns and three certified law enforcement canines.\n\nCreationist geologist Andrew A. Snelling started working with AiG in 2007 as its director of research.\n\n"}

There is an interesting episode regarding the birth of Aurava and as to why he was called Aurava. According to the Mahabharata there was a king named Kritavirya Who was very liberal to his priests, who belonged to the race of Bhrigu. As such they became very rich due to his generosity. But after the death of the king his descendants had fallen into poverty. They begged for help from the Bhrigus, who at that time were very rich. But the Bhrigus refused to help the kings saying that the wealth which is once given to a Brahman cannot be taken back. To protect their wealth they buried their gold in a secret place. Coming to know about this the Kshatriya kings invaded the Ashrams of the Bhrigus and killed all the Bhrigus, without sparing even children that were growing in the wombs of their mothers.. The Bhrigus also belonged to a warrior class once, but they could not stop the kings from slaughtering them. One woman concealed her just born son in her thighs to protect the baby from being slaughtered. The Kshatriyas who came to know about this rushed towards the lady to kill the baby. The baby fell down from her thighs with such a luster that all the persecutors were blinded instantly. Since the child was produced from the ‘Uru’(thigh) of a woman he was called ‘ Aurava’/Aurva.\n"}

The first Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and the first of these to have become a Bahá'í was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Circa 2006 the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith entered the region of the Far East, in Hong Kong, in the 1870s, during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith. While the religion continued to enter other nearby regions to Taiwan — Bahá'ís being in Shanghai in 1902, Japan in 1912, Canton in 1949, and Macau in 1953, there was no Bahá'í contact with the island until 1949. Between 1895 and 1945, until ending with World War II, Taiwan was under Japanese rule and then there was the period of the Chinese Civil War.\n\nFour Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 as part of the wave of refugees of Chiang Kai-shek's retreat from the mainland: Jerone Chu, Yan Hsu-chang, Chien Tien-lee, and Gellan Wang. The first Bahá'í in Taiwan was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung), a newspaper man, who had become a Bahá'í in Washington D.C. in 1945. Chu arrived in Taiwan after a stay in Nanking where an associate, Yuan Hsu-chang, had accepted the religion and also came to Taiwan. Major Chien Tien-lee (Lee L.T. Chang) had had a Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. and came to Taiwan after a stay in Shanghai.\n\nThe first American Bahá'í visitors to Taiwan were Dr. David Earl and Lt. Col. John McHenry in 1952, and Rafi and Mildred Mottahedeh in 1953. In October of that year Dhikru'llah Khadem visited Taiwan, the first Hand of the Cause — people who achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion — to do so and at a meeting he held in Chu's home three more people accepted the Bahá'í Faith: these three were Professor Tsao Li-shih, who was an instructor of architecture at the College of Engineering at the National Taiwan University; Hong Li-ming (Jimmy), the first native-born Taiwanese to become a Bahá'í; and Wong Ho-len (Wong Ho-jen).\n\nLater, Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani, who were Bahá'ís in Shanghai, left that city in 1950, and arrived in Taiwan in 1954 at port Keelung where they found there was already a community of ten Bahá'ís spread among some of the cities of Taiwan: Taipei (2), Tainan (4), Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Chiayi. Mrs. Suleimani was from a Bahá'í family from Ashqabad who left in 1923.\n\nBy May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956, which was noted by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion. The members were Mr. Wang Chi-chang, Mrs. Suleimani, Mr. Pai Chung-chen, Mrs. Ruthy Tu, Mr. Tsao Li-shih. Standing. Dr. Ni Jun-chung (ching), Mr. Chu, Mr. Winston Luk, and Mr. Ho Chung-tzu. Mrs. Tu was the first woman citizen of Taiwan to become a Bahá'í and was elected to be a delegate in 1957 to the election of the regional National Spiritual Assembly but was unable to travel. Noted Bahá'í Agnes Alexander visited the island in 1956, and, after being appointed as a Hand of the Cause, visited the island again in 1958 and 1962.\n\nFrom 1955 through 1957, petitions by the Bahá'í community were submitted to the Taiwanese government to be recognized as a religion by the government had failed, though permission was given to have a temporary Bahá'í summer school in September 1957.\n\nIn 1957, the first regional National Assembly election convention of the Bahá'ís of North East Asia, held in Tokyo, was convened; the jurisdiction of the National Assembly included Taiwan. In 1958, the second Local Spiritual Assembly of the island was established in Taipei with the arrival of two pioneers and one more citizen convert. By April 1958 the number of Bahá'ís in Taiwan had reached twenty-two. The first official use of the Tainan Bahá'í Centre was in 1959. In 1960 the book Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era was revised, translated and reprinted and one copy was given to every Bahá'í in Taiwan. In 1963 Mrs. Tu was able to attend the first Bahá'í World Congress which also the year of the first Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Taiwan.\n\nThe first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of Taiwan was first elected in 1967 — the members of the institution were Mrs. Isabel Dean and Mrs. Ridvaniyyih Suleimani, Mr. Kuo Rong-hui, Mr. Robert Yen, Dr. Sidney Dean, Mr. S.A. Suleimani, Mr. Tsao Kai-min, Mr. Huang Tsen-min and Mr. Huang Ting-seng. At the time there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Then in 1970 the Bahá'í community of the island was recognized by the government.\n\nIn 1990, the Chief of the indigenous Puyuma Tribe, Mr. Chen Wen-sheng, became a Bahá'í.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In more recent years the Bahá'ís of Taiwan have participated in a number of local and international activities. By 1995, the Bahá'í Office of the Environment for Taiwan, in collaboration with the national government, had trained hundreds of teachers throughout the country to introduce conservation issues into curricula. The Office also produced a series of national radio educational programs on environmental care and protection. In December 1997 Bahá'ís were invited to participate in a local exhibit of religions. In 2001 Bahá'ís from Taiwan attended the opening of the Seat of the International Teaching Centre. In 2004, the Taiwanese Baha'i community organizes 20 regular children's classes, attracting some 200 children.\n\nCirca 2006 the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000, or 0.1% of the national population with 13 assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) agreed with that estimate in 2005.\n\n\n"}

Among the earliest is the apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar in the year 40. St Isidore the Farmer claimed to be praying or attending to Mass in Church while at the same time plowing in the fields.\n\nOther Christian figures said to have experienced bilocation include St. Alphonsus Marie De'Liguori (Founder of Redemptorist Congregation), St. Anthony of Padua, Ursula Micaela Morata, St. Gerard Majella, Charles of Mount Argus, Padre Pio, St. Severus of Ravenna, St. Ambrose of Milan, María de Ágreda, and St. Martin de Porres, and María de León Bello y Delgado.\n\nIn the Coptic Church, Saints Yostos El Antony and Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria were claimed to bilocate in the 20th century.\n\nIn the 17th century, persons accused of witchcraft were reported to appear in dreams and visions of witnesses. The trials at Bury St. Edmunds and Salem included this \"spectral evidence\" against defendants. Matthew Hopkins described the phenomenon in his book \"The Discovery of Witches\".\n\nThe English occultist Aleister Crowley was reported by acquaintances to have the ability, even though he said he was not conscious of its happening at the time.\n\nBilocation figures heavily in David Lynch's film \"Lost Highway\" (1997) and Thomas Pynchon's novel \"Against the Day\" (2006). Bilocation also plays a part in the Christopher Priest novel \"The Prestige\".\n\nA mystical story that involved Soviet author Yevgeny Petrov served as inspiration for the film \"Envelope\" (2012) starring Kevin Spacey.\n\nSkeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that there is no scientific evidence that bilocation is a real phenomenon and that cases are often from anecdotal reports that cannot be verified. Nickell listed self-delusion, hoaxing and illusion to explain alleged cases of bilocation.\n\n"}

He also served as the for ordination prior to the arrival of Ganjin, and presided over the opening of the Tōdai-ji Temple.\n\nDao-xuan was born in Hunan Province in 702, and ordained at an early age in the Vinaya school in China (律宗) at Dafu (大福) temple in Loyang. After learning the Vinaya, he traveled and practiced Chan meditation for a time followed by intensive study of Tiantai doctrines before returning to his home temple where he hosted lectures.\n\nIn 733, two Japanese monks, Eiei (栄叡) and Fushō (普照) came to China in search of a Vinaya master who would accompany them to Japan to provide orthodox Buddhist ordinations there. Dao-xuan agreed to go, and arrived in 736. However, the rules of the Vinaya state that a minimum of 10 \"bhikkhu\" monks was required for new ordinations, and so Dao-xuan was unable to conduct an ordination service until 754 when Ganjin and his disciples arrived in Japan.\n\nIn the meantime, Dao-xuan had brought the latest Buddhist teachings from China and lectured actively on such topics as the Brahma Net Sutra and the precepts. Dao-xuan's lectures on the Flower Garland Sutra and his knowledge of Huayan School teachings inspired Emperor Shomu to construct the Tōdai-ji temple as the center for further studies of the Huayan school. It is also recorded that he chanted \"dharani\" during the opening ceremony of the Great Buddha at Tōdai-ji temple. In 751, he was appointed as \"precept master\", and greeted Ganjin upon arrival as well as Bodhisena.\n\nBy 760, his health declined and he was forced to withdraw to Hisodera temple in Yoshino Province, where he died.\n"}

{"id": "2203791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203791", "title": "Freedom of religion in China", "text": "Freedom of religion in China\n\nFreedom of religion in China is provided for in the \"Constitution of the People's Republic of China\", with an important caveat: the government protects what it calls \"normal religious activity,\" defined in practice as activities that take place within government-sanctioned religious organizations and registered places of worship. Although the dynastic governments of imperial China also claimed responsibility for the practice of religion, human rights bodies such as United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have criticized this differentiation as falling short of international standards for the protection of religious freedom.\n\nChina's five officially sanctioned religious organizations are the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. These groups are afforded a degree of protection, but are subject to restrictions and controls under the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Unregistered religious groups—including house churches, Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists, underground Catholics, and Uyghur Muslims—face varying degrees of harassment, including imprisonment, torture, and forced religious conversion. Tam and Hasmath argue that the Chinese government views religion as potentially destabilizing.\n\nArticle 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China of 1982 specifies that:\nThis protection is extended only to what are called \"normal religious activities,\" generally understood to refer to religions that submit to state control via the State Administration for Religious Affairs. The Constitution further forbids the use of religion to \"engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.”\n\nThe law affords protection to five officially sanctioned religions: the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Religious groups are required to register with the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA, formerly known as the central Religious Affairs Bureau) or its provincial and local offices (still known as Religious Affairs Bureaus (RABs)). SARA and the RABs are responsible for monitoring and judging the legitimacy of religious activity.\n\nProselytizing is only permitted in private settings or within registered houses of worship. Proselytization in public, in unregistered churches or temples, or by foreigners is prohibited. Members of the officially atheist Communist Party are strongly discouraged from holding religious faith.\n\nA significant number of non-sanctioned churches and temples exist, attended by locals and foreigners alike. Unregistered or underground churches are not officially banned, but are not permitted to openly conduct religious services. These bodies may face varying degrees of interference, harassment, and persecution by state and party organs. In some instances, unregistered religious believers and leaders have been charged with \"illegal religious activities\" or \"disrupting social stability.\" Religious believers have also been charged under article 300 of the criminal code, which forbids using heretical organizations to \"undermine the implementation of the law.\" An extrajudicial, Communist Party-led security organ called the 6-10 Office oversees the suppression of Falun Gong and, increasingly, other unregistered religious organizations.\n\nFolk religions, though not officially protected, are sometimes tolerated by authorities. The State Administration for Religious Affairs has created a department to oversee the management of folk religion.\n\nChristianity has had a presence in China dating as far back as the Tang dynasty, and accumulated a following in China with the arrival of large numbers of missionaries during the Qing dynasty. Missionaries were expelled from China in 1949 when the Communist Party came to power, and the religion was associated with Western imperialism. However, Christianity experienced a resurgence of popularity since the reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and 1980s. By 2011, approximately 60 million Chinese citizens were estimated to be practicing Protestantism or Catholicism. The majority of these do not belong to the state-sanctioned churches.\n\nReligious practices are still often tightly controlled by government authorities. Chinese children in Mainland China are permitted to be involved with officially sanctioned Christian meetings through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement or the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Associations. In early January 2018, Chinese authorities in Shanxi province demolished a church, which created a wave of fear among the Christians. \n\nChina is home to an estimated 12 million Catholics, the majority of whom worship outside the official Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The State Administration for Religious Affairs states that there are 5.3 million Catholics belonging to the official Catholic Patriotic Association, which oversees 70 bishops, and approximately 6,000 churches nationwide. In addition, there are roughly 40 bishops unordained by the CPA who operate unofficially, and recognize the authority of the Vatican.\n\nThe state-sanctioned church appoints its own bishops, and as with all official religious, exercises control over the doctrine and leadership of the religion. As a matter of maintaining autonomy and rejecting foreign intervention, the official church has no official contact with the Vatican, and does not recognize its authority. However, the CPA has allowed for unofficial Vatican approval of ordinations. Although the CPA continues to carry out ordinations opposed by the Holy See, the majority of CPA bishops are now recognized by both authorities. In addition to overseeing the practice of the Catholic faith, the CPA espouses politically oriented objectives as well. Liu Bainian, chairman of the CPA and the Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, stated in a 2011 interview that the church needed individuals who \"love the country and love religion: politically, they should respect the Constitution, respect the law, and fervently love the socialist motherland.’’\n\nSome Catholics who recognize the authority of the Holy See choose to worship clandestinely due to the risk of harassment from authorities. Several underground Catholic bishops have been reported disappeared or imprisoned, and harassment of unregistered bishops and priests is common. There are reports of Catholic bishops and priests being forced by authorities to attend the ordination ceremonies for bishops who had not gained Vatican approval. Chinese authorities also have reportedly pressured Catholics to break communion with the Vatican by requiring them to renounce an essential belief in Roman Catholicism, the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. In other instances, however, authorities have permitted Vatican-loyal churches to carry out operations.\n\nThe Three-Self Patriotic Movement, National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China; the Three-Self Church or \"TSPM\" is the government-sanctioned (\"patriotic\") Christian organization in China. Known in combination with the China Christian Council as the lianghui, they form the only state-sanctioned (\"registered\") Protestant church in mainland China. All other Protestant denominations are illegal.\n\nChinese house churches are a religious movement of unregistered assemblies of Christians in China, which operate independently of the government-run Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestant groups and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CCPA) and the Chinese Catholic Bishops Council (CCBC) for Catholics. They are also known as the \"Underground\" Church or the \"Unofficial\" Church, although this is somewhat of a misnomer as they are collections of unrelated individual churches rather than a single unified church. They are called \"house churches\" because as they are not officially registered organizations, they cannot independently own property and hence they meet in private houses, often in secret for fear of arrest or imprisonment.\n\nChina took full control of Tibet in 1959. In the wake of the takeover and especially during the cultural revolution many monasteries were destroyed and many monks and laypeople killed. The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current Dalai Lama has attempted to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for greater autonomy and religious freedom for Tibet. As various high-ranking Lamas in the country have died, the authorities have proposed their own candidates on the religious authorities, which has led at times to rival claimants to the same position. In an effort to control this, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a Reincarnation Application be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate.\n\nThe present incarnation of the Panchen Lama is disputed. The Dalai Lama recognises Gedhun Choekyi Nyima; however, the Chinese government recognises Gyaincain Norbu as the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama. Exile Tibetan sources allege that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was kidnapped by the Chinese government. The identity of the Panchen Lama is of critical importance to Tibetan Buddhism because he is one of the authorities that must approve the next Dalai Lama.\n\nTaoist practitioners are required to register with the state-controlled Chinese Taoist Association (CTA), which exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel. Local governments restrict the construction of Taoist temples and statues, and call for abandonment of practices they deem to be \"superstitious\" or \"feudal.\" The CTA dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine, and exhorts Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to ‘‘fervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.’’\n\nThe State Administration for Religious Affairs places the number of Muslims in China at approximately 21 million, while independent estimates suggest the number could be upwards of 50 million. According to a 2000 census, 96 percent of 20.3 million reported Muslims belong to three ethnic groups: Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh. Most Hui Muslims live in Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces, while Uyghur Muslims are found predominantly in the Xinjiang.\n\nThe state-run Islamic Association of China (IAC) oversees the practice of Islam, though many Muslims worship outside the state system. The IAC regulates the content of sermons and interpretation of religious scripture, exercises control over the confirmation of religious leaders, and monitors overseas pilgrimages. In 2001, the IAC established a committee to ensure that scriptures were interpreted in a manner to serve the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party.\n\nAuthorities in Xinjiang impose rigid controls over religious expression, particularly over Uyghurs. Human rights reports indicate that crackdowns on religion are frequently integrated into security campaigns. Authorities monitor mosques, restrict the observation of Ramadan by government officials and students, and enact campaigns to prevent Uyghur men from wearing beards. Uyghur Muslims worshiping independently have been detained and charged with conducting \"illegal religious activities.\"\n\nHowever, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatist, rather than Muslim. China banned a book titled \"Xing Fengsu\" (\"Sexual Customs\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs, Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.\n\nIn 2007, anticipating the coming \"Year of the Pig\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \"to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities\". This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered \"unclean\").\n\nIn response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons insulting Muhammad, with the state-run \"Xinhua\" advocated limiting freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper \"Global Times\" said the attack was \"payback\" for what it characterised as Western colonialism and accusing Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations.\n\nDifferent Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there.\n\nAlthough religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang.\n\nHui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs in the same positions, the amount of Hui going on Hajj is expanding, and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them.\n\nHui religious schools are allowed a massive autonomous network of mosques and schools run by a Hui Sufi leader was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even as he admitted to attending an event where Bin Laden spoke.\n\n\"The Diplomat\" reported on the fact that while Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and that therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang is not directed against Islam, but rather aggressively stamping out the Uyghur separatist threat.\n\nUyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-China oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government. In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang. Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children. Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979-1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan. Han, Hui, and the Chinese government are viewed much more positively by Uyghurs specifically in Turpan, with the government providing better economic, religious, and political treatment for them.\n\nThe Uyghur terrorist organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine \"Islamic Turkistan\" has accused the Chinese \"Muslim Brotherhood\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \"infidel Chinese\" language is the language of the Hui.\n\nIn Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims).\n\nThe main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.\n\nSince the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.\n\nIn 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left.\n\nFrom Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other.\n\nTibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nIn northern Tibet Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh.\n\nTibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs 400 miles east of Lhasa at Chamdo when the Kazakhs were entering Tibet.\n\nIn 1934, 1935, 1936-1938 from Qumil Eliqsan led the Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu and the amount was estimated at 18,000, and they entered Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nTibetan troops serving under the Dalai Lama murdered the American CIA agent Douglas Mackiernan and his two White Russian helpers because he was dressed as a Kazakh, their enemy.\n\nFollowing a period of meteoric growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to \"eradicate\" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. The suppression is characterised by multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death.\n\nAn extra-constitutional body called the 6-10 Office was created to lead the suppression of Falun Gong. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families and workplaces against the group. The campaign is driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and internet. There are reports of systematic torture, illegal imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvesting and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant their belief in Falun Gong.\n\nForeign observers estimate that hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in \"re-education through labor\" camps, prisons and other detention facilities for refusing to renounce the spiritual practice. Former prisoners have reported that Falun Gong practitioners consistently received \"the longest sentences and worst treatment\" in labor camps, and in some facilities Falun Gong practitioners formed the substantial majority of detainees. As of 2009 at least 2,000 Falun Gong adherents had been tortured to death in the persecution campaign, with some observers putting the number much higher.\n\nSome international observers and judicial authorities have described the campaign against Falun Gong as a genocide. In 2009, courts in Spain and Argentina indicted senior Chinese officials for genocide and crimes against humanity for their role in orchestrating the suppression of Falun Gong.\n\nIn 2006 allegations emerged that the vital organs of non-consenting Falun Gong practitioners had been used to supply China's organ tourism industry. The Kilgour-Matas report stated in 2006, \"We believe that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners\". Ethan Gutmann interviewed over 100 witnesses and alleged that about 65,000 Falun Gong prisoners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008. In 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for \"the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners\". The Chinese government has denied the allegation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2938712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2938712", "title": "God in Jainism", "text": "God in Jainism\n\nIn Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul. This quality, however, is subdued by the soul's association with karmic matter. All souls who have achieved the natural state of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge (\"kevala jnana\"), infinite power and infinite perception are regarded as God in Jainism. Jainism rejects the idea of a creator deity responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and perfect soul, an immaterial entity cannot create or affect a material entity like the universe.\n\nFrom the essential perspective, the soul of every living organism is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God is given to the soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are countably infinite souls in the universe.\n\nAccording to \"Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra\" (a major Jain text):\n\nIn Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul (or every living organism) characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, \"Kevala Jnana\" (pure infinite knowledge), infinite perception, and perfect manifestations of (countably) infinite other attributes. There are two possible views after this point. One is to look at the soul from the perspective of the soul itself. This entails explanations of the properties of the soul, its exact structure, composition and nature, the nature of various states that arise from it and their source attributes as is done in the deep and arcane texts of Samayasāra, Niyamasara and Pravachanasara. Another view is to consider things apart from the soul and its relationships with the soul. According to this view, the qualities of a soul are subdued due to karmas of the soul. \"Karmas\" are the fundamental particles of nature in Jainism. One who achieves this state of soul through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called \"Kevalin\". A god thus becomes a liberated soul – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, \"karmas\" and finally liberated of body as well. This is called \"nirvana\" or \"moksha\".\n\nJainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is regarded as observing the \"Mahavrata\" (\"Great Vows\").\n\nGods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as \"arihantas\" and non-embodied formless gods who are called \"Siddhas\". Jainism considers the \"devīs\" and \"devas\" to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve \"moksha\".\n\nThus, there are infinite gods in Jainism, all equivalent, liberated, and infinite in the manifestation of all attributes. The Self and karmas are separate substances in Jainism, the former living and the latter non-living. The attainment of enlightenment and the one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods. Therefore, beings (Arihant) who've attained omniscience (\"kevala jnana\") are worshipped as gods. The quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism is sometimes regarded as a transtheistic religion, though it can be atheistic or polytheistic based on the way one defines \"God\".\n\nIn Jainism, the \"Pañca-Parameṣṭhi\" (Sanskrit for \"five supreme beings\") are a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The five supreme beings are:\n\nA human being who conquers all inner passions and possesses infinite right knowledge (\"Kevala Jnana\") is revered as an \"arihant\" in Jainism. They are also called \"Jinas\" (conquerors) or \"Kevalin\" (omniscient beings). An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence is able to destroy the four \"ghātiyā karmas\" and attain \"kevala jñāna\", or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four \"aghātiyā karmas\". \"Arihantas\", at the end of their human life-span, destroy all remaining \"aghātiyā karmas\" and attain Siddhahood. There are two kinds of \"kevalin\" or \"arihant\":\n\nThe word \"Tīrthaṅkara\" signifies the founder of a \"tirtha\" which means a fordable passage across a sea. The \"Tirthankara\" show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Jain philosophy divides the wheel of time in two halves, \"Utsarpiṇī\" or ascending time cycle and \"avasarpiṇī\", the descending time cycle. Exactly 24 \"Tirthankara\" are said to grace each half of the cosmic time cycle. \" \"Rishabhanatha\" was the first \"Tirthankara\" and Mahavira was the last \"Tirthankara\" of \"avasarpiṇī\".\n\n\"Tirthankara\" revive the fourfold order of \"Shraman, Shramani, Śrāvaka, and Śrāvika\" called \"sangha\". Tirthankara\" can be called teaching gods who teach the Jain philosophy. However it would be a mistake to regard the \"tirthankara\" as gods analogous to the gods of the Hindu pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship. \"Tirthankara\", being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are \"not\" the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.\n\n\"Tirthamkara-nama-karma\" is a special type of \"karma\", bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a \"tirthankara\".\n\nUltimately all \"arihantas\" become \"siddhas\", or liberated souls, at the time of their nirvana. A \"siddha\" is a soul who is permanently liberated from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the \"Karmas\" and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in \"Siddhashila\" (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy.\n\nThe Acharanga Sutra 1.197 describes \"siddhas\" in this way:\n\nSiddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. There are infinite souls who have become \"siddhas\" and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation. According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation.\n\nJains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favors or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the \"karmas\" and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term \"vandetadgunalabhdhaye\" – i.e. \"we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes\" \n\nAccording to Anne Vallely:\nJain cosmology offers an elaborate description of heavenly beings (\"devas\"), but these beings are neither viewed as creators nor as Gods; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.\n\nJainism describes existence of \"śāsanadevatās\" and \"śāsanadevīs\", the attendants of a \"Tirthankara\", who create the \"samavasarana\" or the divine preaching assembly of a \"Tirthankara\". Such heavenly beings are classified as:-\n\nThe souls on account of accumulation of meritorious \"karmas\" reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit \"karmas\" are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.\n\nĀcārya Hemachandra decries the worship of such devas:\n\nWorship of such devas is considered as \"mithyatva\" or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas.\n\nJain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Further, it asserts that no God is responsible or causal for actions in the life of any living organism. Ācārya Hemacandra in the 12th century put forth the Jain view of the universe in the \"Yogaśāstra\":\nBesides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to syllogism and deductive reasoning to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the Vedics, samkhyas, mīmāṃsās, Buddhists and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain Ācāryas. However, the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by Ācārya Jinasena in Mahāpurāna, which was quoted by Carl Sagan in his book \"Cosmos\".\n\n\n\n"}

Different honorifics might be applied depending on the particular status of the deceased. These honorifics are frequently found on gravestones, on memorial walls inside the sanctuary of synagogues, in speeches, and in writing such as in obituaries.\n\nIn writing, it is most common to use the name followed by an abbreviation of an honorific either in Hebrew or English. For examples, see chart.\n\nThe following chart shows different honorifics used, along with their abbreviation in Hebrew and English, their translation, the masculine and feminine forms, the type of person which the honorific is applied to, and examples.\n\nSome honorifics may be used for any individual. These honorifics are generally not used for rabbis or other special persons, since the specific honorifics for those people are used instead, as a sign of honor and respect. See below.\n\nThe most common honorific is \"of blessed memory,\" and the Hebrew transliteration is \"zikhrono livrakha\" (m.) / \"zikhronah livrakha\" (f.) (Hebrew: (f.) \"'\" \\ (m.) \"'\"). It is often abbreviated in English both as\" OBM \"and as\" “\"'Z\"L” The Hebrew abbreviation is \"'.\"\n\nAn alternative honorific is \"Peace be upon him/her.\" The Hebrew version is \"alav ha-shalom\" (m.) / \"aleha ha-shalom\" (f.) (Hebrew: (m.) \"עליו השלום\" / (f.) \"עליה השלום\"). It is abbreviated in English as “A\"H.” The Hebrew abbreviation is \"ע״ה.\"\n\nThis phrase is the same as the Islamic honorific \"peace be upon him\" (which is used for all prophets of Islam). However, unlike in Islamic usage, the English abbreviation \"PBUH\" is not commonly used for the Jewish honorific.\n\nThe above two may be used interchangeably; however \"of blessed memory\" is the most common.\n\nThis honorific \"May HaShem avenge his/her blood\" is generally used for an individual who perished as a result of anti-semitism, for example pogroms or the Holocaust. The term is also applied to any innocent Jew killed, whether for anti-Semitic reasons or others. The Hebrew phrase is \"HaShem yikom damo\" (m.) / \"HaShem yikom dama\" (f.) / \"HaShem yikom damam\" (pl.) and in the Hebrew: \"השם יקום דמו\" (m.) / \"השם יקום דמה\" (f.) / \"השם יקום דמם\" (pl.). The English abbreviation is “HY\"D” and in Hebrew \"הי״ד.\"\n\nThe abbreviation “זי״ע/zy\"a” stands for \"\"zekhuto yagen `aleinu\"/May his merit shield us,\" and often follows the mention of meritorious righteous ones. A variant is “זיע״א/zya\"a” which adds \"Amen\" at the end.\n\nThe honorific \"May the memory of the righteous be a blessing\" is used after the names of holy rabbis and other holy people, from . In Hebrew transliteration: \"zekher tzadik livrakha\" and in Hebrew: \"זכר צדיק לברכה.\" The English abbreviation commonly used is “ZT\"L” and in Hebrew, \"זצ״ל\" is used. It is pronounced in reading as \"\"zatzal\".\" It may be also written as “ZTz\"L”.\n\nIt is used primarily in reference to rabbis who have been deceased in recent memory.

{"id": "22288648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22288648", "title": "Islamic glass", "text": "Islamic glass\n\nThe influence of the Islamic world to the history of glass is reflected by its distribution around the world, from Europe to China, and from Russia to East Africa. Islamic glass developed a unique expression that was characterized by the introduction of new techniques and the innovation of old traditions.\n\nIslamic glass did not begin to develop a recognizable expression until the late 8th or early 9th century AD, despite Islam spreading across the Middle East and North Africa during the mid-7th century AD. Despite bringing enormous religious and socio-political changes to the region, this event appears to have not drastically affected the day-to-day workings of craft industries, nor did it cause \"extensive destruction or long-lasting disruption\". The Roman (Levant and Egypt) and Sassanian (Persia and Mesopotamia) glassmaking industries continued in much the same way they had for centuries. Following the unification of the entire region, the interaction of ideas and techniques was facilitated, allowing for the fusion of these two separate traditions with new ideas, ultimately leading to the Islamic glass industry. Roman glassmaking traditions that are important in the Islamic period include the application of glass trails as a surface embellishment, while stylistic techniques adopted from the Sassanian Empire include various styles of glass cutting. This may have developed out of the long-standing hardstone carving traditions in Persia and Mesopotamia. In regards to glass-making technology, tank furnaces used in the Levant to produce slabs of raw glass for export during the Classical Period were used during the Early Islamic Period in the same region until the 10th or 11th centuries AD.\n\nDuring the first centuries of Islamic rule, glassmakers in the Eastern Mediterranean continued to use the Roman recipe consisting of calcium-rich sand (providing the silica and lime) and mineral natron (soda component) from the Wādi el-Natrūn in Egypt, and examples of natron-based Islamic glass have been found in the Levant up to the late 9th century AD. Archaeological evidence has shown that the use of natron ceased, and plant ash became the source of soda for all Islamic glass in the following centuries. The reasons for this technological transition remain unclear, although it has been postulated that civil unrest in Egypt during the early 9th century AD led to a cut-off in the natron supply, thus forcing Islamic glassmakers to look for alternate soda sources. Evidence of experimentation with the basic glass recipe at Beth She'arim (modern Israel) during the early 9th century AD further supports this argument. A glass slab made from a tank mold from the site contained an excess amount of lime, and may be the result of mixing sand with plant ash. Although the raw glass would have been unusable due to its composition, it does suggest that at this time, Islamic glassmakers in the Levant were combining aspects of Sassanian and Roman traditions in an effort to solve the problem created by the lack of access to mineral natron. The use of plant ash, specifically from halophytic (salt-loving) plants, which were plentiful in the Middle East due to the climate, was well known in Persia and Mesopotamia. It undoubtedly would not take long for the glassmakers in the Near East to correct their manufacturing errors and begin using the plant ash-based recipe used further east.\n\nThe glass industry in the Early Islamic Period can initially be characterized as a continuation of older traditions, coinciding with the Umayyad Caliphate, the first Islamic dynasty (Israeli 2003, 319). Following the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750 AD, the capital of the Islamic world was moved from Damascus in the Levant to Baghdad in Mesopotamia. This led to a cultural shift away from the influences of Classical traditions, and allowed for the development of an 'Islamic' expression.\n\nThe production of glass during this period is concentrated in three main regions of the Islamic world. Firstly, the Eastern Mediterranean remained a centre of glass production, as it had been for centuries. Excavations at Qal'at Sem'an in northern Syria, Tyre in Lebanon, Beth She'arim and Bet Eli'ezer in Israel, and at Fustat (Old Cairo) in Egypt have all shown evidence for glass production, including numerous vessels, raw glass, and their associated furnaces. Also adding to our understanding of the glass industry in this region is the aforementioned shipwreck at Serçe Liman. In Persia, a formerly Sassanian region, archaeological activity has located a number of sites with large deposits of Early Islamic Glass, including Nishapur, Siraf, and Susa. Numerous kilns suggest Nishapur was an important production centre, and the identification of a local type of glass at Siraf suggests the same for that site. In Mesopotamia, excavations at Samarra, a temporary capital of the Abbasid Caliphate during the mid-9th century AD, produced a wide range of glass vessels, while work at al-Madā'in (former Ctesiphon) and Raqqa (on the Euphrates River in modern Syria) provide evidence for glass production in the region. However, it is difficult to clearly identify the place in which a glass piece was manufactured without the presence of wastes (pieces broken and discarded in the process of making), which indicate that the location was a site of glassmaking. Furthermore, during the Abbasid caliphate, both glassmakers and their products moved throughout the empire, leading to dispersion of glassware and \"universality of style\", which further prevents the identification of a piece's birthplace. As the Seljuk empire arose from Seljuk generals conquering lands under the Abbasid flag only nominally, it is likely that glass technology, style, and trade might have continued similarly under the Seljuks as it did under the Abbasids. Despite the increasing ability and style of Islamic glassmakers during this time, few pieces were signed or dated, making identification of a piece's location of origin unfortunately difficult. Glass pieces are typically dated by stylistic comparisons to other pieces from the era.\n\nThe majority of the decorative traditions used in the Early Islamic Period concerned the manipulation of the glass itself, and included trail-application, carving, and mold-blowing. As mentioned previously, glass-carving and trail application are a continuation of older techniques, the former associated with Sassanian glassmaking and the latter with Roman traditions. In relief cutting, a specialized form of glass-carving most often used on colourless and transparent glass, \"the area surrounding the decorative elements was carved back to the ground, thus leaving the former in relief\".\nUnlike relief cutting, trail application, or thread trailing, allowed decoration with hot glass. The glassblower would manipulate molten glass while still malleable and create patterns, handles, or flanges. While cutting reached the height of its popularity from the 9th–11th centuries CE, thread-trailing became more widely used during the 11th–12th centuries, when Seljuq glassmakers were considered at the height of their skill.\n\nMold-blowing, based on Roman traditions from the 1st century CE, is another specialized technique that spread widely throughout the Islamic Mediterranean world during this period. Two distinct types of molds are known archaeologically; a two-part mold made up of separate halves, and the 'dip' mold, whereby the viscous glass is placed entirely inside one mold. The molds were often made of bronze, although there are examples of some being ceramic. Molds also typically mold that often included a carved pattern; the finished piece would take on the shape and style of the mold (Carboni and Adamjee 2002). With these advances in glassmaking technology, artisans began to stylize and simplify their designs, emphasizing designs with \"no foreground or background\" and \"plain but beautiful vessels\".\n\nA final decorative technology that is a distinct marker of the Early Islamic Period is the use of lustre painting. While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in Fustat, others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and Coptic Egypt during the centuries preceding the rise of Islam. Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD, although true lustre technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD. Lustre painting on glass involves the application of copper and silver pigments, followed by a specific firing that allows for the ionic exchange of Ag+ and Cu+ with the glass, resulting in a metallic sheen fully bound to the vessel. Regardless of its specific origins, lustre decoration was a key technology in glass production that continued to develop throughout the Early Islamic Period, and spread not only geographically, but also to other material industries in the form of glazed ceramics.\n\nThis is the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glassmaking, despite the fractious nature of the Islamic world. Persia and Mesopotamia (along with parts of Syria for some time) came under control of the Seljuq Turks, and later the Mongols, while in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Ayyubid and Mamluk Dynasties held sway. Furthermore, this period saw European interruptions into the Middle East due to the Crusades. Glass production seemingly ceased to exist in Persia and Mesopotamia, and little is known about the reasons for this. However, in the earlier part of this period, there is evidence for glass-making in Central Asia, for example at Kuva in modern Uzbekistan. This tradition presumably ended with the Mongol invasions of the mid-13th century that destroyed other sites in the region.\n\nThe glass-producing regions of Syria and Egypt continued their industries. It is for the materials excavated and produced at sites such as Samsat in southern Turkey, Aleppo and Damascus in Syria, Hebron in the Levant, and Cairo that this period is referred to as the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glass. The Middle Islamic Period is characterized by the perfection of various polychrome decorative traditions, the most important of which are marvering, enamelling, and gilding, while relief-carving and lustre painting seemingly fell out of fashion. Marvering involves applying a continuous trail of opaque glass (in various colours such as white, red, yellow, or pale blue) around the body of a glass object. This trail may then be manipulated by pulling it, creating a characteristic 'wavy' pattern. The object was then rolled on a marver (a stone or iron slab) to work the trail into the glass vessel itself. This technique, used on a variety of glass objects from bowls and bottles to chess pieces, was introduced around the late 12th century AD, but is in fact a revival of a much older glass-working tradition that has its origins in the Late Bronze Age in Egypt>\nGilding during this period involved applying small amounts of gold in suspension onto a glass body, followed by a low firing to fuse the two materials, and was adopted from Byzantine traditions. This technique was often combined with enamelling, the application of ground glass with a colourant, to traditional and new vessel forms, and represents the height of Islamic glassmaking. Enamelling, a resurrection of older techniques, was first practiced in the Islamic world at Raqqa (Syria) during the late 12th century, but also spread to Cairo during Mamluk rule. A study of various enamelled vessels, including beakers and mosque lamps, suggests that there are two subtle yet distinct firing practices, possibly representing two distinct production centres or glass-working traditions. Due to its high demand, enamelled glass was exported throughout the Islamic world, Europe, and China during this period. Enamelling eventually ended in Syria and Egypt following disruption by various Mongol invasions from the 13th through to the 15th centuries AD.\n\nA final note on glass from the Middle Islamic Period is the increased interaction between the Middle East and Europe. The Crusades allowed for the European discovery of Islamic gilded and enamelled vessels. The 'Goblet of the Eight Princes' brought to France from the Levant is one of the earliest examples of this technique. Furthermore, large amounts of raw plant ash were exported solely to Venice, fuelling that city's glass industries. It was also in Venice that enamelling was resurrected following its decline in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Late Islamic Period is dominated by three main empires and areas of glass production; the Ottomans in Turkey, the Safavid (and later the Zand and Qajar) Dynasty in Persia, and the Mughals in northern India. The most important over-riding characteristic of glass production in this period is the \"direct influence of European glass\" and, in particular, that of Venice, Bohemia (in the 18th century), and the Dutch. The production of high-quality fine glass essentially ended in Egypt, Syria, and Persia, and it was only in India during the 17th century that Islamic glass regained a high level of artistic expression following European influence. The lack of court patronage for glassmaking and the high quality of European glass contributed to a decline in the industry; however, utilitarian glass was still being made in the traditional centres.\nHistorical documents and accounts, such as the \"Surname-i Humayun\", show the presence of glassmaking, and a glassmaker's guild, in Istanbul, as well as production at Beykoz on the coast of the Bosphorus, in the Ottoman Empire. The glass made at these centres was not of great quality and was highly influenced by Venetian and Bohemian styles and techniques. In Persia, evidence for glassmaking following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century does not reappear until the Safavid period (17th century). European travellers wrote accounts of glass factories in Shiraz, and it is thought that transplanted Italian craftsmen brought about this revival. No significant decorative treatments or technical characteristics of glass were introduced or revived during this period in Persia. Bottle and jug forms with simple applied or ribbed decoration, made from coloured transparent glass, were common, and are linked to the Shirazi wine industry.\n\nMughal glassmaking in India, on the other hand, saw a return to the enamelling and gilding traditions from the Middle Islamic Period, as well as the glass–carving techniques used in Persia during the earliest centuries of the Islamic world. Glass workshops and factories were initially found near the Mughal capital of Agra, Patna (eastern India), and in Gujarat province (western India), and by the 18th century had spread to other regions in western India. New forms were introduced using these older Islamic glass-working techniques, and of these, \"nargileh\" (water pipe) bases became the most dominant. Square bottles based on Dutch forms, decorated with enamelling and gilding in Indian motifs, are another important expression in Mughal glassmaking, and were produced at Bhuj, Kutch, and in Gujarat. Ethnographic study of current glass production in Jalesar shows fundamental similarities between this site and the Early Islamic tank furnaces found in the Levant, despite differences in the shape of the structures (round in India, rectangular at Bet She'arim), highlighting the technological continuity of the glass industry throughout the Islamic period.\n\nWhile the various functions of Islamic glass have been touched upon during the previous discussion (mosque lamps from the Middle Islamic Period, wine bottles from Safavid Persia, \"nargileh\" bases from Mughal India), glass filled a multitude of roles throughout the history of the Islamic world. A variety of vessel forms used to hold a wide range of materials make up the bulk of glass objects (bowls, goblets, dishes, perfume bottles, etc.), and have seen the most attention from Islamic glass scholars (Carboni 2001; Israeli 2003; Kröger 1995; Pinder-Wilson 1991; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001). Some of the more distinct vessel functions from the Islamic period include inkwells (Israeli 2003, 345), \"qumqum\" or perfume sprinklers, and vessels associated with Islamic science and medicine such as alembics, test-tubes, and cuppers. Glass was also used for aesthetic purposes in the form of decorative figurines, and for jewellery as bracelets (Carboni 1994; Spaer 1992) and beads. The bracelets, in particular, may prove to be an important archaeological tool in the dating of Islamic sites. Glass also filled various utilitarian roles, with evidence of use as windows, and as coin weights. The variety of functions filled by glass and the sheer bulk of the material found through excavation further highlights its significance as a distinct and highly developed material industry throughout the Islamic world.\n\nIslamic glass from this period has been given relatively little attention by scholars. One exception to this was the work carried out by Carl J. Lamm (1902–1987). Lamm catalogued and classified the glass finds from important Islamic sites; for example Susa in Iran (Lamm 1931), and at Samarra in Iraq (Lamm 1928). One of the most important discoveries in the field of Islamic glass was a shipwreck dated to around 1036 AD on the Turkey coast at Serçe Liman. The recovered cargo included vessel fragments and glass cullet exported from Syria. The significance of these finds lies in the information they can tell us about the production and distribution of Islamic glass. Despite this, the majority of studies have concentrated on stylistic and decorative classification (Carboni 2001; Kröger 1995; Lamm 1928; Lamm 1931; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001), and as such technological aspects of the industry, as well as undecorated vessels and objects, have often been overlooked within the field. This, in particular, is frustrating because the majority of glass finds during the Islamic period are undecorated and used for utilitarian purposes.\n\n\n"}

Muslims believe the Qur'an, which Muslims hold to be a revelation to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was given as a remedy and that it identifies three sets of books from the Bible as genuine divine revelation given to trusted messengers: the \"Tawrat\" (\"Torah\") given to Musa (Moses), the \"Zabur\" (\"Psalms\") given to Daud (David) and the \"Injil\" (\"Gospel\") given to Isa (Jesus). They believe that the Qur'an, these books, and the \"Suhuf Ibrahim\" (\"Scrolls of Abraham\", which they believe is currently lost) together constitute Islam's scripture. Belief that this scripture is divinely inspired is one of Islam's fundamental tenets, and traditional Muslim teaching stresses those passages in the Qur'an which affirm the Christian Gospel and the Hebrew Torah as valid revelations of God and paths to salvation.\n\nEarly Muslims held multiple perspectives in regard to the Bible.\n\nThe Qur'an mentions the word Torah eighteen times and confirms that it was The Word Of God. However, they believe that there have been additions and subtractions made to the Torah. The early Qu'ran exeget Tabari referred to the Torah from the Jewish as \"the Torah that they possess today\".\n\nSura An-Nisa 4:163 of the Qur'an states \"and to David We gave the Psalms\". Therefore, Islam claims the Psalms as being inspired of God. The Qur'an mentions the word Zabur three times (Qur'an 17:55; 21:105)\n\nWhen the Qur'an speaks of the Gospel, it is believed to refer to an original divine revelation from Jesus Christ. The canonical Gospels from the bible are commonly assumed not to be the original teachings of Jesus or were corrupted over time. Some scholars suggested the original Gospel may be the Gospel of Barnabas.\n\nDeuteronomy 18:18 has often been considered a prophecy of Muhammad by Muslim scholars. Al-Samawal al-Maghribi, a medieval Jewish mathematician who converted to Islam, pointed to Deuteronomy 18:18 in his book \"Confutation of the Jews\" as a prophecy fulfilled by Muhammad. Samawal argued in his book that since the children of Esau are described in Deuteronomy 2:4-6 and Numbers 20:14 as the brethren of the children of Israel, the children of Ishmael can also be described the same way. Some Muslim writers, like Muhammad Ali and Fethullah Gülen, have interpreted several verses in the Quran as implying that Muhammad was alluded to in Deuteronomy 18:18, including Quran 46:10 and 73:15.\n\nHistorians interpret Deuteronomy 18:18 as referring to a future member of the community of Israel who reenacts the function of Moses, serving as act as a mediator for the covenant between YHWH and the Israelites. Walter Brueggemann writes that \"The primary requirement for the prophet, like\nthe king in 17:15, is that he or she must be a member of Israel, thoroughly situated in the traditions and claims of the Yahwistic covenant.\" The Gospels of Matthew and John both make Jesus out to be the prophet like Moses from Deuteronomy 18.\n\nMany Muslim scholars have argued that the Greek words \"paraklytos\" (comforter) and \"periklutos\" (famous/illustrious) were used interchangeably, and therefore, these verses constitute Jesus prophesying the coming of Muhammad.\n\nCritical scholarship recognizes that the Paraclete, or Advocate, is mentioned five times throughout John's Gospel (John 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26-27; 16:7-11; 16:13-17). The Advocate, called the \"Spirit of Truth\" is considered the Holy Spirit; a replacement for Jesus into the world after Jesus leaves, still dependent on Christ (14:6) and sent by the Father at Jesus' demand (14:16, 24). The Spirit is said to permanently remain with the disciples (14:18-21). John's Gospel says that the world cannot receive the Spirit though the Spirit can abide within the disciples (14:17). The Spirit will accuse the world of sin (16:9) and glorify Jesus (16:14), and though it is 'the spirit that gives life', the spirit does not add new revelations to those of Jesus.\n\nSome of the people revered in both the Qur'an and the Bible include: Aaron, Abel, Abraham, Adam, Cain, David, the disciples of Jesus, Elias, Elisha, Enoch, Eve, Ezra, Goliath, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Jesus, John the Baptist, Jonah, Joseph, Lot, Mary, Moses, Noah, the Pharaohs of Egypt, Samuel, Saul, Solomon, and Zacharias.\n\n"}

The narrative contains political debates about the future of the city in which he engaged with the aid of a translator of mixed Italian and Chinese ancestry.\n\nThe Italian manuscript from which David Selbourne, an Englishman residing in Italy, professed to have made his translation, published as \"The City of Light: The Hidden Journal of the Man Who Entered China Four Years Before Marco Polo\", has not come to light, even in photocopies; its possessor still remains anonymous. Selbourne asserts that \"provenance and rights of ownership over it are unclear,\" motivating its owner's desire for anonymity.\n\nIn 1997, Little, Brown and Company was prepared to publish the diary, under the title \"The City of Light\" in the United States. The house had just published the book in the UK when word spread that China scholar Jonathan Spence, the Sterling Professor of History at Yale, had written a book review for \"The New York Times\" that questioned the book's authenticity. Despite growing pressure, David Selbourne has continued to refuse to make the original manuscript available for public scrutiny. At the last minute, in September 1997, Little, Brown and Co. pulled the diary from US publication, scheduled for 3 November.\n\nT. H. Barrett, School of Oriental and African Studies, in \"The London Review of Books\", 30 October 1997, described the text as a forgery; he noted that the garbled name \"Baiciu\" for a famous rebel \"was only known to the narrator of the account in a form which derived from an 18th-century misreading of an Arabic manuscript— as good a proof as any that something is badly amiss.\" Roz Kaveny, reviewing the book in \"New Statesman\" noted that \"By coincidence, much of what Jacob d'Ancona dislikes in 13th-century China is what David Selbourne dislikes in late-20th century Britain\" and thought that she recognized in the dialectical principles with which d'Ancona controverts his ideological opponents close parallels with Selbourne's own rhetorical techniques. She concluded that one might prefer \"to suppose that the dilemma, and the document, are mirages, that his book is a postmodernist literary device.\"\n\nIn December 2007 a University of London professor read a public lecture \"The Faking of 'The City of Light'\", to which he neglected to invite Selbourne. Bernard Wasserstein, president of the Oxford Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and his brother, David, professor of Islamic history at Tel Aviv University publicly called attention to an anachronism, Jacob's arrival at a \"mellah\" in the Persian Gulf, a descriptive for a ghetto based on the root for \"salt\", that was not used until the 15th century, in Morocco.\n\nThe first writer to come forward to support the text's authenticity in public was the right-wing journalist Melanie Phillips, who took issue with Barrett in the \"Sunday Times\", 8 October 1998, and who responded, as did Selbourne, to Barrett's letter to \"LRB\" Selbourne further responded with a \"Preface to the American Edition\" (Lightning Source, 2003) when the Kensington imprint Citadel Press published \"The City of Light: the Hidden Journal of the Man Who Entered China Four Years Before Marco Polo\" in 2000. A Chinese translation was published in Shanghai, December 1999, under the direction of Prof. Li Xue Qin, Academy of Social Sciences, Selbourne reported.\n\n\n\n"}

However, sagehood is hard to attain and so Confucius created the \"junzi\", gentleman, which more individuals could achieve. Zhu Xi defined \"junzi\" as second only to the sage. \n\n\"Junzi\" has many characteristics. \"Junzi\" can live with poverty; \"Junzi\" does more and speaks less. A \"junzi\" is loyal, obedient and knowledgeable. \"Junzi\" disciplines himself. Among these, \"ren\" is the core of becoming \"junzi\".\n\nAs the potential leader of a nation, the son of the ruler is raised to express superior ethical and moral positions while gaining inner peace through virtue. To Confucius, the \"junzi\" sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself can become a \"junzi\".\n\nBy contrast the \"xiaoren\" (, \"xiăorén\", \"small or petty person\") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gain. The petty person is egotistic and does not consider the consequences of his actions. Should the ruler be surrounded by \"xiaoren\" as opposed to \"junzi\", his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such \"xiaoren\" individuals can range from those who continually indulge in sensual and emotional pleasures to the career politician who is interested merely in power and fame; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.\n\nThe \"junzi\" rules by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure virtue would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that government behaves much like family. Thus at all levels filial piety promotes harmony and the \"junzi\" acts as a beacon for this piety.\n\n"}

He is credited with the founding of four monasteries in the Middle and Upper Volga regions of Russia.\n\nThe story of saint Macarius is based on \"Chet’yi-Minei\" (the standard Russian Orthodox \"Lives of the Saints\") as well as to other old manuscripts. One of them, kept in Makaryev Unzhensky Monastery, was first inventoried in 1835. The other is kept in Makaryev Zheltovodsky Convent, and is written in the 17th century hand.\n\nChurch scholars believe that he was most likely born in 1349. His home town, Nizhny Novgorod, was the capital of the Principality of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod, ruled by Prince Constantine Vasilyevich. As most other Russian principalities of the time, his land was dominated by the Golden Horde overlords.\n\nMacarius was baptised in his parents' parish church, Church of Holy Myrrhbearers (). His baptismal name is not known.\n\nAccording to the \"Life of St. Macarius\", when he was still a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but eventually they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.\n\nMacarius grew as a pious boy, especially interested in the lives of the Orthodox hermits of the past ages, living in the wilderness alone or in small lavra communities. For that reason, he enjoyed visiting not only his parish church, but also Pechersky Ascension Monastery, which had been recently founded by Saint Dionysius (later known as Saint Dionysius of Suzdal, the archbishop) who had come to Nizhny Novgorod from the famous Kiev Pechersky (Cave) Lavra. At the age of 12, he sneaked out of his parents' house and joined Pechersky Ascension Monastery, and received the monastic name of Macarius (, Makariy). He became one of the twelve disciples of St. Dionysius, and was known for the strictness of his fast and the fervency of his prayer.\n\nIn 1374, St. Dionysius was appointed the archbishop of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod and left the monastery. Soon, Macarius left the monastery too. He travelled up the Volga, spent some time with St. Tikhon on the Lukh River, and then founded a monastery in honor of Epiphany of Jesus Christ (now Makaryev Reshma Monastery, Макариев-Решемский мужской монастырь, near the village of Reshma in today's Kineshma district or Kostroma Oblast).\nHe did not stay long in his new monastery, however. He wanted to live in the wilderness as a hermit. He travelled down the Volga, and liked the site at the Yellow Water Lake (Желтоводское озеро, Zheltovodskoe Ozero), near the fall of the Kerzhenets into the Volga, some one hundred kilometers downstream from Nizhny Novgorod. In those days, this was no-man's land between the Russian principalities, and the Kazan Khanate.\n\nMacarius dug a small cave by the waters of the Yellow Water Lake, and stayed there day and night, emulating the great hermits of the past. However, his solitude did not last long: pious people from far and wide came to his hermitage, some to seek his blessing, others to join him in hermetic life. In 1434, he founded Zheltovodsky Makariev Monastery of Holy Trinity for his disciples.\n\nThe asceticism of Venerable Macarius, together with his love of his neighbors, attracted not only Christians but also many local pagan Mordvin, Mari, Chuvash and Muslim Tatar people. He baptised many in Yellow Water Lake.\n\nIn 1439, the monastery was destroyed during the invasion of Russia by the khan Olug Moxammat of Kazan. Most of the monks were killed; Macarius and a few other Christians were taken to Kazan as prisoners. The khan, impressed by the pious life of\nthe nonagenarian abbot, released him and a few other Christian prisoners, and allowed him to bury the killed.\n\nOn the way back from Kazan to the Yellow Water Lake, Macarius is said to have stopped at a site near today's Sviyazhsk, blessing the future location of Makaryev Sviyazhsk Monastery. However, Macarius and his companions were not allowed to stay at the Yellow Water Lake site. He decided to leave a safe distance between themselves and the Khanate, and went to the forests of the Unzha River, a few hundred kilometers north of the Nizhny. It is a long way, and the travellers soon run out of food, but were miraculously saved from starvation (Venerable Macarius' Miracle of the Moose). Once they reached the Unzha, still in 1439, Macarius and his party founded Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery (now a convent).\n\nAccording to legend, Macarius lived in his new monastery for a few more years, healing the sick and expelling devils from possessed people. He died on July 25 1444, at the age of 95, after an 83-year monastic career. After the two famous cloisters he founded, he is called Venerable Macarius of Yellow Water Lake and Unzha, the Miracle Worker.\n\nAfter the death of Macarius, a wooden church was built over his grave, and the Unzha monastery was named after him. The locals often reported being miraculously healed of various diseases after visiting his grave; his help was said to have repelled a Tatar invasion, and later, during the Time of Troubles, to protect the region against the Polish troops. The fame of the founder attracted pilgrims and novices to the monasteries, helping its growth.\n\nWhen Feodor Romanov, the father of Russia's new Csar Michael, is enthroned as Patriarch Philaret of Moscow in 1619, he sends a commission to the Unzha to investigate the miracles. He mentions these miracles as confirmed in his letter to his son the Csar in September 1619, and encourages Michael to visit Macarius' Unzha Monastery in fulfillment of the vow he had given earlier (which Michael promptly does). It is thought that it was at that time that Venerable Macarius was canonized by a Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church, which made his veneration nationwide.\n\nThe Holy Relics of Venerable Macarius were discovered in 1671, during a burial in the church where his body had been buried.\nAfter several years of disagreements as to whether the relics were genuine, and some minor miracles that convinced disbelievers that they were, they were put to rest in a reliquary in Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery. In 1929, Soviet authorities closed the monastery, and most of the relics ended up in the local history museum at Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast, where they were kept in storage until 1990, when they were return to Kostroma Eparchy (diocese). In 1995, these relics (bones and vestments) were brought back to Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery.\n\nThe head of Macarius, however, was missing. It was not until 2005 that the Eparchy (Archdiocese) of Nizhny Novgorod was contacted by a priest who had inherited the Head (or most of it, at any rate) from his brother, also a priest, who in his turn had saved it from the Bolsheviks some time after the closing of the Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery in 1929. The priests had reverently kept the relics in their homes for many years, until they felt secure that the Russian Church is reborn and is restoring Macarius' monasteries. After the special commission of the archdiocese, with the forensic experts' help,\nestablished genuineness of the relics, their return was celebrated at a special service in the Holy Saviour Cathedral in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin on March 23, 2006. \nSince then, the Head was kept in a special portable reliquary in Pechersky Ascension Monastery in Nizhny Novgorod, which the clerics can reverently take with them on a visit to a nursing home or to celebrate Feast of Venerable Macarius at his other, Zheltovodsky Monastery.\n\nOn the occasion of Macarius' feast in 2007, the Honorable Head of Venerable Macarius was permanently transferred from Nizhny Novgorod to Makaryev Zheltovodsky Monastery (Convent). The transfer took place during August 3–7, 2007. The prized relic, accompanied by Archbishop Georgy of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas and other ecclesiastical officials of Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy, was transported down the Volga by the boat \"Alexander Peresvet\" during August 3–7, 2007, with stopovers in Bor, \nKstovo and Lyskovo. Religious processions were organized in the cities visited,\nto carry Macarius' head from the Volga docksides to local churches for appropriate celebrations.\n\nMacarius is considered the patron saint of craftsmen, merchants, and travellers, as well as of Makariev Fair. He is especially venerated in the Archdioceses (Eparchies) of Nizhny Novgorod, Ivanovo, and Kostroma—the lands where he performed his earthly works.\n\nIn some monasteries, such as Pechersky Ascension Monastery in Nizhny Novgorod, one can request a prayer to Venerable Macarius for success in business or \"getting out of poverty\" (избавление от нищеты).\n\nRussian Orthodox Church celebrates two Feasts of St. Macarius:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3488006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488006", "title": "Messianic Age", "text": "Messianic Age\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, the Messianic Age is the future period of time on Earth in which the messiah will reign and bring universal peace and brotherhood, without any evil. Many believe that there will be such an age; some refer to it as the consummate \"kingdom of God\" or the \"world to come\".\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Era will be one of global peace and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the furtherment of the knowledge of the Creator. The theme of the Messiah ushering in an era of global peace is encapsulated in two of the most famous scriptural passages from the Book of Isaiah:\n\nIn his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides describes the Messianic Era:\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the Midrash, and the ancient Kabbalistic work, the Zohar, the Messiah must arrive before the year 6000 from the time of creation. In Orthodox Jewish belief, the Hebrew calendar dates to the time of creation, making this correspond to the year 2240 on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Midrash comments:\n\"Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The seventh eon is entirely Shabbat and rest for life everlasting.\"\n\nThere is a kabbalistic tradition that maintains that each of the seven days of the week, which are based upon the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, the Sabbath day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal 'rest' - the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium perforce begins with the year 6000, and is the latest time the Messiah can come. Supporting and elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including Rabbeinu Bachya, Abraham ibn Ezra, the Ramban, Isaac Abrabanel, the Ramchal, the Vilna Gaon, Aryeh Kaplan, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe.\n\nIn Hasidic Judaism, event that marked a start of the building of the messianic era was destruction of the 2nd Temple by the Romans in 70 CE and by subsequent times of the exile. They last until today. According to Yehuda Leib Schapiro, dean of the Yeshiva Gedola Rabbinical College of Greater Miami, what was old had to be destroyed to give room to the construction of the New Messianic Temple and to the future revelation of Ha-Shem that will surpass anything which is known until now. That is the meaning of the festival of Tisha B'Av.\n\nChristian understanding of the messianic age heavily depends on Jewish Scriptures, especially the Prophets. The characteristic of the messianic age, as shown in the Scriptures, was to be an extraordinary outpouring of the Spirit on all people. It should bring them special gifts and charisms. Most eminent prophecies are found in the Book of Zechariah 4:6b; 6:8 and the Book of Joel 3:1-2 (cf. Nb 11:29). Acts of the Apostles refer to them proclaiming that the word of the prophets was made flesh in Jesus on the day of Pentecost. Now, \"he has received from the Father the Holy spirit, who was promised.\" (Acts 2:16-21.17.33) According to Isaiah, the messianic age was to have its anointed leader, the Messiah, who would be filled with the gifts of the spirit to be able to accomplish his saving work. (Is 11:1-3; 42:1; 61:1; see also Mt 3:16)\n\nJesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the messianic age. (cf.Mt 12:28). Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.\n\nAccording to the Book of Ezekiel, apart from bestowing special charismatic gifts, the Spirit would build the messianic age in the hearts of people by exercising their inward renewal resulting in exceptional adherence to the Law of God (cf. Ezk 11:19; 36:26-27; 37:14; Ps 51:12-15; Is 32:15-19; Zc 12:10). According to the Book of Jeremiah, messianic times would be sealed by the \"new covenant\", final and eternal one, written ″on their hearts″ (Jr 31:31). Paul spoke about that new covenant in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians 3:6. Isaiah used the image of the life-giving water \"poured out on the thirsty soil\". People, \"like willows on the banks of a stream\" would have access to the Spirit which would enable them to bring fruits of integrity and holiness (Is 44:3) The Gospel of John would refer to that in the meeting of Jesus with the Samaritan woman at the well of Jacob: \"the water that I shall give will become a spring of water within, welling up for eternal life.\" (Jn 4:14) Ezekiel would say that the holiness of the people would in turn be met by special love, favour and protection from God: \"I will make a covenant of peace\" and \"set up my sanctuary among them for ever.\" (Ezk 37:24; 39:29)\n\nChristian eschatology points out to gradual character of the Messianic Age. According to realized eschatology, the Messianic Era, a time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without crime, war and poverty, to some extent, is already here. With the crucifixion of Jesus the Messianic Era had begun, but according to inaugurated eschatology it will completed and brought to perfection by the parousia of Christ.\n\nIn the past, the messianic age was sometimes interpreted in terms of Millenarianism. The Book of Revelation 20:2-3 gives an image of a 1000-year period in which Satan is to be bound so that he cannot influence those living on the Earth, and Jesus Christ will reign on the Earth with resurrected saints. After that Satan will be defeated once and for all, the Earth and heaven will pass away, and people will face judgment by Jesus Christ to determine whether or not they will enter the new heaven and earth that will be established. (Revelation 21)\n\nAccording to the Nicene Creed (381), professed by most Christians, after his ascension, enthronement at the Right hand of God, the time will come when Jesus will return to fully establish the Kingdom of God of the World to Come.\n\nThe Quran states that Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary) was the Messiah or \"Prophet\" sent to the Jews. Muslims believe he is alive in Heaven, and will return to Earth to defeat the Masih ad-Dajjal, an anti-messiah comparable to the Christian Antichrist and the Jewish Armilus.\n\nA hadith in Abu Dawud (37:4310) says:\nBoth Sunni and Shia Muslims agree Imam Mahdi will arrive first, and after him, Jesus. Jesus will proclaim that the true leader is al-Mahdi. A war, literally Jihad (Jihade Asghar) will be fought—the Dajjal (evil) against al-Mahdi and Jesus (good). This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Jesus slays al-Dajjāl at the Gate of Lud, he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is the true and final word from God to humanity as Yusuf Ali's translation reads:\nHe will live for several years, marry, have children and will be buried in Medina.\n\nA hadith in Sahih Bukhari (Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:55:658) says:\nVery few scholars outside of Orthodox Islam reject all the quotes (Hadith) attributed to Muhammad that mention the second return of Jesus, the Dajjal and Imam Mahdi, believing that they have no Quranic basis. However, Quran emphatically rejects the implication of termination of Jesus’ life when he was allegedly crucified. Yusuf Ali's translation reads:\n\nMany classical commentators such as Ibn Kathir, At-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, Suyuti, al-Undlusi (Bahr al-Muhit), Abu al-Fadl al-Alusi (Ruh al-Maani) clearly mention that verse 43:61 of the Qur'an refers to the descent of Jesus before the Day of Resurrection, indicating that Jesus would be the Sign that the Hour is close.\n\nIn Ahmadiyya Islam, the present age (the Messianic age) has been a witness to the wrath of God with the occurrence of the World Wars and the frequency of natural disasters. In Ahmadiyya, Ghulam Ahmad (d.1908) is seen as the promised Messiah whose Islamic teachings will establish spiritual reform and ultimately establish an age of peace upon earth. This age continues for around a thousand years as per Judeo-Christian prophecies; and is characterised by the assembling of mankind under one faith that is Islam as per Ahmadiyya belief.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, the \"Messianic Age\" refers to a 1000-year period beginning with the Declaration of Bahá'u'lláh in 1863. Bahá'ís believe the period of peace and prosperity is gradually unfolding and will culminate in the appearance of \"The Most Great Peace\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1375891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1375891", "title": "Missionary kid", "text": "Missionary kid\n\nMissionary kids (or MKs) are the children of missionary parents, and thus born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the \"mission-field\"). They form a subset of third culture kids (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their \"home\" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating \"back\" into their \"home\" culture. The resulting feeling is described as \"reverse culture shock\".\n\nThere is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by Ruth Hill Useem, TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture. TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.\n\nIn the past MKs usually were thought of only as American or European, but there is a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from South Korea and from Latin America. Generally, this term applies to Protestant Christians;; however, it can be applied to any denomination of a religion.\n\nWhile MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. David C. Pollock and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they \"should\" feel connected). Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their \"home\" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:\n\nWhen MKs first transition to their new or \"host\" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.\n\nChildren in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together.\n\nMKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be \"homesick\" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.\n\nChildren who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is \"the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture.\" MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.\n\nTo help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called \"Mu Kappa International\". Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at Taylor University, and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities.\n\nAnother frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks. Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the Church, the OSA is responsible for directing legal affairs, public relations, pursuing investigations, publicizing the Church's \"social betterment works,\" and \"oversee[ing its] social reform programs\". Some observers outside the Church have characterized the department as an intelligence agency, comparing it variously to the CIA or the KGB. The department has targeted critics of the Church with dead agent operations and character assassination.\n\nOSA is the successor to the now-defunct Guardian's Office, which was responsible for Operation Snow White and Operation Freakout; both are in Department 20 in the Scientology organizational chart. The most recent head of OSA International was Mike Rinder, who has since departed from the organization.\n\nAt local Scientology organizations, directors (Special Affairs, Legal, Public Affairs) are OSA staff members. Local Directors of Special Affairs are known as DSAs. Members of the Office of Special Affairs are drawn from the Sea Org.\n\nIn addition to regular staff, some church members also act as volunteer collaborators for the office, which cuts down on private investigation and legal research expenses. Some volunteers participate under the notion that they receive special \"ethics protection\". In one case a volunteer who read critical information about Scientology on the internet was led to believe that he would be unable to continue receiving services unless he performed a series of investigations for OSA.\n\nThe Guardian's Office was established in 1966, and its initial mission was to protect the interests of the Church of Scientology, and gather information on agencies and individuals deemed enemies of the organization. The Guardian's Office was also charged with internal monitoring of current Scientologists, in particular heretics and notable defectors. L. Ron Hubbard put his wife Mary Sue Hubbard in charge of the Guardian's Office, and it was initially headquartered at Saint Hill Manor, in England. The Guardian's Office functioned effectively as an Intelligence Bureau of the Church of Scientology, and planted members in key positions within federal government agencies, in order to obtain confidential material. Most branches of the Church of Scientology soon had at least one member from the Guardian's Office on its staff, and the Guardian's Office itself had its own secret Intelligence Bureau at the top of its organizational structure. The Guardian's Office was disbanded in 1983, and the bulk of its previous functions were then assigned to the Office of Special Affairs.\n\nGarry Scarff has said that he used to be an OSA operative. He has made a number of statements about the inner workings of OSA, many of which are disputed by the Church. In a sworn deposition taken between July and August 1993 and submitted in \"Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz\", Scarff testified, \"...I was directed, one, to go to Chicago, Illinois and to murder Cynthia Kisser, Cynthia Kisser being the Executive Director of the Cult Awareness Network, by a staged car accident.\" Kisser was not killed, and Scarff said: \"I could not bring myself to harm or kill anybody.\"\n\nTory Christman, a former volunteer for OSA has stated that the organization hired private investigators, fabricated criminal charges and harassed their targets, including at their place of employment, as well as their family members.\nBonnie Woods, a former member who began counselling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a \"hate campaigner\" with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed to issue an apology and pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 costs to the Woods.\n\nNancy Many was a high-level GO operative during Operation Freakout, and in a 2013 television interview for \"Dangerous Persuasions\" on the Discovery Channel, described intimate details of the operation to harass Paulette Cooper, including her own personal involvement. In the documentary she also explicitly confirmed the existence of \"The Messianic Program\", a GO interrogation program designed specifically to test the subjects reaction to the teaching that L. Ron Hubbard was \"on level with Jesus and Buddha\". This program was only ever administered to trusted GO agents by their superiors, and never to outside Scientologists, indicating its extremely classified nature.\n\nAmong the targets of OSA operations are Free Zone groups.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2481280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2481280", "title": "Pancharatra", "text": "Pancharatra\n\nPancharatra (IAST: Pāñcarātra) was a religious movement in Hinduism that originated in late 1st millennium BCE around the ideas of Narayana considered as an avatar of Vishnu. The movement later merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism. The Pancharatra movement created numerous literary treatises in Sanskrit called the \"Pancharatra Samhitas\", and these have been influential Agamic texts within the theistic Vaishnava movements.\n\nLiterally meaning \"five nights\" (\"pañca\": five, \"rātra\": nights), the term \"Pancharatra\" has been variously interpreted. The term has been attributed to a sage Narayana who performed a sacrifice for five nights and became a transcendent being and one with all beings. The Pancharatra Agamas constitute some of the most important texts of many Vaishnava philosophies including the Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya and the Srivaishnava Sampradaya of Ramanuja. The Pancharatra Agamas are composed of more than 200 texts; with various suggested time periods of composition; including the 3rd century BC, and a period between 600 AD to 850 AD.\n\nThe \"Shandilya Sutras\" (~100 CE) is the earliest known text that systematized the devotional Bhakti pancharatra doctrine and 2nd-century CE inscriptions in South India suggest Pancharatra doctrines were known there by then. The 8th-century Adi Shankara criticized elements of the Pancharatra doctrine along with other theistic approaches stating Pancaratra doctrine was against monastic spiritual pursuits and non-Vedic. The 11th-century Ramanuja, the influential Vaishnavism scholar, developed a qualified monism doctrine which bridged ideas of Pancharatra movement and those of monistic ideas in the Vedas. The Pancharatra theology is a source of the primary and secondary avatar-related doctrines in traditions of Hinduism.\n\nPancharatra has likely roots in 3rd-century BCE, as a religious movement around the ideas of a sage Narayana who is an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe earliest use of the word Pancharatra is found in section 7.1.10 of the \"Taittiriya Samhita\", a Vedic text. The section describes a person going through a Pancharatra ritual to become a master of rhetorics. The section 13.6 of the \"Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa\" mentions Nārāyaṇa as the primordial divinity who performs this offering. The Narayaniya section of the Mahabharata (XII, 335-351) refers to seven rishis who say the Pancharatra system was made consistent with the Vedas. Though the five day ritual is mentioned along with many other sacrifices in the Vedic text, the origins of Pancaratra devotees of Vishnu and their tradition is unclear except that it has been very old. The movement merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition also around Krishna-Vasudeva, and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism.\n\nAccording to J. A. B. van Buitenen, the word \"Pancharatra\" is explained in \"Naradiya Samhita\" as referring to a tradition of \"five knowledges\". Similarly, Jan Gonda states that the term \"nights\" in \"five nights\" in the Pancharatra tradition may be a metaphor for inner darkness, and \"came to mean – how, we do not know\", though indeed there have been many interpretations such as \"five systems\", \"five studies\" and \"five rituals\".\n\nThe 1st-century works by Shandilya are the earliest known systematization of the Pancharatra doctrine. This doctrine was known and influential around then, as is attested by the 2nd-century CE inscriptions in South India. Evidence suggests that they co-existed with the Bhagavata tradition in ancient times.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta scholars, such as Adi Shankara, criticized elements of the Pancharatra doctrine along with other theistic approaches stating it was against monastic spiritual pursuits and non-Vedic. According to Suthren Hirst, Shankara supported the use of icons and temple worship if it focussed as a means to comprehend Brahman as the sole metaphysical reality. However, he opposed devotional theism as an end in itself and the goal of spiritual pursuits. The Pancharatra tradition has historically disagreed with claims of it being non-Vedic, states Gonda, and Pancharatra texts explicitly state that, \"Pancharatra is Vedic, it originates in the Sruti\" and that the \"Pancharatra precepts and practices should be observed by anyone who has allegiance to the Vedas\".\n\nThe 11th-century Ramanuja, the influential Sri Vaishnavism scholar, was born in Pancharatra tradition, disagreed with Shankara, and developed a qualified monism doctrine which integrated ideas of Pancharatra movement and those of monistic ideas in the Vedas. Ramanuja stated that the Vishnu of Pancharatra is identical to Vedanta's Brahman, where Purusha reflects the eternal soul that is Vishnu, and Prakriti the impermanent ever changing body of Vishnu.\n\nVishnu worshipers of today, represented in a wide spectrum of traditions, generally follow the system of Pancharatra worship. The concept of Naḍa and Naḍa-Brahman appear already in Sāttvata Samhita or Sāttvata Tantra and in Jayākhya Samhita, two texts considered most canonical of Pancharatra texts.\n\nĀnanda Tīrtha the founder of Madhva line has written in his commentary on Mundaka Upanishad:\n\n\"In Dvāpara-yuga, Vishnu is exclusively worshiped according to the principles of the Pancharatra Scripture, but in this age of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord Hari is worshiped only by the chanting of his Holy Name.\"\n\nJiva Gosvami had stated in his \"Paramātma Sandārbha\", forming part of six principal Sandārbhas, or philosophical treatises of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, that, \"Seeing that the imperfect scriptures in the modes of passion and ignorance bring only a host of troubles, and also seeing that the original Vedas are very difficult to follow properly, and thus being very dissatisfied with both of these, the all-knowing scripture authors affirm the superiority of the Pancharatras, which describe the pure absolute truth, Narayana, and the worship of the Lord, which is very easy to perform.\"\n\nThe Pancharatra theology developed over time. It presents a dualistic theory on how creation manifested from a godhead, as the Purusha-Prakriti and as the masculine-feminine manifestations of the divine. It states that the creation emerged through \"vyuhas\" (arrangements). In the beginning, states Pancharatra doctrine, there was only Vasudeva-Krishna (Vishnu-Narayana, Vasudeva literally means \"indwelling deity\") as the highest changeless god. It arranged into Saṅkarṣaṇa (Balarama) as the lord over all life, then Pradyumna creating mind, and Aniruddha as ego (\"ahamkara\"). Thereafter, Brahma emerged from Aniruddha who created the empirical universe. Thus, the divinity was and is everywhere in Pancaratra, but in different aspects, one form or phase emerging from the previous.\n\nDuring the 11th century AD Ramanuja, a founder of Sri Vaishnava traditions of Vaisnavism had established the Pancharatra system of Vaisnavism for his followers. His philosophy of worship of Narayana was based on the pancaratric teachings.\n\nRamanuja taught that the deity absolute, Parabrahman, manifests in five possible aspects: Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Antaryamin, and Archa. Living beings can interact with the divine through one or another of these five:\n\n\nThe Vyuha-related Pancharatra theology is a source of the primary and secondary avatar-related doctrines in traditions of Hinduism, particularly Sri Vaishnavism. According to Barbara Holdrege, a professor and comparative historian of religions, the Pancharatra doctrines influenced both Sri Vaishnavism and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, albeit a bit different. In Sri Vaishnavism, Vishnu-Narayana is supreme, while Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the four Vyuhas. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vyuha theory is more complex, Krishna is \"Svayam Bhagavan\" (the ultimate, Brahman) who manifests as Vyuhas, and he along with Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the Vyuhas and the Purusha-avataras of the material realm.\n\nThe Pancharatra tradition has taught \"Panchakala\" or five observances every day. The first is called \"Abhigamna\" or ablutions and morning prayers to god. This is followed by \"Upadana\" or collecting worship materials. The third practice is \"Ijya\" or worship with offerings. The fourth practice in the Pancharatra tradition has been daily study or \"Svadhyaya\". The fifth recommended practice is Yoga and meditation.\n\nThe significance of divine manifestation theology in Pancaratra tradition is it believes that an understanding of the process by which Vishnu-Narayana emerged into empirical reality and human beings, can lead one to reverse the process. Through practicing the reversal and moving from the empirical to ever more abstract, according to Pancaratra, human beings can access immanent Vasudeva-Krishna and thereby achieve salvific liberation (moksha).\n\nThe Vaishnava temples and arts since the Gupta Empire, states Doris Srinivasan, attempted to present the Pancaratra ideas. In this system, states Srinivasan, \"Vasudeva, literally, \"the indwelling deity,\" is the first emanation and the fountainhead of the successive emanations, which may be represented either anthropomorphically or theriomorphically in Hindu art\". As one circumambulates the ancient and medieval Vaishnava cave temples, the devotee walks past from the icon representing Vasudeva (most abstract) and then the successive \"Vyuhas\" (literally, \"orderly arrangement\").\n\nThe Bhaktisūtras of Shandilya were one of the earliest systematic treatises on the Pancaratra doctrine. The Pancaratra literature constitutes the Āgama texts of Vaishnavism. Like the Shaivism counterpart, it not only presents the theology, but describes the details, symbolism and procedures of Vaishnava temples building and rituals. According to the Pancharatra tradition, there are 108 \"samhitas\", but its texts list over 200 \"samhitas\". Many Pancaratra texts have been lost. Some surviving Pancaratra texts, with their general focus, are:\n\nThe Pancharatra texts are samhitas and tantras which both classify as Agama due to subject matter. The Agamas are predominantly divided into Saiva, Sakta and Vaishnava Agamas. The Vaishnava Agamas identify Brahman as Vasudeva. The Mahabharata subscribes to the Pancharatra philosophy in its Narayaniya section. The Vaishnava Agamas are Pancharatra Agama and Vaikhanasa Agama. Some of the Samhita's are, a list mainly based on the list of the Sanskrit texts from the H. Daniel Smith Agama Collection, Cleveland, Ohio:\n\n\nOf these Samhitas in Srirangam Sri Ranganatha Swamy temple \"Sri Paramesvara Samhita\", a variant of paushkara samhita is followed and in practice.\n\nIn Sri Kanchipuram Varadaraja Swamy temple \"Sri Jayakhya Samhita\" is followed and in practice. In Sri Melukote Cheluva Narayana Swamy temple \"Sri Ishwara samhita\" is followed and in practice. In Tiruvellarai Sri Pundarikaksha Swamy Temple \"Sri Paadma Samhita\" is followed and in practice. In Tirukkudantai (kumbakONam) Aravamudhan Sarngapani is worshipped with \"Sriprasna samhita\". Rest of the places use Padma samhita or its variants. Gaudiya Vaishnavas follow Brahma Samhita and \"Naradiya Samhita\".\n\n\n"}

The initial Peshwas were all ministers who served as the chief executives to the king. The later Peshwas held the highest administrative office and also controlled the Maratha confederacy. Under the Chitpavan Brahmin Bhat family, the Peshwas became the \"de facto\" hereditary administrators of the Confederacy. The Peshwa's office was most powerful under Baji Rao I (r. 1720-1740). Under Peshwa administration and with the support of several key generals and diplomats, the Maratha Empire reached its zenith, ruling most of the Indian subcontinent. However, after the Peshwa Raghunathrao allied himself with the British, the Peshwa's power declined substantially. The subsequent Peshwas were titular leaders and are said to be responsible for the downfall of Maratha empire, due to inefficiency in handling the affairs of the state. Later on many provinces were controlled and administered either by the Maratha nobles such as Daulat Rao Sindhia, or by the East India Company. During this period, the Maratha confederacy came to its end through its formal annexation into the British Empire in 1818.\n\nThe word Peshwa is from Persian \"pēshwā\", meaning \"foremost, leader\".\nAfter the coronation of Shivaji in 1674, he appointed Moropant Trimbak Pingle as the first Peshwa. Shivaji renamed this designation as \"Pantpradhan\" in 1674 but this term was less commonly used. Moropant Trimbak Pingale's son, Nilopant Moreshvar Pingale, succeeded him during Sambhaji's rule after Moropant's s death in 1683.\n\nThe third Peshwa, Ramchandra Amatya (né Ramachandra Nilkanth Pant), received royal status from Chhatrapati Rajaram as \"Hukumatpanha\" from 1689 to 1699. He was a sound administrator who rose from the level of a local Kulkarni to the ranks of Ashta Pradhan due to guidance and support from Shivaji. \"Amatya\" is a Sanskrit term denoting counselor, guide, supervisor or overseer of both personal and governmental affairs.\n\nHe recaptured many forts from the Mughals between 1690 and 1694, some in person, as well as personally conducting guerilla war techniques. When Chhatrapati Rajaram fled to Jinji in 1689, before leaving from Maharashtra, he gave \"Hukumat panha\" (King Status) to Pant. Ramchandra Pant managed the entire state under many challenges such as the Mughal influx, the betrayal of Vatandars (Feudal Chiefs), and scarcity of food. With his help, Sachiv kept the Maratha State on a sound economic footing. Pant got tremendous military help from Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav, the great Maratha Generals. Many times he directly participated in battles, especially during 1689–1695; he personally re-captured many forts in south Maharashtra from the Moghuls and played the role of \"Stand-in King\" in the absence of Chhatrapati Rajaram.\n\nIn 1698, he happily stepped down from the post of \"Hukumatpanha\" and Rajaram offered this post to his wife Tarabai. Tarabai gave an important position to Pant in the administration of Maratha State. He wrote a book called \"Adnyapatra\" मराठी: आज्ञापत्र which explained different techniques of war, maintenance of forts and administration etc.\n\nThe concepts in \"Adnyapatra\" and the wisdom and leadership of Tarabai greatly helped the Maratha empire in building the foundation of state. As he was more loyal to Tarabai than Shahu, he was sidelined after the arrival of Chhatrapati Shahu. Later, the Peshwa post was given to Balaji Vishwanath in 1713. Ramchandra Pant died in 1716 at Panhala fort.\n\nParshuram Trimbak Kulkarni was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family and held the post of Pantpratinidhi. Later on, he became the Jagirdar of Aundh State and Vishalgad. He was instrumental in holding the fort Panhala against Aurangzeb (1689). Though he lost the fort then, he recaptured it in 1692. He also captured territories between Miraj and fort Rangana and also Bhudargad, Chandangad, Pavangad, Satara and Vasantgad. He continued his loyalty towards Tarabai much to the chagrin of Shahu. Shahu imprisoned him twice between 1710-14. 14 (second time when his son Krishnaji joined the forces of Sammbhaji II). But his life was spared by Shahu because of the intervention of Khando Ballal (Shahu's personal assistant) who reminded his king of Parshuram Trimbak's contribution to the Maratha cause. Parshuram Trimbak continued holding the position of Pant Pratinidhi in the time of Tarabai until his death in 1718. He was a devotee of Yamai Devi of Aundh and had composed poems praising her might. He was succeeded by his son Shrinivasrao, aka Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi, who continued albeit as the feudatory ruler of Aundh State.\n\nThe Maratha war of succession between Tara Bai and Shahu resulted in latter's victory and assumption of Maratha throne as Chhatrapati.In 1713, Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat), as Peshwa.The appointment of Balaji's son, Baji Rao I, as Peshwa in 1719 by Shahu made the position hereditary in the Bhat family. Baji Rao proved his loyalty and patriotism by controlling the feudal chieftains who wanted independence from the Maratha Empire. The rebellion of General Trimbak Rao Dabhade, the \"senapati\" (commander in chief), over Chauthai (revenue collection) of Gujarat is one example of such internal Maratha feuds. The followers of Baji and Trimbak clashed at the Battle of Bilhapur on April 1, 1731, and Trimbak was killed. In gratitude, Shahu gave the Peshwas and the Bhat family unchallenged control over Maratha empire. who also appointed Baji Rao's son as Peshwa in 1740, gave considerable authority to the Peshwas to command the Maratha armies, and they responded well during his reigns.\n\nAt the time of his death in 1749, Shahu made the Peshwas his successors under these conditions: Shivaji's descendants, who remained as the titular Raja of Satara, were called \"Swami\" (Marathi for the 'real owner') by the Peshwas who reported to them, and officially they were to seek guidance from the Raja. However, the Peshwa also became a ceremonial head of state after the battle of Panipat and the death of Madhavrao.\nThe first Peshwa to receive the status of a pantpradhan was Ramchandra Pant Amatya Bawdekar in 1689 by Chhatrapati Rajaram. The first (Bhat) Deshmukh family Peshwa was Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat) Deshmukh. He was succeeded as Peshwa by his son Baji Rao I, who never lost a battle. Baji Rao and his son, Balaji Baji Rao, oversaw the period of greatest Maratha expansion, brought to an end by the Marathas' defeat by an Afghan army at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. The last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Khadki which was a part of Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818). The Peshwa's land (Peshwai) was annexed to the British East India Company's Bombay province, and the Bajirao II, the Peshwa was pensioned off.\n\n\n"}

Members of religious groups also engage in missionary activity, as there have been many instances of conversion throughout history. For instance, one of the earliest introductions of Islam into Eastern Europe was through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the Byzantines during their war against Muslims. The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.\n\nIn the United States, early colonists originated the concept of the penitentiary as a place where inmates would demonstrate their penance and remorse for their crimes through prayer and reflection.\n\nEnglish prison chaplains also heard confessions from condemned prisoners, some of which were published – for example, the 18th century \"Ordinary of Newgate's Account\". Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation.\n\nChaplains have worked with prisoners and prison staff for many years, even before formal legislation addressed the constitutional rights of inmates.\n\nA 2005 \"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\" study suggests that the practice of religion significantly reduces the chance of prisoners to engage in verbal or physical , and increases the likelihood of reform after completing prison sentence time.\n\nPrisoners may become involved with religion while incarcerated for a variety of reasons ranging from the materially pragmatic to the personal and spiritual. According to research conducted by sociologist Harry R. Dammer, some of the more prominent reasons include:\n\nIn 1970, Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, who served as Jewish chaplain for The Tombs, the Manhattan Detention Facility, for thirty years, and also served as the Secretary of the National Jewish Council of Prison Chaplains, shared his vision of prison ministry by saying, \"My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities – to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart.\"\n\n\n"}

It analyzes the most and least religious states in the United States, potential reasons for high church attendance, the most poverty stricken states in the United States, potential factors of poverty, and religious institutions that are geared toward helping poverty.\n\nAccording to a poll done by Gallup, the most religious states are those that are located in the \"Bible Belt\" and Utah. The data is compiled based on weekly church attendance and people saying that they attend church \"At least once a week.\" Based on their results, here is a list of the most and least religious states in the United States is below. The 3rd chart includes a map of the United States based on religiosity.\n\nTop 10 States, Church Attendance\n\nBottom 10 States,_Church_Attendance_2\n\nhttp://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/churchattendance.jpg\n\nInformation based on a 2011 study done by Hartford Institute for Religion Research says that megachurches play a big role in church attendance. As can be seen from the chart below, the major areas in the United States with megachurches are the south and the far west. It is important to note that some of the areas with the most percentages of megachurches are actually in the bottom states for weekly church attendance.\n\nhttp://www.hartfordinstitute.org/images/2011c.jpg\n\nHere is a list of U.S. states by poverty rate, ranking from 1st to 50th. A study done by economists from Harvard and UC Berkeley claims that religious communities provide a source of social capital. It continues on to say that this social capital is likely to affect income inequality. One theory, presented by Dr. Tom Rees through an independent study conducted by himself, is that personal insecurities, or the lack of being secure, correlates directly with religiosity. He also suggests that in these poverty stricken areas, churches are popular places to go to get help with basic needs such as food or clothing.\n\nAccording to Princeton University, poverty is unique because it started to decrease around the 60's and 70's, but since then has had an uneven pattern of growth. A few factors that they mention that contribute to poverty are the economy, changes in family composition, and changes in government spending. From these factors, they mention some sub-factors such as wage inequality, unemployment, single parent households, and government programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and other groups that compensate for unemployment.\n\nAllan G. Johnson, author of \"The Forest and the Trees\" claims that one potential factor is our system of wealth. He argues that our system allows too much power for the elite to be successful and leaves the rest of the population to share what little amount of wealth is left. He uses a game of musical chairs as an analogy: \"Since the game is set up with fewer chairs than there are people, someone has to wind up without a place to sit when the music stops.\"\n\nThere are certain religious organizations that claim to help with poverty. Some deal specifically with national poverty here in the United States, and others deal with international poverty all over the globe. According to TakePart, some of the top non-profit organizations helping fight poverty today are: Feeding America, KIVA, ONE, Oxfam, Jubilee USA, Mercy Corps, and The Hunger Project.\n"}

Their own origin mythology refers to a belief that they were Rajput-Kshatriya, who escaped the wrath of the Hindu god Parshurama by abandoning the Kshatriya custom of being warriors and took to farming. They are found mainly in north Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch. They speak Gujarati and Kutchi.\n\nThe sathwara mostly live in Gujarat especially in Ahmedabad, Anand, Patan, Mehsana, Surendranagar, Jamnagar, Vadhiyar, Junagadh, Morbi, Bhavnagar, and Sabarkantha.\n\nThe different castes of this samaj are Sathwara, Satvara, Kanjariya, Hadiyal, Rathod, Bumtariya, Sonagra, Kadia, Nakum, Khandhara, Khant, Chauhan, Parmar, Solanki and so on...\n\nAccording to historians the sathwaras were formerly farmers.\n\nThe Sathwara are found mainly in the districts of Ahmedabad, Patan, Mehsana, Dwaraka, Botad, Anand, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Surendranagar, Junagadh, and Morbi. The north Gujarat Sathwara are further divided into territorial divisions, the Dandariya group found in Sabarkantha and Patanwadia and Dandhavya found in Mehsana District.

Ron Hubbard claimed to have had a near-death experience in 1938 that inspired him to write \"Excalibur\", an unpublished manuscript based on the revelations from the experience. In 1945–46, Hubbard was briefly involved with and defrauded Jack Parsons, an American rocketry pioneer who was also a devoted Thelemite and member of the Agape Lodge of Aleister Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis, in Pasadena, California. In 1950, Hubbard published \"\", and in 1953 he organized the Church of Scientology.\n\nThe occult (from the Latin word \"occultus\" \"clandestine, hidden, secret\") is \"knowledge of the hidden\". In common English usage, \"occult\" refers to \"knowledge of the paranormal\". It also describes a number of magical organizations or orders.\n\nHugh B. Urban, a scholar on religion who has written much about Scientology, writes that while some writers, such as Jon Atack, assert that Crowley's ideas on magic are at the core of Scientology, others, including Roy Wallis and J. Gordon Melton, have dismissed the connection between occultism and the Church. He argues further that the occult elements are combined with concepts in Eastern religions, science fiction, pop psychology and Hubbard's own thoughts, while confirming that there is one element that is related to the occult in the religion.\n\nHubbard's eldest son, Ronald DeWolf, related a story that L. Ron Hubbard had \"first discovered Magick\" at the age of sixteen when he read Aleister Crowley's The Book of the Law. Author Jon Atack reports that Hubbard joined the Rosicrucian order Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) in 1940, completing the first two neophyte degrees. According to Atack, Hubbard's membership lapsed on July 5, 1940.\n\nIn April 1938, Hubbard reportedly had a bad reaction to a drug during a dental procedure. According to his account, this caused a near-death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of \"The One Command\" or \"Excalibur\". The contents of \"Excalibur\" formed the basis for some of his later publications.\n\nArthur J. Burks, who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the \"one command\": to survive, a theme that Hubbard revisited in \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". Burks also recalled that the work discussed the psychology of a lynch mob. Hubbard cited \"Excalibur\" as an early version of \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\".\n\nIn August 1945 Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John \"Jack\" Whiteside Parsons, an avid occultist and Thelemite, follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the \"Babalon Working\", a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Thelemite Goddess.\n\nIn 1969, \"The Sunday Times\" published an exposé detailing Hubbard's experiences with Parsons and the OTO.\n\nHubbard was known to his associates in the late 1940s as a talented hypnotist. During this period, he worked in Hollywood posing as a swami. The Church says that Hubbard's experience with hypnosis led to his discovery of the principles of Dianetics as a technique for solving man's problems.\n\nThe \"Affirmations\" is a document purportedly written by Hubbard in the late 1940s, a few years before he established Dianetics (1950) or Scientology (1952). The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis.\n\nMany suggestions encourage Hubbard to believe in his own occult powers: \n\nSeveral suggestions reference a guardian spirit:\n\nAnother suggestion involves numerology: \"That the numbers 7, 25 and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.\"\n\nScholars have noted that the Affirmations contain themes that reappeared later in Scientology. One Affirmation foreshadows Hubbard's future interest in mental healing: \"You understand all the workings of the minds of humans around you, for you are a doctor of minds, bodies and influences.\" Lawrence Wright suggests \"Hubbard is using techniques on himself that he would later develop into Dianetics.\" He draws parallels with the practice of \"auditing\" used in Dianetics and Scientology, noting that the Affimations and Dianetics both involve tackling difficult memories that hold back mental and spiritual progress.\n\nThe Affirmations became public knowledge in during the 1984 lawsuit against Hubbard's former archivist. In that settlement, Armstrong was required to return \"all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard\". As religious studies scholar Hugh Urban comments, \"here the church clearly indicates that the text was \"written by L. Ron Hubbard\", and it seems difficult to understand why the church would file suit to retain ownership of the text were it not an authentic document.\"\n\nIn a 1949 letter to Forrest Ackerman, Hubbard promises his upcoming work will give Ackerman the power to \"rape women without their knowing it, communicate suicide messages to your enemies as they sleep, sell the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the mayor for cash, evolve the best way of protecting or destroying communism\". Hubbard admits he has \"not decided whether to destroy the Catholic church or merely start a new one.\"\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published an article entitled \"\" in the magazine Amazing Stories. In that article, Hubbard discusses the use of hypnosis, automatic writing, automatic speaking and clairvoyance.\n\nAuthor Jon Atack has noted Hubbard seems to have a special interest in the Roman goddess 'Diana'. In 1946, using money from Jack Parsons, Hubbard purchased a boat named \"Diane\". In 1952, Hubbard named his daughter Diana. Later, Hubbard named a sea org vessel 'Diana'. Atack speculates \"Dianetics\" might be a 'double-entendre', and notes the existence of the earlier occult practice of Dianism.\n\nIn December 1952, Hubbard recorded a series of audio lectures in which he connects Crowleyite magical rituals and the practice of Scientology. Hubbard explains the use of Tarot, and discusses \"the magic cults\" of the 8th-12th centuries. He recommends The Master Therion as \"the only modern work that has anything to do with them\". He describes the book's author, Aleister Crowley, as \"my very good friend,\" though there is some question about his intent in this remark because Hubbard never met Crowley personally. Hubbard also explains that Crowley \"signs himself \"The Beast\"; \"The Mark of the Beast, 666.\"\" \n\nIn The Book of the Law, Crowley wrote \"The whole and sole object of all true magickal training is to become free from every kind of limitation.\" Hubbard repurposed this for his movement, lecturing that \"Our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any type of limitation... Old Aleister Crowley had some interesting things to say about this. He wrote the \"Book of the Law\".\" Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard's eldest son, wrote that \"In preparation for the next day's lecture, [Hubbard]'d pace the floor, exhilarated by this or that passage from Aleister Crowley's writings.\"\n\nDuring the Philadelphia course, Hubbard jokes that he is \"the prince of darkness\", which is met with laughter from the audience.\n\nAccording to a former member of the Sea Organization pseudonymously named \"Heidi Forrester\", in late 1975 she met with \"a heavy-set older man. He had reddish grey hair, slightly long in the back. He was wearing a white shirt, black pants, black tie, and black shoes, highly polished.\" \n\nShe recalls \"He lay on top of me. As far as I can tell he had no erection. However, using his hand in some way he managed to get his penis inside me. [...] Then for the next hour he did absolutely nothing at all. I mean nothing!\"\n\nOperating Thetan level VIII is highest level of auditing level in Scientology. It is known as \"The Truth Revealed\". It was initially released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988.\nIn OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death. Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work. Hubbard explains that the reader has \"undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth\" but \"the story was never written, nor spoken... It is only now that I feel it safe to release the information\".\n\nHubbard mentions the Book of Revelation and its prophecy of a time when \"an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti-Christ, will reign\". According to Hubbard, the \"anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer\". Hubbard writes \"My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period.\"\n\nIn the document, Hubbard also teaches that \"the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be. In addition to being a lover of young boys and men. he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred\".\n\nThe document was posted to the Internet in 1995 as part of the Fishman papers. The Church of Scientology denies the document's authenticity, though notable defectors have described receiving the document as part of their training for the rank of OT8.\n\nGeorge White, a public scientologist who had received OT8 in the summer of 1988, asserts the document is authentic. Frank Oliver, a former operative with Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, reports having discovered the document in the church's archives. Jesse Prince, former second-in-command of Scientology's Religious Technology Center, reports that OTVIII was revised after early participants were \"horribly upset\" by the content.\n\nLafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr., Hubbard's eldest son, had been an active participant in the early days of Scientology. In 1959, he left Scientology and later took the name Ronald DeWolf.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, DeWolf gave a series of sworn statements and interviews detailing his father's history. DeWolf explained his father had been \"deeply involved in the occult and black-magic.\" According to DeWolf, Aleister Crowley's death in 1947 was a pivotal event that led Hubbard to \"take over the mantle of the Beast\". DeWolf claimed that \"Black magic is the inner core of Scientology\", arguing that \"my father did not worship Satan. He thought he was Satan.\"\n\nIn 2014, Jamie DeWolf (Ronald's grandson) announced the discovery of Ronald DeWolf's unpublished memoir which had been written in 1981. That work discusses the Hubbards' history of occult practices.\n\nThose in the occult legitimize their worldview “by claiming Jesus taught theories similar to theirs – accepting the illusion of a historical Jesus even as they alter Him to fit their theory or perceptions.” According to \"The Kingdom of the Occult\" Scientologists arbitrarily claim that “Jesus was a member of the cult of the Essenes, who believed in reincarnation,” to give credence to their belief in reincarnation.\n\n\n\n"}

A sadhu named \"Sri Satya Theertha\" who was of the same lineage as Thotakacharya, came to Shakatapuram about six centuries ago and established the \"Shri Vidya Peetam\". An idol of the Hindu God, Lakshmi Narayana was brought by \"Sri Satya Teertha\" from Badarinath and installed at Shakatapuram. This is the presiding deity of this place. The Hindu Gods, Krishna, Raja Rajeshwari and Dattatreya are also worshipped here. The Math preaches the Advaita form of Hindu philosophy.\n\nThe current pontiff of the Math is \"Sri Sri Sri Krishnananda Theertha Mahaswamigal\" who is the 33rd pontif to head this institution. He is a scholar in Kannada, Sanskrit and Vedanta and he became the head of this institution at the age of 13. He started touring India in 1994, to spread his message of goodwill and spirituality amongst the people.\n\nIn 1962, \"Sri Sri Ramachandrananda Theertha\", the then pontiff of the Math established a branch at Tambaram,Chennai.\n\nKumbhabhishekham was celebrated in the Math in 2001 and 2007. In 2001, the event were held to celebrate the installation of a temple to worship the Hindu Lord, Ganesha and the completion of 20 years of the pontificate of \"Sri Krishananda Theertha\". In 2007, the event attracted thousands of devotees from other states of India as well. This event was attended by the BJP leader, Murali Manohar Joshi. \"Horekanike\" (offerings of food articles) were made during this event.\n\n"}

{"id": "3439839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3439839", "title": "Shivalli Brahmins", "text": "Shivalli Brahmins\n\nThe Shivalli Brahmins are a Hindu community in Tulu Nadu. They are divided into two groups, the first of which follows the Dvaita philosophy founded by the Vaishnava saint Madhvacharya of Udupi are called Shivalli Madhwa Brahmins, and the second of which follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankara and are known as Shivalli Smartha Brahmins..\n\nShivalli Brahmins are famous for \"Udupi hotels\" (vegetarian restaurants) known for serving typical south Indian dishes like idli, vada, dosa, shira and upma etc. Shivalli Brahmins have a unique style of cooking, serving and eating meals. The meal is served on a plantain (banana) leaf and is usually eaten by hand, seated with padmasana like position on the floor. As per traditions male members must be bare chested while eating meal and must not talk except for deveranama (bhajan). While having meals, all Brahmins including women and children must start and end their meal together. No one should get up during the meals. The meal is wholesome and elaborate in preparation, serving and eating.\n\nShivalli Brahmin males undergo the Upanayana when they turn seven years old to initiate them into Vedic studies. It is also known as Brahmopadesham. The key ritual during the Upanayana is that of putting a sacred thread consisting of three cotton strands across the left shoulder of the boy. The initiate is called a \"dvija\" \"twice-born\" and is expected to perform the sandhyavandanam at least twice daily. Dvija has a special knot in it which is called as \"Brahma Gantu\". Shivalli Madhwa Brahmins also undergo the Upakarma, where the sacred thread is changed and mudradharana is done. Mudradharana is a ritual where Vaishnavite symbols like the conch or the wheel are etched on bodies as a ritual of purification. Currently, the prevalent practice is to paint the symbols using gopichandana paste. In old vedas it is mentioned that after upanayana he enters the stage of Brahmacharya ashram, leading a celibate and austere life of a student in his teacher’s home, eating from handouts given by the generous neighbors. It is equivalent to say he will undergo studies excluding all other aspects in modern days.\nWhen he has accomplished his studies of the Vedas, he enters the Grahastha ashram, a married man becoming head of his household. This dvija also called as \"Janivara\" is replaced with six cotton strands during the wedding.\n\nIn Tulunadu (consisting of present Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kasargodu districts). Every Shivalli Madhva Brahmin household has its own Bhoota and Nagadevata. These deities were worshiped by household members. Today because of so-called modernisation and emigration they are followed in some households only.\n\nPresent day marriages of Shivalli Madhva Brahmins are a four-day ceremony, sometimes condensed to a single day due to the fast pace of today's life. In the three-day ritual, the process of marriage starts with \"Naandi\" (literally meaning \"start\"). During Naandi, which takes place in the groom's and bride's homes separately, but at the same time, a ceremony is performed where the bride and groom have coconut oil and turmeric applied to them and are bathed in hot water followed by other rituals. Marriage (\"Madimae\" in Tulu) takes place at a temple, hall or auditorium followed by lunch. All the ceremonies are held as per horoscopes of bride and groom at a particular time called muhurtha. Generally the day after marriage, a ceremony called as the \"Bigara authana\" (a sort of reception) is held at the groom's place and consists of the \"Satyanarayana puja\" and other rituals followed by lunch. The bigara authana is an equivalent of the marriage reception. Fourth day is small function at the bride's house named as \"Aarthakshathe.\" It is a ritual where shamiana (house decorative) will be removed concluding end of the ceremony. Bride and groom's Basinga (a wearing specially worn on wedding day) is tied to a pole in the bride's house and the newly married couple will start their new life with elders' (hiriyer) blessings.\n\nShivalli Brahmins celebrate all major Hindu festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Deepavali, Navaratri, Sankranti, Madhwanavami, Janmashtami, maha shivaratri, Bisu Parba(Tulu New Year), Ramanavami, Hanuman Jayanthi etc. They also believe in nagaradhane and rituals of Bhuta Kola..\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2645499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2645499", "title": "Southeastern Ceremonial Complex", "text": "Southeastern Ceremonial Complex\n\nThe Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (formerly the Southern Cult), aka S.E.C.C., is the name given to the regional stylistic similarity of artifacts, iconography, ceremonies, and mythology of the Mississippian culture that coincided with their adoption of maize agriculture and chiefdom-level complex social organization from 1200 to 1650 CE. This development appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerica, but developed independently. This ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples, and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.\n\nObsolete names for this ceremonial complex, found in some anthropological sources, include Buzzard Cult and Southern Death Cult.\n\nMuch of what is called a \"complex\" was more of an \"exchange network.\" This kind of network may be illustrated by a pair of shell gorgets whose representation is so similar as to suggest that they were made by the same artist. One is found in southeast Missouri and the other in Spiro Mounds in Oklahoma. Numerous other pairs of extremely similar gorgets serve to link sites across the entire Southeast. The social organization of the Mississippian culture was based on warfare, which was represented by an array of motifs and symbols in articles made from costly raw materials, such as conches from Florida, copper from the Great Lakes area and Appalachian Mountains, lead from northern Illinois and Iowa, pottery from Tennessee, and stone tools sourced from Kansas, Texas, and southern Illinois. Such objects occur in elite burials, together with war axes, maces, and other weapons. These warrior symbols occur alongside other artifacts, which bear cosmic imagery depicting animals, humans, and mythic beasts. This symbolic imagery bound together warfare, cosmology, and nobility into a coherent whole. Some of these categories of artifacts were used as markers of chiefly office, which varied from one location to another. The term Southeast Ceremonial Complex refers to a complex, highly variable set of religious mechanisms that supported the authority of local chiefs.\n\nThe \"S.E.C.C.\" was first defined in 1945 by the archaeologists Antonio Waring and Preston Holder as a series of four lists of traits, which they categorized as the \"Southeastern (centered) Ceremonial Complex\". Their concept was of a complex of a specific cult manifestation that originated with Muskogean speakers in the southern United States. Since then scholars have expanded the original definition, while using its trait lists as a foundation for critical analysis of the entire concept.\n\nIn 1989 scholars proposed a more archaeologically based definition for the Mississippian artistic tradition. Jon Muller of Southern Illinois University proposes the classification of the complex into five horizons, with each as a discrete tradition defined by the origin of specific motifs and ritual objects, and the specific developments in long-distance exchange and political structures.\n\nWith the redefinition of the complex, some scholars have suggested choosing a new name to exemplify the new understanding of the large body of art symbols classified as the S.E.C.C. Participants of a decade-long series of conferences held at Texas State University have proposed the terms \"Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere\" or \"M.I.I.S.\" and \"Mississippian Art and Ceremonial Complex\" or \"M.A.C.C.\" Present theories suggest that the complex developed from pre-existing beliefs spread over the midwest and southeast by the Hopewell Interaction Sphere from 100 BCE to 500 CE.\n\nThe major expression of the complex developed at the Cahokia site and is known as the Braden Style; it corresponds with the Southern Cult Period horizon defined by Muller. Other regional styles developed as a result of the fusion of ideas borrowed from the Braden Style and pre-existing local expressions of post-Hopewellian traditions.\n\nAs the major centers, such as Cahokia, collapsed and the trade networks broke down, the regional styles diverged more from the \"Braden Style\" and from each other. During the ensuing centuries, the local traditions diverged into the religious beliefs and cosmologies of the different historic tribes known to exist at the time of European contact.\n\nMost S.E.C.C. imagery focuses on cosmology and the supernatural beings who inhabit the cosmos. The cosmological map encompassed real, knowable locations, whether in this world or the supernatural reality of the Otherworld. S.E.C.C. iconography portrayed the cosmos in three levels. The Above World or Overworld, was the home of the Thunderers, the Sun, Moon, and Morning Star or Red Horn / \"He Who Wears Human Heads For Earrings\" and represented Order and Stability. The Middle World was the Earth that humans live in. The Beneath World or Under World was a cold, dark place of Chaos that was home to the Underwater Panther and Corn Mother or \"Old Woman Who Never Dies\".\n\nThese three worlds were connected by an \"axis mundi\", usually portrayed as a cedar tree or a striped pole reaching from the Under World to the Over World. Each of the three levels also was believed to have its own sub-levels. Deeply ingrained in the world view was the concept of duality and opposition. The beings of the Upper and Under realms were in constant opposition to each other. Ritual and ceremony were the means by which these powerful forces could be accessed and harnessed.\n\nMany common motifs in S.E.C.C. artwork are locative symbols that help determine where the action takes place and where the beings originated.\n\nThe falcon is one of the most conspicuous symbols of the S.E.C.C. It was simultaneously an avatar of warriors and an object of supplication for a lengthy life, healthy family, and a long line of descendants. Its supernatural origin is placed in the Upper World with a pantheon including the Sun, Moon, and Four Stars. He is most often represented on precious materials, sometimes shell, most often on beaten copper. He dances, costumed with great ground-sweeping wings and a raptor-beaked mask. In his raised right hand he holds a club, prepared to strike. In his left he holds rattles fashioned from human skulls.\n\nAt Cahokia, the falcon imagery was elaborated in figural expression. It is associated with warfare, high-stakes gaming, and possibly family dynastic ambitions, symbolized by arrow flights and the rising of the pre-dawn morning star as metaphors for the succession of descendants into the future. Raptor imagery gained prominence during the Hopewell period, but attained its peak in the Braden Style of the early Mississippian period. It survived afterward in the Red Horn mythological cycle and native religion of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebagos), Osage, Ioway, and other plains Siouan peoples. In the Braden Style, the Birdman is divided into four categories.\n\nVarious motifs are associated with the Birdman, including the forked eye motif, columnella pendants, mace or club weapons, severed heads, chunkey play (including chunkey stones, striped and broken chunkey sticks), bellows-shaped aprons, and bi-lobed arrow motifs.\n\nThe Red Horn Mythic Cycle is from the Ho Chunk, or Winnebago people. The mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has certain analogies with the Hero Twins mythic cycle of Mesoamerica. Redhorn was known by many names, including \"Morning Star\", a reference to his celestial origin, and \"He who is Struck with Deer Lungs,\" a possible reference to the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif. In the episode associated with this name, Red Horn turns into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race, Redhorn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his hair into a long red braid. Thus he becomes known as \"Redhorn\" and as \"He who has Human Heads as Earlobes\".\n\nIn another episode, Redhorn and his friends are challenged by the Giants to play ball (or possibly chunkey) with their lives staked on the outcome. The best Giant player was a woman with long red hair identical to Redhorn's. The little heads on Redhorn's ears caused her to laugh so much that it interfered with her game and the Giants lost. The Giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Redhorn and his friends to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Redhorn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain. The two wives of Redhorn were pregnant at the time of his death. The sons born to each have red hair, with the older one having heads where his earlobes should be, and the younger one having heads in place of his nipples. The older brother discovers where the Giants keep the heads of Redhorn and his friends. The two boys use their powers to steal the heads from the Giants, whom they wipe out almost completely. The boys bring back to life Redhorn, Storms as He Walks, and Turtle. In honor of this feat, Turtle and \"Storms as He Walks\" promise the boys special weapons.\n\nIn another episode, the sons of Redhorn decide to go on the warpath. The older brother asks \"Storms as He Walks\" for the Thunderbird War bundle. After some effort, it is produced, but the Thunderbirds demand that it have a case. A friend of the sons of Redhorn offers his own body as its case. The boys take the Thunderbird War bundle and with their followers go on a raid to the other side of the sky.\n\nMany S.E.C.C. images seem to be of Red Horn, his companions, and his sons. The characters in the myth seem to be tied integrally to the pipe ceremony, and its association with kinship and adoption. In fact, the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif may be a graphic depiction of the calumet. Other images found in S.E.C.C. art show figures with long-nosed god maskettes on their ears and in place of their nipples. \nThe Great Serpent (or Horned Serpent) is the most well-known mythological figure from the S.E.C.C. Its roots go back to Hopewell times, if not earlier. It usually is described as horned and winged, although the wings are more an indicator of its celestial origin than an essential form of the creature. In some versions of Shawnee myths, the serpent is described as a multi-headed monster with one green and one red horn, horns being a manifestation or marker of its power. In other myths, it is described as a one-eyed buffalo with one green and one red horn. The Piasa figure of the Miami was painted on a bluff near present-day Alton, Illinois. It was described as having the body of a panther, four legs, a human head, an impossibly long tail and horns.\n\n\"Mishibizhiw\", the Ojibwa underwater panther, was a combination of rattlesnake, cougar, deer, and hawk. Other native peoples also gave descriptions of the being, sometimes now referred to as the \"Spirit Otter\", with the majority seeming to belong to one of two extremes, and a multitude in between.\n\nThe Great Serpents, the great denizens of the Underworld, were described as powerful beings who were in constant antagonism with the forces of the Upper World, usually represented by the Thunderers (Birdmen or Falcon beings). Although men were to be careful of these beings, they could also be the source of great power. A Shawnee myth tells of the capture and dismemberment of \"Msi Kinepikwa\". The pieces were distributed to the five \"septs\" of the tribe, who kept them in their sacred \"medicine bundles\". \nS.E.C.C. motifs have been found on a variety of non-perishable materials, including shell, pottery, carved stone, and copper (Wulfing cache and Etowah plates). Undoubtedly many other materials also were used, but haven't survived the intervening centuries. It may be judged by looking at the remaining artifacts that S.E.C.C. practitioners worked with feathers and designs woven into cloth, practiced body painting, and possibly tattooing, as well as having pierced ears. One surviving painting found on a baked clay floor at the Wickliffe Mounds site suggests they also painted designs in and on their dwellings. Paintings displaying S.E.C.C. imagery also have been found in caves, most notably Mud Glyph Cave in Tennessee. Animal images, serpents, and warrior figures occur, as well as winged warriors, horned snakes, stylized birds, maces, and arrows. Their location underneath the Earth probably reflect aspects of Mississippian myth and cosmology concerning the (perhaps sacred) precincts beneath the earth.\n\n"}

{"id": "53474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53474", "title": "Tenrikyo", "text": "Tenrikyo\n\n, sometimes rendered as Tenriism, is a Japanese new religion which is neither strictly monotheistic nor pantheistic, originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named Nakayama Miki, known to her followers as \"Oyasama\". Followers of Tenrikyo believe that God of Origin, God in Truth, known by several names including \"Tsukihi,\" \"Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto,\" and \"Oyagamisama (God the Parent)\" revealed divine intent through Miki Nakayama as the Shrine of God, and to a lesser extent the roles of the Honseki Izo Iburi and other leaders. Tenrikyo's worldly aim is to teach and promote the Joyous Life, which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called \"hinokishin\".\n\nThe primary operations of Tenrikyo today are located at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters (Tenri, Nara, Japan), which supports 16,833 locally managed churches in Japan, the construction and maintenance of the oyasato-yakata, and various community-focused organisations. It has 1.75 million followers in Japan, and is estimated to have over 2 million worldwide.\n\nThe ultimate spiritual aim of Tenrikyo is the construction of the Kanrodai, a divinely ordained pillar in an \"axis mundi\" called the Jiba, and the correct performance of the Kagura ritual around the Kanrodai, which will bring about the salvation of all human beings. The idea of the Jiba as the origin of earthly creation is called \"moto-no-ri\", or the principle of origin. A pilgrimage to the Jiba is interpreted as a return to one's origin, so the greeting \"okaeri nasai\" (welcome home) is seen on many inns in Tenri City.\n\nOther key teachings include:\n\nThe Joyous Life in Tenrikyo is defined as charity and abstention from greed, selfishness, hatred, anger and arrogance. Negative tendencies are not known as sins in Tenrikyo, but rather as \"dust\" that can be swept away from the mind through \"hinokishin\" and ritual. \"Hinokishin\", voluntary effort, is performed not out of a desire to appear selfless, but out of gratitude for \"kashimono-karimono\" and \"shugo\" (providence).\n\nThe most basic teaching of Tenrikyo is \"kashimono-karimono\", meaning \"a thing lent, a thing borrowed\". The thing that is lent and borrowed is the human body. Tenrikyo followers think of their minds as things that are under their own control, but their bodies are not completely under their control.\n\nThe sacred name of the single God and creator of the entire universe in Tenrikyo is \"Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto\" (天理王命).\n\nTenri-Ō-no-Mikoto created humankind so that humans may live joyously and to partake in that joy.\n\nThe body is a thing borrowed, but the mind alone is one's own, thus it is commonly accepted that Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto is not omnipotent.\n\nOther gods are considered instruments, such as the Divine Providences, and were also created by Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto.\n\nTenrikyo's doctrine names four properties of Tenri-O-no-Mikoto: as the God who became openly revealed in the world, as the creator who created the world and humankind, as the sustainer and protector who gives existence and life to all creation, and as the savior whose intention in becoming revealed is to save all humankind.\n\nThrough her scriptures (the Mikagura-uta and Ofudesaki), Nakayama conveyed the concept of the divine to her followers in steps. \n\n\nThese steps have been described as an \"unfolding in the revelation of God's nature in keeping with the developing capacity of human understanding, from an all-powerful God, to a nourishing God, and finally to an intimate God.\"\n\nFollowers use the phrase \"God the Parent\" (\"Oyagamisama\") to refer to God, and the divine name \"Tenri-O-no-Mikoto\" when praising or worshipping God through prayer or ritual.\n\nThe concept of \"causality\" (\"innen\" いんねん) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of karmic belief. Though causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways.\n\nBroadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering. Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense; throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, \"every seed sown will sprout.\" Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth, such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives. This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well. \n\nTenrikyo's ontology, however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of mind, body, and soul. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of \"denaoshi\" (出直し, \"to make a fresh start\"), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Thought the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality. As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of saṃsāra and nirvana.\n\nAt the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of \"original causality,\" or \"causality of origin\" (\"moto no innen\" もとのいんねん), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.\n\nBelief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.\n\nTenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of \"tanno\" (たんのう \"joyous acceptance\" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. \"Tanno\" is a way of settling the mind – it is not to merely resign oneself to one’s situation, but rather to actively “recognize God’s parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.” In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.\n\nIn addition, \"The Doctrine of Tenrikyo\" names three causalities (\"san innen\" さんいんねん) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that \"when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity.\" The \"Causality of the Soul of Oyasama\" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (\"Izanami-no-Mikoto\"), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The \"Causality of the Residence\" means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The \"Causality of the Promised Time\" indicates that October 26, 1838 – the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama – marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.\n\nThe three scriptures (\"sangenten\" 三原典) of Tenrikyo are the \"Ofudesaki\", \"Mikagura-uta\", and \"Osashizu.\"\n\nThe \"Ofudesaki\" (おふでさき, \"Tip of the Writing Brush\") is the most important Tenrikyo scripture. A 17-volume collection of 1,711 waka poems, the Ofudesaki was composed by the foundress of Tenrikyo, Miki Nakayama, from 1869 to 1882.\n\nThe \"Mikagura-uta\" (みかぐらうた \"The Songs for the Service\") is the text of the Service (\"otsutome\"), a religious ritual that has a central place in Tenrikyo. During the Service, the text to the Mikagura-uta is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment, all of which was composed and taught by Miki Nakayama.\n\nThe \"Osashizu\" (おさしづ \"Divine Directions\") is a written record of oral revelations given by Izo Iburi. The full scripture is published in seven volumes (plus an index in three volumes) and contains around 20,000 \"divine directions\" delivered between January 4, 1887 and June 9, 1907.\n\nAccording to Shozen Nakayama, the second Shinbashira (the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), the Ofudesaki \"reveal[s] the most important principles of the faith,\" the Mikagura-uta “come[s] alive through singing or as the accompaniment\" to the Service, and the Osashizu \"gives concrete precepts by which the followers should reflect on their own conduct.\"\n\nThe supplemental texts to the scriptures (\"jungenten\" 準原典) are officially sanctioned texts which, along with the scriptures, are used to instruct students and adherents of Tenrikyo. They are required texts for students enrolling in Tenrikyo's seminary programs, such as the three-month \"Spiritual Development Course\" (\"Shuyoka\" 修養科).\n\n\"The Doctrine of Tenrikyo\" is Tenrikyo's official doctrine, which explains the basic teachings of Tenrikyo. \"The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo\" is Tenrikyo's hagiography of Miki Nakayama. The \"Anecdotes of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo\" is an anthology of anecdotes about Nakayama that were passed down orally by her first followers and later written down and verified.\n\nTenrikyo is subdivided into many different groups with common goals but differing functions. These range from the Daikyokai (lit. large church), to disaster relief corps, medical staff and hospitals, universities, museums, libraries, and various schools.\n\nTenri Judo is renowned as a successful competition style of Judo that has produced many champions, while there are also other sporting and arts interest groups within Tenrikyo.\n\nIn Tenrikyo tradition, Nakayama Miki was chosen as the Shrine of God in 1838, after her son and husband began suffering from serious ailments. The family called a Buddhist monk to exorcise the spirit causing the ailments. When the monk temporarily left and asked Miki to take over, she was possessed by the One god (Tenri-O-no-Mikoto), who demanded that Miki be given to God as a shrine. Miki's husband gave in to this request three days later.\n\nNakayama Miki's statements and revelations as Shrine of God were supplemented by Izo Iburi, one of her earliest followers, who developed a position of revelatory leadership as her deputy, answering questions from followers and giving \"timely talks\". His position, which is no longer held in Tenrikyo, was called Honseki. The revelatory transmissions of the Honseki were written down and collected in large, multi-volume works called Osashizu. Following Izo's death, a woman called Ueda Naraito partially carried on this role for a while, although it appears that she did not the actual title \"Honseki\". Since then, Tenrikyo itself has never had a Honseki, although some Tenrikyo splinter groups believe that the revelatory leadership passed from Iburi to their particular founder or foundress.\n\nMiki Nakayama's eldest son obtained a license to practice as a low-ranking Shinto priest from the powerful Yoshida branch of Shinto in 1867, but did so against his mother's wishes. Tenrikyo was designated as one of the thirteen groups included in Sect Shinto between 1908 and 1945 under State Shinto. During this time, Tenrikyo became the first new religion to do social work in Japan, opening an orphanage, a public nursery and a school for the blind.\n\nAlthough Tenrikyo is now completely separate from Shinto and Buddhism organizationally, it still shares many of the traditions of Japanese religious practice. For instance, many of the objects used in Tenrikyo religious services, such as hassoku and sanpo, were traditionally used in Japanese ritual, and the method of offering is also traditional.\n\n\nTenrikyo utilises traditional musical instruments in its otsutome (lit. service or duty), Hyoshigi (wooden clappers), Chanpon (cymbals), Surigane (small gong), Taiko (large drum), Tsuzumi (shoulder drum), Fue (bamboo flute), Shamisen, Kokyū, and Koto. These are used to play music from the Mikagura-Uta, a body of music, dances and songs created by Nakayama. Most of the world's foremost authorities on Gagaku music (the ancient classical Shinto music of the imperial court of Japan) are also Tenrikyo followers, and Gagaku music is actively promoted by Tenrikyo, although, strictly speaking, the Mikagura-Uta and Gagaku are separate musical forms.\n\nThe Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and Fue were traditionally the men's instruments but are now acceptable for women to play. The Shamisen, Kokyu, and Koto were traditionally women's instruments and, although not very popular, are now acceptable for men to play as well.\n\nThe Otsutome or daily service consists of the performance of the seated service and, optionally, the practice of a chapter or two of the 12 chapters of Teodori (lit. hand dance) or Yorozuyo. The daily service is performed twice a day; once in the morning and then in the evening. The service times are adjusted according to the time of sun rise and sun set but may vary from church to church. Service times at the Jiba in Tenri City go by this time schedule and adjust in the changing of seasons.\n\nInstruments used in the daily service are the Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and Kazutori (a counter, to count the 21 times the first section is repeated). The Hyoshigi is always played by the head minister of the church or mission station. If the head minister is not present, anyone may take his or her place.\n\nThe daily service does not need to be performed at a church. It can be done at any time and anywhere, so long as that one faces the direction of the Jiba, or \"home of the parent\".\n\nThe purpose of the daily service, as taught by Miki Nakayama, is to sweep away the Eight Mental Dusts of the mind.\n\nHinokishin (lit. daily service) is a spontaneous action that is an expression of gratitude and joy for being allowed to \"borrow\" his or her body from God the Parent. Such an action ideally is done as an act of religious devotion out of a wish to help or bring joy to others, without any thought of compensation. Hinokishin can range from helping someone to just a simple smile to brighten another person's day. Examples of common Hinokishin activities that are encouraged include cleaning public bathrooms and parks among other such acts of community service. Doing the work that others want to do least are considered sincere in the eyes of God.\n\nHinokishin is a method of \"sweeping\" the \"mental dusts\" that accumulate in our minds. The \"mental dusts\" are referring to the Eight Mental Dusts. The official translations of these dusts are: Miserliness (Oshii), Covetousness (Hoshii), Hatred (Nikui), Self-love (Kawai), Grudge-bearing (Urami), Anger (Haradachi), Greed (Yoku), Arrogance (Kouman).\n\nThe Tenrikyo Young Men's Association and Tenrikyo Women's Association are Tenrikyo-based groups that perform group activities as public service. To participate in such groups may be considered Hinokishin.\n\nTsukinamisai or the monthly service is a performance of the entire Mikagura-Uta, the sacred songs of the service, which is the service for world salvation. Generally, mission headquarters and grand churches (churches with 100 or more others under them) have monthly services performed on the third Sunday of every month; other churches perform on any other Sunday of the month. The monthly service at the Jiba is performed on the 26th of every month, the day of the month in which Tenrikyo was first conceived – October 26, 1838.\n\nInstruments used in the monthly service are all of those aforementioned. Performers also include dancers – three men and three women – and a singer. Performers wear traditional montsuki, which may or may not be required depending on the church.\n\nThe Divine Grant of Sazuke is a healing prayer in which one may attain through attending the nine Besseki lectures. When one receives the Divine Grant of Sazuke, he or she is considered a Yoboku (lit. useful timber). The Sazuke is to be administered to those who are suffering from illness to request God's blessings for a recovery. However, recovery requires the sincere effort from both the recipient and the administrator of the Sazuke to clean their minds of \"mental dust.\" Only with pure minds then can the blessings be received by the recipient through the Yoboku administering the Sazuke. It is taught that when God accepts the sincerity of the person administering the Sazuke and the sincerity of the person to whom it is being administered, a wondrous salvation will be bestowed. This is accomplished through having the recipient be aware of the mental dusts and the teachings of Tenrikyo to remedy their dusty minds.\n\nIn recent years Tenrikyo has spread outside Japan, with foreign branches centered primarily in Southeast Asia and America. Tenrikyo maintains centers in:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202444", "title": "Ummah", "text": "Ummah\n\nIt is a synonym for ' (, 'the Islamic community'), and it is commonly used to mean the collective community of Islamic peoples. In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation. In the context of pan-Islamism and politics, the word ' can be used to mean the concept of a \"Commonwealth of the Believers\" ( \"\").\n\nThe word \"Ummah\" (pl. \"umam\") means Nation in Arabic. For example the Arabic term for the United Nations in Arabic is \"الأمم المتحدة Al-Umam Al-Mutahedah\", and the term \"الأمة العربية Al-Ummah Al-Arabeyah\" is used to refer to \"The Arabic Nation\". \n\nThe Word \"Ummah\" differs from the concept of a country or people. In it is greater context it is used to describe a larger group of people. For example, in Arabic the word شعب \"Sha'ab\" (\"people\") would be used to describe the citizens of Turkey. However, the term \"Ummah\" is used to describe the Turkic Nation as a whole, which includes Turkey, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and other countries and ethnic groups in Central Asia.\n\nThe phrase ' in the Quran (, \"One Nation\") refers to all the Islamic world as it existed at the time. The Quran says: \"You [Muslims] are the best nation brought out for Mankind, commanding what is righteous ( ', lit. \"recognized [as good]\") and forbidding what is wrong ( \"\", lit. \"recognized [as evil]\")\" [3:110].\n\nThe usage is further clarified by the Constitution of Medina, an early document said to have been negotiated by Muhammad in CE 622 with the leading clans of Medina, which explicitly refers to Jewish, Christians \nand pagan citizens of Medina as members of the \"\".\n\nAt the time of Muhammad, before the conception of the ummah, Arab communities were typically governed by kinship. In other words, the political ideology of the Arabs centered around tribal affiliations and blood-relational ties. In the midst of a tribal society, the religion of Islam emerged and along with it the concept of the ummah. The ummah emerged according to the idea that a messenger or prophet has been sent to a community. But unlike earlier messengers who had been sent to various communities in the past (as can be found among the Prophets in the Old Testament), Muhammad sought to develop a universal ummah and not only for the Arabs. Muhammad saw his purpose as the transmission of a divine message, and the leadership of the Islamic community. Islam sees Muhammad as the messenger to the ummah, transmitting a divine message, and implying that God is directing the life affairs of the ummah. Accordingly, the purpose of the ummah was to be based on religion, following the commands of God, rather than kinship.\n\nThere are a total of sixty-two instances that the term ummah is mentioned in the Qur'an. The use of ummah in the Qur'an almost always refers to ethical, linguistic, or religious bodies of people who are subject to the divine plan of salvation. The meaning of the term ummah in the Qur'an appears to transform throughout the chronology of the Qur'an. When it is first used in the Qur'an it is hardly distinguishable from the term \"qawm\" which can be translated to 'people'. The Qur'an recognizes that each ummah has a messenger that has been sent to relay a divine message to the community and that all ummahs await God's ultimate judgment. Although the meaning of the ummah begins simply with a general application of the word, it gradually develops to reference a general religious community and then evolves to specifically refer to the Muslim community. Before it refers exclusively to Muslims, the ummah encompasses Jewish and Christian communities as one with the Muslims and refers to them as the People of the Book. This is supplemented by the Constitution of Medina which declares all members of the ummah, regardless of religion, to be of ‘one ummah.' In these passages of the Qur'an, ummah may be referring to a unity of mankind through the shared beliefs of the monotheistic religions. However, Denny points out that the most recent ummah that receives a messenger from God is the Arab ummah. As the Muslims became stronger during their residence in Medina, the Arab ummah narrowed into an ummah exclusively for Muslims. This is evidenced by the resacralization of the Kaaba and Muhammad's command to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, along with the redirection of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca. The period in which the term ummah is used most often is within the Third Meccan Period followed by the Medinian period. The extensive use of the term during these two time periods indicates that Muhammad was beginning to arrive at the concept of the ummah to specify the genuine Muslim community. Furthermore, the early Meccan passages generally equate ummah as religion, whereas in the Medinan period the passages of the Qur'an refer more specifically to the relation of the ummah and religion. The final passage that refers to ummah in the Qur'an refers to the Muslims as the \"best community\" and accordingly led to ummah as an exclusive reference to Islam.\n\nA verse in the Qur'an also mentions the ummah, in the context of all of the messengers, that this ummah (nation) of theirs is one ummah and that God is their Lord entirely.\n\n\"O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing.\nAnd indeed this, your ummah (nation), is one ummah (nation), and I am your Lord, so fear Me.\"\n[Qur'an, Surah Al-Mu'minun (The believers) (23:51-52)] \n\nInitially it did not appear that the new Muslim community would oppose the tribes that already existed in Mecca. The first Muslims did not need to make a break with traditional Quraysh customs since the vision for the new community included moral norms that were not unfamiliar to the tribal society of Mecca. However, what distinguished this community from the tribes was its focus of the place of those morals within a person's life.\n\nAfter Muhammad and the first converts to Islam were forced to leave Mecca, the community was welcomed in Medina by the Ansar, a group of Pagans who had converted to Islam. Despite Medina already being occupied by numerous Jewish and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of Muhammad and his followers provoked no opposition from Medina's residents. Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad established the Constitution of Medina with the various tribal leaders in order to form the Meccan immigrants and the Medinan residents into a single community, the ummah. Rather than limiting members of the ummah to a single tribe or religious affiliation as had been the case when the ummah first developed in Mecca, the Constitution of Medina ensured that the ummah was composed of a variety of people and beliefs essentially making it to be supra-tribal. Islamic historian, Tabari, suggested that Muhammad's initial intentions upon arriving in Medina was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely Tabari also claimed that Muhammad observed the first Friday prayer in Medina. It occurred on Friday because Friday served as a market day in Medina to enable Jews to observe the sabbath. Membership to the ummah was not restricted to adhering to the Muslim faith but rather encompassed all of the tribes as long as they vowed to recognize Muhammad as the community and political figure of authority. The Constitution of Medina declared that the Jewish tribes and the Muslims from Medina formed 'one ummah.' It is possible that the Medinan ummah was purely secular (compared to the later transformation of the ummah in Mecca) due to its variety of beliefs and practices of its members. The purpose of the Constitution of Medina was to uphold political obligations and social relations between the various tribes. The community members in Medina, although not derived from the same faith, were committed to each other through a desire to defend the common good of the community. In other words, the community was united according to preserve its shared interests. The people of other religious beliefs, particularly those that are considered to be \"People of the Book\" were granted the special protection of God through the dhimmah contract. These other religious groups were guaranteed security by God and Muhammad because of their common religious history as being the \"People of the Book.\" The dhimmah served as a sort of alliance between Muslims and non-Muslims. In the earlier treaties of the dhimmah, both groups were viewed as equal in status and both were obligated to help the other. However, in later treaties, after Islam had gained more power throughout Arabia, the dhimmah was perceived as the fulfilment of the religious duties of Muslims along with the payment of zakat. With the new contract of dhimmah, non-Muslims' protection by God and Muhammad became dependent on their payment.\n\nThe Constitution of Medina is a document created by Muhammad to regulate social and political life in Medina. It deals with various tribal issues such as the organization and leadership of the participating tribal groups, warfare, blood money, ransom of captives, and war expenditures. It is at the beginning of the document that the Muslims from the Quraysh (those from Mecca) and the Muslims from Yathrib (those from Medina) are declared to be an ummah or one community. The word ummah appears again when the document refers to the treaty of the Jews and states that the Yahūd Banī ' Awf, or Jews, are an ummah that exists alongside the ummah of the Muslims or may be included in the same ummah as the Muslims. The document does state that the Jews who join the Muslims will receive aid and equal rights. In addition, the Jews will be guaranteed security from the Muslims, and are granted to maintain their own religion just as the Muslims will maintain theirs. This implies that the ummah is not strictly a religious community in Medina. The Constitution of Medina lists the various Medinan tribes derived from the Aws and Khazraj as well as the several Jewish tribes that are granted to keep their tribal organization and leadership. The document also reveals that each group, the Muslims and the Jews, is responsible for its own finances except during time of war, when the two are able to share expenses.\n\nAfter the Muslim takeover of Mecca, membership in the ummah required a commitment to Islam. This happened as a result of Islam beginning to distinguish itself not just from Paganism but also Judaism and Christianity by emphasizing a model of community based on Abraham. The membership of the ummah was now based on two main principles; the first is to worship God alone and secondly, in order to worship God properly one must be in a guided community.\n\nThe essentials of the new society were the new relations between human beings and God and between human beings and one another. The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden. Muhammad's community was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.\n\n\n"}
