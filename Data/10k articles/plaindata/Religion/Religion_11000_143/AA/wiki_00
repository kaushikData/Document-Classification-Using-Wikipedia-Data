{"id": "29580554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29580554", "title": "2011 end times prediction", "text": "2011 end times prediction\n\nAmerican Christian radio host Harold Camping stated that the Rapture and Judgment Day would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011, based on adding the 153 fish of John 20 to May 21. The Rapture, as indicated in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 (\"harpagēsometha\" = we shall be raptured / taken up, \"rapture\" derivable from the Latin translation \"rapiemur\") is the taking up of believers to a meeting in the air with the Lord Jesus, but for Camping the rapture was also associated with the End of the World.\n\nCamping, who was then president of the Family Radio Christian network, claimed the Bible as his source and said May 21 would be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment \"beyond the shadow of a doubt\". Camping suggested that it would occur at 6 pm local time, with the Rapture sweeping the globe time zone by time zone, while some of his supporters claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 3% of the world's population) would be 'raptured'. Camping had previously claimed that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.\n\nThe vast majority of Christian groups, including most Protestant and Catholic believers, did not accept Camping's predictions; some explicitly rejected them, citing Bible passages including the words of Jesus stating \"about that day or hour no one knows\" (Matthew 24:36). An interview with a group of church leaders noted that all of them had scheduled church services as usual for Sunday, May 22.\n\nFollowing the failure of the prediction, media attention shifted to the response from Camping and his followers. On May 23, Camping stated that May 21 had been a \"spiritual\" day of judgment, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God. However, on October 16, Camping admitted to an interviewer that he did not know when the end would come, and made no public comment after October 21 passed without his predicted apocalypse.\n\nIn March 2012, Camping \"humbly acknowledged\" in a letter to Family Radio listeners that he had been mistaken, that the attempt to predict a date was \"sinful\", and that critics had been right in pointing to the scriptural text \"of that day and hour knoweth no man\". He added that he was searching the Bible \"even more fervently [...] not to find dates, but to be more faithful in our understanding.\"\n\n\n\n\nCamping presented several arguments labeled \"numerological\" by the mainstream media, which he considered biblical proofs, in favor of the May 21 end time. A civil engineer by training, Camping stated he had attempted to work out mathematically-based prophecies in the Bible for decades. In an interview with the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" he explained \"... I was an engineer, I was very interested in the numbers. I'd wonder, 'Why did God put this number in, or that number in?' It was not a question of unbelief, it was a question of, 'There must be a reason for it.'\"\n\nIn 1970, Camping dated the Great Flood to 4990 BC. Using this date, taking the statement in Genesis 7:4 (\"Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth\") to be a prediction of the end of the world, and combining it with 2 Peter 3:8 (\"With the Lord a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as a day\"), Camping concluded that the end of the world would occur in 2011, 7000 years from 4990 BC. Camping takes the 17th day of the second month mentioned in Genesis 7:11 to be May 21, and hence predicts the Rapture to occur on this date.\n\nAnother argument that Camping used in favor of the May 21 date is as follows:\n\n\nCamping said that 5 × 10 × 17 is telling us a \"story from the time Christ made payment for our sins until we're completely saved.\"\n\nCamping was not precise about the timing of the event, saying that \"maybe\" we can know the hour. He has suggested that \"days\" in the Bible refer to daylight hours particularly. Another account said the \"great earthquake\" which signals the start of the Rapture would \"start in the Pacific Rim at around the 6 pm local time hour, in each time zone.\"\n\nIn Camping's book \"1994?\", self-published in 1992, he predicted that the End Times would come in September 1994 (variously reported as September 4 or September 6). When the Rapture failed to occur on the appointed day, Camping said he had made a mathematical error.\n\nCamping's rapture prediction, along with some of his other teachings and beliefs, sparked controversy in the Christian and secular Western worlds. His critics often quoted Bible verses (such as ) they interpret as saying that the date of the end will never be known by anyone but God until it actually happens. However, Camping and his followers responded that this principle only applied during the \"church age\" or pre-Tribulation period and did not apply to the present day, citing other verses (such as ) in their rebuttal.\n\nIn a 2001 pamphlet, Camping asserted that believers should \"flee the church\", resigning from any church they belong to, because the \"Church Age\" is over and the \"Great Tribulation\" has begun. This assertion was controversial and drew \"a flurry of attacks\".\n\nEdwin M. Yamauchi critiqued Camping's dating of the Flood when Camping first published his ideas in 1970.\n\nCriticism of the May 21 prediction ranged from serious critique to ridicule. Theology professor Matthew L. Skinner, writing at the Huffington Post, noted the \"long history of failed speculation\" about the End Times and cautioned that end-of-the-world talk can lead Christians to social passivity instead of \"working for the world's redemption\". Some columnists mocked the prediction with humorous essays. A group of Christians set up a website called \"RaptureFail\" with the stated intention of undermining \"this embarrassment to the Body of Christ.\"\n\nEvolutionary biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins dismissed Camping's prediction, writing that \"he will inevitably explain, on May 22, that there must have been some error in the calculation, the rapture is postponed to ... and please send more money to pay for updated billboards.\" California Director of American Atheists Larry Hicock said that \"Camping's well-intentioned rapture campaign is indicative of the problems with religion\".\n\nIn 2010, Marie Exley of Colorado Springs made news by purchasing advertising space in her locality, promoting the alleged Rapture date on a number of park benches. After that, more than 3,000 \"Judgment Day\" billboards were erected in locations across the world, including the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Lebanon, Lesotho, the Philippines, Tanzania and the United States. Some people adorned their vehicles with the information. Many who believed in the prediction took time off work to prepare for the Rapture. Others spent their life savings on advertising material to publicise the prophecy. One retired transportation agency worker from New York spent $140,000 on advertising.\n\nFamily Radio spent over US$100 million on the information campaign, financed by sales and swap of broadcast outlets. On October 27, 2010, they launched \"Project Caravan\". Five recreational vehicles announcing on their sides that Judgment Day was to begin on May 21, 2011 were sent out from their headquarters in Oakland, California, to Seattle, Washington. Upon arrival, teams were sent out to distribute tracts. The caravan subsequently made stops in many states in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nCamping's prediction and his promotion of it via his radio network and other promotional means spread the prediction globally, which led believers and non-believers to a variety of actions. Some followers of Camping gave up their jobs, sold their homes, stopped investing in their children's college funds and spent large sums promoting Camping's claims.\n\nAbout 5,000 ethnic Hmong gathered at a remote town in Vietnam's Mường Nhé District in Điện Biên Province in early May, where they planned to await the arrival of Christ. The Vietnamese government broke up the gathering and arrested some people, describing them as \"extremists\". Pastor Doan Trung Tin indicated that a translated version of Camping's prediction had influenced about 300 of his parishioners to go to the assembly point, selling their belongings to be able to afford the journey via bus. Many of the Hmong Christians who escaped arrest were reportedly forced into hiding after the gathering.\n\nOn May 19, 2011, the search term \"end of the world may 21st\" reached second position on Google Trends, based on the popularity of the search term in the United States. The related searches \"Harold Camping\", \"May 21 doomsday\", and \"May 21 rapture\" were also represented among the top 10 positions. The New York Police Department stated: \"We don't plan any additional coverage for the end of the world. Indeed, if it happens, fewer officers will be required for streets that presumably will be empty.\"\n\nOn the weekend of May 21–22, the Family Radio headquarters was closed with a paper note in the window stating, \"This office is closed. Sorry we missed you!\" The Family Radio network remained on the air during May 21 and May 22, mostly broadcasting its normal schedule of programming, but with no mention of the Rapture and without the usual replays of Harold Camping's program \"Open Forum\".\n\nOn Sunday, May 22, Camping emerged briefly from his home, saying \"Give me a day, no interviews today ... I've got to live with it, I've got to think it out.\" He said he would make a public statement on Monday, May 23. Camping said he was \"flabbergasted\" that the Rapture did not occur, that he was \"looking for answers,\" and would say more when he returned to work on May 23.\n\nOn May 23, he returned to his \"Open Forum\" radio program, with members of the press in attendance, and, departing from his typical format, took questions from the reporters present instead of from callers. He stated that May 21 had been an \"invisible judgment day\" which was purely spiritual in nature, and that he now realized that the physical Rapture would take place on October 21, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe. \"We've always said May 21 was the day, but we didn't understand altogether the spiritual meaning,\" he said. \"May 21 is the day that Christ came and put the world under judgment.\" He offered no apology for his earlier interpretation and said that all of his predictions had actually been fulfilled: on May 21, 1988, judgment came upon the churches; on September 7, 1994, judgment continued on the churches; then on May 21, 2011, judgment came upon the entire world.\n\nHe said that the publicity campaign would not continue, explaining that since God's judgment had already occurred, there was no point in continuing to warn people about it. He added, \"We're not going to put up any more billboards – in fact they're coming down right now.\" Responding to a question, Camping said his organization would not return money donated by followers to publicize the May 21 prediction, saying \"We're not at the end. Why would we return it?\"\n\nAs October 21 approached, the Family Radio website stated:\nA Family Radio staffer suggested that the delay might be God's way of separating true believers from those willing to doubt the \"clear biblical warnings.\"\n\nIndividual followers who had spent time and money promoting Camping's prediction were \"crestfallen\" after May 21 passed without evidence of the Rapture. A New York man commented \"I was doing what I've been instructed to do through the Bible, but now I've been stymied. It's like getting slapped in the face.\"\n\nThere were rumors that people had killed themselves or attempted suicide to escape the predicted Judgment Day. There was one documented case, in which a 14-year-old Russian girl killed herself on May 21. Her family told a Russian tabloid, \"LifeNews\", that she did it because of her fear of the \"terrible sufferings\" predicted by Camping; however, police noted that the girl had been obsessed with death and threatening suicide since she was 12.\n\nA group of Christians in Milpitas, California, offered a session to comfort those who had believed in the prophecy. Church deacon James Bynum told a local newspaper that \"We are here because we care about these people. It's easy to mock them. But you can go kick puppies, too. But why?\"\n\nIn response to the prediction, more than 830,000 registered as attending a \"Post Rapture Looting\" event on Facebook. The group American Atheists sponsored billboards in several American cities declaring the Rapture to be \"nonsense\". The group Seattle Atheists formed the Rapture Relief Fund which they said would be used \"to help survivors of any Armageddon-sized disaster in the Puget Sound area\"; since the Rapture failed to occur on May 21, the money will fund a camp that teaches children about science and critical thinking.\n\nOn May 21, groups of protesters gathered at Family Radio's headquarters in Oakland to mock the evangelical broadcaster's failed prediction. One group released human-shaped helium balloons to simulate souls rising to heaven, while another person played The Doors' song \"The End\" over a boombox. Many atheist and secular groups in the United States hosted \"Rapture parties\" on May 21. Other secular groups intentionally scheduled activities for Sunday, May 22, such as \"Non-Judgmental Day\", celebrating tolerance, cooperation and harmony.\n\nAmerican Atheists hosted a two-day conference over the May 21 weekend in Oakland, not far from Camping's radio station. President David Silverman commented, \"We're going to poke fun at these people, but in the end we need to keep in mind that there are people being hurt here ... We're hoping people look at this and learn to use their brains … so we don't have an occurrence of this in 2012\" (when some believed the Mayans predicted as the Earth's final destruction).\n\nCamping continued to predict that October 21 would mark the end of the world, but modified his prediction with words like \"probably\" and \"maybe\". \"I really am beginning to think as I've restudied these matters that there's going to be no big display of any kind,\" Camping said in a podcast. \"The end is going to come very, very quietly.\" He kept a low profile as the date approached, and his daughter responded to a media request by saying, \"I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we at Family Radio have been directed to not talk to the media or the press.\"\n\nNo statement was issued by Camping or Family Radio on October 21 or 22. It was later reported that Camping told an interviewer on October 16 that God has not given anyone the power to know exactly when the Rapture would come. He retired from his leadership position at Family Radio. Sometime after October 21, Family Radio posted an audio message from Harold Camping on their home page. In the message, Camping stated, regarding end times prophecy, that \"we are finding it very very difficult\". He also told followers to \"not feel abandoned by God\" and that \"God is still in charge of everything\".\n\nAs October 21 approached, the Freedom from Religion Foundation bought space on more than 40 billboards in the Bay Area to mock Camping's predictions and urge viewers to use rational judgment. The billboards featured slogans such as, \"Fool me once...\", \"Still here\", and \"Every day is judgment day. Use yours. Use reason.\"\n\nMedia reports on October 21 and 22 stressed that Camping had been \"wrong again\". The \"International Business Times\" proclaimed him a \"false prophet.\" On October 21, 2011, \"Time\" magazine's website listed Camping's end times predictions as one of the \"Top 10 Failed Predictions\", a list compiled in Camping's \"honor\".\n\nFamily Radio removed from its web site the archive of audio recordings of Camping's Open Forum program recorded prior to May 2011.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Camping suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Family Radio broadcast reruns of his May 23 – June 9 Open Forum segments for several weeks. As of June 23 Family Radio began to provide new programming in his time slot.\n\nCamping died on December 15, 2013 at the age of 92, as a result of complications from a fall at home two weeks earlier.\n\nCamping's writings that detail the timing of the end include:\n\n\n\n\nOwned and operated by Chris McCann.\nPublications include:\n\nMcCann continued to teach that October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world, even after the failed May 21, 2011 prediction. And after October 21, 2011, he taught that the end of the world would occur in March 2012.\n\nAt the end of 2012, McCann began teaching the possibility that the last day would be October 7, 2015. He said that there was \"a strong likelihood that this will happen\" and \"an unlikely possibility that it will not\".\n\nThis date was arrived at by adding 1600 days (taken from ) to May 21, 2011, which McCann still teaches is the beginning of the day of judgment. He noted that October 7, 2015 is last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, and exactly 10,000 days from May 21, 1988, which he claims is the date the Church Age came to an end.\n\n\n"}

It is a double album with a total of seventeen songs—nine on \"Abattoir Blues\" and eight on \"The Lyre of Orpheus\".\n\nThe album was produced by Nick Launay at Studio Ferber in Paris in March–April 2004 and Nick Cave used The Bad Seeds line up of Mick Harvey, Thomas Wydler, Martyn Casey, Conway Savage, Jim Sclavunos, Warren Ellis, and James Johnston. It was the first album by the group for which Blixa Bargeld did not perform – English guitarist and organist Johnston, of the group Gallon Drunk, replaced Bargeld. Cave decided to split drumming duties for the two parts, with Sclavunos on \"Abattoir Blues\" and Wydler on \"The Lyre of Orpheus\". According to Launay, the whole album was completed in twelve days.\n\nThe album's release was supported by the Abattoir Blues Tour, which travelled through Europe from 2 November to 5 December. In January 2007 a double live album and DVD was issued as \"The Abattoir Blues Tour\". \"Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus\"s last track, \"O Children\", was featured in the 2010 film \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", and the song is referenced as an achievement in \"\". In March 2005, to complement the success of the double album, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released \"B-Sides & Rarities\", a three-disc, 56-track collection of B-sides, rarities, and tracks that had appeared on film soundtracks.\n\n\"Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus\" holds a score of 88 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Susan Carpenter of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the album as \"a bounty of gothic rock\" and noted that \"the more driving, menacing numbers have been separated from the slow and scurrilous in a double album that is not two halves of a whole so much as two distinct records released simultaneously and in one package.\" Thom Jurek of AllMusic described \"Abattoir Blues\" as \"a rock & roll record... a pathos-drenched, volume-cranked rocker, full of crunch, punishment – and taste\" and \"The Lyre of Orpheus\" as \"a much quieter, more elegant affair... more consciously restrained, its attention to craft and theatrical flair more prevalent.\". Greg Simpson of Punknews.org said that \"Abattoir Blues\" \"is very bluesy indeed, a rock and roll album with many angry songs and booming bass lines,\" while \"The Lyre of Orpheus\" \"insists on being a separate album, due to its completely different more gentle feel.\"\n\nIn a rave review, \"Tiny Mix Tapes\" critic Grigsby wrote that while \"Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus\" \"may not be the best beginner's guide\" to the band, for \"anyone who is a fan of the duration of his career, this album rewards the listener with a bit of the best of everything he has to offer.\" \"Paste\" said: \"Aside from the power of the music and lyrics, the set draws on Cave’s compelling persona: part priest, part sideshow barker--crooning one moment and eviscerating the next. While this has always been the core of his talent, on \"Abattoir/Lyre\" it is particularly rich and rewarding.\" In a more mixed assessment, Douglas Wolk, writing in \"Spin\", was complimentary of \"Abattoir Blues\" but felt that \"The Lyre of Orpheus\" was \"effectively \"Abattoir\" spillover: more mellow, less grand in conception, but—somehow—more pretentious in execution.\" In his Consumer Guide for \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau designated three songs from the album (\"The Lyre of Orpheus\", \"There She Goes, My Beautiful World\", and \"Hiding All Away\") as \"choice cuts\", indicating good songs \"on an album that isn't worth your time or money.\"\n\nThe music online magazine Pitchfork Media placed \"Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus\" at number 180 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nIt peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart, its chart success in Europe includes No. 1 in Norway, No. 2 in Austria and Denmark, and top 10 in Belgium, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden.

Each sage has an association with a specific mythic King. After the seventh sage and king, a deluge (see Epic of Gilgamesh) is said to have occurred. Records list further sages and further historic king pairings. Post-deluge, the sages are considered human, and in some texts are distinguished by being referred to as \"Ummanu\", not \"Apkallu\".\n\nThe terms \"Apkallu\" (as well as \"Abgal\") is also used as an epithet for kings and gods as a mark of wisdom or knowledge.\n\nA further use of the term \"Apkallu\" is when referring to figurines used in apotropaic rituals; these figurines include fish-man hybrids representing the seven sages, but also include bird-headed and other figures.\n\nIn a later work by Berossus describing Babylonia, the Apkallu appear again, also described as fish-men who are sent by the gods to impart knowledge to people. In Berossus, the first one Oannes (a variant of Uanna) is said to have taught people the creation myth the \"Enuma Elis\" (qv)\n\nThe terms \"apkallu\" has multiple uses, but usually refers to some form of wisdom; translations of the term generally equate to English language uses of the terms \"the wise\" or \"sage.\" \n\nAs an epithet, prefix, or adjective it can mean \"the wise\"; it has been used as an epithet for the gods Ea and Marduk, simply interpreted as \"wise one amongst gods\" or similar forms. It has also been applied to Enlil, Ninurta, and Adad, alternatively translated as meaning 'expert.' \n\nA second meaning is when used to refer to the \"seven sages.\" It has also been applied as an epithet of the sage Adapa The term has also been used specifically when referring to apotropaic figures, which are often figurines the 'seven sages' themselves.\n\nA collation of the names and 'titles' of theses seven sages in order can be given as: \n\nAdditionally, the term is used when referring to human \"priests\" (also 'exorcists', 'diviners'). However, Mesopotamian human sages also used the term \"ummianu\" (ummânù).\nThe term 'apkallu' is Akkadian, it is thought to derive from the Sumerian \"abgal\".\n\nThe first of these legendary fish-man sages is known as Oan/Oannes (Sumerian) or Uanna/U-An (Akkadian); on a few cuneiform inscriptions this first sage has \"adapa\" appended to his name. Borger notes, however, that it is difficult to believe that the half-man half-fish \"Adapa\" is the same as the fisherman of the Adapa myth, the son of the god Ea. A potential solution was given by W.G. Lambert -- evidence that \"adapa\" was also used as an appellative meaning \"wise\".\n\nThese Sages are found in the \"Uruk List of Kings and Sages\" (165 BC) discovered in 1959/60 in the Seleucid era temple of Anu in Bit Res; The text consisted of list of seven kings and their associated sages, followed by a note on the 'Deluge' (see Gilgamesh flood myth), followed by eight more king/sage pairs.\n\nA tentative translation reads :\n\nLenzi notes that the list is clearly intended to be taken in chronological order. It is an attempt to connect real (historic) kings directly to mythologic (divine) kingship and also does the same connecting those real king's sages (ummanu) with the demi-godly mythic seven sages (apkallu).\n\nThough the list is taken to be chronological, the texts do not portray the Sages (nor the kings) as genealogically related to each other or their kings. There is some similarity between the sages' and kings' names in the list, but not enough to draw any solid conclusions.\n\nA list (similar to the Uruk list) of the seven sages followed by four human sages is also given in an apotropaic incantation the tablet series \"Bit meseri\". The ritual involved hanging or placing statues of the sages on the walls of a house. A translation of the cuneiform was given by Borger:\n\nBorger found the Uruk and \"bit meseri\" lists to be in agreement.\n\nA text giving the story known as the Twenty-One \"Poultices\" (ref. no. LKA No.76) contains duplications of much of the \"Bit meseir\" text concerning the seven sages - it was analyzed by . Another text from Uruk was later found that duplicated and further completed the coverage of Reiner's text.\n\nIn \"the twenty-one poultices\" text the seven sages (of Eridu) are entrusted with the reading \"tablets of destiny.\" Additionally the sage Anenlilda is the maker of the 'twenty-one poultices' -- these items are then given to Nudimmud to bring to the \"upper world\" to gain merit.\n\nThe seven sages are also mentioned in the Epic of Erra (aka 'Song of Erra', or 'Erra and Ishum'); here again they are referenced as \"paradu\"-Fish. In this text is described how after the Flood, Marduk banished them back to Abzu. Once the apkallu are banished, Marduk's phrasing becomes rhetorical (left):\n\nFinally Erra persuades Marduk to leave his temple and fetch back the apkallu from their banishment, reassuring that he will keep order whilst Marduk is away. However, chaos breaks out; though some of the text is missing it seems that the subsequent outcome was that instead, earthly \"ummanus\" are given the task of cleansing Marduk's shrine. Kvanvig infers from this text that the mythological role of the apkallu was to aid the god (Marduk) in keeping creation stable by maintenance of Marduk's idol.\n\nAccording to Scott B. Noegel this epic also contains several clever etymological wordplays on the names of apkallu, both textual and phonetic.\n\nThis text appears to have a completely different role for the apkallu from that given in the lists of sages and kings -- essentially, Kvanvig proposes that the pre-deluge king-sage list was retroactively inserted onto a Sumerian king list, so to combine the historical record with the flood legend. In doing so it creates an pre-flood origin story for the Sumerian kings.\n\nA Sumerian temple hymn states the seven sages (here as \"abgal\") enlarged a temple.\nThe seven sages were also associated with the founding of the seven cities of Eridu, Ur, Nippur, Kullab, Kesh, Lagash, and Shuruppak; and in the Epic of Gilgamesh (Gilg. I 9; XI 305) they are credited with laying the foundations of Uruk.\n\nBerossus wrote a history of Babylon in around 281 BC, during the Greek period of overlordship. According to his own account, he was a Chaldean priest of Bel (Marduk). His \"Babyloniaca\" was written in Greek, probably for the Seleucid court of Antiochus I. His work gives a description of the wise men, their names, and their associated kings. Berossus' original book is now lost, but parts have survived via the abridgment and copying of historians including Alexander Polyhistor, Josephus, Abydenus, and Eusebius. Mayer Burstein suggests that Berossus' work was partly metaphorical, intended to convey wisdoms concerning the development of man -- a nuance lost or uncommented on by later copyists.\n\nWhat remains of Berossos' account via Apollodorus begins with a description on Babylonia, followed by the appearance of a learned fish-man creature named Oannes. Truncated account:\n\nTruncated account via Abydenus:\n\nTruncated account via Alexander Polyhistor:\n\nIn summary, Berossus' Babylonian history recounts ten kings before a deluge (followed by the reigns of later kings), with a record or myth of primitive man receiving civilized knowledge via the Oannes; in also contains a paraphrasing of the myth the \"Enuma Elis\", which was said to have been recounted by the Oannes. Though Berossus' history contains obvious historical errors, parts of it have convincing matches with ancient cuneiform texts, suggest he was recreating accounts known from ancient Mesopotamian texts. Mayer Burstein considers that the text was not well written in a 'Greek style', but was essentially a transliteration of Mesopotamian myths into Greek. Helpfully for future historians, Berossus does not seem to have altered the myths or narratives to suit a Greek audience.\n\nIn terms of his relevance to the Apkallu: his lists match fairly well with the Uruk King/Apkallu list, though there are differences and variations. Oannes is paired with the king Alorus, and by comparison can be considered equivalent to Adapa [Uanna]. Matches between Berossus and the kings and apkallu in the Uruk King List have been proposed.\n\nVarious other cuneiform texts have references to these seven sages. There are texts that associates a set of seven sages with the city Kuar-Eridu or Eridu, while in the Epic of Gilgamesh there is a reference to seven counselors as founders of Uruk. Another list of seven sages used in a ritual differs from the description and names give in the \"Bit meseri\" text.\n\nSeveral of named apkulla are listed on inscriptions as authors, notably Lu-Nanna is recorded as author of the \"Myth of Etana\".\n\nRepresentations of 'apkallu' were used in apotropaic rituals; in addition to fish-headed ones (similar to descriptions of the seven sages), other human-animal hybrids were used as 'apkallu' in this context (generally bird-headed humans).\n\nApkallu reliefs appear prominently in Neo-Assyrian palaces, notably the constructions of Ashurnasirpal II of the 9th century BC. They appear in one of three forms, bird-headed, human-headed or dressed in fish-skin cloaks. They have also been found on reliefs from the reign of Sennacherib. The form taken of a man covered with the 'pelt' of a fish is first seen the Kassite period, continuing is used to the period of Persian Babylonia - the form was popular during the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods.\n\nProbable depictions of Apkallu\n\nThe spread of the 'seven sage' legend westwards during the 1st and 2nd millennia has been speculated to have led to the creation of the tale of the Nephilim (Genesis 6:1-4) as recounted in the Old Testament, and may have an echo in the text of the Book of Proverbs (Prov 9:1): \"Wisdom built her house. She set out its seven pillars.\" The story of Enoch (\"seventh from Adam\") and his ascension to heaven has also been proposed to be a variant or influenced by the seventh apkallu Utuabzu who is also said to have ascended to heaven in the \"bit meseri\".\n\nOannes was once conjectured to be a form or another name of the ancient Babylonian god Ea. It is now thought that the name is the Greek form of the Babylonian \"Uanna\", an Apkallu.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As Plutarch is our only source on Camma, her historicity cannot be independently verified. In both works, Plutarch cites her as an exemplar of fidelity and courage in love.\n\nIn Plutarch's accounts, Camma was wedded to the tetrarch Sinatus, and became known and admired for her virtue and beauty. Sinatus' rival, another tetrarch named Sinorix, murdered Sinatus and proceeded to woo Camma herself. Rather than submit to Sinorix' advances, Camma took him to a temple of Artemis where she served poison to both herself and him in a libation of either milk and honey or mead. Camma died happily, according to Plutarch, in the knowledge that she had avenged the death of her husband.\n\nPlutarch's story of Camma inspired a number of works of later art and literature. Polyaenus briefly reprises Plutarch's tale in his 2nd-century CE \"Stratagems of War\". In the Renaissance, the story of Camma enjoyed considerable popularity, inspiring \"De re uxoria\" by Barbaro, \"De institutione feminae christianae\" by Vives, the \"Libro del cortegiano\" by Castiglione, and \"Orlando furioso\" by Ariosto (where Camma is renamed Drusilla). Thomas Corneille wrote a play named \"Camma\" (1661) about the story of the Galatian princess. The opera \"Nephté\" (1789) by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne uses the story of Camma but moves the setting to Ancient Egypt. Tennyson subsequently wrote the tragedy \"The Cup\" (1884), in which Camma is again a Galatian princess. The poem ‘Camma’ by Oscar Wilde has been seen as a hedonistic commentary on Plutarch's Camma.\n\n"}

Against this some popular writers have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., John Allegro in relation to Qumran, 1970) have been \"widely dismissed as erroneous\" (Merlin, 2003). The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was Sula Benet (1967), who claimed that the plant \"kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם\" mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis, although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either \"Acorus calamus\" or \"Cymbopogon citratus\".\n\nAccording to those theories that hold that cannabis was present in Ancient Israelite society, a variant of hashish is held to have been present.\n\nIn the United States, the Jewish population is overrepresented among the recreational cannabis using population. The reasons for this are thought to be their urban pattern of residence, the disproportionate association of Jewish residents in the academic milieu of the city as well as its avant-garde moments, and that Jewish families are thought to be less authoritarian and more tolerant toward \"intellectual experimentation\". In Toronto, differences between Jews and Christians with regard to attitudes toward cannabis usage were detected in the high school population, in which surveys show that more than twice as many Jewish students have used cannabis as Catholic ones.\n\nIn a 1973 opinion, Orthodox rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.\n\nIn 2013, Orthodox rabbi Efraim Zalmanovich stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher. In 2016, Belarusian-Israeli rabbi Chaim Kanievsky declared that medicinal cannabis was kosher for Passover. In January 2016, the Orthodox Union certified some medical cannabis products made by Vireo as kosher, their first medical cannabis certification.\n\nIn the United States, the Jewish Social Policy Action Network in Philadelphia and Rabbi Eric Cytrin of Temple Beth El in Harrisburg, have supported medical legalization efforts for cannabis in Pennsylvania.\n\nIf smoked, under normal circumstances there is no reason cannabis would not be kosher, although some rabbis apply this only to medical cannabis, not recreational usage. However, this is excepting that smoking it typically involves lighting a spark, so it would not be appropriate for example after sundown on Shabbat. If cannabis is \"eaten\", as edibles are, on the other hand, the issue is not as clear cut, as there may be small insects inside which are not kosher. For the observant it is recommended to only use brands that are certified as kosher. For cannabis grown in Israel, the plants must observe Shmittah, but this does not apply to cannabis from elsewhere.\n"}

In a career spanning more than 30 years, Smash came to prominence in the late 1970s as the backing vocalist, trumpet player, harmonica player and dancer for the English ska band Madness.\n\nIn addition to trumpet, Smyth plays the bass guitar (having initially joined Madness as a bassist), acoustic guitar and other various percussion instruments. He occasionally performs the lead vocals, such as on the songs \"Michael Caine\", \"Wings of a Dove\", \"One Step Beyond\" and \"Madness (Is All in the Mind)\". He was initially an occasional songwriter, but became a more regular contributor over the course of Madness's career and was credited as co-writer on the band's major international hit, \"Our House\".\n\nCathal Joseph Smyth was born on 14 January 1959, in Middlesex Hospital, Fitzrovia, London, England, and grew up in Marylebone. As a child he went by the name of Carl. His parents were Irish immigrants. His father worked in the oil business and moved the family from Ireland to England, and then to the Middle East because of his work. The Smyths were competitive Irish dancers, and Cathal grew up around dance, but never took much of an interest until he began to dance as a performer.\n\nIn 1976, the North London Invaders recruited Smyth to play the bass guitar with them when he was only 17 years old, but he was replaced a year later by Gavin Rogers. During the late seventies, Cathal became friends with members of the band Madness, and performed as a dancer onstage at their concerts.\n\nIn 1980, Smyth became the last of the seven original Madness members to join the band. He soon moved on to playing other instruments instead of bass. After Madness broke up in 1986, he formed a new short-lived band The Madness in 1988 along with Suggs, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman.\n\nIn 1990, Cathal became an executive for Go Discs where, at his suggestion, the label signed The Stairs. He was also responsible for reforming Madness in 1992 for Madstock!, but he left Go Discs to reform the band. In 1989/1990, he became friends with former Smiths singer Morrissey, who had once asked him to be his manager. Smyth declined, claiming that \"I didn't fancy having to iron his socks.\" Smyth introduced Morrissey to Boz Boorer, who went on to work with him from 1991 onwards. Cathal is also the subject of the 1992 Morrissey single, \"You're the One for Me, Fatty\".\n\nHe also provided backing vocals on Morrissey's version of the Jam's \"That's Entertainment\". Cathal also had a small part in Suggs' solo career, co-writing the song \"Green Eyes,\" and he also performed backing vocals on \"The Lone Ranger\" album. In 1999, Smyth formed and fronted the folk-influenced band The Velvet Ghost, which played at the Fleadh festival in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, Cathal started up his own record label, Rolled Gold Records (RGR Music), at an office in Camden Town. He released a debut single, \"We're Coming Over\", with The England Supporters Band (billed as Mr. Smash & Friends) and it reached number 67 in the UK Singles Charts. RGR released an album and three singles by London rapper, Just Jack. The label also released material by dance and rap artists Autamata and Border Crossing. In 2004, after briefly moving his office to Islington, he closed RGR.\n\nIn 2009 Madness released their first album of new material in ten years, \"The Liberty of Norton Folgate\". About this time, Smyth was rumoured to be working on several solo projects, including a dubstep album, according to \"Mojo\". In 2012 Madness followed up \"Norton Folgate\" with \"Oui Oui, Si Si, Ja Ja, Da Da\".\n\nHis debut solo album, \"A Comfortable Man\", was released in May 2015 and it reached no.68 in the UK album chart. In 2016 Madness released \" Can't Touch Us Now\", the first Madness album since \"One Step Beyond\" to be recorded without Smyth being credited as a member of the band.\n\nSmyth became a Freemason in 1994.\n\nAfter being a couple since their teen years, Smyth and his wife of 28 years separated in 2005. He has three grown-up children from the marriage: Casper, Milo, and Eloise. He appeared with Eloise at the 2012 Q Awards ceremony. \n\nAfter his marriage ended, Smyth started to practise Transcendental Meditation. He also spent time in rehab in Arizona and moved to Ibiza in 2008.\n\nStudio albums\n\n"}

The suggestion of a Nahuatl etymology for the Virgin's name was part of the Mexican indigenista debates of the mid 20th century, in which prominent intellectuals reinterpreted Mexican history with a renewed emphasis on the nation's indigenous heritage. In addition to \"coatlaxopeuh\" many other proposed Nahuatl etymologies of Guadalupe have been suggested, but in the devotional literature coatlaxopeuh remains the most accepted.\n\nThe earliest suggestion that the word \"Guadalupe\" had originated as a misconstrual of an original Nahuatl word was by the priest Luís Becerra y Tanco in 1666. He proposed that since Juan Diego to whom the virgin had appeared did not speak Spanish, and since the Nahuatl language did not have the voiced consonants \"g\" or \"d\", it was likely that the name had originally been a Nahuatl word which was later misheard by Spaniards as Guadalupe. He proposed that the original name could have been \"tequantlanopeuh\" which he translated as \"She who originated from the summit of the rocks\".\n\nFather Mario Rojas Sánchez who translated the Nican Mopohua suggested the Nahuatl name \"Tlecuauhtlapeupeuh,\" which he translates as \"She who emerges from the region \nof light like the Eagle from fire\".\n\nScholar Jeanette Rodriguez, citing Xavier Escalada, notes \"the Nahuatl language does not contain the letters d and g; therefore Our Lady's name could not have been \"Guadalupe\". She also presents the theory that Juan Diego and his uncle called the lady \"Tlecuauhtlacupeuh\", saying \"The Nahuatl understanding of 'Tlecuauhtlacupeuh' is \"La que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego\" (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire). The region of light was the dwelling place of the Aztec gods, and the eagle was a sign from the gods. To the Spaniards, it sounded like 'Guadalupe' and reminded them of their Virgin at home.\" \n\nRodriguez holds that the Spanish thought of \"Guadalupe of Estremadura, Spain. [As] A large number of conquistadors were from the province of Estremadura and quite naturally were devoted to the local patroness. ...the devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Estremadura was reaching its peak at the time of the first contacts between Spain and the New World\". \n\nRodriguez states that the name \"To the Spaniards...reminded them of their Virgin at home. To the natives, it...referred to a sign that had come from their gods.\" This allowed each side to see in the story something it \"understood and valued, which would inevitably bring them together as a unifying force.\"\n\nGloria Anzaldúa, in her book \"Borderlands / La Frontera,\" proposes the indigenous origin of Guadalupe as \"Coatlalopeuh\", which she translates as \"She Who Has Dominion over Serpents.\" She argues that because Coatlalopeuh sounds like \"Guadalupe\", the Spanish saw Coatlalopeuh as parallel or identical to \"the dark Virgin, \"Guadalupe\", patroness of West Central Spain\" (Page 27). Anzaldúa gives \"Coatlaxopeuh\" as a variant name. She sees both versions as being linked historically to \"Coatlicue\", whose name means \"Serpent Skirt.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "106339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106339", "title": "Dagon", "text": "Dagon\n\nDagon (; , /dɔːgon/) or Dagan () is an ancient Mesopotamian and ancient Canaanite deity. He appears to have been worshipped as a fertility god in Ebla, Assyria, Ugarit and among the Amorites.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible mentions him as the national god of the Philistines with temples at Ashdod and elsewhere in Gaza.\n\nA long-standing association with a Canaanite word for \"fish\" (as in , Tib. ), perhaps going back to the Iron Age, has led to an interpretation as a \"fish-god\", and the association of \"merman\" motifs in Assyrian art (such as the \"Dagon\" relief found by Austen Henry Layard in the 1840s). The god's name was, however, more likely derived from a word for \"grain\", suggesting that he was in origin associated with fertility and agriculture.\n\nThe name is recorded as Ugaritic ( or ), Akkadian .\n\nIn Ugaritic, the root also means \"grain\": in Hebrew, (Samaritan Hebrew ), is an archaic word for grain.\n\nAccording to Philo of Byblos, the Phoenician author Sanchuniathon explained \"Dagon\" as a word for \"grain\" (). Sanchuniathon further explains: \"And Dagon, after he discovered grain and the plough, was called Zeus Arotrios.\" The word means \"ploughman\" or \"pertaining to agriculture\" (from ).\n\nThe theory relating the name to the Hebrew word \"fish\", based solely upon a reading of 1 Samuel 5:2–7, is discussed in below.\n\nThe god Dagon first appears in extant records about 2500 in the Mari texts and in personal Amorite names in which the Mesopotamian gods Ilu (Ēl), Dagan, and Adad are especially common.\n\nAt Ebla (Tell Mardikh), from at least 2300 , Dagan was the head of the city pantheon comprising some 200 deities and bore the titles \"BE-DINGIR-DINGIR\", \"Lord of the gods\" and \"Bekalam\", \"Lord of the land\". His consort was known only as Belatu, \"Lady\". Both were worshipped in a large temple complex called E-Mul, \"House of the Star\". One entire quarter of Ebla and one of its gates were named after Dagan. Dagan is called \"ti-lu ma-tim\", \"dew of the land\" and \"Be-ka-na-na\", possibly \"Lord of Canaan\". He was called lord of many cities: of Tuttul, Irim, Ma-Ne, Zarad, Uguash, Siwad, and Sipishu.\n\nDagan is mentioned occasionally in early Sumerian texts but becomes prominent only in later Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions as a powerful and warlike protector, sometimes equated with Enlil. Dagan's wife was in some sources the goddess Shala (also named as wife of Adad and sometimes identified with Ninlil). In other texts, his wife is Ishara. In the preface to his famous law code, King Hammurabi calls himself \"the subduer of the settlements along the Euphrates with the help of Dagan, his creator\". \nAn inscription about an expedition of Naram-Sin to the Cedar Mountain relates (\"ANET\", p. 268): \"Naram-Sin slew Arman and Ibla with the 'weapon' of the god Dagan who aggrandizes his kingdom.\"\n\nAn interesting early reference to Dagan occurs in a letter to King Zimri-Lim of Mari, 18th century , written by Itur-Asduu an official in the court of Mari and governor of Nahur (the Biblical city of Nahor) (\"ANET\", p. 623). It relates a dream of a \"man from Shaka\" in which Dagan appeared. In the dream, Dagan blamed Zimri-Lim's failure to subdue the King of the Yaminites upon Zimri-Lim's failure to bring a report of his deeds to Dagan in Terqa. Dagan promises that when Zimri-Lim has done so: \"I will have the kings of the Yaminites [\"coo\"]\"ked\" on a fisherman's \"spit\", and I will lay them before you.\"\n\nIn Ugarit around 1300 , Dagon had a large temple and was listed third in the pantheon following a father-god and Ēl, and preceding Baīl Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or Hadad/Adad). Joseph Fontenrose first demonstrated that, whatever their deep origins, at Ugarit Dagon was sometime identified with El, explaining why Dagan, who had an important temple at Ugarit is so neglected in the Ras Shamra mythological texts, where Dagon is mentioned solely in passing as the father of the god Hadad (Ba'al), but Anat, El's daughter, is Ba'al's sister, and why no temple of El has appeared at Ugarit. It is suspected that Dagon was one of the \"seventy sons of El and Athirat\" that later sired Hadad (Ba'al) who would eventually attempt to forcefully insert himself in the second-tier of the council of El (although he would ultimately fail in this attempt)\n\n\"Dagan\" was sometimes used in Mesopotamian royal names. Two kings of the pre-Babylonian Dynasty of Isin were Iddin-Dagan (c. 1974–1954 ) and Ishme-Dagan (c. 1953–1935 ). The latter name was later used by two Assyrian kings: Ishme-Dagan I (c. 1782–1742 ) and Ishme-Dagan II (c. 1610–1594 ).\n\nThe stele of the 9th century BC Assyrian emperor Ashurnasirpal II (\"ANET\", p. 558) refers to Ashurnasirpal as the favorite of Anu and of Dagan. In an Assyrian poem, Dagan appears beside Nergal and Misharu as a judge of the dead. A late Babylonian text makes him the underworld prison warder of the seven children of the god Emmesharra.\n\nThe Phoenician inscription on the sarcophagus of King Eshmunʿazar of Sidon (5th century BC) relates (\"ANET\", p. 662): \"Furthermore, the Lord of Kings gave us Dor and Joppa, the mighty lands of Dagon, which are in the Plain of Sharon, in accordance with the important deeds which I did.\"\n\nSanchuniathon reportedly made Dagon the brother of Cronus, both sons of the Sky (Uranus) and Earth, but not truly Hadad's father. Hadad (Demarus) was begotten by \"Sky\" on a concubine before Sky was castrated by his son Ēl, whereupon the pregnant concubine was given to Dagon. Accordingly, Dagon in this version is Hadad's half-brother and stepfather.\n\nThe Byzantine \"Etymologicon Magnum\" lists Dagon as the Phoenician Cronus.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Dagon is particularly the god of the Philistines with temples at Beth-dagon in the tribe of Asher (Joshua 19.27), in Gaza (Judges 16.23, which tells soon after how the temple is destroyed by Samson as his last act). Another temple, located in Ashdod, was mentioned in 1 Samuel 5:2–7 and again as late as 1 Maccabees 10.83;11.4. King Saul's head was displayed in a temple of Dagon. There was also a second place known as Beth-Dagon in Judah (Joshua 15.41). The first-century Jewish historian Josephus mentions a place named Dagon above Jericho. Jerome mentions Caferdago between Diospolis and Jamnia. There is also a modern Beit Dejan south-east of Nablus. Some of these toponyms may have to do with grain rather than the god.\n\nThe account in 1 Samuel 5.2–7 relates how the Ark of the Covenant was captured by the Philistines and taken to Dagon's temple in Ashdod. The following morning the Ashdodites found the image of Dagon lying prostrate before the ark. They set the image upright, but again on the morning of the following day they found it prostrate before the ark, but this time with head and hands severed, lying on the \"miptān\" translated as \"threshold\" or \"podium\". The account continues with the puzzling words \"raq dāgôn nišʾar ʿālāyw\", which means literally \"only Dagon was left to him.\" (The Septuagint, Peshitta, and Targums render \"Dagon\" here as \"trunk of Dagon\" or \"body of Dagon\", presumably referring to the lower part of his image.)\n\nThereafter we are told that neither the priests nor anyone ever steps on the \"miptān\" of Dagon in Ashdod \"unto this day\". \"We have remarkable evidence of the permanence of the custom in , where the Philistines are described as 'those that leap on, or more correctly over, 'the threshold'\". This story is depicted on the frescoes of the Dura-Europos synagogue as the opposite to a depiction of the High Priest Aaron and the Temple of Solomon.\n\nThe \"vita\" of Porphyry of Gaza, mentions the great god of Gaza, known as Marnas (Aramaic \"Marnā\" the \"Lord\"), who was regarded as the god of rain and grain and invoked against famine. Marna of Gaza appears on coinage of the time of Hadrian. \nHe was identified at Gaza with Cretan Zeus, \"Zeus Krētagenēs\". It is likely that Marnas was the Hellenistic expression of Dagon. His temple, the Marneion—the last surviving great cult center of paganism—was burned by order of the Roman emperor during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in 402. Treading upon the sanctuary's paving-stones had been forbidden. Christians later used these same to pave the public marketplace.\n\nThe \"fish\" etymology was accepted in 19th and early 20th century scholarship. This led to the association with the \"merman\" motif in Assyrian and Phoenician art (e.g. Julius Wellhausen, William Robertson Smith), and with the figure of the Babylonian \"Oannes\" (Ὡάννης) mentioned by Berossus (3rd century BC).\nThe first to cast doubt on the \"fish\" etymology was Schmökel (1928), who suggested that while Dagon was not in origin a \"fish god\", the association with \"dâg\" \"fish\" among the maritime Canaanites (Phoenicians) would have affected the god's iconography. Fontenrose (1957:278) still suggests that Berossos's \"Odakon\", part man and part fish, was possibly a garbled version of Dagon. Dagon was also equated with Oannes.\nThe association with \"dāg\"/\"dâg\" 'fish' is made by 11th-century Jewish Bible commentator Rashi. In the 13th century, David Kimhi interpreted the odd sentence in 1 Samuel 5.2–7 that \"only Dagon was left to him\" to mean \"only the form of a fish was left\", adding: \"It is said that Dagon, from his navel down, had the form of a fish (whence his name, Dagon), and from his navel up, the form of a man, as it is said, his two hands were cut off.\" The Septuagint text of 1 Samuel 5.2–7 says that both the hands \"and the head\" of the image of Dagon were broken off.\n\nThe Semitic god Dagon has appeared in many works of popular culture.\n\nNotable examples include John Milton's epic poems \"Samson Agonistes\" and \"Paradise Lost\", \"Dagon\" and \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" by H. P. Lovecraft, \"Dagon\" by Fred Chappell, \"Middlemarch\" by George Eliot, and \"King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David\" by Malachi Martin.\n\n\n\n"}

She worked in Wellington as a journalist, and wrote a weekly article for the Catholic weekly \"The New Zealand Tablet\" for almost fifty years.\n\nShe was born in Tuamarina near Blenheim in Marlborough, the youngest of four daughters of John and Julia Duggan. They were both from County Kerry, Ireland, and had married in Wellington on 7 October 1885. John was a platelayer on the New Zealand Railways.\n\nShe attended Tuamarina School from 1901 to 1910 and Marlborough High School. She taught as a pupil teacher at Tuamarina School from 1912 to 1913, and attended Wellington Teachers Training College from 1914 to 1915. She studied at Victoria University College, Wellington from 1916, receiving a BA in 1916, and a MA with first class honours in history in 1918, and was awarded the Jacob Joseph Scholarship. She taught at Dannevirke High School in 1918, then at Marlborough High School, St Patrick’s College, Wellington, and was an assistant lecturer at Victoria University College for one year. She was deeply affected by the death of her sister Evelyn in 1921, and after briefly staying with her other married sister Mary moved about 1925 to the Catholic Girls’ Hostel in Wellington. Her other sister Catherine (or Katherine) had entered the Order of Our Lady of the Missions.\n\nShe had continued ill health from a childhood sickness, so decided to give up teaching. Partly for the same reason she decided not to marry in 1918 and in 1940. She supported herself by journalism, with a weekly article in \"The New Zealand Tablet\", writing the women’s page under the pen name of Pippa. The first article appeared in the issue of 7 September 1927, and the last posthumously on 17 January 1973. She also wrote items for newspapers like \"The Dominion\" of Wellington. She lived in inner-city Wellington in Glencoe Terrace off The Terrace, in a weird canyon in the heart of the city up flights of precipitous stairs.\n\nHer first poems were published in \"The New Zealand Tablet\" in 1917. Soon after her arrival in Wellinngton she published her first volume, probably in 1921 (although other dates have been proposed: 1920, 1922 or 1924). Through her career she published individual poems in various newspapers and journals in New Zealand (\"The School Journal\"), Australia (\"The Bulletin\"), England (\"The New English Weekly\") and America (\"America\" and \"The Commonweal\", both Catholic journals). In the 1930s she was New Zealand's best-known poet, with an Eileen Duggan Society in America. Her 1937 volume of poems had an introduction by Walter de la Mare. She stopped writing poems about 1951. She wrote some poems on events for the Catholic Church, which treated her at times as an unofficial poet laureat, and a poem when Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage died.\n\nSome of her poems were anthologised in books of New Zealand poems by Chapman, Bennett and Vincent O’Sullivan, but none of her poems were included in Allen Curnows influential 1960 \"Penguin\" anthology because of a disagreement over selection of them. Her reputation declined after her death, from her association with the English Georgian poets and with the inclusion of some of her poems in the 1930 anthology \"Kowhai Gold\" which was rather self-consciously New Zealand.\n\nShe was awarded the O.B.E. in 1937 for services to the Dominion, one of the first writers to be so honoured. In 1942 Prime Minister Peter Fraser who was a personal friend got her a small pension.\n\n\n\n"}

In some English-language Bibles, the word is transliterated as \"ezob.\" \n\nThe Septuagint translates the name as ὕσσωπος \"hyssop\", and English translations of the Bible often follow this rendering. The Hebrew word אזוב and the Greek word ὕσσωπος probably share a common (unknown) origin.\n\nIn the Bible, \"ezov\" is described as a small plant found on or near walls, with an aromatic odour. Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and earlier Jewish commentators identified \"ezov\" with \"za'atar\", which may refer to various local herbs, including marjoram, oregano and thyme, which have aromatic and cleansing properties, grow wild in Israel, and can easily be bunched together to be used for sprinkling.\n\nThe book of John in the New Testament (written in Koine Greek) mentions that \"hyssop\" was used, along with vinegar, to alleviate the thirst of Jesus, during his Passion. Matthew and Mark mention the occasion but refer to the plant using the general term κάλαμος (\"kálamos\"), which is translated as \"reed\" or \"stick.\" \"Origanum\" has short stems and some scholars say it would have been too short to reach the mouth of Jesus during crucifixion. A number of scholars have proposed that \"ezov\" is the caper plant (\"Capparis spinosa\"), which the Arabs call \"azaf.\" The caper is native throughout the Mediterranean Basin, and considered to have cleansing properties.\n\nThe Israelites used ezov in the Passover ritual when they were enslaved in Egypt, according to the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, to sprinkle lamb's blood on the door posts and lintels of the slaves' quarters in which they lived, so that God would pass over them as he slew the first-born of the Egyptians. The Israelites used ezov more regularly for other rituals when they had settled in Israel. It was used in the ritual for cleansing from leprosy and for ritual purification. In Psalms, the sprinkling of ezov is used metaphorically to refer to purification of the heart.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church and some sects interpret \"ezov\" as \"hyssop\" and have adopted the biblical practice of sprinkling with water to ritually cleanse objects, including churches and people, in a ritual termed \"aspersion\" during the Asperges.\n"}

Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions is a 1980 book by magician and skeptic James Randi about paranormal, occult, and pseudoscience claims. The foreword is by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. Randi explores topics which he says that scientists and the media are too willing to promote without skepticism and proper expertise.\n\nTimothy Ferris wrote that \"Flim Flam!\" \"will enlighten any reader who does not clearly understand that not one shard of evidence exists to prove that the Bermuda Triangle poses any special menace to ships and planes, that earth is being visited by alien spacecraft, that the unassisted power of the mind can read closed books, predict our future or induce levitation, or that the 'psychic surgeons' of the Philippines have relieved their patients of any burden more troublesome than their money.\" Randi levels criticism at the sloppy study designs and faulty controls of the investigations into remote viewing by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff.\n\nGeorge Kauffman wrote, \"Randi explores and exposes the outrageous deceptions widely promoted in the sensation-seeking media.\" The book calls on \"researchers\" to be accountable for their failures and impostures. Randi writes the public is badly served by scientists investigating the paranormal who don't adhere to the standards of their profession and shows how sloppy research was followed with rationalization of their failures. The book repeatedly explores the sloppy nature of research into the paranormal, pointing out how commonly carelessness and selective interpretation that would not be tolerated in other fields of research is accepted in investigations of the supernatural. Randi documents how the scientific method is often twisted and bent to accommodate the subject of investigation.\n\nOne anecdote in the book is Randi's experience as a newspaper astrologer in Montreal under the name Zo-ran where he cut horoscopes from old astrology magazines and randomly assigned them to the twelve signs of the zodiac, publishing the results. Randi also debunks the book \"Chariots of the Gods?\" noting, among other things, the author's eurocentrism. The Transcendental Meditation movement and Edgar Cayce's mystic medical practice are subjected to Randi's skeptical scrutiny. The author also deconstructs the Cottingley Fairies particularly addressing how Arthur Conan Doyle fell for the hoax. The complete absence of any physical evidence of UFOs is also discussed.\n\nLater sections of the book cover specific cases of paranormal feats where Randi was consulted as an expert or judge. These include tests of dowsing and pyramid power. In these anecdotes the reader learns some of the methods used by charlatans including how to guess cards, tilt tables, read while blindfolded and produce photographs. Randi announces an annual award for \"the psychic who fools the greatest number of people with the least effort\" and the scientists, journalists and foundations they fool. The \"Uri trophy\" is a bent spoon on a \"flimsy and quite transparent base\". He writes that winners will be notified telepathically.\n\nTimothy Ferris wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review\" it is \"a healthy and often hilarious book.\" He described the \"Uri trophy\" as typical of the \"cheerful devices\" of Randi's book. Ferris cited Randi's, \"penchant for sarcasm and overemphasis\" as a drawback and considered this \"heavy-handedness\" appropriate for charlatans who profit from fraud but less so for sincere if gullible true-believers. He noted Randi apologized for this, describing it as, \"killing the gnat with a sledgehammer.\"\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" states \"Flim Flam!\" has a brisk pace and clear message. They were also critical of Randi's \"abrasive style\" but state that after, \"Randi has set forth the shameless frauds and money-making schemes, the outrageous misstatements and falsifications of data in respected scientific journals, the righteous harangue seems warranted.\" The magazine describes the anecdotes about cases Randi was involved in as a judge or expert as absorbing and states they go far to make the point, \"if you design the experiment adequately, no extraordinary powers are demonstrated.\" concluding, \"By the end of the book, Randi's personal offer of $10,000 to be paid to anyone who successfully demonstrates paranormal abilities under proper test conditions seems safe beyond a doubt.\"\n\nJack Kirwan writing in the \"National Review\" embraced the tone of the book describing the writing as \"a juicy knock-'em-down style\" and stating, \"Randi takes on the heavies of the paranormal scene - von Däniken, UFOs, Uri Geller, TM - and feeds them into the meat grinder of critical investigation.\" The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" stated, \"\"Flim-Flam!\" is an excellent overview of paranormal claims that analyzes medical humbugs, psychic photography, Transcendental Meditation, ancient astronauts, UFOs, etc. Plentiful photographs catch hoaxers in the act.\"\n\nIn a review of the audiotape edition in the \"Journal of College Science Teaching\" George Kauffman wrote of Randi's analysis of the failures of paranormal \"researchers\", \"In clearly pointing out their errors and misrepresentations, he provides a compelling and convincing case that will startle and enlighten the listener, especially one unable to distinguish between genuine scientific research and the pseudoscientific nonsense that results in fantastic theories and fallacies. The \"Lodi News-Sentinel\" stated \"Flim Flam!\" succeeds in discrediting the supernatural.\n\nIn 2001 \"Skeptic\" magazine listed \"Flim Flam!\" at number three in its \"Top Ten Recommended Skeptics' Books\". Novelist Christopher Brookmyre listed \"Flim Flam!\" among four of the best, \"works evincing a vivid, clear and entertaining rationalism.\" In a 2010 interview the magician Teller listed it as one of four books \"In My Library.\" \"Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions\" has been cited in newspapers, magazines and scientific journals, since its initial publication in 1980 to the present day. Google Scholar lists 82 citations.\n\nDuring an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn Jillette stated that he read \"Flim-Flam!\" in high school and \"Randi had already started changing [his] life.\"\n\n\"Flim Flam!\" was originally published in hardcover by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. then by Lippincott Crowell (an imprint of Harper & Row). The publication run by Harper & Row was planned to be 17,500 but was reduced to about 6,000 and the book was declared out of print by the publisher despite outstanding paid orders. Randi charged this was due to the publisher's conflict of interest, as Randi described the market for books promoting belief in the supernatural as, \"possibly the single greatest moneymaker in publishing today.\" Harper & Row denied this. A revised edition with an introduction by Isaac Asimov was published in 1982 by Prometheus Books. the book is available in English, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, Italian, and Chinese.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "742442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=742442", "title": "Horatii", "text": "Horatii\n\nIn the ancient Roman legend of the kingdom era, the Horatii were triplet warriors who lived during the reign of Tullus Hostilius. The accounts of their epic clash with the Curiatii and the murder of their sister by Publius, the sole survivor of the battle, appear in the writings of Livy.\n\nLivy recounts this tale in the first book of his History of Rome. During the Roman king Tullus Hostilius' war with the neighboring city of Alba Longa, it was agreed that rather than fighting a costly war between their armies, the conflict would be settled by a fight to the death between the Horatii and the three triplets from Alba Longa, known as the \"Curiatii\". They met on the battlefield between the lines as the two armies and their countrymen looked on.\n\nWith so much at stake, both sides fought bravely. The Horatii had wounded all three Curiatii, but two of the Romans were killed in the process. That left their brother Publius alone and surrounded by the three Albans. Though he was uninjured, Publius realized he stood no chance against all three of his enemies together. So he began to run across the battlefield instead. The Albans pursued him, each as fast as their individual injuries permitted. This was exactly what he had hoped they would do, and after they had gone far enough, he saw that the Curiatii had become staggered and were separated from each another. His plan had worked perfectly. He turned and launched a furious attack on the first, least-injured Curiatius and slew him.\n\nThe Roman spectators, who, moments before, had been sure of defeat, began cheering wildly as the Albans began shouting at the Curiatii to regroup in the face of Publius' onslaught. But before they could, the Horatius caught up to the second Curiatius and killed him as his brother, helpless, looked on. The final Curiatius was physically spent from his wounds and the chase. His hope had been crushed by watching both of his brothers die. He managed to unsteadily stand his ground and faced the Horatius, who was heartened by his wildly successful strategy and confident of his imminent victory. Publius declared that he had killed the first two Curiatii for his fallen brothers. He would kill this last one for the Roman cause and their rule over the Albans. He thrust his sword down the Alban's throat and took the armor of his slain enemies as the spoils of his victory.\n\nAfterwards, King Mettus honored the treaty and the Albans accepted Roman rule.\n\nThe victorious Horatius returned to a hero's welcome. Before the war had broken out, Publius' sister, Camilla, had been engaged to one of the Alban triplets. When she saw the cloak that she herself had woven and given to the Curiatius on her brother's shoulder, now stained with his blood, she realized that her betrothed had been slain. Camilla was overcome with grief and began wailing and crying out his name. Proclaiming that no Roman woman should mourn Rome's fallen enemies, Publius killed his sister on the spot.\n\nFor his crime, he was condemned to death. On the advice of a jurist named Tullus, Publius appealed to one of the popular assemblies. In defense of his son, the Horatius' father, also Publius, spoke of the recent victory and entreated them to spare his last surviving son (his fourth son, a brother of the Horatii, had also died). The assembly was persuaded and Publius' sentence was commuted. This may be the source of the Roman tradition of allowing the condemned to appeal their sentences to the populace. \n\nPublius the elder was required to offer a sacrifice to atone for his son's crime and from that time forward, the Horatia family made it a tradition to offer the same. The spoils of the victory were hung in a place that became known as Pila Horatia. A wooden beam was erected on the slope of the Oppian Hill, which was called the Sororium Tigillum (Sister's Beam). It symbolized a yoke, under which Publius the younger was made to pass. It remained standing long after his death.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47312061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47312061", "title": "Imperial Preceptor", "text": "Imperial Preceptor\n\nThe Imperial Preceptor, or Dishi (, lit. \"Teacher of the Emperor\") was a high title and powerful post created by Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty. It was established as part of Mongol patronage of Tibetan Buddhism and Yuan administrive rule of Tibet.\n\nThe title was originally created as the State Preceptor or Guoshi (, lit. \"Teacher of the State\") in 1260, the first year of Kublai Khan's enthronement. In that year he appointed the Sakya lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa to this post and soon placed him in charge of all Buddhist clergy. In 1264, he founded the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs and appointed Phagpa as the first director of this important new agency. The lama was offered nominal rule over all Tibet and also supervised Mongol relations with the Buddhist clergy. In 1270, Phagpa became Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) when the title was renamed. As Imperial Preceptor, he was authorized to issue letters and proclamations to the temples and institutions of Tibet, and he advised the Emperor regarding official appointments in Tibet. Kublai Khan dispatched the lama to Tibet in 1264 to help persuade his people to accept Mongol rule.\n\nA member of the Sakya sect, acting as Imperial Preceptor and residing in China, supervised the Buddhist clergy throughout the empire. The Mongols also selected a Tibetan official titled \"dpon-chen\" to live in and administer Tibet. This pattern of religio-political relations prevailed for the remainder of the Yuan period. After the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan dynasty by the Chinese Ming dynasty, Yuan titles such as Imperial Preceptor were revoked, replaced with titles of lesser status.\n\nThe Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) was founded by Kublai Khan after the fall of the Song Dynasty (960–1279). During the last century of the Song Dynasty, a new state referred to as the Great Hsia state came into existence. The Hsia were a Tibetan people. The Tangut monarch Jen-tsung (1139-1193) resisted the Mongolian conquest of Tibet by fighting with the Northern Steppe Tribes. He formed a close relationship between the Buddhist prelates and Tibetan priests, which led to the creation of the Hsia Institution of the Imperial Preceptorship. The role the Imperial Preceptor carried would later emerge in the Yuan Dynasty and be largely influential to the Buddhist religion during Yuan rule.\n\nKublai Khan, leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan, established the Yuan Dynasty eight years before he took over all of China. He proclaimed himself the first non-Han Emperor of China in 1279 after conquering the Song Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty was the first Chinese dynasty to be ruled by a foreign people. Under Kublai Khan, the Yuan Dynasty was structurally divided in a similar manner as the Mongol Empire. He also established his rule under the Mandate of Heaven (1272), which was a Chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify kingship over China. This doctrine helped Kublai Khan establish his legitimate rule as he was considered to have the Divine right of kings. Not only did he establish religious and political rule over China, he kept his ancestral roots as a Mongolian leader by following Confucianism. Kublai Khan expanded the Chinese commercial, scientific, and cultural industries. He improved the Silk Road, created better infrastructure, circulated paper banknotes, and spread Mongol peace, leading to a prosperous and flourishing period.\n\nThe Buddhist influence on Yuan rule under Kublai Khan was heavily dependent on the Tibetan Buddhist Imperial Preceptors. In twelfth century Asia, Hsia Buddhism was vigorously promoted and there were religious scriptures translated to Chinese and Tangut in order to spread the religion. Use of these Buddhist scriptures continued even during the Mongol conquest for the Hsia state in 1227. By the mid-twelfth century onward shows a special relationship between the Tangut throne and the Sangha that is distinct from the Song Dynasty courts. Before the Yuan Dynasty, the role of the Imperial Preceptor had already been established during the early rule of Renzong Emperor in 1139-1193. During the Mongol rule over the Yuan Dynasty, the Imperial Preceptor's position was continued in response to overseeing the political situation in Central Tibet. The role of the Imperial Preceptor was to coordinate all of the Buddhist activities and establishments in the Yuan Empire and promoting Buddhism.\n\nIn the 12th century, under the Emperor Renzong of Western Xia, the role of the imperial preceptor was serving as the emperor's chaplain, teacher and consecrator and, more generally, teaching, writing, translating and editing. Later, under the Yuan Dynasty, this post had also the added responsibility of overseeing the political situation in Central Tibet. Phagpa was a State Preceptor (guoshi), that eventually became Mongol Imperial Preceptor. The Mongol imperial preceptor resided within the precincts of the imperial palace, in order to serve the imperial family. The role of the imperial preceptors was to issue decrees, under the emperor's authority to both protect and command monasteries in Tibet. At some point, the imperial preceptor's decrees began to be equally effective as the emperor's in Tibet, as the Yuan court had begun tending to leave Tibet politically under the supervision of the imperial preceptor. He also advised the Emperor regarding official appointments in Tibet. Moreover, being members of the Sakya sect, they directed all Buddhist establishments in the Yuan empire and were charged with promoting Buddhism in the empire. They also oversaw routine Buddhist ceremonies and special rituals upon the enthronement and funerals of the emperors. They held rituals and dedicated stupas to the protection of the state and its subjects, in general terms or in specific instances, such as to prevent flooding or thunderstorms. Nevertheless, the roles of the dishi focused on religious matters rather than political ones.\n\nDrogon Chogyal Phagpa was born is 1235 – 15 December 1280 as the son of Sönam Gyeltsen, in Ngari (West Tibet). Phagpa was the first Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty, division of the Mongol Empire, and was simultaneously named the director of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. He was the fifth leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan ordered Phagpa to create a new writing system, for which he received a title of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in 1270. To design the script, Chogyal Phagpa made modifications to the Tibetan alphabet and made the Phags-pa script. The scripts was completed in 1268. Although the script was made into the official writing system of the empire there was a lot of opposition by the people and not many texts were written in that script. Although due to his important political role, he was to always stay close to the emperor and had a supreme authority over the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, he apparently did not meet with the emperor that often and mostly lived in Lintao in Gansu. He gave up his position and passed it on to his brother (Rinchen Gyaltsen - the second perceptor of the Yuan Dynasty) in 1274.\n\nIn his last years, Phagpa spent his time trying to built up the power of the Sakya-Yuan, in Tibet. Later in 1280, he died in Sakya (the Lhakhang palace). There were rumours that his death was a murder by Kunga Zangpo, who was a past \"pönchen\" (whom Phagpa had dismissed for arrogant demeanor). Kunga Zangpo was then executed by the army.\n\nRinchen Gyaltsen was born in 1238 as the son of Zangtsa Sonam Gyaltsen. He was the second preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty. Rinchen Gyaltsen’s family members were very important members in the Mongol government. His older half-brother had the title of the Dishi (Imperial Perceptor) and had a close relation with the emperor. His other brother (Chakna Dorje) was the viceroy of Tibet from the period 1264 to 1267. Also, Rinchen Gyaltsen’s father belonged to the Khon family who were hereditary rulers of the Sakya monastery in Western Tibet.\n\nWhen Rinchen Gyaltsen’s older half-brother (Phagpa - the first preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty) left Sakya, he became the “somewhat” abbot of the monastery of Sakya. Although his brother Phagpa was given the title of the Imperial Preceptor, he gave up the post in 1274 (to return to Sakya) and it was passed on to Rinchen Gyaltsen.\n\nThe year of the death of Rinchen Gyaltsen seems to be uncertain. It is said to be either 1279 or 1282 (most probably 12 March 1279). His death occurred in Shingkun (Lintao) and his post was passed on to his nephew and a son of Chakna Dorje (Dharmapala Raksita - the third preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty).\n\nDharmapala Raksita was born after the death of his father (Chakna Dojre - brother Phagpa), in 1268. In addition to the title of the Imperial Preceptor, he was also the head of the Sakya School. Since birth, because he was born fatherless, his care was assigned to the lord of Zhalu. At the age of 14 in 1892, he succeeded his uncles title and was appointed as Dishi (imperial preceptor). Although he was given the title, he did not have much experience and knowledge about the position and he never became the abbot. After receiving the title he stayed close to the great Khan. During his period of being Dishi, he mostly participated in building activities. He had a stupa built in the memory of Phagpa (the first imperial preceptor). Also, he built the Metog Raba which then became an official residence for the imperial preceptors till the end of the Yuan Dynasty. Dharmapala married two women, Palden, a granddaughter of Köden, and to Jowo Tagibum, a lady from Zhalu. He had a son with the latter, who died at the age of 5, this is why his part of the Khon family died out and the next Dishi or Sakya abbot were not part of the Khon lineage.\n\nDharmapala gave up his position as the imperial preceptor in 1286 and left the court to visit Sakya and Tibet. However, he died before getting there on 24 December 1287, at Tre Mandala.\n\nYeshe Rinchen was born in 1248 as the son of Chukpo Jetsun Kya and was from Sakya in Tibet. Unlike the first three imperial preceptors of the Yuan dynasty, Yeshe Rinchen was not from the Khon lineage. Yeshe Rinchen was from the Sharpa lineage. There were three divisions within the disciples of the abbots, Sakya Pandita and Phagpa. The three disciples were; eastern (Shar), western (Nub) and middle (Gun). The Shar (eastern) was headed by a family of Zhangzhung origins, known as Sharpa. When he was younger, Yeshe Rinchen was a follower of Phagpa. The Dishi before Yeshe Rinchen was Dharmapala Raksita and because he had no heirs to succeed his position at the time he vacancied his position as Dishi, the position was handed to the Sharpa family and Yeshe Rinchen was appointed imperial preceptor. At the same time, Yeshe Rinchen’s brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen became the ruling abbot of Sakya. There is a possibility that the Sharpa brothers were both guided and supported by an older and more experienced or influential person (imperial minister Sangge). However Sangge fell from power and was executed in 1291, which presumably made Yeshe Rinchen’s position, difficult to protect. After this, Yeshe Rinchen vaccated his position as Dishi in the same year. His position was succeeded by Drakpa Odzer. After stepping down from his position as Dishi, Yeshe Rinchen retired to the sacred Buddhist site Mount Wutai in present-day Shanxi. He died there in 1294.\n\nDrakpa Odzer was born in 1246 as the son of Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen, he was from Sakya in Tibet. Up to 1286 the position of the imperial preceptor was filled by members of the Khon family who were also usually hereditary abbots of Sakya. However, due to the lack of fully ordained members of the lineage after the death of the third preceptor (Dharmapala Raksita), persons from other clerical elite families of Sakya origins were appointed. Drakpa Odzer was from one of those clerical elite families called Khangsarpa. Drakpa Odzer was the general administrator in charge of Phagpa's property. After which he followed Phagpa's nephew Dharmapala Raksita when he moved to Beijing to take up the Dishi dignity in 1282. Drakpa Odzer was appointed as the Dishi after Yeshe Rinchen (the Dishi after Dharmapala Raksita) vaccated his position as Dishi. He held the post from 1291 until he died at the imperial court in 1303. He was succeeded by the ex-abbot Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. After Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen, his younger brother Sanggye Pal became Dishi, in 1309.\n\nJamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen was born as the son of Chukpo Jetsun Kyab in 1257, he was from Sakya in Tibet. Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen was the brother of Yeshe Rinchen, they both had another brother called Kunga Senge.\n\nThere were three divisions within the disciples of the abbots, Sakya Pandita and Phagpa. The three disciples were; eastern (Shar), western (Nub) and middle (Gun). The Shar (eastern) was headed by a family of Zhangzhung origins, known as Sharpa. Just as Yeshe Rinchen, Jamyan Rinchen Gyaltsen also belonged to the Sharpa family. After the young Sakya Dishi Dharmapala Raksita vacated his position in 1286 and died in 1287, Khagan Kublai Khan suspended the influence of the Khön family. Instead the Shar or Sharpa family came to the fore. This was possibly due to their good relations with the influential Yuan minister Sangge. Yeshe Rinchen was appointed Dishi by orders of Kublai Khan, while his youngest brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyeltsen became the acting abbot (Wylie: bla chos) of the Sakya school. The appointments gave the Sharpa brothers influence in Tibet.\n\nAt the time when Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen was the ruler of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, After the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 the dpon-chen Aglen suggested that a scion of the old Khön family should be allowed to rule Sakya instead of Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. This would be Zangpo Pal, a nephew of Phagpa, who presently stayed in South China. As a matter of fact the new great khan Temür acknowledged Zangpo Pal as the right heir and let him return to Sakya in 1298. Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen nominally handed over the abbot-ship, but continued to direct Sakya affairs from the official abbot's palace Zhitog. Later in 1303, he was summoned to Beijing by the great khan. Being a loyal and experienced man, he was ordered to take up the position of Dishi after the death of the former title-holder. However, he died in 1305, and the position was succeeded by Drakpa Odzer’s younger brother Sanggye Pal.\n\nSanggye Pal was born in 1267 as the son of Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen, he was from Sakya in Tibet. He was the younger brother of Drakpa Odzer, who was the fifth Dishi of the Yuan dynasty. Sanggye Pal belonged to the Khangsarpa family (a clerical elite family of Sakya origins). According to the Yuan shi (History of the Yuan Dynasty), the old Dishi Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen (d. 1305) was followed first by a Duoerjibale (Dorje Pal) in 1305-13, and then Sangjiayizhashi (Sanggye Tashi) in 1313-14. However, a document sent to the Tibetan myriarchy Zhalu in 1307 is issued by Sanggye Pal. Therefore, there is a possibility that Sanggye Pal took over the Dishi dignity in 1305 and kept it until 1314, and that he was also known as Dorje Pal.\n\nThere is not much documentation on Sanggye Pal and not much is known of his activities. In the period of his position as the Dishi, Tibet was relatively stable under the administration of the Yuan dynasty.\n\nKunga Lotro Gyaltsen, born in 1299 and deceased in 1327, was the eighth Tibetan Imperial Preceptor of the Yuan dynasty. He came from a very prominent aristocratic family called the Khon of Sakya. His father, Zangpo Pal, is the ruler of a monastery while his mother, Jomo Kunga Bumphulwa, was a widow of a Tibetan administrator. He served under the title of the Imperial Preceptor from 1314 until his death. As the Preceptor Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen has mass influence over the department of Buddhist affairs. For example, he once wrote a letter and started the letter by saying: “By the king's order, the words of Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen Palzangpo, Imperial Preceptor: To the officials of \"Pacification Commissioner\" rank, to generals, soldiers, administrators of the \"nang so\", to judges, holders of golden letters, chiefs of districts, laymen and monks who collect taxes and go and come, to myriarchs, to dignitaries, a command.” This shows how much power and authority he commanded during his year as the Imperial Preceptor. In 1326, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen decided to return to Tibet from the Imperial Capital due to health declination. However, he never actually went back, because his homeland was unsafe at that time due to a rebellion. Eventually, he stayed in the Yuan capital until his death (March 6, 1327).\n\nThere is neither records of Wangchug Gyeltshen’s year of birth nor that of his family background. Even the year of his death has proven to be very controversial. For example, according to the \"Yuanshi\" (also known as \"The History Of Yuan\"), Wangchug Gyeltshen deceased in 1323, while on the other hand, according to another unknown source, he died in 1325. Another controversial debate around Wangchug Gyeltshen is whether he had actually been assigned as the Imperial Preceptor or not. The reason for this controversy is that he actually died earlier than the last Preceptor, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen, who deceased in 1327. This seemed like a rather odd situation because Preceptors usually continue their role until their death. As a result, some scholars tend to believe that even if Wangchug Gyeltshen had been appointed as the Preceptor, he was merely a temporary substitute for Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen when he was away in Tibet and not around the Yuan capital.\n\nKunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was born in 1308 and died in 1330. He was the younger brother of the eighth Imperial Preceptor, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen. When Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen was the Imperial Preceptor, he divided up his siblings into four different groups, each of which lived in a different palace (Zhitog, Lhakhang, Rinchengang, and Ducho). And Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen lived in the Lhakhang. About two months after his brother’s death in 1327, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen got appointed by emperor Yesün Temür as the new Imperial Preceptor. However, he only arrived in the Yuan Capital a year after his appointment. Like his brother, he worked as the Imperial Preceptor until he died. Nevertheless, multiple sources show controversies over his year of death. However, according to the most reliable one, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen died in 1330. A common practice among his family was to get married and have kids before fully turning into a monk; Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen showed no difference. He had five children and one of them, Sonam Lotro, eventually became the thirteenth Imperial Preceptor, while another, Drakpa Gyaltsen, also became a very powerful government official in Tibet.\n\nRinchen Trashi’s family background, year of birth and death are all unknown. Furthermore, this is the last Preceptor that was recorded in the \"Yuanshi\" (also known as \"The History Of Yuan\"). On the other hand, no records of him in the Tibetan language can be found. According to a very limited Wikipedia page in the Chinese Language, Rinchen Trashi was appointed by Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür, the 12th Khagan of the Mongol empire, as the Imperial Preceptor in 1329.\n\nKunga Gyaltsen was born in 1310 and died in 1358. He was the twelfth Imperial Preceptor of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Like many other previous Imperial Preceptors, Kunga Gyaltsen belonged to the Khon family, a group of monastery leaders with fairly high political authority in certain regions of Tibet. Kunga Gyaltsen served under this title from 1331 to his death, making him a raw exception that held the title for a very long period of time. Also, he was the last Imperial Preceptor before the coming of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in Tibet. During his early career as the Imperial Preceptor, Kunga Gyaltsen’s authority and power were recognized and respected in Tibet. He came up with several new religious rules and people followed them with respect. The appointment of his son, Lotro Gyaltsen, as a monastery leader in the year 1347 further strengthened his place. However, his stay in Dadu during the Tibertan civil war period meant that he could not really do anything significant to help, despite having so much authority as the Imperial Preceptor. Eventually, when the Phagmodrus took over, the leader of this dynasty severely weakened the authorities of the Sakyas (the group which Kunga Gyaltsen and many other previous Imperial Preceptors belonged in). In 1358, the leader of the Phagmodrupas, Changchub Gyaltsen, arranged a meeting in which he officially claimed rule over Central Tibet under the regime of Phagmodrupa. Kunga Gyaltsen died the same year and there were not any appointments of a new successor for 3 years until his nephew, Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen, eventually replaced him in 1361.\n\nSonam Lotro Gyaltsen was born in 1332 and deceased in 1362. No information about him can be found in any records in the Chinese language. According to records of Tibetan history published in 2005 by the official Chinese government, this Imperial Preceptor came from one of the six ancient aristocratic families in Tibet. His aristocratic background, in particular, was located in Sa’gya, a county in the city of Shigatse. His father is the 10th Imperial Preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen, while his mother also came from an aristocratic family of the Ü-Tsang region, one of the three traditional provinces of Tibet. Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen replaced his uncle, Kunga Gyaltsen, as the Imperial Preceptor. However, he served under this title for only a year, from 1361 until his eventual death in 1362.\n\nThere are little to no records of Namgyel Pel Sangpo.\n\nThe Yuan Dynasty ended in 1368, after the armies of the Ming Dynasty captured the Capital city, Khanbaliq. This followed decades of struggle for the Yuan Dynasty, including natural disasters, like flooding and droughts, and a rebellion. The Red Turban Rebellion (1351) was the result of a lack of faith shown in the government.\n\nDue to the weakening of the government and the Yuan Emperor's (Emperor Huizong) reliance on local Warlords' armies, it led to his desire of keeping his seat of power to vanish. Emperor Huizong eventually fled North to the city of Shangdu, leaving the Capital open, to be captured by the armies of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nAt their capture of Khanbaliq in 1368, it led to the formation of the Ming Dynasty, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, otherwise called the Hongwu Emperor. As the Yuan Dynasty were Mongol people, the Hongwu Emperor passed many edicts that were intended to purify China of their influence whilst also forbidding many Mongolian practices.\n\nThe Hongwu Emperor changed the basic structure of the government which was used by the Qing Dynasty after them, lasting up until 1911/12. One of the changes that was made was the revoking of the Imperial Preceptor title. When Zhu came to power and the Ming Dynasty was established, the role of the Imperial Preceptor was abolished, and their responsibilities and roles were divided. Titles of lesser importance were created and the people that carried these new titles were given the Imperial Preceptor's previous responsibilities. However, these new titles were granted to very few people, mainly due to political reasons.\n\nDuring the reign of the second Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, the Yongle Emperor, the ties between China and Tibet were brought closer together, especially through religious teachings. The Yongle Emperor hosted many Tibetan teachers with the most famous and highest regarded being Dezhin Shekpa. Shekpa was the only one to be recognised as the Emperor's personal preceptor. Because of this, Shekpa was granted a lengthy title often shortened to \"Rulai dabao fawang\", meaning \"Tathagata Great Precious Dharma King\". The highest title to be granted to a Tibetan teacher during the Ming period, it was the equivalent of being granted the title of Imperial Preceptor.\n\n"}
{"id": "16812883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16812883", "title": "Islam and secularism", "text": "Islam and secularism\n\nThe definition and application of secularism, especially the place of religion in society, varies among Muslim countries as it does among western countries. Secularism is often used to describe the separation of public life and civil/government matters from religious teachings and commandments, or simply the separation of religion and politics. Secularism in Muslim countries is often contrasted with Islamism, and secularists tend to seek to promote secular political and social values as opposed to Islamic ones. Among western scholars and Muslim intellectuals, there are some debates over secularism which include the understanding of political and religious authorities in the Islamic world and the means and degree of application of \"sharia\" in legal system of the state.\n\nAs the concept of secularism varies among secularists in the Muslim world, reactions of Muslim intellectuals to the pressure of secularization also varies. On the one hand, secularism is condemned by some Muslim intellectuals who do not feel that religious influence should be removed from the public sphere. On the other hand, secularism is claimed by others to be compatible with Islam. The quest for secularism has inspired some Muslim scholars to argue that secular government is the best way to observe \"sharia\", as \"enforcing [sharia] through coercive power of the state negates its religious nature\". While they did not adhere to the modern concept of a nation with no official religion or religion-based laws, a number of Muslim-majority states in the Middle Ages demonstrated some level of separation between religious and political authority.\n\nToday, some Muslim-majority countries define themselves as or are regarded as secular, and many of them have a dual system in which Muslims can bring familial and financial disputes to \"sharia\" courts. The exact jurisdiction of these courts varies from country to country, but usually includes marriage, divorce, inheritance, and guardianship.\n\nThe etymology of the Arabic word for secularism can be controversial in itself. Some scholars pointed out that originally there was no Arabic term to describe the secular and secularism and therefore some neologisms were spawned. Secularism was translated into Arabic either as \"‘alamaniyah\", which is derived from \"‘alam (world or universe)\", or as \"‘ilmaniyah\", which is derived from \"‘ilm (science or knowledge)\". The term \"‘alamaniyah\" first appeared at the end of the nineteenth century in the dictionary Muhit al-Muhit written by the Christian Lebanese scholar Butrus al-Bustani. It has been suggested that the use of other translations, such as \"la diniyah (non-religious)\", that implied the exclusion or marginalisation of religion, would have met with outright rejection by Muslims, for whom (according to the principle al-Islam din wa-dawlah, Islam is religion and state) the division between the temporal and the spiritual is literally unthinkable.\n\nMoreover, some refer to \"‘almaniyyah\" which is derived from the word \"‘alam\", and others prefer \"dunyawiyyah\", which is derived from \"dunya (temporal)\", in contrast to \"dini (religious)\". \n\nThe concept of secularism was imported along with many of the ideas of post-enlightenment modernity from Europe into the Muslim world, namely Middle East and North Africa. Among Muslim intellectuals, the early debate on secularism centered mainly on the relationship between religion and state, and how this relationship was related to European successes in science, technology and governance. In the debate on the relationship between religion and state, (in)separability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world, or status of the Caliph, was one of the biggest issues.\n\nJohn L. Esposito, a professor of international affairs and Islamic studies, points out: \"the post-independent period witnessed the emergence of modern Muslim states whose pattern of development was heavily influenced by and indebted to Western secular paradigms or models. Saudi Arabia and Turkey reflected the two polar positions. [...] The majority of Muslim states chose a middle ground in nation building, borrowing heavily from the West and relying on foreign advisers and Western-educated elites.\"\n\nEsposito also argues that in many modern Muslim countries the role of Islam in state and society as a source of legitimation for rulers, state, and government institutions was greatly decreased though the separation of religion and politics was not total. However while most Muslim governments replaced Islamic law with legal systems inspired by western secular codes, Muslim family law (marriage, divorce, and inheritance) remained in force.\n\nHowever, many Muslims argue that, unlike Christianity, Islam does not separate religion from the state and many Muslims around the world welcome a significant role for Islam in their countries' political life. It is apolitical Islam, not political Islam, that requires explanation and that is an historical fluke of the \"shortlived heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970.\"\n\nFurthermore, the resurgence of Islam, beginning with the Iranian revolution of 1978-9, defied the illusions of advocates of secularization theory. The resurgence of Islam in politics in the most modernizing of Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Algeria and Turkey, betrayed expectations of those who believed religion should be at the margins not the center of public life. Furthermore, in most cases, it was not rural but urban phenomena, and its leaders and supporters were educated professionals.\n\nFrom a more historical perspective, scholar Olivier Roy argues that \"a defacto separation between political power\" of sultans and emirs and religious power of the caliph was \"created and institutionalized ... as early as the end of the first century of the hegira\" and what has been lacking in the Muslim world is \"political thought regarding the autonomy of this space.\" No positive law was developed outside of sharia. The sovereign's religious function was to defend the Islamic community against its enemies, institute the sharia, ensure the public good (\"maslaha\"). The state was an instrument to enable Muslims to live as good Muslims and Muslims were to obey the sultan if he did so. The legitimacy of the ruler was \"symbolized by the right to coin money and to have the Friday prayer (\"Jumu'ah khutba\") said in his name.\"\n\nIra M. Lapidus, an Emeritus Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic History at The University of California at Berkeley, notes that religious and political power was united while the Prophet Muhammad was leading the ummah, resulting in a non-secular state. But Lapidus states that by the 10th century, some governments in the Muslim world had developed an effective separation of religion and politics, due to political control passing \"into the hands of generals, administrators, governors, and local provincial lords; the Caliphs had lost all effective political power\". These governments were still officially Islamic and committed to the religion, but religious authorities had developed their own hierarchies and bases of power separate from the political institutions governing them:\n\nLapidus argues that the religious and political aspects of Muslim communal life came to be separated by Arab rebellions against the Caliphate, the emergence of religious activity independent of the actual authority of the Caliphs, and the emergence of the Hanbali school of law.\n\nThe Umayyad caliphate was seen as a secular state by many Muslims at the time, some of whom disapproved of the lack of integration of politics and religion. This perception was offset by a steady stream of wars that aimed to expand Muslim rule past the caliphate's borders. \n\nIn early Islamic philosophy, Averroes presented an argument in \"The Decisive Treatise\" providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official Ash'ari theology. Because of this, some consider Averroism a precursor to modern secularism. Others argue that this reflects an incorrect view of his philosophy, stripped of its inherent Islamic dimensions by European philosophers.\n\nMany of the early supporters of Secularist principles in Middle Eastern countries were Baathist and non-Muslim Arabs, seeking a solution to a multi-confessional population and an ongoing drive to modernism.\n\nMany Islamic modernist thinkers argued against the inseparability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world, and described the system of separation between religion and state within their ideal Islamic world.\n\nMuhammad ʿAbduh, a prominent Muslim modernist thinker, claimed in his book \"Al-Idtihad fi Al-Nasraniyya wa Al-Islam\" that no one had exclusive religious authority in the Islamic world. He argued that the Caliph did not represent religious authority, because he was not infallible nor was the Caliph the person whom the revelation was given to; therefore, according to Abduh, the Caliph and other Muslims are equal. ʿAbduh argued that the Caliph should have the respect of the umma but not rule it; the unity of the umma is a moral unity which does not prevent its division into national states.\n\nAbdel Rahman Al-Kawakibi, in his book \"Taba'i' Al-Istibdad (The Characteristics of Tyranny)\", discussed the relationship between religion and despotism, arguing that \"while most religions tried to enslave the people to the holders of religious office who exploited them, the original Islam was built on foundations of political freedom standing between democracy and aristocracy.\" Al-Kawakibi suggested that people can achieve a non-religious national unity, saying:\"Let us take care of our lives in this world and let the religions rule in the next world.\" Moreover, in his second book \"Umm Al-Qura (The Mother of Villages)\" his most explicit statement with regard to the question of religion and state appeared in an appendix to the book, where he presented a dialogue between the Muslim scholar from India and an amir. The amir expressed his opinion that \"religion is one thing and the government is another ... The administration of religion and the administration of the government were never united in Islam.\"\n\nRashid Rida's thoughts about the separation of religion and state had some similarities with ʿAbduh and Al-Kawakibi. According to the scholar, Eliezer Tauber:\nWhat is unique in Rida's thought is that he provided details of his ideas about the future Arab empire in a document, which he called the \"General Organic Law of the Arab Empire\". Rida argued that the general administrative policy of the future empire would be managed by a president, a council of deputies to be elected from the entire empire, and a council of ministers to be chosen by the president from among the deputies. There, the caliph must recognize the 'General Organic Law' and abide by it. He would manage all the religious matters of the empire. Rida's ideal Islamic empire would be administered in practice by a president, while the caliph would administer only religious affairs and would be obliged to recognize the organic law of the empire and abide by it.\n\nAs seen above, these arguments about separability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world were greatly connected with the presence of the Caliphate. Therefore, the abolishment of the Caliphate by Turkish government in 1924 had considerable influence on such arguments among Muslim intellectuals.\n\nThe most controversial work is that of Ali Abd al-Raziq, an Islamic Scholar and Shari’a judge who caused a sensation with his work \"Islam and the Foundations of Governance (Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm)\" in 1925. He argued that there were no clear evidence in the Quran and the hadith, which justify a common assumption: to accept the authority of the caliph is an obligation. Furthermore, he claimed that it was not even necessary that the ummah should be politically united and religion has nothing to do with one form of government rather than another. He argued that there is nothing in Islam which forbids Muslims to destroy their old political system and build a new one on the basis or the newest conceptions of the human spirit and the experience of nations. This publication caused a fierce debate especially as he recommended that religion can be separated from government and politics. He was later removed from his position. Rosenthall commented on him saying: \n\"we meet for the first time a consistent, unequivocal theoretical assertion of the purely and exclusively religious character of Islam\".\n\nTaha Hussein, an Egyptian writer, was also an advocate for the separation of religion and politics from a viewpoint of Egyptian nationalism. Hussein believed that Egypt always had been part of Western civilization and that Egypt had its renaissance in the nineteenth century and had re-Europeanized itself. For him, the distinguishing mark of the modern world is that it has brought about a virtual separation of religion and civilization, each in its own sphere. It is therefore quite possible to take the bases of civilization from Europe without its religion, Christianity. Moreover, he believed that it is easier for Muslims than for Christian, since Islam has no priesthood, and so there has grown up no vested interest in the control of religion over society.\n\nIt was suggested that secular oriented women do not support sharia as the main source of legislation, rather they refer to civil law and the resolution of human rights conventions, as adopted by the United Nations, as frames for reference for their struggle. Azza Karam (1998:13), for example, describes secular feminists as follows: \"Secular feminists firmly believe in grounding their discourse outside the realm of any religion, whether Muslim or Christian, and placing it, instead within the international human rights discourse. They do not ‘waste their time’ attempting to harmonize religious discourses with the concept and declarations pertinent to human rights. To them religion is respected as a private matter for each individual, but it is totally rejected as a basis from which to formulate any agenda on women’s emancipation. By so doing, they avoid being caught up in interminable debates on the position of women with religion.\" Generally, secular feminist activists call for total equality between the sexes, attempt to ground their ideas on women’s rights outside religious frameworks, perceive Islamism as an obstacle to their equality and a linkage to patriarchal values. They argue that secularism was important for protecting civil rights.\n\nIn many former colonised Middle East countries, the \"kuttab\" or the \"madrassas\" (the Quranic schools) were moved to the western format. The French colonial government in the protectorates of the Maghreb changed the education system into a secular model closely modeled on their own. The colonialists firmly believed that their secular system was more modern, efficient, and progressive than the incumbent practices. These changes had far-reaching social consequences and laid the foundation of \"Arab Secularism\" by separating the Islam from government affairs, education, and justice.\n\nIn consequence, \"perception of the public, political, and social domain through the prism of religion became marginal and was replaced by a new perception, a perception that was modern, temporal, ideological, ethical, evolutionary, and political.\"\n\nIn 1918 the Soviet Union opened the Commissariat for Muslim Affairs, which actively opposed the colonial powers in the Middle East and their system of Mandates.\n\nIn the 1920s the formation of the first communist parties in the Middle East started playing a key role in the anti-colonial struggle and promoting their ethos regarding workers rights. During the Second World War they also played a role fighting against fascism and participating in the international peace movement.\n\nA key element of the Communism movement was the well organized network of parties in different countries that provided support to each other and enabled communist organizations to become an effective outlet against oppression.\n\nCommunism went on to become one of the key components of Arab Nationalism and was particularly prominent during the rule of Gamel Abdel Nasser in Egypt in which Egyptian communists stood aside. And even though communism was often a prominent supporter of Arab nationalism, the international relationships which allowed it to be such a potent force were also used by opposition regimes, and to some extent third parties during the Cold War.\n\n\nSecularism in Turkey was both dramatic and far reaching as it filled the vacuum of the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. With the country getting down Mustafa Kemal Atatürk led a political and cultural revolution. \"Official Turkish modernity took shape basically through a negation of the Islamic Ottoman system and the adoption of a west-oriented mode of modernization.\"\n\n\nThroughout the 20th century secularism was continuously challenged by Islamists. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, political Islamists and Islamic democrats such as the Welfare Party and Justice and Development Party (AKP) gained in influence, with the AKP in the 2002 elections acquiring government and holding on to it ever since with increasingly authoritarian methods.\n\nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy within the overall framework of Confessionalism, a form of consociationalism in which the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities.\n\nA growing number of Lebanese, however, have organized against the confessionalist system, advocating for an installation of laïcité in the national government. The most recent expression of this secularist advocacy was the Laïque Pride march held in Beirut on April 26, 2010, as a response to Hizb ut-Tahrir's growing appeal in Beirut and its call to re-establish the Islamic caliphate.\n\nUnder the leadership of Habib Bourguiba (1956–1987), Tunisia’s post independence government pursued a program of secularization.\n\nBourguiba modified laws regarding habous (religious endowments), secularized education and unified the legal system so that all Tunisians, regardless of religion, were subject to the state courts. He restricted the influence of the religious University of Ez-Zitouna and replaced it with a faculty of theology integrated into the University of Tunis, banned the headscarf for women, made members of the religious hierarchy state employees and ordered that the expenses for the upkeep of mosques and the salaries of preachers to be regulated.\n\nMoreover, his best known legal innovations was the ‘Code du Statut Personel’ (CSP) the laws governs issues related to the family: marriage, guardianship of children, inheritance and most importantly the abolishing of polygamy and making divorce subject to judicial review.\n\nBourguiba clearly wanted to undercut the religious establishment’s ability to prevent his secularization program, and although he was careful to locate these changes within the framework of a modernist reading of Islam and presented them as the product of \"ijtihad\" (independent interpretation) and not a break with Islam, he became well known for his secularism. John Esposito says that \"For Bourguiba, Islam represented the past; the west was Tunisia's only hope for a modern future, but he was mistaken, Islam is modernization\"\nFollowing increasing economic problems, Islamist movements came about in 1970 with the revival of religious teaching in Ez-Zitouna University and the influence which came from Arab religious leaders like Syrian and Egyptian Muslim Brotherhoods. There is also influence by Hizb ut-Tahrir, whose members issue a magazine in Tunis named \"Azeytouna\". In the aftermath, the struggle between Bourguiba and Islamists became uncontrolled and in order to repress the opposition the Islamist leaderships were exiled, arrested and interrogated.\n\nEnnahda Movement, also known as Renaissance Party or simply Ennahda, is a moderate Islamist political party in Tunisia. On 1 March 2011, after the secularist dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali collapsed in the wake of the 2011 Tunisian revolution, Tunisia's interim government granted the group permission to form a political party. Since then it has become the biggest and most well-organized party in Tunisia, so far outdistancing its more secular competitors. In the Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011, the first honest election in the country's history with a turn out of 51.1% of all eligible voters, the party won 37.04% of the popular vote and 89 (41%) of the 217 assembly seats, far more than any other party.\n\nSecularism in Egypt has had a very important role to play in both the history of Egypt and that of the Middle East. Egypt’s first experience of secularism started with the British Occupation (1882–1952), the atmosphere which allowed propagation of western ideas. In this environment, pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad who sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work. This debate had then become a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh Ali abd al-Raziq (1888–1966), \"The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history\"\n\nBy 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the \"Hizb 'Almani\" (Secular Party) this name was later changed to the Wafd party. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence. The Wafd party supported the allies during World War II and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections, following these elections the prime minister was overthrown by the King leading to riots. These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the Wafd and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe government of Gamel Abdel Nasser was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states. Key elements of Nasserism:\n\n\nSecular legacy of Nasser's dictatorship influenced dictatorial periods of Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak and secularists ruled Egypt until 2011 Egyptian revolution. Nevertheless, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the Islamic world, particularly in the Arab world. For many years it was \ndescribed as \"semi-legal\" and was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections. In the Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012, the political parties identified as \"Islamist\" (the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Salafi Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats. Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist democrat of Muslim Brotherhood was the first democratically elected president of Egypt. Nowadays, most Egyptian proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ‘national unity’ between Coptic Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe process of secularization in Syria began under the French mandate in the 1920s and went on continuously under different governments since the independence. Syria has been governed by the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party since 1963. The Ba'ath government combined Arab socialism with secular ideology and an authoritarian political system. The constitution guarantees religious freedom for every recognized religious communities, including many Christian denominations. All schools are government-run and non-sectarian, although there is mandatory religious instruction, provided in Islam and/or Christianity. Political forms of Islam are not tolerated by the government. The Syrian legal system is primarily based on civil law, and was heavily influenced by the period of French rule. It is also drawn in part from Egyptian law of Abdel Nasser, quite from the Ottoman Millet system and very little from Sharia. Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims. Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law.\n\nFollowing the military coup of 21 February 1921, Reza Khan had established himself as the dominant political personality in the country. Fearing that their influence might be diminished, the clergy of Iran proposed their support and persuaded him to assume the role of the Shah.\n\n1925–1941: Reza Shah began to make some dramatic changes to Iranian society with the specific intention of westernization and removing religion from public sphere. He changed religious schools to secular schools, built Iran’s first secular university and banned the hijab in public. Nevertheless, the regime became totally undemocratic and authoritarian with the removal of Majles power (the first parliament in 1906) and the clampdown on free speech.\n\n1951–1953: During the early 1950s the Prime Minister Dr Mossadeq was again forming a secular government with a socialist agenda with the specific aim of reducing the power held by the clergy. However his plans for nationalization the oil industry were a step too far for Britain, and the legislature became increasingly wary of his concentration of power. So with the help of the CIA, the United Kingdom supported a coup which replaced the government of Mossadeq with Mohammad Reza Shah.\n\n1962–1963: Using the mandate of westernization, Mohammad Reza Shah introduced White Revolution, aiming to transform Iran into a Westernized secular capitalist country.\n\n1963–1973: Opposition rallied united behind Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and by the end of the 1970s the Shah was overthrown in an Islamic Revolution (1979).\n\nEarly in the history of the state of Pakistan (12 March 1949), a parliamentary resolution (the Objectives Resolution) was adopted, just a year after the death of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, in accordance with the vision of other founding fathers of Pakistan (Muhammad Iqbal, Liaquat Ali Khan). proclaiming:\n\nAccording to Pakistani secularists, this resolution differed from the Muhammad Ali Jinnah's 11th August Speech that he made in the Constitutive Assembly, but however, this resolution was passed by the rest of members in the assembly after Muhammad Ali Jinnah's death in 1948. This resolution later became key source of inspiration for writers of Constitution of Pakistan and is included in constitution as preamble. However, Pakistan is an Islamic republic, with Islam as the state religion; it has aspects of secularism inherited from its colonial past. Islamists and Islamic democratic parties in Pakistan are relatively less influential than democratic Islamists of other Muslim democracies however they do enjoy considerable street power.\n\nThe Council of Islamic Ideology is a body that is supposed to advise the Parliament of Pakistan on bringing laws and legislation in alignment with the principles of the Quran and Sunnah, though it has no enforcement powers. The Federal Shariat Court can strike down any law deemed un-Islamic, though its decisions can be overturned by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\n\nIslamists believe that Islam fuses religion and politics, with normative political values determined by the divine texts. It is argued that this has historically been the case and the secularist/modernist efforts at secularizing politics are little more than \"jahiliyyah\" (ignorance), \"kafir\" (unbelief/infidelity), \"irtidad\" (apostasy) and atheism. \"Those who participated in secular politics were raising the flag of revolt against Allah and his messenger.\"\n\nSaudi scholars denounce secularism as strictly prohibited in Islamic tradition. The Saudi Arabian Directorate of Ifta', Preaching and Guidance, has issued a directive decreeing that whoever believes that there is a guidance (\"huda\") more perfect than that of the Prophet, or that someone else's rule is better than his is a \"kafir\".\n\nIt lists a number of specific tenets which would be regarded as a serious departure from the precepts of Islam, punishable according to Islamic law. For example:\n\n\nIn the view of Tariq al-Bishri, \"secularism and Islam cannot agree except by means of talfiq [combining the doctrines of more than one school, i.e., falsification], or by each turning away from its true meaning.\"\n\nA number of scholars believe that secular governments in Muslim countries have become more repressive and authoritarian to combat the spread of Islamism, but this increased repression may have made many Muslim societies more opposed to secularism and increased the popularity of Islamism the Middle East.\n\nAuthoritarianism has left in many countries the mosque as the only place to voice political opposition. Scholars like Vali Nasr argue that the secular elites in the Muslim world were imposed by colonial powers to maintain hegemony.\n\nSecularism is also associated with military regimes, such as those in Turkey and Algeria. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) succeeded in December 1991 elections in Algeria and the Welfare Party succeeded in the Turkish 1995 elections. However, both of these parties were eliminated through military coups in order to protect secularism. While Welfare Party government in Turkey was forced to resign from the office by Turkish military in February 1997 with a military intervention which is called as \"post modern coup\", FIS in Algeria lived an austere military coup which carried the country in to a civil war in 1992. Military forces in those countries could use their power in undemocratic ways in order to ‘protect secularism’.\n\nIn some countries, the fear of Islamist takeover via democratic processes has led to authoritarian measures against Islamist political parties. \n\"The Syrian regime was able to capitalize on the fear of Islamist coming to power to justify the massive clampdown on the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood.\" When American diplomats asked Hosni Mubarak to give more rights to the press and stop arresting the intellectuals, Mubarak rejected it and said, \"If I do what you ask, the fundamentalists will take over the government in Egypt. Do you want that?\" Or when President Bill Clinton asked Yasser Arafat to establish democracy in Palestine in 2001, Yasser Arafat also replied similarly. \"He said that in a democratic system Islamist Hamas will surely take control of the government in Palestine\". Most secularist autocrats in the Middle East drew upon the risk of Islamism in order to justify their autocratic rule of government in the international arena.\n\n\nIslamism:\n\n"}

In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the Kharijites. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.\nSome of the proponents of Islam emphasise peaceful political processes, whereas Sayyid Qutb in particular called for violence, and those followers are generally considered Islamic extremists and their stated goal is Islamic revolution with the intent to force implementation of Sharia law and/or an Islamic State Caliphate.\n\nThere are over 120 such groups active today.

{"id": "6117423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6117423", "title": "Jewish geography", "text": "Jewish geography\n\nJewish geography is a popular \"game\" sometimes played when Jews meet each other for the first time and try to identify people they know in common. The game has become something of an informal social custom in the Jewish community, and it is often surprisingly easy for strangers who play it to discover mutual acquaintances and establish instant context and connection.\n\nAs Etan Diamond observes in his book \"And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia\":\nThis \"game\" of \"Jewish geography\" follows a simple pattern. One person asks, \"You're from [insert name of city here]? Do you know [insert person's name here]?\" The other one usually responds something like, \"Sure, he sits behind my uncle in synagogue,\" or \"I met her once at a youth group convention,\" or \"She is really good friends with my sister's college roommate.\" Non-Jews often find it astonishing that such links are made so easily, but given both the relative smallness of the Jewish community—and the even smaller size of the Orthodox Jewish community—and the extensive overlapping social circles within these communities, it should not surprise too much. [p. xv].\nAn Israeli version of the game, \"pitsuchim\", has been a common pastime among young Israeli backpackers traveling the world, taking its name from a 1980s television quiz show.\n\nAnother similar social game called \"The rule of communicated Datis\" (Hebrew for religious orthodox Jews) is used by Zionist religious orthodox Jews, and a movie mocking the game called by that name has been produced by students of the Ma'ale school for video and media.\n\nThe game is a form of testing the Small-world experiment.\n\nThe origins of \"Jewish geography\" are unclear. Sarah Benor, a linguist and professor of Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted \"Sometimes that kind of thing is really impossible to find.\"\n\nThe term \"Jewish geography\" not only functions as the name of the game, but also describes the unique smallness and closeness of the worldwide Jewish population. The Jewish population's \"Jewish geography,\" therefore, is what makes the game possible and lets Jews from different cities, regions, and countries easily discover people they know in common.\n\nBoth the game and the concept are Jewish-specific examples of the six degrees of separation theory proposed by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in 1929 and the small world phenomenon hypothesized by social scientist Stanley Milgram in 1967.\n\nWhile the accuracy of these theories have been questioned by some, few Jews doubt the validity of \"Jewish geography,\" having observed its connective power firsthand.\n\n"}
{"id": "604593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604593", "title": "Kazimierz", "text": "Kazimierz\n\nKazimierz (; ; \"Kuzimyr\") is a historical district of Kraków and Kraków Old Town, Poland. Since its inception in the fourteenth century to the early nineteenth century, Kazimierz has been an independent city, a royal city of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, a location south of the Old Town of Kraków Old Town, separated from it by a branch of the Vistula river. For many centuries, Kazimierz was a place of coexistence and interpenetration of ethnic Polish and Jewish cultures. Its northeastern part of the district was historic Jewish, whose Jewish inhabitants were forcibly relocated in 1941 by the German occupying forces into the Krakow ghetto just across the river in Podgórze. Today Kazimierz is one of the major tourist attractions of Krakow and an important center of cultural life of the city.\n\nThe boundaries of Kazimierz are defined by an old island in the Vistula river. The northern branch of the river (\"Stara Wisła\" – Old Vistula) was filled-in at the end of the 19th century during the partitions of Poland and made into an extension of ul. Stradomska Street connecting Kazimierz district with Kraków Old Town.\n\nThree early medieval settlements are known to have existed on the island defining Kazimierz. The most important of these was the pre-Christian Slavic shrine at Skałka (“the little rock”) at the western, upstream tip of the island. This site, with its sacred pool, was later Christianised as the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in the 11th century and was the legendary site of the martyrdom of St. Stanisław. There was a nearby noble manor complex to the southeast and an important cattle-market town of Bawół, possibly based on an old tribal Slavic gród, at the edges of the habitable land near the swamps that composed the eastern, downstream end of the island. There was also a much smaller island upstream of Kazimierz known as the “Tatar Island” after the Tatar cemetery there. This smaller island has since washed away.\n\nOn 27 March 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (\"Kazimierz Wielki\") declared the two western suburbs of Kraków to be a new town named after him, Kazimierz (\"Casimiria\" in Latin). Shortly thereafter, in 1340, Bawół was also added to it, making the boundaries of new city the same as the whole island. King Casimir granted his \"Casimiria\" location privilege in accordance with Magdeburg Law and, in 1362, ordered defensive walls to be built. He settled the newly built central section primarily with burghers, with a plot set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka. He also began work on a campus for the Kraków Academy which he founded in 1364, but Casimir died in 1370 and the campus was never completed.\n\nPerhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the \"Pons Regalis\", the only major, permanent bridge across the Vistula () for several centuries. This bridge connected Kraków via Kazimierz to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last bridge at this location (at the end of modern Stradomska Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the filling-in of the \"Old Vistula\" river bed under Mayor Mikołaj Zyblikiewicz made it obsolete.\n\nJews had played an important role in the Kraków regional economy since the end of the 13th century, granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel by Bolesław the Pious in his General Charter of Jewish Liberties issued already in 1264. The Jewish community in Kraków had lived undisturbed alongside their ethnic Polish neighbours under the protective King Casimir III the Great, the last king of the Piast dynasty. Nevertheless, in early 15th century pressured by the Synod of Constance some dogmatic clergy began to push for less official tolerance. Accusations of blood libel by a fanatic priest in Kraków led to riots against the Jews in 1407 even though the royal guard hastened to the rescue.\n\nAs part of the re-founding of the Kraków university, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy out buildings in the Old Town. Some Jews moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepański. The oldest synagogue building standing in Poland was built in Kazimierz at around that time, either in 1407 or 1492 (the date varies with several sources). It is an Orthodox fortress synagogue called the Old Synagogue. In 1494 a disastrous fire destroyed a large part of Kraków. In 1495 the Polish king Jan I Olbracht transferred the Jews from the ravaged Old Town to the Bawół district of Kazimierz. The Jewish Qahal petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior walls, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down as redundant.\n\nThe area between the walls was known as the \"Oppidum Judaeorum\", the Jewish City, which represented only about one fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland’s finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the Talmudist Moses Isserles, the Kabbalist Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam.\n\nThe golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II disbanded the kahal. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and ethnic Polish Kazimierz.\n\nWhen after 1795 (in the Third Partition of Poland) Austria acquired the city of Kraków, Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Kraków. The richer Jewish families quickly moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz. Because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, however, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz’s reputation as a “Jewish district” long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning. By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podgórze.\n\nIn a tourist guide that was published in 1935, Meir Balaban, a Reform rabbi and professor of History at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were “only the poor and the ultraconservative.” However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the Nazis into a crowded ghetto in Podgórze, across the river. Most of them were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in death camps.\nAfter the Second World War, devoid of Jews, Kazimierz was neglected by the communist authorities. However, since 1988, now a popular annual Jewish Cultural Festival has drawn Cracovians back to the heart of the Oppidum and re-introduced Jewish culture to a generation of Poles who have grown up without Poland’s historic Jewish community. In 1993, Steven Spielberg shot his film \"Schindler's List\" largely in Kazimierz (in spite of the fact that very little of the action historically took place there) and this drew international attention to Kazimierz. Since 1993, there have been parallel developments in the restoration of important historic sites in Kazimierz and a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops. Not only that, there are also some Jews moving to Kazimierz from Israel and America. Kazimierz with Krakow, is having a small growth in Jewish population recently.\n\nA Jewish youth group now meets weekly in Kazimierz and the Remuh Synagogue, which actively serves a small congregation of mostly elderly Cracovian Jews.\n\nEach year at the end of June, the Jewish Culture Festival takes place in Kazimierz. It is Europe's largest Jewish festival of culture and music and attracts visitors from around the world. Music at the festival is very diverse and played by bands from the Middle East, USA and Africa, amongst others.\n\n\"See map:\"\n\n\"See map:\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "625380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625380", "title": "King Noah", "text": "King Noah\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, King Noah was a wicked monarch best known for burning the prophet Abinadi at the stake. King Noah, described in the Book of Mosiah, is said to have presided over a wicked kingdom guided by false priests. Noah succeeds his father Zeniff, and is succeeded by his son Limhi.\n\nNoah's father, Zeniff, led a group of Nephites into the land of their 'first inheritance' (the land originally settled by Lehi and his descendants upon their arrival in the Americas). Zeniff had made an agreement with the Lamanites in the area, but wars between the two peoples inevitably ensued. Upon his death Zeniff conferred the kingdom on Noah, who seems to have been far less diligent in preparing and protecting his people against their enemies than his father. Noah was an extremely wicked man and he taxed his people heavily, spending the money on extravagances and wickedness. Possibly the greatest wrong he did his subjects, however, was to teach them to follow his own wicked ways. He deposed the righteous priests who had been appointed by his father and replaced them with prideful ones. Through vanity and flattery they led the people to commit the same sins that they themselves did. Some of the sins that are listed are pride, laziness, idolatry, whoredoms, adultery, drunkenness, and riotous living.\n\nThe prophet Abinadi was sent to preach repentance to Noah's people, but was not immediately successful. He was imprisoned and taken before King Noah and his priests. They attempted to \"cross him\" (or prove him a liar) by asking difficult questions concerning the interpretation of scriptures, including an excerpt from Isaiah, but were unable to do so. Abinadi began to teach them the Ten Commandments and they attempted to \"do away with him\" but were unable to touch him because he was protected by the power of God. He continued to teach them the rest of the Ten Commandments, as well as to interpret further writings of Isaiah and teach them about Jesus Christ. He finished by testifying that redemption comes through Christ.\nAbinadi, having delivered his message, was executed by fire. As he was dying he prophesied that Noah and his priests would suffer death in a similar manner.\n\nOne of the priests of Noah, a young man named Alma, believed Abinadi's words and pleaded with the king to spare the prophet's life. Alma was cast out, and was forced to hide so that the servants of the king would not kill him. He taught the words of Abinadi to more of the people, and many believed him. He also became a great prophet and religious leader among the rest of the Nephites later in his life. Hence, Abinadi was successful in his mission although he died a martyr and only one man believed his teachings.\nKing Noah's wickedness and oppression of his people continued. Alma and his followers left Noah's people and the king's army were unable to follow them. A minority of Noah's people became angry with him, including a man named Gideon who swore to kill the king. They fought, and Noah saw that he was about to lose so he fled to a tower. From the top of the tower he saw an army of Lamanites about to attack and convinced Gideon to spare him so that he could lead the people to safety.\n\nNoah and his people fled, but were unable to escape the Lamanites. He ordered them to leave their wives and children behind. Some did, while others did not. They were captured by the Lamanites and returned to their lands, where they were taxed one half of all they owned and produced. They made Noah's son, Limhi, their king. Those who abandoned their families and stayed with Noah were sorry for their choice. They turned on Noah and his priests. They burned Noah to death but his priests ran away and hid in the wilderness. The men then returned, determined to find out what had happened to their families and to avenge them or die with them. They rejoined Limhi's people.\n\nLimhi ruled over his people in captivity for some time. Eventually they escaped and rejoined the main body of the Nephites in Zarahemla, as did Alma and his followers. Their story of the wickedness of King Noah and the consequences for his people was most likely a great motivation for the people in accepting King Mosiah's proposition that kingship be done away with among the Nephites. At the death of Mosiah, kings were replaced with a system of lesser and chief judges. The first chief judge was Alma (known as Alma the Younger), the son of that Alma who had been a priest of King Noah.\n\n"}

{"id": "17910533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17910533", "title": "Mamilla Cemetery", "text": "Mamilla Cemetery\n\nMamilla Cemetery is a historic Muslim cemetery located just to the west of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, Israel. The cemetery, at the center of which lies the Mamilla Pool, contains the remains of figures from the early Islamic period, several Sufi shrines and Mamluk-era tombs. The cemetery grounds also contain the bodies of thousands of Christians killed in the pre-Islamic era, as well as several tombs from the time of the Crusades.\n\nIts identity as an Islamic cemetery is noted by Arab and Persian writers as early as the 11th century. It was used as a burial site up until 1927 when the Supreme Muslim Council decided to preserve it as a historic site. Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the cemetery and other waqf properties in West Jerusalem fell under the control of Israeli governmental bodies. The Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs stated in 1948 that the cemetery is: \"one of the most prominent Muslim cemeteries, where seventy thousand Muslim warriors of [Saladin’s] armies are interred along with many Muslim scholars... Israel, will always know to protect and respect this site.\"\n\nA number of buildings, a road and other public facilities, such as a park, a parking lot and public lavatories have since been constructed on the cemetery grounds, destroying grave markers and tombs. A plan to build a Museum of Tolerance on part of the cemetery grounds, announced in 2004, aroused much controversy and faced several stop work orders before being given final approval in July 2011.\n\nThe name \"Mamilla\" is used to refer to the cemetery and the Mamilla Pool located at its center. It was also the name of a church dedicated to St Mamilla located at the same site in the early Byzantine and Islamic periods.\n\nMamilla is mentioned as an Islamic cemetery as early as the 11th century in \"Concerning the (religious) status of Jerusalem\", a treatise penned by Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Wasiti, the preacher of Al Aqsa Mosque in 1019-1020 (AH 410). He gives its name as \"zaytun al-milla\", Arabic for \"the olive trees of the religion\", which Moshe Gil says was \"a commonly used distortion of the name Māmillā,\" along with \"bab al-milla\" (meaning, \"the door of the religion\").\n\nAbd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi writes in \"al-Haqiqa\", based on his travels to the region in 1693-4, that, \"It is said that its original name is Ma'man Illah and sometimes it was called Bab Illah [Gate to God]. It is also called 'Zeitun il-Milla'. Its name, according to the Jews, is Beit Milo and to the Christians, Babilla. But it is known to the common people as Mamilla.\" A similar description appears in James Turner Barclay's \"The city of the Great King\" (1857) and he gives the meaning of \"Ma'man Illah\" (or \"Ma-min-ullah\", as he transcribes it) as \"What is from God!\"\n\nPrior to the Islamic period, early on during the rule of the Byzantine Empire over Palestine (c. 4th-6th centuries), a church dedicated to St Mamilla was established on the same site and it appears to have been used for burials at this time as well. An account of the aftermath of the Persian capture of Jerusalem in 614 by Strategius, a monk of Mar Saba, says that the bodies of thousands of Christians killed by the Persian forces of the Sassanid Empire - 4,518 according to Gregorian translations of the lost Greek original, and 24,518 according to Arabic translations of the same - were found in the Mamilla Pool and buried in caves in and around it.\n\nIslamic rule over Jerusalem began in 638 under the Rashidun Caliphate and persisted for some 1,400 years, interrupted only by the Crusader invasions of 1099-1187 and 1229-1244. Throughout much of this period, Mamilla cemetery was the largest Islamic cemetery in the city, containing the remains of emirs, muftis, Arab and Sufi mystics, soldiers of Saladin and numerous Jerusalem notables. The cemetery is said to be the burial site of several of the first Muslims, the Sahabah, companions or disciples of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. In 1945, \"The Palestine Post\" said it covered an area of over 450 dunams (111 acres), while \"Haaretz\" in 2010 said that at its peak, it covered an area of 200 dunams (some 50 acres). A 1938 deed issued by the British mandatory authorities to the Islamic waqf outlined the size of the plot as 134.5 dunams (33 acres).\n\nReligious warriors or mujahideen who died in the battles for control over Jerusalem with the Byzantines in 636 and the Crusaders in 1137 were buried in the cemetery, including, according to tradition, some 70,000 soldiers of Saladin. The Church of St Mamilla was still standing in the 9th century when Palestine was under the rule of the Abbasid Empire; it is listed in the \"Commemoratorium De Casis Dei\" (c. 808) as one of the properties for which the Jerusalem Patriarch paid the Arabs taxes, and is described by Bernard the Monk as lying about a mile west of Jerusalem (c. 870).\n\nThe cemetery is mentioned by Arab and Persian authors under its various names throughout the ages (see above). In 1020, al-Wasiti writes that the Muslim cemetery situated in \"zaytun al-milla\" and outlines the advantages of being buried in Jerusalem. Ibn al-Adim, the Syrian historian, recounts visiting the cemetery several times, and on one visit in 1239-40 recalls going to the graves of Rabi' al-Mardini (d. 1205-6), a shaykh from Mardin renowned for performing miracles, and al-'Iwaqi (d. 1232), a pious Sufi who lived in the compound of al-Aqsa mosque. Al-Adim describes the grave of the former as housed in a prominent mausoleum with other pious individuals.\n\nDuring Crusader rule over Jerusalem, the cemetery appears to have once again served as a burial place for Christians. Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, the French archaeologist, described and sketched several Frankish sarcophagi that were in the cemetery in the 19th century, most of which were destroyed in 1955 (see below).\n\nDuring the period of Mamluk rule (c. 12th-15th centuries), most of the area's notable citizens were buried in Mamilla. A structure known as \"al-Kebekiyeh\" (or \"Zawiya Kubakiyya\"), a one-room square-shaped building covered with a dome and incorporating architectural materials from the Crusader era was built during this period. It is identified as the tomb of emir Aidughdi Kubaki, a Syrian slave who rose to prominence as the governor of Safed and Aleppo, before his death in 1289.\n\nIn the 14th century work \"A'lam\", a collection of traditions on the value of prayer in Jerusalem, al-Zarkashi says those buried in the city will avoid \"fitnat al qabr\" or \"purgatory of the tomb,\" and for those buried in \"zaytun al-milla\" itself, it would be as if they were buried in heaven.\n\nMujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi in \"al-Uns al-Jalil\" (c. 1496) says, \"Who ever invokes God's name while standing between the graves of Ibn Arslān and al-Quraishī [in Māmilā cemetery], God will grant all his wishes.\" Al-Quraishi, a famous Sufi mystic said to have miraculous healing powers, immigrated to Jerusalem from Andulasia by way of Fustat and garnered a school of disciples in his new home that numbered some 600 people before his death and burial in 1194. Ibn Arslan, who was buried alongside him some two and a half centuries later, was a charismatic Sufi shaykh whom Muslims from surrounding countries came to visit.\n\nOther notables buried in Mamilla and recalled by Mujir al-Din include two founders of zawiyas in Jerusalem - Nasr ed-din Mohammad, one of the \"ten emirs of Gaza\", and Shaykh 'Omar, a Moroccan of the Masmoudys, El Modjarrad tribe. Also named are several emirs, including Ruq ed-din Mankouros, the imperial lieutenant of the Jerusalem Citadel (d. AH 717), Abu el-Qasim, the Governor of Nablus and custodian of Jerusalem and Hebron (d. AH 760), and Nasser ed-din Mohammad, custodian of the two Haram al-Sharifs (Holy Mosques) of al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and al-Ibrahimi in Hebron (d. AH 828), among others.\n\nDuring the period of Ottoman imperial rule from the early 16th to early 20th centuries, the cemetery continued to serve as a burial site, and in 1847, it was demarcated by a 2 meter high fence.\n\nBurials in the cemetery ceased early in the period of British rule over Mandate Palestine (1918–1948), following the 1927 decision by the Supreme Muslim Council, who oversaw the administration of waqf properties, to preserve it as a historic site. By this decision, the cemetery, its tombs, and its grounds were maintained.\n\nIn 1929, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Mufti of Jerusalem, decided to build the Palace Hotel on what was assumed to be outside the border of the cemetery. While the foundations were being laid, Arab workers uncovered Muslim graves. Baruch Katinka, a Jewish contractor hired to oversee the project, wrote in his memoirs that when the Mufti was informed of the discovery, he said to quietly rebury the bones elsewhere, as he feared Raghib al-Nashashibi, his political rival and the mayor of Jerusalem, would issue a cease work order. As Shari'a law permits the transfer of graves in special cases with the approval of a qadi (Muslim judge), Husayni, acting as head of the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandate Palestine, authorized the disinterment. When it was discovered what had happened, rival factions filed a suit against Husayni in the Muslim courts, arguing that he had desecrated ancient graves.\n\nThe Islamic waqf continued to control the cemetery and in 1944, the cemetery was designated an antiquities site by the British mandatory authorities.\n\nA November 1945 article in \"The Palestine Post\" reported on plans of the Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) and the Government Town Planning Adviser to build a commercial center on cemetery grounds and to transfer remains buried in the areas to be developed to a \"40 dunams walled reserve\" centered around the tomb of al Sayid al Kurashi, ancestor of the Dajani family. A member of the SMC told the newspaper that, \"the use of Muslim cemeteries in the public interest had many precedents both in Palestine and elsewhere.\" The SMC's plan, however, was never implemented.\n\nAt the time of Israel's assertion of control over West Jerusalem in 1948, the cemetery, which contained thousands of grave markers, came under the administration of the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property and the Muslim Affairs Department of Israel's Ministry of Religious Affairs. By the end of the 1967 war that resulted in the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, only a handful of broken grave markers remained standing. A large part of the cemetery was bulldozed and converted into a parking lot in 1964 and a public lavatory was also built on the cemetery grounds.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sensitive to how the treatment of waqf properties would be viewed internationally, criticized government policy towards the cemetery. A ministry representative described the vandalism to tombstones, including their use by the guard appointed by the Religious Ministry to build a henhouse beside his shelter in the cemetery, and the destruction of ancient tombs by bulldozers cleaning the Mamilla Pool. Noting the site constituted waqf property and lay within sight of the American Consulate, the ministry said it viewed the situation, which included plans for new roads and the parceling out of portions to private landowners as compensation for other properties confiscated by the state, with deep regret.\n\nIsraeli authorities bulldozed several tombs in the cemetery, including some of those identified as Frankish by Clermont-Ganneau, to establish Mamilla Park (or Independence Park) in 1955. Two of the largest and finest tombs survived, though the lid of one was overturned when it moved from its original spot. The other is the Mamluk era funerary chapel known as \"al-Kebekiyeh\" (or \"Zawiya Kubakiyya\"), now located in the eastern end of Independence Park.\n\nBesides Independence Park, other parts of downtown Jerusalem erected on the cemetery grounds include the Experimental School, Agron Street, Beit Agron, and Kikar Hahatulot (Cats’ Square), among others. Government buildings on the cemetery grounds include the main headquarters of the Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry, and the Customs Department building, which is said to be located on what was once the site of the chapel dedicated to St. Mamilla. \n\nIn 1992, the Custodian of Absentee Property sold the cemetery grounds to the Jerusalem Municipality, a sale the Mufti of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, said they had no right to make. The Israeli Electricity Company destroyed more tombs on 15 January 2005 in order to lay some cables.\n\nIn 2004, the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) revealed plans to build a Center for Human Dignity as part of its Museum of Tolerance with a target date for completion in 2009. Frank Gehry was appointed the architect, and the Jerusalem Municipality offered the SWC a 3.5 acre plot in the northern section of the original Mamilla cemetery where the parking lot was built in 1964. Marvin Hier, head of the SWC, said his association was unaware that the site was located on a cemetery and was told by the municipality that the land was owned by the Israel Lands Administration before it was given to the SWC for the project.\n\nDuring excavations to prepare the ground for construction in 2005-2006, skeletons were found and removed. The Islamic Court, a division of Israel's justice system, issued a temporary ban on work, but work continued anyway. The Al Aqsa Association of the Islamic Movement moved to bring the case before Israel's Supreme Court.\n\nThe SWC's plan also elicited considerable outcry from some Israeli academics and archaeologists, and work was stayed several times by the courts. After the Supreme Court rejected the Islamic Movement's petition in October 2008, work resumed. Between November 2008 and April 2009, crews of 40 to 70 people per shift worked in 8-hour stints, 24-hours a day to remove an estimated 1,000 skeletons from the site slated for construction.\n\nIn 2010, Marvin Hier, rabbi and founder and dean of the SWC, said \"Our opponents would have you believe our bulldozers are preparing to desecrate ancient Muslim tombstones and historic markers. Let me be clear: The Museum of Tolerance is not being built on the Mamilla Cemetery, but on an adjacent 3-acre site where, for a half-century, hundreds of people of all faiths have parked in a three-level underground structure without any protest.\" Hier also accused opponents of the SWC's building plans of \"sheer hypocrisy,\" noting that the plans of the Supreme Muslim Council to build a commercial center in 1945 was evidence that substantiated the Supreme Court's ruling, \"That the Mamilla Cemetery was regarded by many Muslim religious leaders as 'mundras,' or abandoned and without sanctity.\"\n\nRashid Khalidi, a professor of Arab studies at Columbia University, said that, \"contrary to what Rabbi Hier said, that parking lot was built over a cemetery, part of it. And so, the Israeli authorities are basically pushing ahead with the desecration of a cemetery that they have been, unfortunately, slowly nibbling away at for over three decades. We and other families are taking action as a group of families to try and stop this, after other families failed in the Israeli Supreme Court.\" He also said that \"What they have now done is to dig down and disinter four layers, according to the chief archaeologist for the Israeli Archaeological Authority, four layers of graves. There are more probably beneath those, according to his report, which was suppressed in the submissions to the Israeli Supreme Court.\" \n\nGehry resigned from the project in January 2010. A new design for the museum drafted by Chyutin Architects was approved by the city of Jerusalem in June 2011, receiving an official building permit from the Interior Ministry in July 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, eighty-four archaeologists called on the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Jerusalem municipality and the Israel Antiquities Authority to end construction of the Museum of Tolerance. In a letter sent to the three bodies, the archaeologists argued that the establishment of the museum on the site of the Mamilla Muslim cemetery contradicted ethical standards in the archaeological world, as well as Israeli law. \"The bulldozing of historic cemeteries is the ultimate act of territorial aggrandizement: the erasure of prior residents,\" said Professor Harvey Weiss of Yale University, adding that \"Desecration of Jerusalem's Mamilla cemetery is a continuing cultural and historical tragedy.\" The Simon Wiesenthal Center responded that \"the arguments in the letter are old, of a mistaken nature and contain factual errors.\"\n\nPlans to build new buildings to house the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court and the Jerusalem District Court on the cemetery grounds were cancelled by Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch in January 2010. The decision followed the discovery of human remains at the site, supporting critics' claims that construction in the area was offensive to Muslims.\n\nOn 9 August 2010, 300 Muslim gravestones in the cemetery were bulldozed by the Israel Lands Administration (ILA) in an area US Jewish human rights activists said was very close to the planned site for the Museum of Tolerance. A reporter from Agence France Presse witnessed the destruction of 200 graves until the work was briefly suspended while the court heard a stop work petition it rejected, allowing demolitions to continue that same day. The judge later issued an order prohibiting harm to ancient graves and mandating that the ILA coordinate work with the Israel Antiquities Authority and representatives of the Islamic Movement.\n\nThe Jerusalem city council issued its first official response in a written statement on 12 August, saying that, \"The municipality and the (Israel Lands) Authority destroyed around 300 dummy gravestones which were set up illegally in Independence Park on public land.\" It said these \"fake\" gravestones were not erected over any human remains and were placed in the park in an effort to \"illegally take over state land.\"\n\nMahmud Abu Atta, a spokesman for the Al-Aqsa Foundation, denied the city council's claim that new tombs were added illegally. He said that between 500 and 600 tombs had been renovated in total \"with the municipality's agreement,\" that \"some of the tombs had to be totally rebuilt,\" but that \"all the tombs that we built or renovated contain bodies.\"\n\nTwenty graves were completely destroyed or had their tombstones removed by vandals in January 2011. On the night of 25–26 June 2011, about 100 gravestones in an intact part of the cemetery were destroyed by Israeli bulldozers. Footage filmed by local media and activists appeared on Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera and showed the bulldozers pulling out quickly after realizing they were being filmed; Israeli officials made no comment on the incident.\n\nLater that same year, fifteen gravestones in the cemetery were spray painted red with racist slogans reading \"Death to the Arabs\", as well as \"price tag\" and \"Givat Asaf\", the name of an Israeli outpost slated for demolition. The news was reported in November 2011 by Agence France Presse whose photographer saw the damage. Haaretz reported that the authorities did not know exactly when the vandalism took place, nor who was responsible, An Israeli Police spokeswoman told AFP that \"the slogans were painted several weeks ago\" and had not yet been erased by municipal authorities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29946990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29946990", "title": "North French Hebrew Miscellany", "text": "North French Hebrew Miscellany\n\nThe North French Hebrew Miscellany or \"French Miscellany\" or \"London Miscellany\" (British Library Add. MS 11639) is an important Hebrew illuminated manuscript from 13th-century France, created c. 1278-98. A miscellany is a manuscript containing texts of different types and by different authors, and this volume contains a wide range of Hebrew language texts, mostly religious but many secular. The manuscript is exceptional among medieval Hebrew manuscripts both for its size and the diversity of the texts and the quality and lavishness of its illuminations, which as was often the case were added by Christian specialists.\n\nThis manuscript was digitized by the British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project and is available online.\n\nThe manuscript (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), which include a quire of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12 cm. The manuscript includes \"eighty-four different groups of texts, including hundreds of poems\". The Biblical and liturgical texts include the Pentateuch, the \"Haftarot\" prophetical readings, \"Tiqqun soferim\", Five Scrolls, and the full annual cycle of the liturgy, as well as the Haggadah (Passover ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the Book of Tobit, which is not included in the Tanakh or canon of the Hebrew Bible. Other texts include the \"Pirkei Avot\", prayers, gematria, legal texts and calendars. The poetry includes a large group of poems by Moses ibn Ezra, the great Spanish Sephardic poet of the previous century. The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as \"Benjamin\", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no \"proper colophon\" as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript. Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of Aaron indicate a patron with this name.\n\nThe manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, \"which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops\", and probably also worked on at Amiens or another north French city, and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that \"broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style\".\n\nThe subjects include Jewish mythical beasts whose depiction draws on Christian bestiaries. These are mostly illustrated in roundels with a text caption beneath, while the narrative scenes from the Pentateuch are in rectangular miniatures (the scene with Noah's Ark illustrated here is an exception). There are 2 full-page diagrams in ink of the stars and planets and the signs of the zodiac (ff. 542, 542v) and \"numerous inhabited initial-word panels, and inhabited and decorated panels in colours and gold attached to initial words and numerous decorated initial-word panels with gold letters\".\nThe relatively precise dating comes from aspects of the text including the inclusion of Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil's legal compendium the \"Sefer Mitzvot Katan\", a text known to have been finished in 1277, mentions of Yehiel of Paris, who died in 1286, as still alive, and \"a table of moladot (lunation-commencements) for the period 1279/80 - 1295/95 (f. 444)\". The style of the miniatures accords with this date range.\n\nInscriptions record various points in the manuscript's history, though many gaps remain. It perhaps left France for Germany in the persecutions of 1306. A loan of the book is noted in 1426, and in 1431 it was sold to an Abraham ben Moses of Coburg. By 1479 it was in Italy at Mestre on the coast opposite Venice, where it went next, followed by Padua in 1480 and Iesi near Ancona in 1481. The 16th century bookbinding has the arms of the Jewish Rovigo family, but in the 17th century the manuscript passed into Christian hands, including the Barberini family. It was examined by the Christian Hebraist Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi and published in his work \"Variae lectionis veteris testamenti\" (Parma, 1784). It was bought by a Paris bookseller from a Milan collection for the British Museum in 1839.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The practice began under the Saxons in England and spread through Europe. Both before and after the Norman conquest the practice varied by time and place; initially, it was done as a pious contribution, whereas later it was required by various rulers, and collected, more like a tax. Though formally discontinued in England at the time of the Reformation, a post-Reformation payment of uncertain characteristics is seen in some English manors into the 19th century. In 1871, Pope Pius IX formalized the practice of lay members of the church \"other persons of good will\" providing financial support to the Roman See. Modern \"Peter's Pence\" proceeds are used by the Pope for philanthropic works throughout the world.\n\nThe term Peter's pence, in its Latin form, first appeared in writing in 1031. However, the payment may not have had a single origin under the Saxons. It was applied by the Normans to Ireland as a 'penny per hearth' annual tax in the later part of the twelfth century under the Papal Bull \"Laudabiliter\". The traditional scholarly view is summarized in Jacob's \"Law Dictionary\" Otherwise called by Saxons the \"Romefeoh\" (the fee due to Rome), it was a tribute, or rather an alms, given by Ina, King of the West Saxons, on his pilgrimage to Rome in 725. A similar \"contribution\" was also collected by Offa, King of the Mercians, throughout his dominions, in 794. However, it was said to be not a tribute to the pope, but for the maintenance of the English School or College at Rome. It was called Peter's pence because a penny from every house (subject to a means test) was collected on 1 August, the feast day of St. Peter ad Vincula. The penny of Offa was a small silver coin. King Edgar’s laws contained a sharp Constitution touching this money (Leg. Edg 78 c 4)\n\nSome sources give the Anglo-Saxon term \"Romescot\" instead of \"Romefeoh\".\n\nThe Offa story is elaborated in later accounts of unknown reliability:\n\nEthelbert, king of the East Angles, having reigned single some time, thought fit to take a wife; for this purpose he came to the court of Offa, king of Mercia, to desire his daughter in marriage. Cynethryth, consort of Offa, a cruel, ambitious, and blood-thirsty woman, who envied the retinue and splendor of the unsuspicious king, resolved in some manner to have him murdered, before he left their court, hoping by that to gain his immense riches; for this purpose she, with her malicious and fascinating arts, overcame the king–her husband, which she most cunningly effected, and, under deep disguises, laid open to him her portentous design; a villain was therefore hired, named Gimberd, who was to murder the innocent prince.\n\nThe manner in which the heinous crime was effected was as cowardly as it was fatal: under the chair of state in which Ethelbert sat, a deep pit was dug; at the bottom of it was placed the murderer; the unfortunate king was then let through a trap-door into the pit; his fear overcame him so much, that he did not attempt resistance. Three months after this, Queenrid died, when circumstances convinced Offa of the innocence of Ethelbert; he therefore, to appease his guilt, built St. Alban's monastery, gave one-tenth part of his goods to the poor, and went in penance to Rome, where he gave to the Pope a penny for every house in his dominions.\nThe earliest documentary evidence concerning these payments is found in a letter written from Rome by King Canute to the English clergy in 1031. At that time, Canute was collecting a levy of one penny on each hearth or household, using a means test requiring that the household have an annual rental cost of thirty pence or more; households paying less than that in rent were exempt. \n\nOver time, the payment came to be regarded as a tax rather than an offering, and payment was apt to be avoided, if possible, the more so as time went on. Indeed, in the 13th century, the revenue arising from it had been stabilized, on the basis of the assessment of a much earlier day, at the annual sum of £20 1s. 9d for the whole of England. Pope Clement V pressed to return to the more rewarding ancient basis of a penny from each sufficient household. By the 14th century, a standard sum, typically 5s. per manor or parish, was being given to local church authorities for forwarding. It appears that new tenants entering on a property which had historically been subject to a Peter's Pence levy did not always accept the obligation to pay.\n\nOlder sources are often unclear in their references to Peter's Pence, and there was (and remains) a degree of local confusion between it, various hearth taxes (sometimes called smoke-money or smoke-farthings), and other ancient payments.\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, the English population had increased, so the ecclesiastical authorities were collecting more than the stabilized sum, and keeping the surplus.\n\nIt ceased to be remitted to the pope after 1320, but seemingly this was not permanent. The exact reason for the 'prohibition' by Edward III is unknown, but the threat of withholding payment of Peter's Pence proved more than once a useful weapon against uncooperative popes in the hands of English kings. In 1366 and for some years after, it was refused on the grounds of the pope's obstinacy Evidently, however, the payment survived or was revived in some localities, because it was one of many payments abolished by Act of Parliament in the 25th year of Henry VIII's reign. The 1534 Act, \"An Act for the exoneration of exactions paid to the See of Rome\", specifically mentions Peter's Pence. Along with other payments, it was \"never more to be levied … to any person\", indicating that the payment was to be extinguished completely and not diverted to crown use. This occurred just prior to Henry's permanent break from the Church, which occurred in 1536, making England part of the Protestant Reformation. \n\nHowever, under the Catholic Queen Mary, Henry VIII's reformation legislation was overturned. On 16 Jan 1555, royal assent was given to \"An Act, repealing all Statutes, Articles, and Provisions, made against the See of Rome, sithence the 20th Year of King Henry the Eighth; and for the Establishment of Ecclesiastical Possessions conveyed to the Laity\" (1 & 2 Philip & Mary c.8) However, this act did not mention Peter's Pence specifically. There is isolated evidence that in some parishes, payment of Peter's Pence did indeed resume during Mary's reign, for instance in Rowington, Warwickshire, where the church accounts for 1556 record the collection of 54s. 4d., a considerable sum. Mary's Act was in turn repealed by the 1559 Act of Supremacy, under the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nDespite the unequivocal abolition called for by the 1559 Act, payments termed Peter's Pence undoubtedly continued in England in the succeeding centuries. In one Devon parish, there is a record regarding 1609–1610 that states \"besides 2s. for Peter's farthings there is a payment of 2s. for Peter's pence\". In Gloucestershire, a survey of the then royal manor of Cheltenham in 1617 asked tenants, \"whether there is not duly continued and paid certain moneys called peter pence; if not when did they discontinue and what was the sum of them and to whom was it paid?\" This question indicates that at the least, Gloucester recognized that practices varied. The reply given was that, \"the moneys called Peter Pence are commonly every year paid unto the Bailiff and are not discontinued to their knowledge, and the sum of them by the year is 5s. or thereabouts, as they think\". This suggests that originally some 60 households contributed annually. The survey makes no mention of when in the year the payment was made, and whether the bailiff passed the money on or retained it on the lord's behalf. (Pre-Reformation practice in Cheltenham had called for payment—invariably of 5s.—on the accustomed date of 1 August, as above.) In Cheltenham manorial records, occasional references to properties being liable for Peter's pence are seen until as late as 1802, but there is no direct evidence of any actual payment.\n\nAn Act of Parliament obtained in 1625 to clarify manorial customs in Cheltenham acknowledges the continued existence of Peter Pence: \"And be it enacted … that the said copyholders … shall … hold the said customary messuages and lands of the said manors severally and respectively, by copies of court-roll to them and their heirs, by suit of court, and by the yearly rents, worksilver, Peter-pence, and Bead Reap-money, to be paid severally and respectively as heretofore…\"\n\nIt is uncertain how exceptional the situation in Cheltenham may have been. It is possible that the label Peter's Pence had been transferred to some other type of household or hearth tax. Some evidence for this comes from references in Minchinhampton (Gloucestershire) churchwardens' accounts of 1575 to \"Peter-pence or smoke-farthings\" expended at the time of the bishop’s visitation in the summer. Smoke-farthings are glossed as a composition for offerings made in Whitsun week by every man who occupied a house with a chimney, to the cathedral of the diocese in which he lived; and that though Peter's pence was abolished in 1534, \"on the grant of those monasteries to whom they had by custom become payable, they continued payable as appendant to the manors etc of the persons to whom granted\". Before the Reformation, the lordship of the manor of Cheltenham had been held by the Abbess of Syon. It is plausible therefore that as both the pious payment of Peter's Pence and the secular manorial fees had once gone to the same institution, the former came over time to be regarded as part of the latter.\n\nIn 1871, Pope Pius IX formalized the practice of lay members of Church and \"other persons of good will\" – providing financial support directly to the Roman See. In general, contributions go to the local parish or diocese, who then provide contributions to support higher level offices. Collections for Peter's Pence go directly to Rome. Pius IX approved this practice in the encyclical \"Saepe venerabilis\", issued on 5 August 1871. The money collected is today used by the pope for philanthropic purposes.\n\nAt present, this collection is taken each year on the Sunday closest to 29 June, the Solemnity of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in the liturgical calendar. , the United States has donated the largest amounts, giving some 28% of the total, followed by Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Brazil and South Korea. US donations totaled $75.8 million in 2008, $82,529,417 in 2009, $67,704,416.41 in 2010 and $69,711,722.76 in 2011.\n\n\n"}

Stagg graduated from Turlock High School in 1915 and the University of Southern California. He married Mary Litt Boyd in 1917. He moved to Manila, Philippine Islands in 1923, and became the pastor of the Central Church on San Luis Street (now Kalaw Avenue, Malate, Manila), affiliated with the General Conference of the Methodist Church of America.

Modern history suggests that much earlier figures such as Roger Bacon and Islamic scientists also played an important role in shaping the experimental method. Thomas Jefferson wrote \"Bacon, Locke and Newton... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".

{"id": "537541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=537541", "title": "Sibylline Books", "text": "Sibylline Books\n\nThe Sibylline Books () were a collection of oracular utterances, set out in Greek hexameters, that according to tradition were purchased from a sibyl by the last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, and were consulted at momentous crises through the history of the Republic and the Empire. Only fragments have survived, the rest being lost or deliberately destroyed.\n\nThe \"Sibylline Books\" should not be confused with the so-called \"Sibylline Oracles\", twelve books of prophecies thought to be of Judaeo-Christian origin.\n\nAccording to the Roman tradition, the oldest collection of Sibylline books appears to have been made about the time of Solon and Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida in the Troad; it was attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. From Gergis the collection passed to Erythrae, where it became famous as the oracles of the Erythraean Sibyl. It would appear to have been this very collection that found its way to Cumae (see the Cumaean Sibyl) and from Cumae to Rome.\n\nThe story of the acquisition of the Sibylline Books by Tarquinius is one of the famous legendary elements of Roman history. The Cumaean Sibyl offered to Tarquinius nine books of these prophecies; and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquinius at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. Tarquinius then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price and had them preserved in a vault beneath the Capitoline temple of Jupiter. The story is alluded to in Varro's lost books quoted in Lactantius \"Institutiones Divinae\" (I: 6) and by Origen, and told by Aulus Gellius (\"Noctes Atticae\" 1, 19).\n\nThe Roman Senate kept tight control over the Sibylline Books; \"Sibylline Books\" were entrusted to the care of two patricians; after 367 BC ten custodians were appointed, five patricians and five plebeians, who were called the \"decemviri sacris faciundis\"; subsequently (probably in the time of Sulla) their number was increased to fifteen, the \"quindecimviri sacris faciundis\". They were usually ex-consuls or ex-praetors. They held office for life, and were exempt from all other public duties. They had the responsibility of keeping the books in safety and secrecy. These officials, at the command of the Senate, consulted the \"Sibylline Books\" in order to discover not exact predictions of definite future events in the form of prophecy but the religious observances necessary to avert extraordinary calamities and to expiate ominous prodigies (comets and earthquakes, showers of stones, plague, and the like). It was only the rites of expiation prescribed by the Sibylline Books, according to the interpretation of the oracle that were communicated to the public, and not the oracles themselves, which left ample opportunity for abuses.\n\nIn particular, the keepers of the \"Sibylline Books\" had the superintendence of the worship of Apollo, of the \"Great Mother\" Cybele or Magna Mater, and of Ceres, which had been introduced upon recommendations as interpreted from the \"Sibylline Books\". The Sibylline Books motivated the construction of eight temples in ancient Rome, aside from those cults that have been interpreted as mediated by the Sibylline Books simply by the Greek nature of the deity. Thus, one important effect of the \"Sibylline Books\" was their influence on applying Greek cult practice and Greek conceptions of deities to indigenous Roman religion, which was already indirectly influenced through Etruscan religion. As the \"Sibylline Books\" had been collected in Anatolia, in the neighborhood of Troy, they recognized the gods and goddesses and the rites observed there and helped introduce them into Roman state worship, a syncretic amalgamation of national deities with the corresponding deities of Greece, and a general modification of the Roman religion.\n\nSince they were written in hexameter verse and in Greek, the college of curators was always assisted by two Greek interpreters. The books were kept in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, and, when the temple burned in 83 BC, they were lost. The Roman Senate sent envoys in 76 BC to replace them with a collection of similar oracular sayings, in particular collected from Ilium, Erythrae, Samos, Sicily, and Africa. This new Sibylline collection was deposited in the restored temple, together with similar sayings of native origin, e.g. those of the Sibyl at Tibur (the 'Tiburtine Sibyl') of the brothers Marcius, and others, which had been circulating in private hands but which were called in, to be delivered to the Urban Praetor, private ownership of such works being declared illicit, and to be evaluated by the Quindecimviri, who then sorted them, retaining only those that appeared true to them. \n\nFrom the Capitol they were transferred by Augustus as \"pontifex maximus\" in 12 BC, to the temple of \"Apollo Patrous\" on the Palatine, after they had been examined and copied; there they remained until about AD 405. According to the poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, the general Flavius Stilicho (died AD 408) burned them, as they were being used to attack his government.\n\nSome genuine Sibylline verses are preserved in the \"Book of Marvels\" or \"Memorabilia\" of Phlegon of Tralles (2nd century AD). These represent an oracle, or a combination of two oracles, of seventy hexameters in all. They report the birth of an androgyne, and prescribe a long list of rituals and offerings to the gods.\n\nThe \"Sibylline Oracles\" were quoted by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (late 1st century) as well as by numerous Christian writers of the second century, including Athenagoras of Athens who, in a letter addressed to Marcus Aurelius in ca. AD 176, quoted \"verbatim\" a section of the extant \"Oracles\", in the midst of a lengthy series of other classical and pagan references such as Homer and Hesiod, stating several times that all these works should already be familiar to the Roman Emperor. Copies of the actual \"Sibylline Books\" (as reconstituted in 76 BC) were still in the Roman Temple at this time. The \"Oracles\" are nevertheless thought by modern scholars to be anonymous compilations that assumed their final form in the fifth century, after the \"Sibylline Books\" perished. They are a miscellaneous collection of Jewish and Christian portents of future disasters, that may illustrate the confusions about sibyls that were accumulating among Christians of Late Antiquity.\n\nAn incomplete list of consultations of the \"Sibylline Books\" recorded by historians: \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "847476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847476", "title": "The Jewish Chronicle", "text": "The Jewish Chronicle\n\nThe Jewish Chronicle (The JC) is a London-based Jewish weekly newspaper. Founded in 1841, it is the oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the world.\n\nThe newspaper is published every Friday (except on days which are Jewish holidays, when it appears earlier in the week) providing news, views, social, cultural and sports reports, as well as editorials and a spectrum of readers' opinions on the letter page. It is independent and owned by the Kessler Foundation (UK), a charitable trust in the United Kingdom which has overall control of the newspaper and its assets.\n\nThe Jewish Chronicle first appeared on 12 November 1841. Its first editors were D. Meldola and M. Angel. It was first issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844 it was resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847 it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the Anglo-Jewish Association in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M. Samuel and Israel David.\n\nIn 1881 the leaders of the Jewish community in London were being criticised for not campaigning against the pogroms that were taking place in the Russian Empire. Under the leadership of Francis Henry Goldsmid the pogroms were missed by the newspaper, and it was only after the feminist Louisa Goldsmid gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named \"Juriscontalus\" and Asher Myers of \"The Jewish Chronicle\" that action was taken. Public meetings were then held across the country and Jewish and Christian leaders in Britain spoke out against the atrocities.\n\nIn December 1906, L. J. Greenberg, a successful advertising agent and English Zionist leader, contacted the Dutch banker Jacobus Kann with the idea to buy the Jewish Chronicle for promoting Zionism. The same month, Greenberg, together with David Wolffsohn, Joseph Cowen, Jacobus H. Kahn, and Leopold Kessler, bought the shares. Greenberg himself became its editor.\n\nThe JC obtained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, \"The Hebrew Observer\" and \"The Jewish World\". Only in October 1919, the JC got a strong opposing voice by The Jewish Guardian, who counterbalanced the dominant Zionist propaganda of the Chronicle, until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg's death, the same year, the JC remained moderate pro-Zionist under the leadership of Leopold Kessler.\n\nThe weekly newspaper \"The Jewish World\" was taken over in 1913. It published articles by various Zionist leaders, as well as early non-Jewish pro-Zionists. In 1934, it was merged with the Chronicle. After 1948, the paper maintained a pro-Israel attitude.\n\nParticularly under Leopold Greenberg, the JC was hostile to the Reform and Liberal movements in Britain. Over the years, attention shifted from Orthodoxy in Anglo-Jewry to developments in Progressive Judaism, while increasingly becoming more critical of the Orthodox position on halakhic issues.\n\nUnder the ownership of Asher Myers and Israel Davis, from 1878, the paper was hostile to Zionism in line with the official positions of the religious and lay leaders of the community. After Leopold Greenberg had taken over the paper in 1906, it became strongly Zionist and it was made into \"a firm and influential champion of Zionism\".\n\nThe JC supported the Balfour Declaration, the publication of which was postponed for a week in order to allow the Chronicle to publish it in time. After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of Chaim Weizmann. Greenberg was discontented with the too vague definition of the Zionist goals and wanted him to state clearly that Palestine must be politically Jewish. He wanted to define \"National Home\" as a Jewish Commonwealth. Although JC's support to Zionism somewhat decreased after Greenberg's death, it consistently devoted considerable space to Israel and Zionism.\n\n\"The JC\" sponsors the Jewish Sunday league system in London, known as the Maccabi Football League.\n\nIn 1981, the publication published an interview with then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher was questioned regarding the state of Israel and how Conservative policy affected the Jewish community.\n\nIn September 1999, it was the first non-Israeli newspaper to conduct an interview with Ehud Barak during his term as Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nIn December 2007, the newspaper published an interview with the Labour Party donor, David Abrahams.\n\nIn July 2013, \"The Jewish Chronicle\" hosted an audience with UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Farage was interviewed by editor Stephen Pollard, and took questions from the audience.\n\nDr Othman Moqbel, Dr Hussein Nagi and Mr Mohamad Yousef of Human Appeal International received an apology and substantial damages from \"The Jewish Chronicle\" following articles published in February 2012 in the newspaper and on its website, suggesting that Human Appeal International, a British charity, had been designated as a terrorist organisation by the US government and had diverted donations to fund terror and to support the families of suicide bombers. An apology was published in the newspaper on 31 May and on its website on 30 May.\n\nThe average number of copies sold per week is estimated to be in the region of 32,000 (accurate as of June 2010). The newspaper's website includes paid-for searchable archives of all editions from the first issue to the present, making it valuable for Anglo-Jewish genealogists and historians. The website was launched in 2000 and has won three successive Weekly Newspaper on the Web awards. It was relaunched in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

He is commonly referred to in Hebrew as \"ha-Gaon he-Chasid mi-Vilna\", \"the pious genius from Vilnius\".\n\nThrough his annotations and emendations of Talmudic and other texts he became one of the most familiar and influential names in rabbinic study since the Middle Ages, counted by many among the sages known as the \"Acharonim\", and ranked by some with the even more revered \"Rishonim\" of the Middle Ages. Large groups of people, including many \"yeshivas\", uphold the set of Jewish customs and rites (\"minhag\"), the \"minhag ha-Gra\", which is named for him, and which is also considered by many to be the prevailing Ashkenazi \"minhag\" in Jerusalem.\n\nBorn in Sielec in the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (today Sialiec, Belarus), the Gaon displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult \"halakhic\" problems to him for legal rulings. He was a prolific author, writing such works as glosses on the Babylonian Talmud and \"Shulchan Aruch\" known as \"Bi'urei ha-Gra\" (\"Elaborations by the Gra\"), a running commentary on the Mishnah, \"Shenoth Eliyahu\" (\"The Years of Elijah\"), and insights on the Pentateuch entitled \"Adereth Eliyahu\" (\"The Splendor of Elijah\"), published by his son. Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name, and he wrote commentaries on the Proverbs and other books of the Tanakh later on in his life. None of his manuscripts were published in his lifetime.\n\nWhen Hasidic Judaism became influential in his native town, the Vilna Gaon joined the \"opposers\" or \"Misnagdim\", rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, to curb Hasidic influence. In 1777, one of the first excommunications against the nascent Hasidic movement was launched in Vilna.\n\nHe encouraged his students to study natural sciences, and even translated geometry books to Yiddish and Hebrew.\n\nLegend has it that by the age of four he had committed the Tanakh to memory. At the age of seven he was taught Talmud by Moses Margalit, rabbi of Kėdainiai and the author of a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud, entitled \"Pnei Moshe\" (\"The Face of Moses\"). The young Eliyahu was said to have already known several of the Talmudic tractates by heart. He is known for having possessed an eidetic memory. By eight, he was studying astronomy during his free time. From the age of ten he continued his studies without the aid of a teacher due to his knowledge already surpassing all his teachers, and by the age of eleven he had committed the entire Talmud to memory.\n\nWhen he reached a more mature age, Elijah decided to go into \"exile\" and he wandered in various parts of Europe including Poland and Germany, as was the custom of the pious of the time. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult \"halakhic\" problems to him. Scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish, sought his insights into mathematics and astronomy. He returned to his native city in 1748, having by then acquired considerable renown.\n\nThe Gaon applied to the Talmud and rabbinic literature proper philological methods. He made an attempt toward a critical examination of the text; thus, very often with a single reference to a parallel passage, or with a textual emendation, he overthrew tenuous decisions made by his rabbinic predecessors.\n\nHe devoted much time to the study of the Torah and Hebrew grammar, and was knowledgeable in the secular sciences, enriching the latter by his original contributions. His pupils and friends had to pursue the same plain and simple methods of study that he followed. He also exhorted them not to neglect the secular sciences, maintaining that Judaism could only gain by their studying them. The Gaon was also attracted to the study of Kabbalah; his controversy with Hasidic Judaism thus stems not from a rejection of mysticism \"per se\", but from a profoundly different understanding of its teachings, in particular regarding its relationship to halakha and the Ashkenazic \"minhag\".\n\nThe Vilna Gaon was modest; he declined to accept the office of rabbi, though it was often offered to him on the most flattering terms. In his later years he also refused to give approbations, though this was the privilege of great rabbis; he thought too humbly of himself to assume such authority. He led a retiring life, only lecturing from time to time to a few chosen pupils.\n\nIn 1755, when the Gaon was thirty-five, Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschütz, then sixty-five years old, applied to him for an examination of and decision concerning his amulets, which were a subject of discord between himself and Rabbi Jacob Emden. The Vilna Gaon, in a letter to Eybeschütz, stated his support of Eybeschutz but that he did not believe that words coming from a stranger like himself, who had not even the advantage of old age, would be of any weight with the contending parties. Already at that age, however, the Gaon was considered the greatest of the generation, despite the many older Torah luminaries alive at the time.\n\nWhen Hasidic Judaism became influential in Vilna, the Vilna Gaon, joining the rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, took steps to check the Hasidic influence. In 1777 one of the first excommunications by the \"Misnagdim\" was launched in Vilna against the Hasidim, while a letter was also addressed to all of the large communities, exhorting them to deal with the Hasidim following the example of Vilna, and to watch them until they had recanted. The letter was acted upon by several communities; and in Brody, during the trade fair, the \"cherem\" (ban of excommunication) was pronounced against the Hasidim.\n\nIn 1781, when the Hasidim renewed their proselytizing work under the leadership of their Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (the \"Ba'al Ha'tanya\"), the Gaon excommunicated them again, declaring them to be heretics with whom no pious Jew might intermarry. However, the excommunications did not stop the tide of Hasidism.\n\nExcept for the conflict with the Hasidim, the Vilna Gaon almost never took part in public affairs and, so far as is known, did not preside over any school in Vilna. He was satisfied with lecturing in his \"bet ha-midrash\" to a few chosen pupils, whom he initiated into his methods. He taught them Hebrew grammar, Hebrew Bible, and Mishna, subjects that were largely neglected by the Talmudists of that time. He was especially anxious to introduce them to the study of midrash literature, and the Minor Treatises of the Talmud, which were very little known by the scholars of his time.\n\nHe laid special stress on the study of the Jerusalem Talmud, which had been almost entirely neglected for centuries. As the Mishna in Tractate \"Peah\" (:) states: \"The study of Torah is equal to all of the mitzvos\", and being convinced that the study of the Torah is the very life of Judaism, and that this study must be conducted in a scientific and not in a merely scholastic manner, the Gaon encouraged his chief pupil, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, to found a \"yeshiva\" (rabbinic academy) in which rabbinic literature should be taught. Rabbi Chaim Volozhin opened the Volozhin yeshiva in 1803, a few years after the Gaon's death, and revolutionized Torah study, with resulting impact on all of Orthodox Jewry.\n\nThe Vilna Gaon led an ascetic life. He interpreted literally the words of the Jewish sages, that the Torah can be acquired only by abandoning all pleasures and by cheerfully accepting suffering. He was revered by his countrymen as a saint due to his ascetic practices, being called by some of his contemporaries \"the \"Hasid\"\". While he was an opponent to the Hasidic movement, the term itself means \"pious person\" and is used here without reference to the movement.\n\nThe Gaon once started on a trip to the Land of Israel, but for unknown reasons did not get beyond Germany. (In the early nineteenth century, three groups of his students, known as Perushim, did manage the trip, settling mostly in Safed and Jerusalem). While at Königsberg he wrote to his family a famous letter that was published under the title \"Alim li-Terufah,\" Minsk, 1836.\n\nThe Vilna Gaon was a copious annotator; there is hardly an ancient Hebrew book of any importance to which he did not provide marginal glosses and notes, or write a brief commentary, which were mostly dictated to his pupils. (Many maintain that it was his disciples who recorded his comments, if not his editorial notes.) However, nothing of his was published in his lifetime. The \"Gra\" was very precise in the wording of his commentaries, because he maintained that he was obligated by Torah Law that only the \"\"Torah shebichtav\" (the written law) is permitted to be written down - the rest of \"Torah sheb'al peh\"\" (oral law) cannot be, unless circumstances require. (This further supports the view that it was his disciples who wrote his comments.) So the Vilna Gaon abided by this view of law by reducing his extensive explanations that are largely inscrutable to any but advanced talmudists. Glosses on the Babylonian Talmud and \"Shulchan Aruch\" are known as \"Bi'urei ha-Gra\" (\"Elaborations by the Gra\"). His running commentary on the Mishnah is titled \"Shenoth Eliyahu\" (\"The Years of Elijah\"). Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name. His insights on the Pentateuch are titled \"Adereth Eliyahu\" (\"The Splendor of Elijah\"). Commentaries on the Proverbs and other books of the Tanakh were written later on in his life.\n\nHe also wrote on mathematics, being well versed in the works of Euclid and encouraging his pupil Rabbi of Shklov to translate the great mathematician's works into Hebrew. A mathematical work titled \"Ayil Meshulash\" (\"A Ram in Three Parts\", a reference to Abraham's \"Covenant Between the Parts\" in Genesis 15:9) is generally attributed to him.\n\nHe was one of the most influential rabbinic authorities since the Middle Ages, and—although he is properly an Acharon—he is held by many authorities after him as belonging to the Rishonim (rabbinic authorities of the Middle Ages).\n\nHis main student Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, founded the first yeshiva in his home town of Volozhin, Belarus. The results of this move is claimed to have revolutionized Torah study, by departing from the centuries of 'informal' study. Youth and scholars would congregate in local synagogues and study freely, although it was customary to migrate to towns possessing great scholars as the local rabbi. The Volozhin Yeshivah created a formal structure of study, by providing qualified faculty, meals, and accommodation. The results of this process are currently the norm in Orthodox Jewry.\n\nSomewhat ironically, viewed from a traditional light, the leaders of the Haskalah movement used the study methods of the Vilna Gaon to gain adherents to their movement. Maskilim valued and adapted his emphasis on peshat over pilpul, his engagement with and mastery of Hebrew grammar and Bible, and his interest in textual criticism of rabbinic texts, further developing the philosophy of their movement.\n\nAs for the Vilna Gaon's own community, in accordance with the Vilna Gaon's wishes, three groups of his disciples and their families, numbering over 500, made aliyah to the Land of Israel between 1808 and 1812. This immigration was one of the first modern Jewish migrations to Palestine, although Hasidic immigration was already active in the 1780s (even by the rebbes themselves, such as the elderly Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk). The disciples of the Vilna Gaon, known as \"Perushim\" due to how they isolated themselves from worldly concerns to study Torah, originally settled in Safed because the Muslim authorities in Jerusalem prevented Ashkenazi Jews from settling there. However, after numerous devastating calamities in the region, including plague and earthquake, most of the disciples moved to Jerusalem. Their arrival in Jerusalem, which for over 100 years had been mainly Sephardi, revived the presence of Ashkenazi Jewry in Jerusalem, and resulted in a dominance of the customs of the Vilna Gaon.\n\nThe impact of the Perushim is still apparent today in the religious practices of the Israeli Jewish community, even among non-Ashkenazim. For example, the institution of the priestly blessing by the Kohanim known as \"duchaning\" during the weekdays (rather than only during festivals, as practiced in the Diaspora), and the accepted time for the onset of Shabbat in Jerusalem and other cities can both be traced to the custom of the Vilna Gaon. However, the teachings and traditions of the Vilna Gaon have been passed down most directly to the Litvaks in Israel. The Perushim also set up several Kollels, founded the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, and were instrumental in rebuilding the Yehudah HeChassid Synagogue (also known as the Hurba Synagogue, or \"The Ruins\"), which had lain in ruins for 140 years. \n\nThere is a statue of the Vilna Gaon and a street named after him in Vilnius, the place of both his birth and his death. His brother Avraham authored the revered work, \"Maalos Hatorah\". His son Abraham was also a scholar of note.\n\nThe Vilna Gaon died in 1797, aged 77, and was subsequently buried in the Šnipiškės cemetery in Vilnius, now in Žirmūnai elderate. The cemetery was closed by the Tsarist Russian authorities in 1831 and partly built over.\n\nIn the 1950s, Soviet authorities planned to build a stadium and concert hall on the site. They allowed the remains of the Vilna Gaon to be removed and re-interred at the new cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}
