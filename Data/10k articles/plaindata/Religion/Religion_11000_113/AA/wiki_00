{"id": "24197895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24197895", "title": "Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums", "text": "Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums\n\nAllgemeine Zeitung des Judentums (until May 1903: \"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums\") was a Jewish German magazine devoted to Jewish interests, founded in 1837 by Ludwig Philippson (1811–89), published first in Leipzig and later in Berlin. In 1860 it had a circulation of approximately 1,500. It was read not only in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands but also in Eastern Europe, and continued to appear until 1922.\n\nAt the time of its founding several Jewish journals had recently been launched in Germany – \"Sulamith\" (1806-1843), \"Jedidja\" (1817-1831), and Abraham Geiger's \"Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für Jüdische Theologie\" (1835-1847), as well as the \"Unparteiische Universal-Kirchenzeitung\" (1837), of Julius Vinzenz Höninghaus, which had a Jewish section edited by Michael Hess and Isaac Markus Jost – and Philippson recognized that none had kept pace with the needs of the times. He aimed to produce a journal for the intelligent lay person that would both advance knowledge of Jewish history and plead the cause of the Jews of his day.\n\nThe first number of the paper appeared May 2, 1837, and was published by Baumgärtner in Leipzig with the subtitle \"Unparteiisches Organ für Alles Jüdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde, und Belletristik\" (Impartial Organ for All Matters of Jewish Interest Pertaining to Politics, Religion, Literature, History, Philology, and Belles-lettres). During the first two years the paper appeared three times per week. For a year and a half a supplement was published three times a month, devoted to literature and homiletics. In the course of 1839 it was first published twice weekly and then eventually became a weekly.\n\nIsidore Singer, writing in 1906, highlighted the paper's editorial independence, noting that it had not ever received a subsidy from any Jewish body, and that during the revolutions of 1848, \"when the publication of nearly all other Jewish journals was interrupted, the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" braved the storm and spoke out plainly in the political turmoil.\" According to I. M. Jost, who devoted a chapter to the journal in his \"Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten\" (1847), the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" \"became epoch-making in Jewish history by attempting for the first time to give a general view of the life and conditions of the Jews.\"\n\nPhilippson's chief aim was the civil emancipation of the Jews, carrying on the fight for that cause in the spirit of Gabriel Riesser's earlier periodical \"Der Jude\" (1832-1835). The paper was a voice for moderate religious reform, focusing attention on the organization of religious instruction, the form of worship in the synagogue, and the cultivation of all branches of Jewish learning. It also advocated for closer relations with non-Jews. It exercised considerable influence on Judaism in general, and, in particular, on the evolution of Judaism in Germany. It played a role in the establishment of a rabbinical seminary (Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums) in Berlin, and of a Jewish Publication Society \"(Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Literatur)\", as well as the calling together of a Jewish synod (Leipzig, 1869).\n\nFrom the outset the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" met with success, drawing the interest of cultured Jewish circles of Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Within the first months of its publication a society of students in Leyden (Netherlands) had formed to aid its circulation, and it even obtained several hundred subscribers in Poland.\n\nDuring the first years of its existence the paper had among its collaborators a number of the most distinguished scholars, including Gabriel Riesser, E. Carmoly, J. L. Saalschütz, S. D. Luzzatto, Leopold Zunz, Leopold Dukes, Julius Fürst, Leopold Löw, Franz Delitzsch, Adolph Jellinek, Abraham Geiger, and I. M. Jost. During the first year Phoebus Philippson, brother of Ludwig, contributed a series of 11 articles under the title \"Ideas for an Encyclopedia and a Methodology of Jewish Theology.\"\n\nIn the mid 1850s a supplement was published regularly, entitled \"Jüdisches Volksblatt zur Belehrung und Unterhaltung auf Jüdischem Gebiete\" (A Popular Jewish Journal for Instruction and Entertainment on Jewish Subjects).\n\nAfter Philippson's death Gustav Karpeles assumed the editorship, beginning with the issue of February 9, 1890. Under his tenure the paper's interests shifted toward the lives and situation of the Jews of Eastern Europe. At that time a change was made in the format so that the literary part, which formed the bulk of the paper, was separated from the part containing the news. The latter was paged separately as a supplement entitled \"Der Gemeindebote\", which continued to appear until 1922.\n\nIn 1890 the journal was acquired by Rudolf Mosse and from then on was published in Berlin.\n\nLater, beginning in the second half of 1920, the journal appeared only once every two weeks. It ceased publication with the issue of April 28, 1922, and was succeeded by the \"C.V.-Zeitung\" (C.V.-Newspaper), the organ of the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith).\n"}

The diviner can also interpret patterns formed from the residue of a salt solution as it evaporates in the bowl. The exact interpretations are unknown, but it probably follows a similar method to aleuromancy.\n\nSalt itself is often intertwined with luck and some of this ancient tradition can be seen in the superstitions, such as perceived misfortune when the salt cellar is overturned and the custom of throwing salt over the left shoulder for good luck.\n\nOne form of alomancy consists of the casting of salt into a fire, which is considered a type of pyromancy.\n"}

It is a part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and its see city is Turku. The Archbishop has many administrative tasks relating to the National church, and is the Metropolitan and Primate of the church. In common with other Lutheran and Anglican churches the Archbishop is considered \"primus inter pares\", whilst all diocesan bishops retain their independence within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nInfluenced by papal bulls, Swedish magnates in the 12th century set up crusading expeditions to convert the heathens in the eastern Baltic. This resulted in the establishment of the Catholic Church, the Christian religion and the Swedish conquest of southern Finland in 1249. Turku, or \"Åbo\", became the principal city in Finland and residence of a Bishopric. \nAs a result of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century the Catholic Church had to give way for the Lutheran state church which was established by King Gustav Vasa of Sweden, whose principal reformer in Finland was Mikael Agricola and from 1554 also the Bishop. \n\nAfter the Finnish War in 1809, Finland became a part of the Russian Empire as an autonomous grand duchy. In 1817 the Bishop was created Archbishop and became head of the Church in Finland, which thereupon became the state church of the grand duchy. In 1870, the church was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, through the constitution of 1919 and the act on religious freedom of 1922 the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland became a national church of Finland (along with the Finnish Orthodox Church, which however did not get a constitutional position).\n\nThe bishopric of Turku was elevated to an archbishopric in 1817, and since then the Ordinary has held the full official title of Archbishop of Turku and Finland. There has been a continuous succession of archbishops since that time. Since the retirement of Archbishop Jukka Paarma in 2010, Kari Mäkinen has been the incumbent Archbishop of Turku and Finland. He previously served in the archdiocese as the Bishop of Turku.\n\nSince 1998, the Diocese of Turku has had a bishop in addition to the Archbishop. The Bishop of Turku is responsible for the oversight of all the parishes of the diocese except for those in the deaneries of Turku and Naantali, which are led by the Archbishop. This arrangement allows the Archbishop to take a leading role on the national and international stages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2851793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851793", "title": "Chavda dynasty", "text": "Chavda dynasty\n\nThe Chavda (IAST:Chávaḍá), also spelled Chawda or Chavada, dynasty ruled region of modern-day northern Gujarat in India, from c. 690 to 942. Variants of the name for the dynasty include Chapa, Chahuda, Chávoṭakas and Chāpoṭkata.\n\nDuring the seventh century, Panchasar was the capital of Chavda ruler Jayaśekhara. In c. 697, Panchasar was attacked and Jayaśekhara was killed. His wife had fled and she gave birth to Vanraja, the founder (746 or 765) of Aṇahilaváḍa and most prominent ruler of dynasty. According to \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\", he ruled for 60 years. He was succeeded by Yogaraja (ruled 35 years), followed by Kshemraja (25 years), Bhuyada (29 years), Virsimha (25 years) and Ratnaditya (15 years). Ratnaditya was succeeded by Samantsimha (also known as Chuyadadeva) who ruled seven years. Samantsimha did not have any children so he adopted his nephew Mularaja who overthrew him in 942 and established the Chaulukya dynasty.\n\nThe chief sources of information regarding the Chavda rule are the opening chapters of the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" and \"Vicháraśreṇi\", \"Sukṛitasankírtana\", and \"Ratnamálá\". All of these works are written during rule of Chaulukya dynasty, successors of Chavdas. The \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" and \"Vicháraśreṇi\" were written by Merutunga. The \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" is a short historical compilation; the \"Vicháraśreṇi\", though a mere list of kings, is more reliable. Kṛishṇabhaṭṭa's \"Ratnamálá\" is a poetic history with good descriptions and many fables taken from the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\". Arisiṇha's \"Sukṛitasankírtana\" is a short work largely borrowed from the \"Vicháraśreṇi\".\n\nThe reference to them was found in a Navsari copperplate of Chalukya governor of Lata region (modern-day South Gujarat) Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin dated 738-39 CE which enlisted the dynasties defeated by Arabs (\"Tajika\") and finally repelled by him. In it, Chávoṭaka is mentioned after Kachchela and Saindhavas.\n\nDharanivaraha's Haddala grant dated Shaka 836 (914 CE) mentions himself as Chapas of Vardhamana (now Wadhwan). Dharanivaraha was subordinate of Mahipala of Gurjara-Pratihara (of Kanauj). The grant was issued to Acharya of Amardaka Santana of Vimkala village (Shaiva sect). It also mentions his ancestors; Vikramarka, Addaka, Pulakeshin, Dhruvabhata followed by himself.\n\nThe Chávaḍás are connected with the Chápas of Bhinmal and Chápa of Wadhwan. Their Gurjara origin is disputed. Some scholar believe they originated from Indo-Scythian. Their origin is also placed in Saurashtra where their capital was at Deobandar near Somnath. Dharanivaraha of Vardhamana's grant mentions origin from the Chapa or bow of Shiva. It was a common practice at that time to associate one's origin with Puranic or mythological traditions.\n\nA small Chávaḍá chiefship centred at Pañchásar (now a village in Patan district, Gujarat) in the 7th century. The Navsari copperplate prove the early existence of the domain. They were probably feudatory of rulers of Bhinmal.\n\nThe author of the \"Ratnamálá\" () says that in 696 CE (Samvat 752) Jayaśekhara, the Chavda king of Pañchásar was attacked by the Chaulukya king Bhuvaḍa of Kalyánakaṭaka in Kanyákubja (probably Kanauj) and slain by Bhuvaḍa in battle. Before his death Jayaśekhara, he sent his pregnant wife Rupasundarí to the forest in charge of her brother Surapála, one of his chief warriors. After Jayaśekhara's death, Rupasundarí gave birth to a son named Vanarája.\n\nThe truthfulness of the tradition is doubtful. In the seventh century, not Chaulukyas but Gurjara-Pratihara and Pala kings flourished in Kanauj. No place of importance called Kalyánakaṭaka is recorded in the Kanauj territory. The Western Chalukya kingdom with its capital at Kalyán was only established about the middle of the eleventh century. The Chalukyas of Vemulavada lists contain no king named Bhuvaḍa, unless he be the great Chálukya king Vijayáditya also called Bhuvanásraya, who warred in the north and was there imprisoned but made his escape. The \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" and other old records do not mention of an invasion from Kanauj. The attack may be carried out by Gurjara-Pratihara or Arabs mentioned in Navsari copperplate.\n\nMerutunga, the author of the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\", tells a story that Rupasundarí was living in the forest swinging her son in a hammock, when a Jain monk named Śílaguṇasúri noticing as he passed royal marks on the boy bought him from his mother. The story adds that a nun named Víramatí brought up the boy whom the monks called Vanarája, literally \"the forest king\". When eight years old, the monk told Vanarája to protect his place of worship from rats. The boy's skill in shooting rats convinced the monk he was not fit to be a monk but was worthy of a kingdom. He therefore returned the boy to his mother. These details seem invented by the Jain writers themselves. No mention of any such story occurs in the \"Ratnamálá\".\n\nIn the forests where Vanarája passed his youth lived his maternal uncle Surapála, one of Jayaśekhara's generals, who, after his sovereign's defeat and death, had become an outlaw. Vanarája grew up under Surapála's charge. The \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" records the following story of the origin of Vanarája's wealth. A Kanyákubja king married Maháṇaká, the daughter of a Gujarát king. To receive the proceeds of the marriage cess which the Gujarát king had levied from his subjects, a deputation or \"panchkúla\" came from Kanyákubja to Gujarát. The deputation made Vanarája their leader or \"sellabhrit\" to realize the proceeds of the cess. In six months Vanarája collected 24 \"lákhs\" of \"Páruttha drammas\" and 4000 horse, which the deputation took and started for Kanyákubja. Vanarája waylaid and killed them, secured the money and horses, and remained in hiding for a year. With the wealth thus acquired Vanarája enrolled an army and established his power assuming the title of king.\n\nFounding of Aṇahilaváḍa (now Patan, Gujarat), 746–765 CE, he fixed the site of a capital which afterwards rose to be the great city of Aṇahilapura. Vanarája is said to have asked a Bharváḍ or Shepherd named Aṇahila, son of Śákhadá to show him the best site. Aṇahila agreed on condition that the city should be called by his name. Aṇahila accordingly showed Vanarája the place. The city may have been called after some local chief since it was popularly known as Aṇahilaváḍa (Sanskrit:Aṇahilaváta) that is \"the place of Aṇahila\". In the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\", Merutuṇga gives 746 CE (S. 802) as the date of the installation of Vanarája, while in his \"Vicháraśreṇi\" the same author gives 765 CE (S. 821 Vaisakha Śukla 2) as the date of the foundation of the city. The discrepancy may be explained by taking 746 CE (S. 802) to refer to the date of Vanarája's getting money enough to fix the site of his capital, and 765 CE (S. 821) to refer to the date of his installation in the completed Aṇahilaváḍa.\n\n\"Vicháraśreṇi\" gives 765 (S. 821) seems the more probable date for the installation as the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" says that Vanarája got himself installed at Aṇahilapura when he was about fifty. This accords with the date fixed on other grounds. Placing Vanarája's birth at about 720 CE would make him 44 in 765 CE (S. 821) corresponding to date mentioned in the \"Vicháraśreṇi\". Merutuṇga in both his works gives the length of Vanarája's life at 109 and of his reign at sixty years. The figure 60 seems to mark the length of his life and not of his reign. So long a reign as sixty years is barely possible for a sovereign who succeeded late in life, and the 109 years of his life can hardly be correct. Taking Vanarája's age at 45 when he was installed in 765 CE (S. 821) and allowing fifteen years more to complete the sixty years, he probably died circa 780 (S. 836), the closing year of his reign.\n\nIt is unclear that he had a war with Arab or not as mentioned in Navsari copperplate (739 CE).\n\nThe lists of Vanarája's successors vary so greatly in the names, in the order of succession, and in the lengths of reigns, that little trust can be placed in them. The first three agree in giving a duration of 196 years to the Chávaḍá dynasty after the accession of Vanarája. The accession of the Chaulukya dyansty founder Mularaja is given in the \"Vicháraśreṇi\" at Saṃvat 1017 and in the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" at Saṃvat 998 corresponding with the original difference of nineteen years (S. 802 and 821) in the founding of the city. This shows that though the total duration of the dynasty was traditionally known to be 196 years the order of succession was not known and guesses were made as to the duration of the different reigns. Certain dates fixed by inscriptions or otherwise known to some compilers and not known to others caused many discrepancies in the various accounts.\n\nAccording to the calculations given above Vanarája's reign lasted to about CE 780. Authorities agree that Vanarája was succeeded by his son Yogarája. The length of Yogarája's reign is given as thirty-five years by the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" and the \"Ratnamálá\", and as twenty-nine by the \"Vicháraśreṇi\". That is according to the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" and \"Ratnamálá\" his reign closes in CE 841 (S. 897) and according to the \"Vicháraśreṇi\" in CE 836 (S. 891). On the whole the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" date CE 841 (S. 897) seems the more probable. The author of the \"Vicháraśreṇi\" may have mistaken the 7 of the manuscripts for a 1, the two figures in the manuscripts of that date being closely alike. If CE 780 is taken as the close of Vanarája's reign and CE 806 as the beginning of Yogarája's reign an interval of twenty-six years is left. This blank, which perhaps accounts for the improbably long reign and life assigned to Vanarája, may have been filled by the forgotten reign of a childless elder brother of Yogarája.\n\nOf Yogarája the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" tells the following tale. Kshemarája, one of Yogarája's three sons, reported that several ships were storm-stayed at Prabhása or Somanátha. The ships had 10,000 horses, many elephants, and millions of money and treasure. Kshemarája prayed that he might seize the treasure. Yogarája forbade him. In spite of their father's orders the sons seized the treasure and brought it to the king. Yogarája said nothing. And when the people asked him why he was silent he answered: \"To say I approve would be a sin; to say I do not approve would annoy you. Hitherto on account of an ancestor’s misdeeds we have been laughed at as a nation of thieves. Our name was improving and we were rising to the rank of true kings. This act of my sons has renewed the old stain. Yogarája would not be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre\".\n\nAccording to the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" in CE 841 (S. 898) Yogarája was succeeded by his son Kshemarája. The \"Vicháraśreṇi\" says that Yogarája was succeeded by Ratnáditya who reigned three years, and he by Vairisiṃha who reigned eleven years. Then came Kshemarája who is mentioned as the son of Yogarája and as coming to the throne in CE 849 (S. 905). The relationship of Yogarája to Ratnáditya and Vairisiṃha is not given. Probably both were sons of Yogarája as the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" mentions that Yogarája had three sons. The duration of Kshemarája's reign is given as thirty-nine years. It is probable that the reigns of the three brothers lasted altogether for thirty-nine years, fourteen years for the two elder brothers and twenty-five years for Kshemarája the period mentioned by the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\". Accepting this chronology CE 880 (S. 936) will be the date of the close of Kshemarája's reign.\n\nAccording to the Vicháraśreṇi and the Sukṛitasankírtana Kshemarája was succeeded by his son Chámuṇḍa. Instead of Chámuṇḍa the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" mentions Bhúyada perhaps another name of Chámuṇḍa, as in the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" the name Chámuṇḍa does not occur. The \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" notes that Bhúyada reigned twenty-nine years and built in Aṇahilaváḍa Patan the temple of Bhúyadeshvar. The \"Vicháraśreṇi\" gives twenty-seven years as the length of Chámuṇḍa's reign an insignificant difference of two years. This gives CE 908 (S. 964) as the close of Chámuṇḍa's reign according to the \"Vicháraśreṇi\".\n\nAfter Bhúyada the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" places Vairisiṃha and Ratnáditya assigning twenty-five and fifteen years as the reigns of each. The \"Vicháraśreṇi\" mentions as the successor of Chámuṇḍa his son Ghaghaḍa who is called Ráhaḍa in the \"Sukṛitasankírtana\". Instead of Ghaghaḍa the \"Prabandhachintámaṇi\" gives Sámantasiṃha perhaps a title of Ghághaḍa's. The \"Vicháraśreṇi\" gives Ghaghaḍa a reign of twenty-seven years and mentions as his successor an unnamed son who reigned nineteen years. The \"Sukṛitasankírtana\" gives the name of this son as Bhúbhaṭa. According to these calculations the close of Ghághaḍa's reign would be CE 936 (Saṃvat 965 + 27 = 992). Adding nineteen years for Bhúbhaṭa's reign brings the date of the end of the dynasty to CE 956 (Saṃvat 993 + 19 = 1012) that is five years earlier than S. 1017 the date given by the \"Vicháraśreṇi\". Until some evidence to the contrary is shown Merutuṇga's date CE 961 (S. 821 + 196 = 1017) may be taken as correct.\n\nRatnaditya was succeeded by Samantsimha (also known as Chuyadadeva) who ruled seven years. Samantsinh Chavda did not have any children so he adopted his nephew Mularaja who overthrew him c. 942 and established the Chaulukya dynasty.\n\nThe Merutunga's \"Prabandhachintamani\" states about Vanrajavihara temple at Anahilapathaka (now Patan, Gujarat) as well as the construction of Kanteshwari-prasada by Vanraja. Kanteshwari was the petron goddess of later Chaulukya kings too. Kumarapala has prohibited the animal sacrifice at this temple later. The \"Prabandhachintamani\" mentions the construction of the temple of Bhattaraka Shri Yogishwari by Yogaraja at Patan in early 9th century. The \"Prabandhachintamani\" also mentions the construction of Bhuyadeshwara temple built by Bhuyada at Patan in last quarter of the 9th century. According to Haribhadra Suri (middle of 12th century), Minister Nihhaya's son Lahara had built the temple of Vindhyavasini (Laharadhanuhavi) at Sander in Patan district. He had also founded Narangpura town and built a Parshwanatha temple for merit of his mother. In later half of 9th century, king Yashobhadra had built a Jain temple at Dinduanapura, which is mentioned in \"Purnagaccha-pattavali\". According to an inscription on a bronze, king Raghusena had built Raghusena-vihara at Ramasaiyanpura in 928 CE. \n\nThe extant temples this period (Early Nagara Phase) include the Roda Group of Temples, Lakodra in Vijapur Taluka, old temple at Thangadh, Ranakdevi Temple at Wadhwan, the Sun Temple at Kanthkot, Shiva temple at Puaranogadh at Manjal in Kutch. Harishchandra-ni-Chori at Shamlaji, older Bhadreshwar Jain Temple (rebuilt now) and the Temple III of Roda Group of Temples are some other extant temples of the early 9th century.\n\nBased on Dharanivaraha's grant, it is known that in 914 CE, he, a Chapa or Chavda king, was ruling at Vardhamana (now Wadhwan) as a fuedatory of Gurjara-Pratiharya Mahipaladeva. It also mentions his ancestors; Vikramarka, Addaka, Pulakeshin, Dhruvabhata followed by Dharanivaraha.

{"id": "51732974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51732974", "title": "Christian humanitarian aid", "text": "Christian humanitarian aid\n\nChristian humanitarian aid is work performed by Christian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to alleviate the suffering of people around the world. Charity is a concept of great importance in Christianity. Humanitarian aid occurs in areas where some churches choose to invest time and money in the spirit of compassion.\n\nThe modern concept of Christian humanitarian aid is based on teachings from the Bible.\nCharity and providing assistance to the poor are concepts established in the Old Testament. According to Exodus, part of one's tithe was devoted to the needy (orphans, widows, foreigners). In the New Testament, Jesus taught much about the subject of charity. In the Sermon on the Mount, he called for people to help not only friends but also enemies, as well as those rejected by society, such as people with disabilities. In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, he described the medical care paid by a Samaritan to a Jew (both peoples were enemies), as a model of love for his neighbor. Paul of Tarsus has also raised funds for the underprivileged. \n\nDating back as early as the Middle Ages, Catholic monasteries and monastic orders have a long tradition of providing charity, asylum, and assistance to the poor. Protestant churches established the Department of Deacons responsible for helping the poor. Missionary societies of the 18th and 19th centuries often offered humanitarian assistance in addition to their main activity of evangelism.\n\nIn the 19th century, the first Christian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) began emerging. YMCA, a Protestant NGO, was created in 1844 in London. Caritas, a Catholic NGO, was founded in Cologne in 1897. The entrepreneurial culture of Evangelical churches also led to their creation of multiple NGOs. \nLike the humanitarian movement, Christian NGOs attracted more attention in the 1970s. Some Christian NGOs, such as those run by evangelical doctors providing medical assistance in impoverished countries, are recognized for their contributions to development. \n\nThere is no universal definition of these organizations. A Christian humanitarian NGO has at least one of the following traits: \n\nAffiliation with local Christian churches across the world often make it possible for Christian NGOs to work in countries or regions that are otherwise difficult for governmental or international organizations to access. The international network of many Christian religions allows their NGOs to gather significant funding and publicity to promote their humanitarian actions across the world.\n\nIn some Christian NGOs, the staff is not only Christian. However, common spiritual values are a common feature among Christian NGO employees and volunteers. According to Christian aid workers, their commitment is motivated by spiritual values of compassion and mercy. In some NGOs, such as Mercy Ships, all employees are volunteers and have to pay for accommodation and food, as well as work for free. \n\nThe majority of Christian NGOs help everyone, regardless of religion. With the growth of secularization in some countries, some Christian NGOs have downplayed their religious identity. In some NGOs this depends on the cultural context of the national antenna. \n\nAccording to Marie Lefebvre-Billiez, contrary to certain clichés, many Evangelical NGOs do not mix humanitarian and evangelization. But on the other hand, some evangelical NGOs can not provide help without accompanying evangelization. The diversity of evangelical movements makes both scenarios possible. In some parts of the world, as on the African continent, local culture places a great deal of importance on spiritual things, which makes it difficult for some people to understand or accept the work of Humanitarian NGOs that do not display their religious identity.\n\nIn 2007, Christian NGOs comprised 57.4% of the NGOs affiliated with the United Nations.\n\nAccording to a British study by Elizabeth Ferris, published in 2005 in the periodical \"International Review of the Red Cross\", Christian NGOs have large budgets and provide considerable financial support worldwide. This same study gives the following figures:\n\nAccording to Sébastien Fath, Evangelical churches and their respective NGOs develop an international humanitarian entrepreneurship that influences policy decisions. Therefore, they are unavoidable geopolitical players in the humanitarian field.\n\nAmong the most important International Catholic Humanitarian NGOs, there are Caritas Internationalis and Emmaus International. \n\nAt the level of international Protestant humanitarian NGO, there are church-related organizations such as Lutheran World Relief and United Methodist Committee on Relief. The largest NGO humanitarian Protestant international not directly attached to a church is the YMCA. \n\nAmong the most important Evangelical Christian Humanitarian NGO are International Justice Mission, Prison Fellowship International, Samaritan's Purse, Mercy Ships, World Vision International. \n\n\n\n\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing French Wikipedia article at ; see its history for attribution.\n"}

The subsequent year (or years) is spent as part of a smaller self-supporting mission team within small Australian towns. \n\nStudents work alongside churches within neighborhoods, schools, universities, youth groups and sporting clubs to serve the community and build bridges with those not connected with the traditional church. \n\nCornerstone is a non-profit organisation, and used to operate several businesses to finance its training centers and mission teams.\n\nCornerstone Community was founded on a cotton farm in Outback Australia in 1978 by two friends who shared a passion to make practical sense of Jesus and his teaching.\n\nLaurie McIntosh, a civil engineer, anthropologist, professional thumb wrestler and theologian, developed the idea for a self-sufficient 'mission-minded' community of Christians while working with Campus Crusade on universities in England and Australia.\n\nTogether with history teacher Paul Roe and with the financial support of local farmers Jack Buster and Owen Boone, they founded the first Cornerstone Community west of Bourke, New South Wales.\n\nThe first intake of students arrived in 1978 and divided their time between farm work and study. \n\nEarly facilities included a ramshackle collection of farm buildings, caravans and sheds and students and staff lived in close quarters. Lectures occasionally took place outside under the shade of a tree to escape the harsh Bourke summer. \n\nFrom these humble beginnings Cornerstone has at various times maintained centres in Bourke, Broken Hill and Canowindra in New South Wales, Emerald and Dalby in Queensland and Swan Hill in Victoria. Cornerstone mission teams have worked in many Australian towns and cities in most states. \n\nCornerstone remains a small, non-denominational, community-based fellowship focused on mission and training.\n\nThey are officially described as an Australian 'Christian Mission Order'.\n\nIn 2015, Cornerstone's Director of Mission, Peter Volkofsky, published a book called \"Beautiful Quest\". It tells small stories about different aspects of Cornerstone life, such as training at one of the first year campuses.\n\nCornerstone Community used to operate Training Centres, which were described as intentional communities similar to the Israeli kibbutz system. These Centres used to be based in Broken Hill, Canowindra, Dubbo and Swan Hill, but are now either sold or functionally vacant. They also have an overseas Training Centre in Ghana which is operated by one of their graduates named Kwadwo. \n\nCornerstone’s courses were allegedly designed to extend beyond an academic understanding of theology,(including ethics, apologetics, Christian history and discipleship)and students are encouraged to develop a practical understanding of how their faith impacts everyday life.\n\nMentors were assigned to students to assist in their course and personal discipleship, integrating Biblical studies with modern scholarship, personal experience and awareness of current issues. \n\nCornerstone suggest their emphasis is on training the laity in relevant and life-style based mission. Critics suggest they are insular and anti-church. \n\nCornerstone Community maintains that their community lifestyle is not an attempt to retreat from the realities of modern life, but to help men and women discover life (as Jesus put it) \"in all its fullness\" right in the middle of common things and daily experience.\n\nGraduates come from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life. Over the years, cornerstone has attracted everyone from doctors to builders with Australian children's entertainer and Christian musician Colin Buchanan their most famous graduate. \n\nCornerstone's website used to host a discussion forum called \"Cornerstone Interactive\". This sub-domain of the cornerstone website contains a 'news' page where articles are posted for discussion and 'forums' section where discussion topics are open. \nMembership to 'Interactive' is open (public) and free (no charge). It was discontinued around 2012 through looking at the Wayback Machine \n\nCornerstone once operated a variety of commercial enterprises.\n\nRather than pay tuition fees students were forced to work in these Cornerstone owned businesses.\n\nMost community members were expected to work without pay at least part-time while in Cornerstone by the Cornerstone leadership. \n\nCornerstone Community has at times drawn fire from competitors who claim that they have an unfair advantage in that they do not need to pay wages or Company Tax on their business activities. \n\nThis issue gained particular prominence in 2002 when one of Cornerstone’s businesses, “\"Turf the Lot\"”, became involved in the so-called “turf wars” in Canberra. This drew the attention of the Australian Taxation Office who examined Cornerstone’s business affairs.\n\n"}

After the Yakkhas had left to live in the mountains and remote dense forests, they met Gautama Buddha who converted them to Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the Mahavamsa, Gautama Buddha met the Deva at Mahiyangana. Buddha gave Sumana Saman (A leader of the Deva) a few hairs from his head, which were placed in a golden urn and enshrined in a sapphire stupa. A buddhist monk called Sarabhu is then said to have deposited Buddha's ashes in this Stupa. This stupa is now called the \"Mahiyangana Stupa\" and can be found in the Anuradhapura museum.\n\nSumana Saman was a leader of the Deva who came from the central hills of Sri Lanka. Some Sri Lankan Buddhists worship him as a deity. He is said to be the guardian of Samanalakanda.\n\nDuring the ascension of the mythical Raksha demon King Ravana, some Deva people migrated to other places like present-day North Malabar of Kerala where they followed Buddhism before the advent of Brahminism. Having their own complete social fabric and systems of precedence and worship, they dominated the area until their power was seriously undermined by the Brahmin lead power lobby. However, they still survive in Malabar, and are known as \"Thiyya\", a localization of the name \"Deyva\" equivalent to Deva. The ancestor worship of Thiyyas springs from the fact that they consider themselves as descendants of \"Deyva\" or God. The ceremonial oracles, who represent the spirit of their ancestors of Lanka, in the temple are known as \"Theyyam\", originating from the word \"Deyvam\" meaning God. However, by the time of the arrival of Vijaya to Sri Lanka, a significant number of the Deva clan had intermingled with North Indians, Nagas and Yaksas, to create the Modern Sinhalese lineage.\n\n"}
{"id": "23927021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23927021", "title": "Dialogue with Trypho", "text": "Dialogue with Trypho\n\nThe Dialogue with Trypho, along with the First and Second Apologies, is a second-century Christian apologetic text, documenting the attempts by theologian Justin Martyr to show that Christianity is the new law for all men, and to prove from Scripture that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah.\n\nThe \"Dialogue\" utilizes the literary device of an intellectual conversation between Justin and Trypho, a Jew. The concluding section propounds that the Christians are the true people of God.\n\nThe identity of Trypho as rabbi Tarfon (the Hebrew name Tarfon likely derived from Greek Trypho) has been proposed, but virtually all scholars mentioned in Setzer's 'Jewish Responses to Early Christians' do not accept the notion that Trypho is Tarfon. These scholars say that Trypho is a fictional character invented by Justin for his literary goals. Setzer's book further claims that, whether a character on which Trypho was based existed or not, one can generally assume that Trypho's words are \"largely put in his mouth by Justin\".\n\nThe setting is presented as a chance meeting between Justin and Trypho in Ephesus. Justin had just converted to Christianity from a philosophical background and Trypho had just fled the disturbances in Palestine.\n\nWhen Justin suggests to Trypho to convert to Christianity, the dialogue becomes animated. Trypho criticizes Christians on a number of grounds, and Justin provides answers to each criticism.\n\nIn the opening of the \"dialogue\", Justin relates his vain search among the Stoics, Peripatetics, and Pythagoreans for a satisfying knowledge of God; his finding in the ideas of Plato wings for his soul, by the aid of which he hoped to attain the contemplation of the God-head; and his meeting on the sea-shore with an aged man who told him that by no human endeavor but only by divine revelation could this blessedness be attained, that the prophets had conveyed this revelation to man, and that their words had been fulfilled. Of the truth of this he assured himself by his own investigation; and the daily life of the Christians and the courage of the martyrs convinced him that the charges against them were unfounded. So he sought to spread the knowledge of Christianity as the true philosophy.\n\nIn the \"Dialogue\", Justin also wrote, \"For I choose to follow not men or men's doctrines, but God and the doctrines [delivered] by Him. For if you have fallen in with some who are called Christians, but who do not admit this [truth], and venture to blaspheme the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that their souls, when they die, are taken to heaven; do not imagine that they are Christians.\" This passage is sometimes cited as evidence that the early church subscribed to the doctrine of soul sleep, though some claim that Justin's emphasis is on saying that denial of the resurrection of the dead is what makes them non-Christian, especially considering that he claims that \"even after death souls are in a state of sensation\" in Chapter 18 of his \"First Apology\".\n\nIn his critical edition (with French translation), Philippe Bobichon demonstrates the particular nature of this text, equally influenced by Greek and Rabbinic thought.\n\nBecause the text mentions Justin Martyr's \"First Apology\", which was written sometime between 150-155 CE, \"Dialogue with Trypho\" must have been written after it. The date of authorship has been suggested to have been written anywhere between 155-167, with some scholars favoring 155–160, or even the specific date of 160.\n\nThe \"Dialogue with Trypho\" and the two \"Apologies\" is preserved only in the \"Sacra parallela\"; but, besides that they were known by Tatian, Methodius, and Eusebius, their influence is traceable in Athenagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, the Pseudo-Melito, and especially Tertullian. Eusebius speaks of two \"Apologies\", but he quotes them both as one, which indeed they are in substance. The identity of authorship is backed up not only by the reference in chapter 120 of the \"Dialogue\" to the \"Apology,\" but by the unity of treatment. Zahn showed that the \"Dialogue\" was originally divided into two books, that there is a considerable lacuna in chapter 74, as well as at the beginning, and that it is probably based on an actual occurrence at Ephesus, the personality of the Rabbi Tarfon being employed, though in a Hellenized form.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47181089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47181089", "title": "European Scythian campaign of Darius I", "text": "European Scythian campaign of Darius I\n\nThe European Scythian campaign of Darius I was a military expedition into parts of European Scythia by Darius I, the king of the Achaemenid Empire, in 513 BC. The Scythians were an East Iranian-speaking people who had invaded Media, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and the shores of the Black Sea as they lived between the Danube and Don Rivers and the Black Sea. The campaigns took place in parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper, while principally in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern Russia.\n\nThe Scythians managed to avoid a direct confrontation with the Persian army due to their mobile lifestyle and lack of any settlement (except Gelonus), while the Persians suffered losses due to the Scythians' scorched earth tactic. However, the Persians conquered much of their cultivated lands and damaged their allies, forcing the Scythians to respect the Persian force. Darius halted the advance to avoid further losses, and built a defence line.\n\nDarius crossed the Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large portions of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded Scythia with his general Megabazus, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, mostly in what is modern-day Ukraine, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius, unless the Persians found and desecrated the graves of the Scythians' forefathers. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose. Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful. As presented by Herodotus, the tactics of the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and damage to their loyal allies. The fact is thus that Darius held the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off of the land.\n\nWhile moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.\n\nDarius ordered a halt at the banks of Oarus, where he built \"eight great forts, some eight miles distant from each other\", no doubt as a frontier defence. As the \"Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece and the Western Mediterranean C. 525 to 479 B.C.\" states, this evidently was as far eastwards as Darius intended to go, at least for the time being. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. In his \"Histories\", Herodotus states that the ruins of the forts were still standing in his day. Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the Volga River and headed towards Thrace. He had failed to bring the Scythians to a direct battle, and until he did so he did not have much reason to secure the conquered territories. The initiative still lay with him. As the tactics of evading Darius' army and scorched earth were continued by the Scythians, they had failed however completely, though Darius had failed too as still he wasn't able to bring it to a direct confrontation. He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.\n\nThe whole area from central Thrace to Georgia and from the Ukraine to the north-east Mediterranean formed a compact area with mutual economic interests between Scythians, Thracians or Ionians, and Iranians. In strategic terms, Darius must have seen that some Scythian-type peoples extended from the Ukraine all the way to what is modern-day Uzbekistan, forming a continuum of dangerous nomadic raiders. Furthermore, control of the Black Sea recognized no international divisions. The Persians and the Greeks (many of whom lived in the Persian Empire, while another number lived in the Greek colonies in what is nowadays southern Ukraine) had a common interest in seeking to control the source of Scythian exports of gold, grain, hides, and furs. As the \"Cambridge Ancient History\" further states, Ctesias, a Greek doctor at the Persian court ca. 400 BC, wrote that before the invasion of Darius into the European Scythian lands a satrap of Cappadocia named Ariaramnes had crossed the Black Sea to the north, raiding the European Scythian regions with a fleet of thirty penteconters, returning with Scythian men and women, including the brother of a Scythian king.\n\nWhile some have supposed that the reason for Darius' invasions was merely to destroy the Scythian lands, the erection of a bridge over the Hellespont contradicts this; his superior fleet could have easily shipped the troops over as the Scythians had no navy at all.\n\nThough Herodotus does not mention the season of the year, as the \"Cambridge Ancient History\" states, it is possible to infer it, knowing that if Darius marched from Susa in spring 513, he would have reached Chalcedon in May, and mustered his forces on the European side in June. Thus, he may have started to go beyond the Danube in late August.\n\nAs the \"Cambridge History\" states, Darius inflicted widespread damage on the Scythians and their allies, weakened the prestige of the Royal Scythians especially, and upset the balance of power among the various peoples of the region. But because he failed to bring the Scythians to battle, he was unable to secure any territorial gains and he did not even complete the building of the forts at what could have been a frontier. The campaign was little more than an expansive stalemate. As winter now had come, Darius did not return to attack, and marched towards Thrace, towards his firmly secured territories.\n\nSome form of Persian authority perhaps remained after Darius withdrew, for the \"Scythians across the Sea\" (Old Persian cuneiform: 𐎿𐎣𐎠𐏐𐎫𐎹𐎡𐎹𐏐𐎱𐎼𐎭𐎼𐎹, \"Sakā tayaiya paradraya\") are mentioned at Naqsh-e Rustam as one of the peoples the king conquered outside of Persia. Persian rule could have never extended beyond the Danube in any strength, however.\n\nThe Scythian campaign was decisive in that the Persians abandoned the attempt to subjugate the European Scythians. Herodotus was correct in his assessment that the Scythians owed their escape to their mobility, their lack of inhabited centres, and the skill of their mounted archers. He furthermore states that their refusal to yield to Persia was due to such factors as the authoritarian power of the kings, the widespread hatred of foreigners (IV.76.1), and the ordinary man's belief that what brought him and his tribe honour was the killing of enemies. The various Scythian tribes co-operated with each other, winning support of other neighboring peoples as well. In that regard, as the \"Cambridge Ancient History\" states, they showed more of a sense of a community than the Greek city-states were to show through much of the subsequent Greco-Persian Wars.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1955 \"L'Origine du monde\" was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs (the buyer was psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan).\n\nPaintings that were looted from Hatvany's collection are still hanging on museum walls in Budapest, Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod.

It is the coming-of-age celebration when Krishna's father, Nanda Maharaja, gave Krishna the responsibility for taking care of the cows of Vrindavan.\n\nNanda Maharaj is the father of Krishna and Balarama. Those days children were given the charge to take care of the calves. Both Krishna and Balarama having passed their fifth year, cowherd men conferred and agreed to give those boys who had passed their fifth year charge of the cows in the pasturing ground. Nanda Maharaj decided to organise a ceremony for Krishna and Balarama while going for cow grazing for the first time in Vrindavan. Raddha, a Hindu goddess, wanted to graze cows but was denied of being a girl. So, she disguised herself in a boy because of her resemblance to Subala-sakha, She put on his dhoti and garments and joined Krishna for cow herding along with her companions for funs. The festival is celebrated on the eighth day in the bright half of Karthik month.\n\nGo-puja is done on this day. Devotees visit the gosala, bathe and clean the cows and the gosala. Cows are decorated with cloth and jewellery before offering special ritual by the devotees. Special fodders are fed for good health and special drive is organized for its preservation. On this day, Sri Krishna puja and cow Puja is performed along with pradakshina to acquire blessing for a good and happier life. Devotees also pay special respect to cows for its utilities in daily life. Cows provide milk that helps in fulfilling the nutritional requirement of the people like a mother. This is why cows are held sacred and worshipped in Hindu religion as a mother. The glories of the cow and her protection are discussed by senior devotees.

{"id": "8794766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8794766", "title": "Hell Money", "text": "Hell Money\n\n\"Hell Money\" is the nineteenth episode of the third season of the science fiction television series \"The X-Files\" and 68th episode overall. It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 1996. It was written by Jeffrey Vlaming and directed by Tucker Gates. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Hell Money\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.9, being watched by 14.86 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly mixed to positive reviews from television critics.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a murder in San Francisco's Chinatown involving masked intruders, strange Chinese symbols, a lottery, and the clandestine selling of body parts.\n\nThe premise of the episode was based on three major ideas: a pyramid scheme involving body parts, a lottery in a small town, and the corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. The episode's writer, Vlaming, developed the latter two ideas and series creator Chris Carter merged all three ideas in the finalized script. The episode contained several elaborate special effects shots, most notably the scene wherein a frog bursts out of a victim's chest, which was created by using molds to create a fake human torso that was then placed over an actor.\n\nIn San Francisco's Chinatown, a Chinese immigrant, Johnny Lo, makes his way to his apartment. There, he is confronted by someone telling him to \"pay the price\", and is overtaken by three figures wearing \"shigong\" masks. A security guard later finds the three figures near a crematory oven, in which Lo is being burned alive.\n\nFox Mulder and Dana Scully investigate Lo's death, the latest in a series of fatal incinerations in Chinatown; Mulder believes that ghost activity is behind the deaths, while Scully suspects a cult. The agents collaborate with Glen Chao (BD Wong), a Chinese-American detective with the SFPD. When they find a Chinese character written inside the oven, Chao translates it as meaning \"ghost.\" Mulder also finds a scrap of burned paper in the ashes, which Chao identifies as \"hell money\", a symbolic offering to deceased spirits. The agents locate Lo's apartment, where they find his collection of charms, as well as bloodstains underneath the recently installed carpet.\n\nMeanwhile, another immigrant, Hsin, tends to his leukemia-stricken daughter, Kim (Lucy Liu). To pay for her treatments, Hsin attends an underground lottery in which participants either win money or lose an organ, depending on tiles chosen from a pair of vases. One man wins the lottery but selects a bad tile, and his body is found later that day. Scully performs an autopsy and finds that he had been selling body parts, noticing his numerous surgical scars. The agents question Chao, who claims that the local community maintains a code of silence and does not reveal anything, even to him.\n\nChao finds information that leads them to Hsin, who installed the carpet in Lo's apartment. Hsin has a bandage over his eye, having lost it to the lottery earlier. Returning to his home, Chao is confronted by the three masked figures. Scully is informed about the attack on Chao and his admittance in the hospital, the agents then go to see him at the hospital. Meanwhile, Hsin is visited by the Hard Faced Man (James Hong), one of the proprietors of the lottery. Hsin tells the man that he wants to end his participation, to which the man replies that the rules cannot be broken and warns him that the ghostly fire will consume him if he leaves the lottery. Upon arriving at the hospital, the agents find Chao gone. They trace his blood to that on the carpet in Lo's apartment, finding a match. This causes the agents to visit Hsin, but find only his daughter at his apartment.\n\nHsin wins the lottery, but selects the tile representing his heart. Chao comes in and tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over the table with the vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.\n\n\"Hell Money\" was written by Jeff Vlaming, his last script for the series. The episode was directed by Tucker Gates, making it the first of only two episodes of \"The X-Files\"—the other being the show's fourth season entry \"El Mundo Gira\"—that he directed. The episode features pre-fame Lucy Liu in a guest star role. Liu would later gain prominence as a cast member of the show \"Ally McBeal\" in 1998.\n\nThe premise of the episode evolved from an idea that series creator Chris Carter had about a \"pyramid scheme for body parts\". Writer Jeff Vlaming took this concept and combined it with two other ideas: The first involved \"a lottery in a small town\" and the other concerned a corporate entity controlling the poor in Chinatown. When the initial script for \"Hell Money\" was submitted, Carter streamline the three stories into one. \"Entertainment Weekly\" later noted that \"the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you think it must be based on a true story\", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode would end with Scully being correcta rare occurrence on the show. In the end, however, Mulder is once again vindicated.\n\nExterior scenes for the episode were filmed in Chinatown, Vancouver, while the scenes taking place in a crematorium were shot on a soundstage. Interior shots of the gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver. The production staff created a second balcony in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to tear it down once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place \"for aesthetic reasons\". The vase and tiles used in the episode were created by the show's production department. The scene where a frog pops out of a victim's chest was created by using a live actor pretending to be a corpse, covered with a faux torso. For a close-up shot, the torso itself, which had a discrete access hole in it, was placed on the autopsy table, and an animal wrangler pushed a real frog up through the slit. After filming wrapped up, actors Michael Yama and Lucy Liu were asked to re-record their dialogue, this time affecting Cantonese accents. Their lines were then added over the original footage in post-production.\n\n\"Hell Money\" premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 1996. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.9, with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 9.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. This totaled 14.86 million viewers.\n\nThe episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the episode an A–, calling it \"gorgeously shot\", citing the \"lush, smoky gaming sequences\" in particular. Television Without Pity ranked \"Hell Money\" the eleventh most nightmare-inducing episode of the show noting, \"If there’s one thing you don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) forces you to participate in a haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, whether you like it or not.\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book \"Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen\", rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a \"hard episode to love [but] sincere and purposeful\". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, \"Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant.\"\n\nOther reviews were more mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 5/10, noting \"Overall, this episode attempted to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing the agents to interact with an 'alien' culture. Unfortunately, the structure of the episode gave the audience answers long before the agents discovered them, making the bulk of the episode an exercise. By not taking the theme far enough or deepening the mystery, the writers ultimately fail to reach their goals.\" Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the entry a C+ and wrote that the episode \"was also fairly bold for its time, providing a whole subplot that's mostly told through subtitles [but] it feels like a series of shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup.\" Ultimately, VanDerWerff concluded that, \"the major problem with 'Hell Money' is that it feels, at times, like a backdoor pilot for a new series starring B.D. Wong as corrupt detective Glen Chao.\" Paula Vitaris from \"Cinefantastique\" gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She critiqued the fact that the episode lacked a paranormal mystery, noting that the theme of the episode \"would fit nicely into any other police drama\". Vitaris described the \"three actors in the black suits and ghost masks\" as \"not very convincing.\"\n\nCo-producer Paul Rabwin was not a fan of \"Hell Money\": he believed that the premise was not really an X-File due to the fact that nothing paranormal happened during the episode. He claimed that if Mulder and Scully were removed from the story, it would not have changed anything and that the two were not affected personally by the case.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1690380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1690380", "title": "Jesus Christ Pose", "text": "Jesus Christ Pose\n\n\"Jesus Christ Pose\" is a song by the American rock band Soundgarden, released in 1991 as the first single from the band's third studio album, \"Badmotorfinger\" (1991). The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, \"A-Sides\".\n\n\"Jesus Christ Pose\" features lyrics written by frontman Chris Cornell and music co-written by Cornell, drummer Matt Cameron, bassist Ben Shepherd, and guitarist Kim Thayil. Some see the song as defining the \"essence\" of Soundgarden, as it is credited to all four band members. Cameron said, \"As soon as I played this pattern everyone dove right in, and within an hour we had the guts of the song. The approach we took on this one was pure assault of the senses. Canadians dance to this song.\"\n\nAccording to a Rolling Stone interview, Kim Thayil explained the origin of this song:\n\n\"Jesus Christ Pose\" was performed in drop D tuning and is in 4/4 time. Regarding the song, Thayil said, \"The song's groove reminds me of helicopter blades. I bent the strings at the beginning and end of the song.\"\n\nThe band explained that the lyrics for \"Jesus Christ Pose\" concern the exploitation of religion for personal benefit. The song is a criticism of how public figures use religion (particularly the image of Jesus Christ) to portray themselves as being \"better\" than others, or as \"martyrs\". Chris Cornell specifically mentioned Jane's Addiction's frontman Perry Farrell as an influence on the song, explaining, \"It became fashionable to be the sort of persecuted-deity guy.\" In an interview with Spin magazine in 1992, Cornell explained the term \"Jesus Christ Pose\":\n\"Jesus Christ Pose\" was released as a single in 1991 in various versions with the previously unreleased B-sides \"Stray Cat Blues\" and \"Into the Void (Sealth)\". Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in the United Kingdom.\n\nGreg Prato of AllMusic said, \"In addition to Cornell's biting lyrics and vocals, the rest of the band helped fuel unquestionably one of Soundgarden's most vicious and venomous rockers. Breakneck guitar riffs do battle with sledgehammer drumming for most of the song's five minute and 50 seconds.\" Gina Arnold of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated, \"On songs like the cynical 'Jesus Christ Pose' ... Soundgarden sound a hell of a lot smarter than their peers, who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars.\"\n\nThe song is featured on the soundtrack for the 1994 film, \"S.F.W.\" \"Jesus Christ Pose\" is available as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" series as a master track.\n\nThe music video for \"Jesus Christ Pose\" was directed by Eric Zimmerman, who would later direct the music video for \"Rusty Cage\". The video's intro includes words similar to ; \"And God So Loved Soundgarden He Gave Them His Only Song\". The video features the band members wandering around a desert interspersed with various images of crosses, cyborgs, a crucified girl, a crucified skeleton and even cruciform vegetables crucified in a human form. Thayil said, \"A lot was chosen by the director Eric Zimmerman, and we checked it out and decided what we liked and didn't like.\" Cornell said, \"It was a pretty unanimous decision by the band to have a woman being crucified in the video ... As a visual, it's powerful and it's also challenging to people, because women basically have been persecuted since before recorded history, and it would almost make more sense than seeing a man on it.\" He also added, \"There's upside down crosses and right-side up ones. But there's certainly no blatant direction as far as religious conviction in the video.\"\n\nThayil said that the video was one of the few Soundgarden videos the band was satisfied with. He stated that \"on the \"Jesus Christ Pose\" video we did a lot of experimenting at different kinda fun, cool things. I guess it seems fun to me because I didn't end up getting disappointed by it.\" The video was released in October 1991.\n\n\"Jesus Christ Pose\" garnered attention when MTV banned its corresponding music video in 1991—it has not been shown by the channel in its entirety since. Many listeners were outraged by the song and its video, perceiving it as anti-Christian. The band actually received death threats about it on a UK tour in the early 1990s.\n\nThayil on the \"Jesus Christ Pose\" music video and controversy:\n\nThat was our first single from \"Badmotorfinger\", but it never got any airplay because of the references to Jesus. And MTV wouldn't play the video because they didn't like the idea of a girl on the cross. There are no guitars in the video at all. There's not even a picture of a guitar in the video. It's like this hard, rock-fast, punk-metal video that has no instruments in the whole thing. And it's a six minute video!\n\nCornell stated:\nThe way [MTV's] programming works is like a commercial radio station, the shorter the video, the more videos they can play, and—they figured I guess that in the normal hours people watch videos they're not going to want to watch something for six minutes.\n\nA live performance of \"Jesus Christ Pose\" can be found on the \"Black Hole Sun\" single and the compilation album \"Telephantasm\". A performance of the song is also included on the \"Motorvision\" home video release.\n\nThe Killing Tree performed a cover of \"Jesus Christ Pose\" on the band's 2003 EP, \"We Sing Sin\". A cover of \"Jesus Christ Pose\" was done by the band The Dillinger Escape Plan which was featured on the 2006 cover album, \"\", as well as the band's 2006 EP of cover songs, \"Plagiarism\". Fellow grunge rockers Pearl Jam have jammed to this song live. A version appeared on Kearney Barton's Wheedle's Groove (2009), a collection featuring Funk and Soul acts from Seattle such as Ron Buford, Robbie Hill, Ural Thomas, Pat Wright and the Total Experience Gospel Choir, Overton Berry, Broham, Calvin Law, and Johnny Horn. Montreal Indie Artist, NeeNee Knightly, released an Industrial/Electronica version in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information regarding accolades attributed to \"Jesus Christ Pose\" is adapted in part from Acclaimed Music.\n\n"}

Tiamat gave Kingu the 3 Tablets of Destiny, which he wore as a breastplate and which gave him great power. She placed him as the general of her army.

Sometimes it is spelled kiai. Traditionally, students of Islam in Indonesia would study in a boarding school known as a pesantren. The leader of the school was called kyai, as a form of respect. The traditional word for a teacher in Islam is ustad, which is a Persian word. There are many ustads in Indonesia who teach the religion, but most of them do not have a boarding school.\n\nKiai were educated in various pesantren:\nA student in a pesantren is called a santri. After the founding kyai of a pesantren dies, his son or another santri may take over the supervision of the school, and would then be called kyai. It is possible for a large boarding school to have several kyai living and teaching there. However, most pesantren have a few hundred students, with only one person who is called kyai. The other teachers in the school are called ustadz. Many Indonesian Muslims consider a kyai to be higher ranked than an ustadz because a kyai runs his own boarding school and has mystical abilities.\n\nKiai were distinct from the \"pangulu\", the state officials:\nA kyai is not a cleric in the same way as a priest in Christianity or Buddhism. There is no governing body that ordains or authorizes a kyai. Likewise, no organization can defrock a kyai or remove him from his position. The reason is that a kyai has his position and authority because people will listen to what he says.\n\nSome Indonesians refer to a widely regarded kyai as an ulama. This word is actually the plural form of the Arabic word alim which means knowledgeable person. Through common usage in Indonesia, the word ulama grew to signify a high-level kyai, even though this is a grammatical misuse of the Arabic word.\n\nIn legend, if not in fact, a kyai combines the skills and roles of both the Islamic scholar and the Sufi master (sheikh or syehk). Stories abound about kyai that can perform such feats as:\n\nKyai is also a common honorific for important heirloom items in kratons in Java, like gamelan, chariot, and kris. For example, gamelan used in annual \"Grebeg\" celebration in Yogyakarta is called \"Kyai Sekati\", itself divided into two instrumental sets: \"Kyai Gunturmadu\" and \"Kyai Nagawilaga\". Meanwhile, Yogyakarta's royal chariot of is called \"Kyai Garudayaksa\".\n\nIn some parts of Indonesia, famous students of the Wali Songo mystics are referred to historically as kyai or kiai or ki. One of them, Ki Ageng Gribig, is said to have returned from Mecca with a small kind of pastry which did not spoil during the long journey. To commemorate this feat, the people of Jatinom hold a festival each year, wherein thousands of these little cakes (called apem) are blessed and tossed out to participants. The main road from Klaten to Boyolali in Central Java, which passes through the town of Jatinom, is officially named after Ki Ageng Gribig, though known colloquially as Jalan Boyolali (Boyolali Road).\n"}

Ron Hubbard in 1960. It involves an \"Ethics officer\" probing the thoughts, attitudes and behavior of an individual member by asking them large numbers of questions. The bulk of the questions deal with criminal or sexual activity or intentions, or other things that the interviewee might be ashamed of. The questions also probe negative thoughts that the person might have about Scientology or Hubbard. As with traditional auditing, the subject holds the electrodes of the E-meter, a simple lie-detector device that measures electrical conductivity in the human body, while they are given a series of highly probing, personal questions.\n\nHubbard described security checking as a remedy for \"unreasonable action\", specifically \"the compulsion or obsession to commit actions\" the person feels must be kept secret. Checks are given to all Scientologists on the Bridge to Total Freedom, every six months to all Operating Thetans, according to officials, \"to make sure they're using the tech correctly\", and to members who are leaving staff.\n\nIn a \"Code of Reform\" issued in 1968, Hubbard announced that he was cancelling security checks, along with the policies of Fair Game and Disconnection. However, later Scientology documents refer to the practice, and former members report that it still continues.\n\nSec Checks are also known in the Scientology Justice system as \"Integrity Processing\" or \"Confessional Auditing\".\n\nA security check resembles the confessional in traditional religions. However, it also differs from them in that it is not voluntary. Hubbard told security checkers that \"you are not merely an observer, or an auditor, you are a detective.\"\n\nSusan Raine of the University of Alberta observes that the questions asked in security checks show that L. Ron Hubbard was intensely preoccupied with scrutiny, surveillance and betrayal. She notes that this intense form of surveillance makes sense from a bureaucratic perspective as a way of making sure all individuals follow (and internalize) the organisational goals. Bent Corydon, an ex-Scientologist, compares security checking to the use of thought police in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. He writes that Scientologists are punished for having negative thoughts about Hubbard or Scientology and so learn to think only positively. David Mayo, another former member, reported that sec checks included the question, \"Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?\" and that such \"discreditable thoughts\" could land a follower in trouble.\n\nIn 1972, the South African Commission of Enquiry published a report on Scientology. It recommended that there should be legislation against sec checks. However, no legislative action was taken as a result.\n\nHGC stands for \"Hubbard Guidance Centre\". Sociologist Roy Wallis quotes some questions from this security check dating from 1961.\n\nThe Johannesburg (also known as \"Joburg\") Security Check was described by Hubbard as \"the roughest security check in Scientology\". An amended form continued to be used for some time thereafter.\n\nAmongst Hubbard's list of primarily crime-related questions is the question \"Have you ever slept with a member of a race of another color?\" Other questions include:\n\nThe contents of the Joburg security check were later revised into what became \"The Only Valid Security Check\". Added to the Sec Check are new questions such as:\n\nThis sec check, comprising 170 questions, was meant for staff auditors and field auditors.\n\nDesigned to be applied to children aged 6 to 12.

The procedure runs through 99 questions, such as:\n\nThis long Sec Check, consisting of hundreds of questions, takes stock of the subject's entire time track, including their \"recollections\" of any \"past lives\" they believe they have had. It includes questions such as:\n\nScientology researcher Jon Atack — a critic of Scientology, and himself a former Scientologist — explains in his book \"A Piece of Blue Sky\" that sec checks could be applied either as a \"confidential\" Confessional or as a non-confidential investigation.

Up until the mid-1890s, the LDS Church had proactively supported the People's Party (Utah) and entering politics had been seen as almost a part of several church leader's ecclesiastical responsibilities. Leading up to the issuance of the Manifesto, there was major disagreement about church members entering politics. Utah was transitioning to statehood and to a situation where the two national parties dominated Utah politics, and the church began to adopt a posture of political neutrality.\n\nThe leaders of the church, led by church president Wilford Woodruff, decided to establish a written rule that the general authorities of the church would require the approval of the First Presidency before seeking public office. Apostle Moses Thatcher did not agree with this new rule and in 1896 was removed from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles over the issue. B. H. Roberts, a general authority of the church, resisted the Manifesto at first, but agreed to it in 1896 under threat of being removed from his position.\n\nMore recently, the LDS Church has taken a more stringent rule on political involvement by its leaders. Current policies prohibit general authorities not only from running for office but also from contributing financially to political campaigns. This policy was implemented in 2011.\n\n"}

{"id": "52618246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52618246", "title": "Pompeii Lakshmi", "text": "Pompeii Lakshmi\n\nThe Pompeii Lakshmi is an ivory statuette that was discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, which was destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius 79 CE. She was found by Amedeo Maiuri an Italian scholar in 1938. The statuette has been dated to the first-century A.D. The statuette is thought of representing an Indian goddess of feminine beauty and fertility. It is possible that the sculpture originally formed the handle of a mirror. Lakshmi is a reminder of commercial trade of goods and resources between India and Italy in the first century A.D. Over the years historians have been able to connect Roman trade with the far east specifically India.\n\nOriginally, it was thought that the statuette represented the goddess Lakshmi, a goddess of fertility, beauty and wealth, revered by early Buddhists, Hindus and Jains. However, the iconography reveals that the figure is more likely to depict a \"yakshi\", a female tree spirit that represents fertility, or possibly a syncretic version of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi from an ancient exchange between Classical Greco-Roman and Indian cultures.\n\nThe figure is now in the Secret Museum in the Naples National Archaeological Museum.\n\nThe statuette was discovered in October 1938 beside the Casa dei Quattro stili at Pompeii.\n\nStanding at 0.25 m. high the statuette is nearly naked apart from her narrow girdle and lavish jewels as well as an elaborate coiffure. She has two female attendants, one facing outward on each side, holding cosmetics containers. The statuette has a hole bored down from the top of her head. There is the theory that its purpose may have been a mirror handle.\n\nThe existence of this statuette in Pompeii by 79 CE, when Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the city, testifies to the intensity of Indo-Roman trade relations during the 1st century CE. This statuette has been dated by the Naples National Archaeological Museum as having been created in India in the first half of that century.\n\nThough the origin is not entirely certain, based on archeological finds and historian work, the Pompeii Lakshmi has had a questionable origin. There is evidence of the then active trade routes between the Roman Empire under Emperor Nero and India during this time period. According to Pollard, with the Roman long-distance trade, she is believed to have found herself in the city during the reign of Augustus. The archeological evidence suggests that the height of trade between Roman and India appears to have been the first and second centuries C.E. This trade took place along several routes, both overland as documented by Isidore of Charax’s \"Parthian Stations,\" and by sea as the merchant guide known as the \"Periplus Maris Erythraei\" reveals.\n\nThere is a possibility that the statuette found its way to the west during the rule of Western Satrap Nahapana in the Bhokardan area, and was shipped from the port of Barigaza.\n\nRome played an important part in the Eastern oriental trade of antiquity, they imported many goods from India and at the same time set up their own trading stations in the country. According to Cobb, trading through land routes such as crossing the Arabian Peninsula and Mesopotamia, and through seaborne trade from the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean were used by the Romans.\n\nThe sea routes that utilized the winds of the Indian Ocean was able to create a significant volume of goods to be imported from the East on ships. The wealth of the trade was significant enough for Pliny to claim that 100 million sesterces were being sent annually to India, China, and Arabia. With shipments of nard, ivory, and textiles it is clear from the archaeological evidence, that Roman trade with the East peaked in the first and second centuries A.D.\n\nIt was initially assumed that the statuette had been produced at Mathura, but according to Dhavalikar, it is now thought that its place of production was Bhokardan since two similar figurines were discovered there. Bhodarkan was a part of the Satavahana territory and cultural sphere, although it might have been held for a few decades by the Western Satraps, who may have been the ones who provided an export route to the Roman world.\n\nThere is also an inscriptive mark in Kharosthi at the base of the Pompeii statuette (the letter śi, as the śi in Shiva). This suggests she might have originated from the northwestern regions of India, Pakistan, or Afghanistan, or at least passed through these areas. Since the Pompeii statuette was necessarily made sometime before 79 CE, if it was indeed manufactured in Gandhara, it would suggest that the Begram ivories are also of this early date, in the 1st century CE.\n\nThe statuette is represented in the round, and the center of two other female figures. The legs are turned to its side and one arm bent to hold earrings. She is presumed to only be looked at front the front because the details from the back are very flat. As stated by D’Ancona, the iconography falls into the broad category of female deities in India.\nIn a case of cross-cultural pollination, the theme of the goddess attended by two child attendants, which can be seen in the case of the Pompeii Lakshmi, is an uncommon depiction of Lakshmi or Yashis in Indian art. It lacks the lotus flower found in Lakshmi iconography. According to D'Ancona, the iconography represented in this statuette may have been imported from the Classical world, possibly derived from the iconography of Venus attended by cherubs holding cosmetics containers, which are well known in Greco-Roman art. She may be one of the several representations of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi that appeared in the 1st century CE, states D'Ancona. The Pompeii Lakshmi would therefore be a mixture of Indian and Classical art.\n\n"}
{"id": "367843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367843", "title": "Religion in China", "text": "Religion in China\n\nChina has long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring religio-philosophical traditions of the world. Confucianism and Taoism, later joined by Buddhism, constitute the \"three teachings\" that have shaped Chinese culture. There are no clear boundaries between these intertwined religious systems, which do not claim to be exclusive, and elements of each enrich popular or folk religion. The emperors of China claimed the Mandate of Heaven and participated in Chinese religious practices. In the early 20th century, reform-minded officials and intellectuals attacked all religions as \"superstitious\", and since 1949, China has been governed by the Communist Party of China, an atheist institution that prohibits party members from practising religion while in office. In the culmination of a series of campaigns against religions already underway since the late 19th century, the Cultural Revolution against old habits, ideas, customs and culture, lasting from 1966 to 1967, destroyed or forced them underground. Under following leaders, religious organisations were given more autonomy. The government formally recognises five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism (though the Chinese Catholic Church is independent of the Catholic Church in Rome). In the early twenty-first century there has been increasing official recognition of Confucianism and Chinese folk religion as part of China's cultural inheritance.\n\nFolk or popular religion, the most widespread system of beliefs and practices, has evolved and adapted since at least the Shang and Zhou dynasties in the second millennium BCE. Fundamental elements of a theology and spiritual explanation for the nature of the universe harken back to this period and were further elaborated in the Axial Age. Basically, Chinese religion involves allegiance to the \"shen\", often translated as \"spirits\", defining a variety of gods and immortals. These may be deities of the natural environment or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history. Confucian philosophy and religious practice began their long evolution during the later Zhou; Taoist institutionalised religions developed by the Han dynasty; Chinese Buddhism became widely popular by the Tang dynasty, and in response Confucian thinkers developed Neo-Confucian philosophies; and popular movements of salvation and local cults thrived.\n\nChristianity and Islam arrived in China in the 7th century. Christianity did not take root until it was reintroduced in the 16th century by Jesuit missionaries. In the early 20th century Christian communities grew, but after 1949, foreign missionaries were expelled, and churches brought under government-controlled institutions. After the late 1970s, religious freedoms for Christians improved and new Chinese groups emerged. China is also often considered a home to humanist and secularist, this-worldly thought beginning in the time of Confucius.\n\nBecause many, perhaps most, Han Chinese do not consider their spiritual beliefs and practices to be a \"religion\" and in any case do not feel that they must practise any one of them exclusively, it is difficult to gather clear and reliable statistics. According to scholarly opinion, \"the great majority of China's population of 1.4+ billion\" takes part in Chinese cosmological religion, its rituals and festivals of the lunar calendar, without belonging to any institutional teaching. National surveys conducted in the early 21st century estimated that some 80% of the population of China, that is more than a billion people, practise some kind of Chinese folk religion or Taoism; 10–16% are Buddhists; 2–3% are Christians; and 1–2% are Muslims. Folk religious movements of salvation constitute 2–3% to 13% of the population, while many in the intellectual class adhere to Confucianism as a religious identity. In addition, ethnic minority groups practise distinctive religions, including Tibetan Buddhism, and Islam among the Hui and Uyghur peoples.\n\nPrior to the formation of Chinese civilisation and the spread of world religions in the region known today as East Asia (which includes the territorial boundaries of modern-day China), local tribes shared animistic, shamanic and totemic worldviews. Mediatory individuals such as shamans communicated prayers, sacrifices or offerings directly to the spiritual world, a heritage that survives in some modern forms of Chinese religion.\n\nAncient shamanism is especially connected to ancient Neolithic cultures such as the Hongshan culture. The Flemish philosopher Ulrich Libbrecht traces the origins of some features of Taoism to what Jan Jakob Maria de Groot called \"Wuism\", that is Chinese shamanism.\n\nLibbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of the Chinese theology and religion that continues to this day, traditions derived respectively from the Shang (1600–1046 BCE) and subsequent Zhou dynasties (1046–256 BCE). The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the universe was \"by itself so\", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called \"di\" (帝), \"deities\", and the utmost progenitor was \"Shangdi\" (上帝 \"Highest Deity\"). Shangdi is identified with the dragon, symbol of the unlimited power (\"qi\"), of the \"protean\" primordial power which embodies yin and yang in unity, associated to the constellation Draco which winds around the north ecliptic pole, and slithers between the Little and Big Dipper (or Great Chariot). Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four 方 \"fāng\" (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their 風 \"fēng\" (\"winds\") as his cosmic will.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, was more rooted in an agricultural worldview, and they emphasised a more universal idea of \"Tian\" (天 \"Heaven\"). The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the Mandate of Heaven. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.\n\nJohn C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient Chinese characters for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square, or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor (Little Dipper). Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power.\n\nBy the 6th century BCE the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual cauldrons, and the Zhou ritual system) became \"diffuse\" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Divine right no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian.\n\nBesides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as \"wild\" (野 \"yě\") traditions, or traditions \"outside of the official system\", developed as attempts to access the will of Tian. The population had lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the \"Nine Fields\" (九野 \"Jiǔyě\") and of the \"Yijing\" flourished. Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a \"Hundred Schools of Thought\", each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) appeared in this period of political decadence and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang-Zhou theology, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and human agency, and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of 愛人 \"àirén\", \"loving others\"). As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of meditation that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts. Confucius amended and recodified the classical books inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\".\n\nPhilosophers in the Warring States compiled in the \"Analects\", and formulated the classical metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (一 \"Yī\"), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.\n\nAccording to Zhou Youguang, Confucianism's name in Chinese, basically 儒 \"rú\", originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by Mencius (~372–289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.\n\nThe Qin (221–206 BCE), and especially Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), inherited the philosophical developments of the Warring States period molding them into a universalistic philosophy, cosmology and religion. It was in this period that religious focus shifted to the Earth (地 \"Dì\"), regarded as representative of Heaven's (celestial pole's) power. In the Han period, the philosophical concern was especially the crucial role of the human being on earth, completing the cosmological trinity of Heaven-Earth-humanity (天地人 \"Tiāndìrén\"). Han philosophers conceived the immanent virtue of Tian as working through earth and humanity to complete the 宇宙 \"yǔzhòu\" (\"space-time\").\n\nThe short-lived Qin dynasty, started by Qin Shihuang (247–220 BCE), who reunified the Warring States and was the first Chinese ruler to use the title of \"emperor\", chose Legalism as the state ideology, banning and persecuting all other schools of thought. Confucianism was harshly suppressed, with the burning of Confucian classics and killing of scholars who espoused the Confucian cause. The state ritual of the Qin was indeed similar to that of the following Han dynasty. Qin Shihuang personally held sacrifices to Di at Mount Tai, a site dedicated to the worship of the supreme God since pre-Xia times, and in the suburbs of the capital Xianyang. The emperors of Qin also concentrated the cults of the five forms of God, previously held at different locations, in unified temple complexes.\n\nThe universal religion of the Han, which became connected at an early time with the proto-Taoist Huang–Lao movement, was focused on the idea of the incarnation of God as the Yellow Emperor, the central one of the \"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\" (五方上帝 \"Wǔfāng Shàngdì\"). The idea of the incarnation of God was not new, as already the Shang royal lineage regarded themselves as divine. Their progenitors were \"sons of God\", born by women who \"stepped on the imprinting\" of Di. This was also true for royal ancestors of the early Zhou dynasty. The difference rests upon the fact that the Yellow Emperor was no longer an exclusive ancestor of some royal lineage, but rather a more universal archetype of the human being. The competing factions of the Confucians and the \"fāngshì\" (方士 \"masters of directions\"), regarded as representatives of the ancient religious tradition inherited from previous dynasties, concurred in the formulation of Han state religion, the former pushing for a centralisation of religio-political power around the worship of the God of Heaven by the emperor, while the latter emphasising the multiplicity of the local gods and the theology of the Yellow Emperor. Besides these developments of common Chinese and Confucian state religion, the latter Han dynasty was characterised by new religious phenomena: the emergence of Taoism outside state orthodoxy, the rise of indigenous millenarian religious movements, and the introduction of the foreign religion of Buddhism.\n\nBy the Han dynasty, the universal God of early Shang-Zhou theology had found new expression by the names of \"Tàiyǐ\" (太乙 \"Great Oneness\"), \"Supreme Oneness of the Central Yellow\" (中黄太乙 \"Zhōnghuáng Tàiyǐ\"), or the \"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper (i.e. Ursa Major)\" (黄神北斗 \"Huángshén Běidǒu\"), other than by names inherited from the previous tradition. Although the name \"Taiyi\" became prominent in the Han, it harkens back to the Warring States, as attested in the poem \"The Supreme Oneness Gives Birth to Water\", and possibly to the Shang dynasty as \"Dàyī\" (大一 \"Big Oneness\"), an alternative name for Shangs' (and universe's) greatest ancestor. Han theology focalised on the Yellow Emperor, a culture hero and creator of civility, who, according to a definition in apocryphal texts related to the \"Hétú\" 河圖, \"proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\", is born to \"a daughter of a chthonic deity\", and as such he is \"a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth\".\n\nIn the myth, the Yellow Emperor was conceived by a virgin mother, Fubao, who was impregnated by Taiyi's radiance (\"yuanqi\", \"primordial pneuma\") from the Big Dipper after she gazed at it. Through his human side, he was a descendant of 有熊氏 \"Yǒuxióng\", the lineage of the Bear (another reference to the Ursa Major). Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in Siberia or in north Asia.\n\nIn latter Han-dynasty description of the cosmology of the five forms of God by Sima Qian, it is important that the Yellow Emperor was portrayed as the grandfather of the Black Emperor (黑帝 \"Hēidì\") of the north who personifies as well the pole stars, and as the tamer of the Flaming Emperor (炎帝 \"Yándì\", otherwise known as the \"Red Emperor\"), his half-brother, who is the spirit of the southern Chinese populations known collectively as Chu in the Zhou dynasty.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han (142–87 BCE), under the influence of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (who incorporated into Confucianism the man-focused developments of the common religion, formulating the doctrine of the \"Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind\"), and of prominent \"fangshi\", officially integrated the Confucian state religion and ritual inherited from the erstwhile dynasties with the theology of Taiyi, while outside the state religion the Yellow God was the focus of Huang-Lao religious movements which influenced the primitive Taoist Church. Before the Confucian turn of Emperor Wu and after him, the early and latter Han dynasty had Huang-Lao as the state doctrine under various emperors; in Huang-Lao, the philosopher-god Laozi was identified as the Yellow Emperor and received imperial sacrifices, for instance by Emperor Huan (146-168).\n\nThe latter Han dynasty (25–220 CE) struggled with both internal instability and menace by non-Chinese peoples from the outer edges of the empire. Prospects for a better personal life and salvation appealed to the masses who were periodically hit by natural disasters and galvanised by uprisings organised by self-proclaimed \"kings\" and \"heirs\". In such harsh conditions, while the imperial cult continued the sacrifices to the cosmological gods, common people estranged from the rationalism of the state religion found solace in enlightened masters and in reviving and perpetuating more or less abandoned cults of national, regional and local divinities that better represented indigenous identities. The Han state religion itself was \"ethnicised\" by associating the cosmological deities to regional populations.\n\nBy the end of the dynasty (206 BCE–8 CE) the earliest record of a mass religious movement attests the excitement provoked by the belief in the imminent advent of the Queen Mother of the West (西王母 \"Xīwángmǔ\") in the northeastern provinces (then Henan, Hebei and Shandong) in the first half of the year 3 BCE. Though the soteriological movement included improper and possibly reprehensive collective behavior, it was not crushed by the government. Indeed, from the elites' point of view, the movement was connected to a series of abnormal cosmic phenomena seen as characteristic of an excess of 阴 \"yīn\" (femininity, sinister, reabsorption of the order of nature).\n\nBetween 184 and 205 CE, the Way of the Supreme Peace (太平道 \"Tàipíngdào\") in the Central Plains, the earliest attested popular Taoist religious-military movement led by members of the Zhang lineage—prominently Zhang Jue and Zhang Liu, among leaders from other families—, organised the so-called Yellow Turban Rebellion against the Han dynasty. Later Taoist religious movements flourished in the Han state of Shu (modern Sichuan). A 巫 \"wū\" (shaman) of the Supreme Peace named Zhang Xiu was known to have led a group of followers from Shu into the uprising of the year 184. In 191 he reappeared as a military official in the province, together with the apparently unrelated Zhang Lu. During a military mission in Hanning (modern southwest Shaanxi), Xiu either died in battle or was killed by Lu himself, who incorporated Xiu's followers and seized the city, which he renamed Hanzhong. A characteristic of the territory governed by Lu was its significant non-Chinese population. Between 143 and 198, starting with the grandfather Zhang Daoling and culminating with Zhang Lu, the Zhang lineage had been organising the territory into dioceses or parishes, establishing a Taoist theocracy, the early Celestial Masters' Church (in Chinese variously called 五斗米道 \"Wǔdǒumǐdào\", \"Way of the Five Pecks of Rice\", and later 天师道 \"Tiānshīdào\", \"Way of the Celestial Masters\", or 正一道 \"Zhèngyīdào\", \"Way of the Orthodox Unity\"). Zhang Lu died in 216 or 217, and between 215 and 219 the people of Hanzhong were gradually dispersed northwards, implanting Celestial Masters' Taoism in other parts of the empire.\n\nBuddhism was introduced during the latter Han dynasty, and first mentioned in 65 CE. Liu Ying, a half brother of Emperor Ming of Han (57–75 CE) was one of the earliest Chinese adherents, at a time when the imported religion interacted with Huang-Lao proto-Taoism. China's earliest known Buddhist temple, the White Horse Temple, was established outside the walls of the capital Luoyang during Emperor Ming's reign.\n\nBuddhism entered China via the Silk Road, transmitted by the Buddhist populations who inhabited the Western Regions (modern Xinjiang), then Indo-Europeans (predominantly Tocharians and Saka). It began to grow to become a significant influence in China proper only after the fall of the Han dynasty, in the period of political division. When Buddhism had become an established religion it began to compete with Chinese indigenous religion and Taoist movements, deprecatorily designated as Ways of Demons (鬼道 \"Guǐdào\") in Buddhist polemical literature.\n\nAfter the fall of the Han dynasty, a period of disunity defined as the \"Six Dynasties\" began. After the first stage of the Three Kingdoms (220–280), China was partially unified under the Jin dynasty (265–420), while much of the north was governed by sixteen independent states. The fall of the Han capital Luoyang to the Xiongnu in 311 led the royal court and Celestial Masters' clerics to migrate southwards. Jiangnan became the epicenter of the \"southern tradition\" of Celestial Masters' Taoism, which developed characteristic features, among which a meditation technique known as \"guarding the One\" (\"shouyi\"), that is visualising the unity God in the human organism.\n\nRepresentatives of Jiangnan's indigenous religions responded to the spread of Celestial Masters' Taoism by reformulating their own traditions according to the imported religion. This led to the foundation of two new Taoist schools, with their own scriptural and ritual bodies: Shangqing Taoism (上清派 \"Shàngqīngpài\", \"Highest Clarity school\"), based on revelations that occurred between 364 and 370 in modern-day Nanjing, and Lingbao Taoism (灵宝派 \"Língbǎopài\", \"Numinous Gem school\"), based on revelations of the years between 397 and 402 and recodified later by Lu Xiujing (406-77). Lingbao incorporated from Buddhism the ideas of \"universal salvation\" and ranked \"heavens\", and focused on communal rituals.\n\nBuddhism brought a model of afterlife to Chinese people and had a deep influence on Chinese culture. The story \"Mulian Rescues His Mother\", for instance, is a parable dated back to the 3rd century, which adapts an originally Buddhist fable to show Confucian values of filial piety. In the story, a virtuous monk descends into hell to rescue his mother, who had been condemned for her transgressions.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty (618–907) the concept of \"Tian\" became more common at the expense of \"Di\", continuing a tendency that started in the Han dynasty. Both also expanded their meanings, with \"di\" now more frequently used as suffix of a deity's name rather than to refer to the supreme power. \"Tian\", besides, became more associated to its meaning of \"Heaven\" as a paradise or the hierarchy of physical skies. The proliferation of foreign religions in the Tang, especially Buddhist sects, entailed that each of them conceived their own ideal \"Heaven\". \"Tian\" itself started to be used, linguistically, as an affix in composite names to mean \"heavenly\" or \"divine\". This was also the case in the Buddhist context, with many monasteries' names containing this element.\n\nUnder the influence of foreign cultures and thought systems, new concepts to refer to the supreme God were formulated, such as \"Tiānzhōngtiān\" (天中天 \"God of the Gods\"), seemingly introduced by Yuezhi Buddhist missionaries to render the Sanskrit \"Devātideva\" (of the same meaning) or \"Bhagavān\" from their Iranian sources.\n\nBoth Buddhism and Taoism developed hierarchic pantheons which merged metaphysical (celestial) and physical (terrestrial) being, blurring the edge between the human and the divine, which reinforced the religious belief that gods and devotees sustain one another.\n\nThe principle of reciprocity between the human and the divine, which was strengthened during the Tang dynasty, led to changes in the pantheon that reflected changes in the society. The late Tang dynasty saw the spread of the cult of the City Gods in direct bond to the development of the cities as centres of commerce and the rise in influence of merchant classes. Commercial travel opened China to influences from foreign cultures.\n\nThe City God is a protector of the boundaries of a city and of its internal and economic affairs, such as trade and elections of politicians. In each city, the respective City God is embodied by one or more historical personages, native of the city itself, who distinguished themselves by extraordinary attainments. Scholar Valerie Hansen argues that the City God is not a homegrown cult, but has its prototype in the Indian \"Vaiśravaṇa\" as a guardian deity.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Jesuit China missions played a significant role in opening dialogue between China and the West. The Jesuits brought Western sciences, becoming advisers to the imperial court on astronomy, taught mathematics and mechanics, but also adapted Chinese religious ideas such as admiration for Confucius and ancestor veneration into the religious doctrine they taught in China.\n\nFounded by Manchu rulers, the Qing dynasty (1636–1912) promoted the teachings of Confucius as the textual tradition superior to all others. The Qing made their laws more severely patriarchal than any previous dynasty, and Buddhism and Taoism were downgraded. Despite this, Tibetan Buddhism began in this period to have significant presence in China, with Tibetan influence in the west, and with the Mongols and Manchus in the north.\n\nLater, many folk religious and institutional religious temples were destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1871). It was organised by Christian movements which established a separate state in south-east China against the Qing dynasty. In the Christian-inspired Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, official policies pursued the elimination of Chinese religions to substitute them with forms of Christianity. In this effort, the libraries of the Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, almost completely in the Yangtze River Delta.\n\nAs a reaction, the Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the century (1899–1901) would have been inspired by indigenous Chinese movements against the influence of Christian missionaries—\"devils\" as they were called by the Boxers—and Western colonialism. At that time China was being gradually invaded by European and American powers, and since 1860 Christian missionaries had had the right to build or rent premises, and they appropriated many temples. Churches with their high steeples and foreigners' infrastructures, factories and mines were viewed as disrupting \"feng shui\" (\"wind–water\" cosmic balance) and caused \"tremendous offence\" to the Chinese. The Boxers' action was aimed at sabotaging or outrightly destroying these infrastructures.\n\nChina entered the 20th century under the Manchu Qing dynasty, whose rulers favoured traditional Chinese religions, and participated in public religious ceremonies, with state pomp, as at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, where prayers for the harvest were offered. Tibetan Buddhists recognised the Dalai Lama as their spiritual and temporal leader. Popular cults were regulated by imperial policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing others. During the anti-foreign and anti-Christian Boxer Uprising of 1900, thousands of Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries were killed, but in the aftermath of the retaliatory invasion, numbers of reform-minded Chinese turned to Christianity. Between 1898 and 1904 the imperial government issued a measure to \"build schools with temple property\" (庙产兴学 \"miàochǎn xīngxué\").\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1911, with increasing urbanisation and Western influence, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer the worship of heterodox gods as it was the case in imperial times, but the delegitimisation of religion itself, and especially folk religion, as an obstacle to modernisation. Leaders of the New Culture Movement (1916–1923) debated whether religion was cosmopolitan spirituality or irrational superstition, and the Anti-Christian Movement of 1923 was part of a rejection of Christianity as an instrument of foreign imperialism.\n\nThe Guomindang-governed Republic of China (1912–49) intensified the suppression of local religion. Temples were widely appropriated, destroyed, or used for schools. The 1928 \"Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines\" formally abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius. Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China, and his successor Chiang Kai-shek, were both Christians. During the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945 many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.\n\nThe People's Republic of China, proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of Mao Zedong, established a policy of state atheism. Initially, the new government did not suppress religious practice, but, like its dynastic ancestors, viewed popular religious movements, especially in the countryside, as possibly seditious. The government condemned religious organisations, labeling them as superstitious. Religions that were deemed \"appropriate\" and given freedom were those that entailed the ancestral tradition of consolidated state rule. In addition, Marxism viewed religion as feudal. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement institutionalised Protestant churches in official organisations that renounced foreign funding and foreign control as imperialist. Chinese Catholics resisted the new government's move towards state control and independence from the Vatican. Later onwards, the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) involved a systematic effort to destroy religion. The historian Arthur Waldron explains that \"communism was, in effect, a religion for its early Chinese converts: more than a sociological analysis, it was a revelation and a prophecy that engaged their entire beings and was expounded in sacred texts, many imported from Moscow and often printed in English\".\n\nThe radical policy relaxed considerably in the late 1970s. Since 1978, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees \"freedom of religion\". Its article 36 states that:\n\nFor several decades, the party acquiesced or even encouraged a religious revival. Most Chinese were allowed to worship as they felt best. Although \"spiritual practices\" such as the Falun Gong were banned and practitioners have been persecuted since 1999, local authorities were likely to follow a hands-off policy towards other religions. In the late 20th century there was a reactivation of the state cults devoted to the Yellow Emperor and the Red Emperor. In the early 2000s, the Chinese government became open especially to traditional religions such as Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism and folk religion, emphasising the role of religion in building a \"Harmonious Society\" (\"hexie shehui\"), a Confucian idea. China hosted religious meetings and conferences including the first World Buddhist Forum in 2006 and the subsequent World Buddhist Forums, a number of international Taoist meetings and local conferences on folk religions. Aligning with Chinese anthropologists' emphasis on \"religious culture\", the government considers these religions as integral expressions of national \"Chinese culture\".\n\nA turning point was reached in 2005, when folk religious cults began to be protected and promoted under the policies of intangible cultural heritage. Not only were traditions that had been interrupted for decades resumed, but ceremonies forgotten for centuries were reinvented. The annual worship of the god Cáncóng of the ancient state of Shu, for instance, was resumed at a ceremonial complex near the Sanxingdui archaeological site in Sichuan. New deities have emerged, including Chēshén (车神), the god protecting motor vehicles, and modern Chinese political leaders have been deified into the common Chinese pantheon.\n\nIn 2012 Xi Jinping was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. During his early political career in the 1980s, Xi was the secretary of Zhengding County in Hebei, where he allied himself with Chan master Youming and helped the reconstruction of the county's Buddhist temples, explicitly expressing interest towards Buddhism. Once he became president of China, fighting moral void and corruption through a return to traditional culture became the primary tasks of the new government. The government's project also involved restricting Christian churches, which resulted in some removals of crosses from steeples and churches' demolition. At least one prominent pastor who protested was arrested on charges of misusing church funds. A lawyer who had counselled these churches appeared on state television to confess that he had been in collusion with American organisations to incite local Christians.\n\nAndré Laliberté noted that despite there having been much talk about \"persecution against religion (especially Christianity) in China\", one should not jump to hasty conclusions, since \"a large proportion of the population worship, pray, perform rituals and hold certain beliefs with the full support of the Party. Most of this activity affects people who subscribe to world views that are sometimes formally acknowledged by the state and are institutionalised, or others that are tacitly approved as customs\". In this context, Christianity not only represents a small proportion of the population, but its adherents are still seen by the majority who observe traditional rituals as followers of a foreign religion that sets them apart from the body of society.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in September 2018 that \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982.\", which has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".\n\nCounting the number of religious people anywhere is hard; counting them in China is even harder. Low response rates, non-random samples, and adverse political and cultural climates are persistent problems. One scholar concludes that statistics on religious believers in China \"cannot be accurate in a real scientific sense\", since definitions of \"religion\" exclude people who do not see themselves as members of a religious organisation but are still \"religious\" in their daily actions and fundamental beliefs. The forms of Chinese religious expression tend to be syncretic and following one religion does not necessarily mean the rejection or denial of others. In surveys, few people identify as \"Taoists\" because to most Chinese this term refers to ordained priests of the religion. Traditionally, the Chinese language has not included a term for a lay follower of Taoism, since the concept of being \"Taoist\" in this sense is a new word that derives from the Western concept of \"religion\" as membership in a church institution.\n\nAnalysing Chinese traditional religions is further complicated by discrepancies between the terminologies used in Chinese and Western languages. While in the English current usage \"folk religion\" means broadly all forms of common cults of gods and ancestors, in Chinese usage and in academia these cults have not had an overarching name. By \"folk religion\" (民間宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\") or \"folk beliefs\" (民間信仰 \"mínjiān xìnyǎng\") Chinese scholars have usually meant folk religious organisations and salvationist movements (folk religious sects). Furthermore, in the 1990s some of these organisations began to register as branches of the official Taoist Association and therefore to fall under the label of \"Taoism\". In order to address this terminological confusion, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed the legal recognition and management of the indigenous religion by the state and to adopt the label \"Chinese native (or indigenous) religion\" (民俗宗教 \"mínsú zōngjiào\") or \"Chinese ethnic religion\" (民族宗教 \"mínzú zōngjiào\"), or other names.\n\nThere has been much speculation by some Western authors about the number of Christians in China. Chris White, in a 2017 work for the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity of the Max Planck Society, criticises the data and narratives put forward by these authors. He notices that these authors work in the wake of a \"Western evangelical bias\" reflected in the coverage carried forward by popular media, especially in the United States, which rely upon a \"considerable romanticisation\" of Chinese Christians. Their data are mostly ungrounded or manipulated through undue interpretations, as \"survey results do not support the authors' assertions\".\n\n\nBesides the surveys based on fieldwork, estimates using projections have been published by the Pew Research Center as part of its study of the \"Global Religious Landscape\" in 2010. This study estimated 21.9% of the population of China believed in folk religions, 18.2% were Buddhists, 5.1% were Christians, 1.8% were Muslims, 0.8% believed in other religions, while unaffiliated people constituted 52.2% of the population. According to the surveys by Phil Zuckerman published on Adherents.com, 59% of the Chinese population was not religious in 1993, and in 2005 between 8% and 14% was atheist (from over 100 to 180 million). A survey held in 2012 by WIN/GIA found that in China the atheists comprise 47% of the population.\n\nYu Tao's survey of the year 2008 provided a detailed analysis of the social characteristics of the religious communities. It found that the proportion of male believers was higher than the average among folk religious people, Taoists, and Catholics, while it was lower than the average among Protestants. The Buddhist community shew a greater balance of male and female believers. Concerning the age of believers, folk religious people and Catholics tended to be younger than the average, while Protestant and Taoist communities were composed by older people. The Christian community was more likely than other religions to have members belonging to the ethnic minorities. The study analysed the proportion of believers that were at the same time members of the local section of the Communist Party of China, finding that it was exceptionally high among the Taoists, while the lowest proportion was found among the Protestants. About education and wealth, the survey found that the wealthiest populations were those of Buddhists and especially Catholics, while the poorest was that of the Protestants; Taoists and Catholics were the better educated, while the Protestants were the less educated among the religious communities. These findings confirmed a description by Francis Ching-Wah Yip that the Protestant population was predominantly composed of rural people, illiterate and semi-illiterate people, elderly people, and women, already in the 1990s and early 2000s. A 2017 study of the Christian communities of Wuhan found the same socio-econimic characteristics, with the addition that Christians were more likely to suffer from physical and mental illness than the general population.\n\nThe China Family Panel Studies' findings for 2012 shew that Buddhists tended to be younger and better educated, while Christians were older and more likely to be illiterate. Furthermore, Buddhists were generally wealthy, while Christians most often belonged to the poorest parts of the population. Henan was found hosting the largest percentage of Christians of any province of China, about 6%. According to Ji Zhe, Chan Buddhism and individual, non-institutional forms of folk religiosity are particularly successful among the contemporary Chinese youth.\n\nThe varieties of Chinese religion are spread across the map of China in different degrees. Southern provinces have experienced the most evident revival of Chinese folk religion, although it is present all over China in a great variety of forms, intertwined with Taoism, \"fashi\" orders, Confucianism, Nuo rituals, shamanism and other religious currents. Quanzhen Taoism is mostly present in the north, while Sichuan is the area where Tianshi Taoism developed and the early Celestial Masters had their main seat. Along the southeastern coast, Taoism reportedly dominates the ritual activity of popular religion, both in registered and unregistered forms (Zhengyi Taoism and unrecognised \"fashi\" orders). Since the 1990s, Taoism has been well-developed in the area.\n\nMany scholars see \"north Chinese religion\" as distinct from practices in the south. The folk religion of southern and southeastern provinces is primarily focused on the lineages and their churches (\"zōngzú xiéhuì\" 宗族协会) and the worship of ancestor-gods. The folk religion of central-northern China (North China Plain), otherwise, is focused on the communal worship of tutelary deities of creation and nature as identitary symbols, by villages populated by families of different surnames, structured into \"communities of the god(s)\" (\"shénshè\" 神社, or \"huì\" 会, \"association\"), which organise temple ceremonies (\"miaohui\" 庙会), involving processions and pilgrimages, and led by indigenous ritual masters (\"fashi\") who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority. Northern and southern folk religions also have a different pantheon, of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of Chinese mythology.\n\nFolk religious movements of salvation have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern popular religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the great importance given to mother goddess worship and shamanism, as well as their scriptural transmission. Also Confucian churches and \"jiaohua\" organisations have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of Manchuria and contemporary Shandong has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups.\n\nGoossaert talks of this distinction, although recognising it as an oversimplification, between a \"Taoist south\" and a \"village-religion/Confucian centre-north\", with the northern context also characterised by important orders of \"folk Taoist\" ritual masters, one order being that of the 阴阳生 \"yīnyángshēng\", and sectarian traditions, and also by a low influence of Buddhism and official Taoism.\n\nThe folk religion of northeast China (Manchuria) has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with Tungus and Manchu shamanisms; these include the practice of \"chūmǎxiān\" (出马仙 \"riding for the immortals\"), the worship of Fox Gods and other zoomorphic deities, and of the Great Lord of the Three Foxes (胡三太爷 \"Húsān Tàiyé\") and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (胡三太奶 \"Húsān Tàinǎi\") usually positioned at the head of pantheons. Otherwise, in the religious context of Inner Mongolia there has been a significant integration of Han Chinese into the traditional folk religion of the region.\n\nAcross China, Han religion has even adopted deities from Tibetan folk religion, especially wealth gods. In Tibet, across broader western China, and in Inner Mongolia, there has been a growth of the cult of Gesar with the explicit support of the Chinese government, Gesar being a cross-ethnic Han-Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity—the Han identify him as an aspect of the god of war analogically with Guandi—and culture hero whose mythology is embodied in a culturally important epic poem.\n\nThe Han Chinese schools of Buddhism are mostly practised in the eastern part of the country. On the other hand, Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in Tibet, and significantly present in other westernmost provinces where ethnic Tibetans constitute a significant part of the population, and has a strong influence in Inner Mongolia in the north. The Tibetan tradition has also been gaining a growing influence among the Han Chinese.\n\nChristians are especially concentrated in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. The latter two provinces were in the area affected by the Taiping Rebellion, and Zhejiang along with Henan were hubs of the intense Protestant missionary activity in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIslam is the majority religion in areas inhabited by the Hui Muslims, particularly the province of Ningxia, and in the province of Xinjiang that is inhabited by the Uyghurs. Many ethnic minority groups in China follow their own traditional ethnic religions: Benzhuism of the Bai, Bimoism of the Yi, Bön of the Tibetans, Dongbaism of the Nakhi, Miao folk religion, Qiang folk religion, Yao folk religion, Zhuang folk religion, Mongolian shamanism or Tengerism, and Manchu shamanism among Manchus.\n\nHan Chinese culture embodies a concept of religion that differs from the one that is common in the Abrahamic traditions, which are based on the belief in an omnipotent God who exists outside the world and human race and has complete power over them. Chinese religions, in general, do not place as much emphasis as Christianity does on exclusivity and doctrine.\n\nHan Chinese culture is marked by a \"harmonious holism\" in which religious expression is syncretic and religious systems encompass elements that grow, change, and transform but remain within an organic whole. The performance of rites (礼 \"lǐ\") is the key characteristic of common Chinese religion, which scholars see as going back to Neolithic times. According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centring\" (央 \"yāng\" or 中 \"zhōng\"). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.\n\nThis primordial sense of ritual united the moral and the religious and drew no boundaries between family, social, and political life. From earliest times, the Chinese tended to be all-embracing rather than to treat different religious traditions as separate and independent. The scholar Xinzhong Yao argues that the term \"Chinese religion\", therefore, does not imply that there is only one religious system, but that the \"different ways of believing and practicing... are rooted in and can be defined by culturally common themes and features\", and that \"different religious streams and strands have formed a culturally unitary single tradition\" in which basic concepts and practices are related.\n\nThe continuity of Chinese civilisation across thousands of years and thousands of square miles is made possible through China's religious traditions understood as systems of knowledge transmission. A worthy Chinese is supposed to remember a vast amount of information from the past, and to draw on this past to form his moral reasoning. The remembrance of the past and of ancestors is important for individuals and groups. The identities of descent-based groups are molded by stories, written genealogies (\"zupu\", \"books of ancestors\"), temple activities, and village theatre which link them to history.\n\nThis reliance on group memory is the foundation of the Chinese practice of ancestor worship (拜祖 \"bàizǔ\" or 敬祖 \"jìngzǔ\") which dates back to prehistory, and is the focal aspect of Chinese religion. Defined as \"the essential religion of the Chinese\", ancestor worship is the means of memory and therefore of the cultural vitality of the entire Chinese civilisation. Rites, symbols, objects and ideas construct and transmit group and individual identities. Rituals and sacrifices are employed not only to seek blessing from the ancestors, but also to create a communal and educational religious environment in which people are firmly linked with a glorified history. Ancestors are evoked as gods and kept alive in these ceremonies to bring good luck and protect from evil forces and ghosts.\n\nThe two major festivals involving ancestor worship are the Qingming Festival and the Double Ninth Festival, but veneration of ancestors is held in many other ceremonies, including weddings, funerals, and triad initiations. Worshippers generally offer prayers through a \"jingxiang\" rite, with offerings of food, light incense and candles, and burning joss paper. These activities are typically conducted at the site of ancestral graves or tombs, at an ancestral temple, or at a household shrine.\n\nA practice developed in the Chinese folk religion of post-Maoist China, that started in the 1990s from the Confucian temples managed by the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself), is the representation of ancestors in ancestral shrines no longer just through tablets with their names, but through statues. Statuary effigies were previously exclusively used for Buddhist bodhisattva and Taoist gods.\n\nLineage cults of the founders of surnames and kins are religious microcosms which are part of a larger organism, that is the cults of the ancestor-gods of regional and ethnic groups, which in turn are part of a further macrocosm, the cults of virtuous historical figures that have had an important impact in the history of China, notable examples including Confucius, Guandi, or Huangdi, Yandi and Chiyou, the latter three considered ancestor-gods of the Han Chinese (Huangdi and Yandi) and of western minority ethnicities and foreigners (Chiyou). This hierarchy proceeds up to the gods of the cosmos, the Earth and Heaven itself. In other words, ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society, and are therefore the means connecting back to Heaven as the \"utmost ancestral father\" (曾祖父 \"zēngzǔfù\").\n\n\"Tian\" 天 (\"Heaven\" or \"Sky\") is the idea of absolute principle or God manifesting as the northern culmen and starry vault of the skies in Chinese common religion and philosophy. Various interpretations have been elaborated by Confucians, Taoists, and other schools of thought. A popular representation of Heaven is the Jade Deity (玉帝 \"Yùdì\") or Jade Emperor (玉皇 \"Yùhuáng\"). Tian is defined in many ways, with many names, other well-known ones being \"Tàidì\" 太帝 (the \"Great Deity\") and \"Shàngdì\" 上帝 (the \"Highest Deity\") or simply \"Dì\" 帝 (\"Deity\"). \"Tengri\" is the equivalent of Tian in Altaic shamanic religions. By the words of Stephan Feuchtwang, in Chinese cosmology \"the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy\" (\"hundun\" 混沌 and \"qi\"), organising as the polarity of yin and yang which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation \"ex nihilo\". Yin and yang are the invisible and the visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order).\n\nWhile Confucian theology emphasises the need to realise the starry order of the Heaven in human society, Taoist theology emphasises the \"Tao\" 道 (\"Way\"), which in one word denotes both the source and its spontaneous arising in nature. In the Confucian text \"On Rectification\" (\"Zheng lun\") of the \"Xunzi\", the God of Heaven is discussed as an active power setting in motion creation. In the tradition of New Text Confucianism, Confucius is regarded as a \"throne-less king\" of the God of Heaven and a savior of the world. Otherwise, the school of the Old Texts regards Confucius as a sage who gave a new interpretation to the tradition from previous great dynasties. Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200) developed the idea of \"Lǐ\" 理, the \"reason\", \"order\" of Heaven, which unfolds in the polarity of yin and yang. In Taoist theology, the God of Heaven is discussed as the Jade Purity (玉清 \"Yùqīng\"), the \"Heavenly Honourable of the First Beginning\" (元始天尊 \"Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn\"), the central of the Three Pure Ones—who represent the centre of the universe and its two modalities of manifestation. Even Chinese Buddhism adapted to common Chinese cosmology by paralleling its concept of a triune supreme with Shakyamuni, Amithaba and Maitreya representing respectively enlightenment, salvation and post-apocalyptic paradise, while the Tathātā (真如 \"zhēnrú\", \"suchness\") is generally identified as the supreme being itself.\n\nIn Chinese religion, Tian is both transcendent and immanent, inherent in the multiple phenomena of nature (polytheism or cosmotheism, \"yǔzhòu shénlùn\" 宇宙神论). The \"shén\" 神, as explained in the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", \"are the spirits of Heaven. They draw out the ten thousand things\". \"Shen\" and ancestors (祖 \"zǔ\") are agents who generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the order of Heaven. \"Shen\", as defined by the scholar Stephen Teiser, is a term that needs to be translated into English in at least three different ways, according to the context: \"spirit\", \"spirits\", and \"spiritual\". The first, \"spirit\", is in the sense of \"human spirit\" or \"psyche\". The second use is \"spirits\" or \"gods\"—the latter written in lowercase because \"Chinese spirits and gods need not be seen as all-powerful, transcendent, or creators of the world\". These \"spirits\" are associated with stars, mountains, and streams and directly influence what happens in the natural and human world. A thing or being is \"spiritual\"—the third sense of \"shen\"—when it inspires awe or wonder.\n\n\"Shen\" are opposed in several ways to \"guǐ\" 鬼 (\"ghosts\", or \"demons\"). \"Shen\" are considered \"yáng\" 阴, while \"gui\" are \"yīn\" 阴. \"Gui\" may be the spirit or soul of an ancestor called back to live in the family's spirit tablet. Yet the combination 鬼神 \"guǐshén\" (\"ghosts and spirits\") includes both good and bad, those that are lucky or unlucky, benevolent or malevolent, the heavenly ad the demonic aspect of living beings. This duality of \"guishen\" animates all beings, whether rocks, trees, and planets, or animals and human beings. In this sense, \"animism\" may be said to characterise the Chinese worldview. Further, since humans, \"shen\", and \"gui\" are all made of 气 \"qì\" (\"pneuma\" or primordial stuff), there is no gap or barrier between good and bad spirits or between these spirits and human beings. There is no ontological difference between gods and demons, and humans may emulate the gods and join them in the pantheon. If these spirits are neglected or abandoned, or were not treated with death rituals if they were humans, they become hungry and are trapped in places where they met their death, becoming dangerous for living beings and requiring exorcism.\n\nThere was no term that corresponded to \"religion\" in Classical Chinese. The combination of \"zong\" (宗) and \"jiao\" (教), which now corresponds to \"religion\", was in circulation since the Tang dynasty in Chan circles to define the Buddhist doctrine. It was chosen to translate the Western concept \"religion\" only at the end of the 19th century, when Chinese intellectuals adopted the Japanese term \"shūkyō\" (pronounced \"zongjiao\" in Chinese). Under the influence of Western rationalism and later Marxism, what most of the Chinese today mean as \"zōngjiào\" are \"organised doctrines\", that is \"superstructures consisting of superstitions, dogmas, rituals and institutions\". Most academics in China use the term \"religion\" (\"zongjiao\") to include formal institutions, specific beliefs, a clergy, and sacred texts, while Western scholars tend to use the term more loosely.\n\n\"Zōng\" (宗 \"ancestor\", \"model\", \"mode\", \"master\", \"pattern\", but also \"purpose\") implies that the understanding of the ultimate derives from the transformed figure of great ancestors or progenitors, who continue to support—and correspondingly rely on—their descendants, in a mutual exchange of benefit. \"Jiào\" (教 \"teaching\") is connected to filial piety (\"xiao\"), as it implies the transmission of knowledge from the elders to the youth and of support from the youth to the elders.\n\nUnderstanding religion primarily as an ancestral tradition, the Chinese have a relationship with the divine that functions socially, politically as well as spiritually. The Chinese concept of \"religion\" draws the divine near to the human world. Because \"religion\" refers to the bond between the human and the divine, there is always a danger that this bond be broken. However, the term \"zōngjiào\"—instead of separation—emphasises communication, correspondence and mutuality between the ancestor and the descendant, the master and the disciple, and between the Way (Tao, the way of the divine in nature) and its ways. Ancestors are the mediators of Heaven. In other words, to the Chinese, the supreme principle is manifested and embodied by the chief gods of each phenomenon and of each human kin, making the worship of the highest God possible even in each ancestral temple.\n\nChinese concepts of religion differ from concepts in Judaism and Christianity, says scholar Julia Ching, which were \"religions of the fathers\", that is, patriarchal religions, whereas Chinese religion was not only \"a patriarchal religion but also an ancestral religion\". Israel believed in the \"God of its fathers, but not its divinised fathers\". Among the ancient Chinese, the God of the Zhou dynasty appeared to have been an ancestor of the ruling house. \"The belief in Tian (Heaven) as the great ancestral spirit differed from the Judeo-Christian, and later Islamic belief in a creator God\". Early Christianity's Church Fathers pointed out that the First Commandment injunction, \"thou shalt have no other gods before me\", reserved all worship for one God, and that prayers therefore might not be offered \"to\" the dead, even though Judaism, Christianity, and Islam did encourage prayers \"for\" the dead. Unlike the Abrahamic traditions in which living beings are created by God out of nothing, in Chinese religions all living beings descend from beings that existed before. These ancestors are the roots of current and future beings. They continue to live in the lineage which they begot, and are cultivated as models and exemplars by their descendants.\n\nThe mutual support of elders and youth is needed for the continuity of the ancestral tradition, that is communicated from generation to generation. With an understanding of religion as teaching and education, the Chinese have a staunch confidence in the human capacity of transformation and perfection, enlightenment or immortality. In the Chinese religions, humans are confirmed and reconfirmed with the ability to improve themselves, in a positive attitude towards eternity. Hans Küng defined Chinese religions as the \"religions of wisdom\", thereby distinguishing them from the \"religions of prophecy\" (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and from the \"religions of mysticism\" (Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism).\n\nThe cults of gods and ancestors that in recent (originally Western) literature have been classified as \"Chinese popular religion\", traditionally neither have a common name nor are considered \"zōngjiào\" (\"doctrines\"). The lack of an overarching name conceptualising Chinese local and indigenous cults has led to some confusion in the terminology employed in scholarly literature. In Chinese, with the terms usually translated in English as \"folk religion\" (i.e. 民間宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\") or \"folk faith\" (i.e. 民間信仰 \"mínjiān xìnyǎng\") they generally refer to the folk religious movements of salvation, and not to the local and indigenous cults of gods and ancestors. To resolve this issue, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed to formally adopt \"Chinese native religion\" or \"Chinese indigenous religion\" (i.e. 民俗宗教 \"mínsú zōngjiào\"), or \"Chinese ethnic religion\" (i.e. 民族宗教 \"mínzú zōngjiào\"), or even \"Chinese religion\" (中華教 \"Zhōnghuájiào\") and \"Shenxianism\" (神仙教 \"Shénxiānjiào\"), as single names for the local indigenous cults of China.\n\nThe economic dimension of Chinese folk religion is also important. Yang Mayfair (2007) studied how rituals and temples interweave to form networks of grassroots socio-economic capital for the welfare of local communities, fostering the circulation of wealth and its investment in the \"sacred capital\" of temples, gods and ancestors.\n\nThis religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern Taiwan, and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural China, especially the southern and eastern coasts.\n\nAccording to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the reconstruction of patriarchal civilisation:\n\nYang defined it as an \"embedded capitalism\", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an \"ethical capitalism\" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity that foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society. Hao (2017) defined lineage temples as nodes of economic and political power which work through the principle of crowdfunding (\"zhongchou\"):\n\nChinese popular or folk religion, otherwise simply said \"Chinese religion\", is the \"background\" religious tradition of the Chinese, whose practices and beliefs are shared by both the elites and the common people. This tradition includes veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief that a rational order structures the universe, and such order may be influenced by human beings and their rulers. Worship is devoted to gods and immortals (\"shén\" and \"xiān\"), who may be founders of human groups and lineages, deities of stars, earthly phenomena, and of human behaviour.\n\nChinese popular religion is \"diffused\", rather than \"institutional\", in the sense that there are no canonical scriptures or unified clergy—though it relies upon the vast heritage represented by the Chinese classics—, and its practices and beliefs are handed down over the generations through Chinese mythology as told in popular forms of literature, theatre, and visual arts, and are embedded in rituals which define the microcosm of the nuclear families, the kins or lineages (which are peoples within the Chinese people, identified by the same surnames and by the same ancestor-god), and professional guilds, rather than in institutions with merely religious functions. It is a meaning system of social solidarity and identity, which provides the fabric of Chinese society, uniting all its levels from the lineages to the village or city communities, to the state and the national economy.\n\nBecause this common religion is embedded in Chinese social relations, it historically has never had an objectifying name. Since the 2000s, Chinese scholars have proposed names to identify it more clearly, including \"Chinese native religion\" or \"Chinese indigenous religion\" (民俗宗教 \"mínsú zōngjiào\"), \"Chinese ethnic religion\" (民族宗教 \"mínzú zōngjiào\"), or simply \"Chinese religion\" (中華教 \"Zhōnghuájiào\"), \"Shenism\" (神教 \"Shénjiào\") and \"Shenxianism\" (神仙教 \"Shénxiānjiào\", \"religion of deities and immortals\"). This search for a precise name is meant to solve terminological confusion, since \"folk religion\" (民间宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\") or \"folk belief\" (民间信仰 \"mínjiān xìnyǎng\") have historically defined the sectarian movements of salvation and not the local cults devoted to deities and progenitors, and it is also meant to identify a \"national Chinese religion\" similarly to Hinduism in India and Shinto in Japan.\n\nTaoism has been defined by scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper as a doctrinal and liturgical framework for the development of indigenous religions. The Zhengyi school is especially intertwined with local cults, with Zhengyi \"daoshi\" (道士, \"masters of the Tao\", otherwise commonly translated simply the \"Taoists\", since common followers and folk believers who are not part of Taoist orders are not identified as such) performing rituals for local temples and communities. Various vernacular orders of ritual ministers often identified as \"folk Taoists\", operate in folk religion but outside the jurisdiction of the state's Taoist Church or schools clearly identified as Taoist. Confucianism advocates the worship of gods and ancestors through appropriate rites. Folk temples and ancestral shrines, on special occasions, may use Confucian liturgy (儒 \"rú\" or 正统 \"zhèngtǒng\", \"orthoprax\") led by Confucian \"sages of rites\" (礼生 \"lǐshēng\"), who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles. Taoism in its various currents, either comprehended or not within Chinese folk religion, has some of its origins from Chinese shamanism (Wuism).\n\nDespite this great diversity, all experiences of Chinese religion have a common theological core that may be summarised in four cosmological and moral concepts: \"Tian\" (天), Heaven, the \"transcendently immanent\" source of moral meaning; \"qi\" (气), the breath or energy–matter that animates the universe; \"jingzu\" (敬祖), the veneration of ancestors; and \"bao ying\" (报应), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: \"ming yun\" (命运), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and \"yuan fen\" (缘分), \"fateful coincidence\", good and bad chances and potential relationships.\n\nIn Chinese religion yin and yang constitute the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of growth or expansion (\"shen\") and principles of waning or contraction (\"gui\"), with act (\"yang\") usually preferred over receptiveness (\"yin\"). \"Ling\" (numen or sacred) coincides with the middle way between the two states, that is the inchoate order of creation. It is the force establishing responsive communication between yin and yang, and is the power of gods, masters of building and healing, rites and sages.\n\nThe present-day government of China, like the erstwhile imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing, tolerates popular religious cults if they bolster social stability, but suppresses or persecutes cults and deities which threaten moral order. After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate folk religion in order to promote \"modern\" values while overcoming \"feudal superstition\". These attitudes began to change in the late 20th century, and contemporary scholars generally have a positive vision of popular religion.\n\nSince the 1980s Chinese folk religions experienced a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official approval as they preserve traditional Chinese culture, including the worship of Mazu and the school of Sanyiism in Fujian, Huangdi worship, and other forms of local worship, for instance the worship of Longwang, Pangu or Caishen. In mid-2015 the government of Zhejiang began the registration of the province's tens of thousands of folk religious temples.\n\nAccording to the most recent demographic analyses, an average 80% of the population of China, approximately 1 billion people, practises cults of gods and ancestors or belongs to folk religious movements. Moreover, according to one survey approximately 14% of the population claims different levels of affiliation with Taoist practices. Other figures from the micro-level testify the wide proliferation of folk religions: in 1989 there were 21,000 male and female shamans (\"shen han\" and \"wu po\" respectively, as they are named locally), 60% of them young, in the Pingguo County of Guangxi alone; and by the mid-1990s the government of the Yulin Prefecture of Shaanxi counted over 10,000 folk temples on its territory alone, for a population of 3.1 million, an average of one temple per 315 persons.\n\nAccording to Wu and Lansdowne:\n\nAccording to Yiyi Lu, discussing the reconstruction of Chinese civil society:\n\nIn December 2015, the Chinese Folk Temples' Management Association was formally established with the approval of the government of China and under the aegis of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.\n\nChina has a long history of sectarian traditions, called \"salvationist religions\" (救度宗教 \"jiùdù zōngjiào\") by some scholars, which are characterised by a concern for salvation (moral fulfillment) of the person and the society, having a soteriological and eschatological character. They generally emerged from the common religion but are separate from the lineage cults of ancestors and progenitors, as well as from the communal worship of deities of village temples, neighbourhood, corporation, or national temples. The 20th-century expression of such religions has been studied under Prasenjit Duara's definition of \"redemptive societies\" (救世团体 \"jiùshì tuántǐ\"), while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as \"folk religious sects\" (民間宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\", 民间教门 \"mínjiān jiàomén\" or 民间教派 \"mínjiān jiàopài\"), overcoming the ancient derogatory definition of \"xiéjiào\" (邪教), \"evil religion\".\n\nThese religions are characterised by egalitarianism, charismatic founding figures claiming to have received divine revelation, a millenarian eschatology and voluntary path of salvation, an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, evangelism and philanthropy. Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and on the recitation of scriptures.\n\nMany redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to embody and reform Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism. They include Yiguandao and other sects belonging to the Xiantiandao ( \"Way of Former Heaven\"), Jiugongdao ( \"Way of the Nine Palaces\"), the various branches of Luoism, Zailiism, and more recent ones such as the Church of Virtue, Weixinism, Xuanyuanism and Tiandiism. Also the qigong schools are developments of folk salvationist movements. All these movements were banned in the early Republic of China (1912–49) and later People's Republic. Many of them still remain underground or unrecognised in China, while others—for instance the Church of Virtue, Tiandiism, Xuanyuanism, Weixinism and Yiguandao—operate in China and collaborate with academic and non-governmental organisations. Sanyiism is another folk religious organisation founded in the 16th century, which is present in the Putian region (Xinghua) of Fujian where it is legally recognised. Some of these movements began to register as branches of the Taoist Association since the 1990s.\n\nAnother category that has been sometimes confused with that of the folk salvationist movements by scholars is that of the secret societies (會道門 \"huìdàomén\", 祕密社會 \"mìmì shèhuì\", or 秘密結社 \"mìmì jiéshè\"). They are religious communities of initiatory and secretive character, including rural militias such as the Red Spears (紅槍會) and the Big Knives (大刀會), and fraternal organisations such as the Green Gangs (青幫) and the Elders' Societies (哥老會). They were very active in the early republican period, and often identified as \"heretical doctrines\" (宗教異端 \"zōngjiào yìduān\"). Recent scholarship has coined the category of \"secret sects\" (祕密教門 \"mìmì jiàomén\") to distinguish positively-viewed peasant secret societies of the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, from the negatively-viewed secret societies of the early republic which were regarded as anti-revolutionary forces.\n\nA further type of folk religious movements, possibly overlapping with the \"secret sects\", are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the \"wénchǎng\" (文场 \"cultural field\"), which is a doctrinal aspect characterised by elborate cosmologies, theologies, and liturgies, and usually taught only to initiates; and the \"wǔchǎng\" (武场 \"martial field\"), that is the practice of bodily cultivation, usually shown as the \"public face\" of the sect. These martial folk religions were outlawed by Ming imperial decrees which continued to be enforced until the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 20th century. An example of martial sect is Meihuaism (梅花教 \"Méihuājiào\", \"Plum Flowers\"), a branch of Baguaism which has become very popular throughout northern China. In Taiwan, virtually all folk salvationist movements operate freely since the late 1980s.\n\nConfucianism in Chinese is called, 儒教 Rújiào, the \"teaching of scholars\", or 孔教 Kǒngjiào, the \"teaching of Confucius\". It is both a teaching and a set of ritual practices. Yong Chen calls the question on the definition of Confucianism \"probably one of the most controversial issues in both Confucian scholarship and the discipline of religious studies\".\n\nGuy Alitto points out that there was \"literally no equivalent for the Western (and later worldwide) concept of 'Confucianism' in traditional Chinese discourse\". He argues that the Jesuit missionaries of the 16th century selected Confucius from many possible sages to serve as the counterpart to Christ or Muhammad in order to meet European religion categories. They used a variety of writings by Confucius and his followers to coin a new \"-ism\"—\"Confucianism\"—which they presented as a \"rationalist secular-ethical code\", not as a religion. This secular understanding of Confucianism inspired both the Enlightenment in Europe in the 18th century, and Chinese intellectuals of the 20th century. Liang Shuming, a philosopher of the May Fourth Movement, wrote that Confucianism \"functioned as a religion without actually being one\". Western scholarship generally accepted this understanding. In the decades following the Second World War, however, many Chinese intellectuals and academic scholars in the West, among whom Tu Weiming, reversed this assessment. Confucianism, for this new generation of scholars, became a \"true religion\" that offered \"immanent transcendence\".\n\nAccording to Herbert Fingarette's conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which proposes \"the secular as sacred\", Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism. Confucians experience the sacred as existing in this world as part of everyday life, most importantly in family and social relations. Confucianism focuses on a thisworldly awareness of \"Tian\" (天 \"Heaven\"), the search for a middle way in order to preserve social harmony and on respect through teaching and a set of ritual practices. Joël Thoraval finds that Confucianism expresses on a popular level in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (\"Di\" 地), the sovereign or the government (\"jūn\" 君), ancestors (\"qīn\" 親) and masters (\"shī\" 師). Confucians cultivate family bonds and social harmony rather than pursuing a transcendental salvation. The scholar Joseph Adler concludes that Confucianism is not so much a religion in the Western sense, but rather \"a non-theistic, diffused religious tradition\", and that \"Tian\" is not so much a personal God but rather \"an impersonal absolute, like \"dao\" and \"Brahman\"\".\n\nBroadly speaking, however, scholars agree that Confucianism may be also defined as an ethico-political system, developed from the teachings of the philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE). Confucianism originated during the Spring and Autumn period and developed metaphysical and cosmological elements in the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), to match the developments in Buddhism and Taoism which were dominant among the populace. By the same period, Confucianism became the core idea of Chinese imperial politics. According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the Shang-Zhou (~1600 BCE–256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.\n\nBy the words of Tu Weiming and other Confucian scholars who recover the work of Kang Youwei (a Confucian reformer of the early 20th century), Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and Heaven, or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven. The principle of Heaven (\"Li\" or \"Dao\") is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, monistic in its structure. Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order. This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community. Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\". As defined by Stephan Feuchtwang, Heaven is thought to have an ordering law which preserves the world, which has to be followed by humanity by means of a \"middle way\" between yin and yang forces; social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is the worship of ancestors and progenitors in the male line, in ancestral shrines.\n\nIn Confucian thought, human beings are always teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor of self-cultivation and self-creation. Some of the basic Confucian ethical and practical concepts include \"rén\", \"yì\", \"lǐ\", and \"zhì\". \"Ren\" is translated as \"humaneness\", or the essence proper of a human being, which is characterised by compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time what allows man to achieve oneness with Heaven—in the \"Datong shu\" it is defined as \"to form one body with all things\" and \"when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused\". \"Yi\" is \"righteousness\", which consists in the ability to always maintain a moral disposition to do good things. \"Li\" is a system of ritual norms and propriety of behaviour which determine how a person should act in everyday life. \"Zhi\" is the ability to see what is right and what is wrong, in the behaviour exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt when he fails to uphold the cardinal moral values of \"ren\" and \"yi\".\n\nConfucianism never developed an institutional structure similar to that of Taoism, and its religious body never differentiated from Chinese folk religion. Since the 2000s, Confucianism has been embraced as a religious identity by a large numbers of intellectuals and students in China. In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people, a purpose achievable through a standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations. Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a state church is Jiang Qing.\n\nIn 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established and \"guoxue\" (\"national learning\") started to be implemented in public schools. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers started to appear on television since 2006. The most enthusiast New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.\n\nThe idea of a \"Confucian Church\" as the state religion of China has roots in the thought of Kang Youwei (1858–1927), an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism at a time when it fell out of favour with the fall of the Qing dynasty and the end of the Chinese empire. Kang modeled his ideal \"Confucian Church\" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches devoted to the worship of Confucius and the spread of his teachings.\nIn contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (\"shuyuan\" 书院 or 孔学堂 \"Kǒngxuétáng\", \"Confucian learning halls\"), the resurgence of Confucian rites (\"chuántǒng lǐyí\" 传统礼仪), and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (\"shèqū rúxué\" 社区儒学). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of lineage churches and their ancestral temples, as well as of cults and temples of natural gods and national heroes within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism.\n\nOther forms of revival are folk religious movements of salvation with a Confucian focus, or Confucian churches, for example the \"Yidan xuetang\" (一耽学堂) of Beijing, the \"Mengmutang\" (孟母堂) of Shanghai, Confucian Shenism (儒宗神教 \"Rúzōng Shénjiào\") or the phoenix churches, the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 \"Rújiào Dàotán\") of northern Fujian, and ancestral temples of the Kong (Confucius') lineage operating as churches for Confucian teaching.\n\nAlso the Hong Kong Confucian Academy, one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, the establishment of Confucian hospitals, the restoration of temples and other activities. In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 \"Kǒngshèngtáng\") in Shenzhen, affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu City. It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the Holy Confucian Church (孔圣会 \"Kǒngshènghuì\"). The first spiritual leader of the Holy Church is the renowned scholar Jiang Qing, the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode (阳明精舍 \"Yángmíng jīngshě\"), a Confucian academy in Guiyang, Guizhou.\n\nChinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called 儒 \"rú\" or 正统 \"zhèngtǒng\", \"orthoprax\") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 \"lǐshēng\") to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual. \"Confucian businessmen\" (儒商人 \"rúshāngrén\", also \"refined businessman\") is a recently rediscovered concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.\n\nTaoism (道教 \"Dàojiào\") refers to a variety of related orders of philosophy and rite that operate in Chinese religion. They share elements going back to the 4th century BCE and to the prehistoric culture of China, such as the School of Yin and Yang and the thought of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Taoism has a distinct scriptural tradition, with the \"Dàodéjīng\" (道德经 \"Book of the Way and its Virtue\") of Laozi being regarded as its keystone. Taoism may be precisely described, as does the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in \"The Taoist Body\" (1986), as a doctrinal and liturgical framework or structure for developing the local cults of indigenous religion. Taoist traditions emphasise living in harmony with the \"Tao\" (also romanised as \"Dao\"). The term \"Tao\" means \"way\", \"path\" or \"principle\", and may also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism. In Taoism, however, \"Tao\" denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. It is ultimately ineffable: \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao\" says the first verse of the Tao Te Ching. According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, the concept of \"Tao\" is equivalent to the ancient Greek concept of \"physis\", \"nature\", that is the vision of the process of generation and regeneration of things and of the moral order.\n\nOnly by the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organisations and orders of ritualists. In earlier China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or ascetics who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of them, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was involved in local shamanic traditions. Women shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbing fundamental shamanic elements. Shamans revealed texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century.\n\nTaoist institutional orders evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism. Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, immortals or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for divination and exorcism, and techniques for achieving ecstasy, longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behaviour that Taoists have to follow may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all of them emphasise \"wu wei\" (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.\n\nTaoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture over the course of the centuries, and Taoists (, \"masters of the Tao\") usually take care to remark the distinction between their ritual tradition and those of vernacular orders which are not recognised as Taoist.\n\nTaoism was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution but its traditions endured in secrecy and revived in following decades. In 1956 a national organisation, the Chinese Taoist Association, was established to govern the activity of Taoist orders and temples. According to demographic analyses, approximately 13% of the population of China claims a loose affiliation with Taoist practices, while self-proclaimed \"Taoists\" (a title traditionally attributed only to the \"daoshi\", i.e. the priests, who are experts of Taoist doctrines and rites, and to their closest disciples) might be 12 million (~1%). The definition of \"Taoists\" is complicated by the fact that many folk sects of salvation and their members began to be registered as branches of the Taoist association in the 1990s.\n\nThere are two types of Taoists, following the distinction between the Quanzhen and Zhengyi traditions. Quanzhen \"daoshi\" are celibate monks, and therefore the Taoist temples of the Quanzhen school are monasteries. Contrarywise, Zhengyi \"daoshi\", also known as \"sanju daoshi\" (\"scattered\" or \"diffused\" Taoists) or \"huoju daoshi\" (Taoists \"who live at home\"), are priests who may marry and have other jobs besides the sacerdotal office; they live among the population and perform Taoist rituals within common Chinese religion, for local temples and communities.\n\nWhile the Chinese Taoist Association started as a Quanzhen institution, and remains based at the White Cloud Temple of Beijing, that also functions as the headquarters of the Quanzhen sects, from the 1990s onwards it started to open registration to the \"sanju daoshi\" of the Zhengyi branch, who are more numerous than the Quanzhen monks. The Chinese Taoist Association had already 20.000 registered \"sanju daoshi\" in the mid-1990s, while the total number of Zhengyi priests including the unregistered ones was estimated at 200.000 in the same years. The Zhengyi \"sanju daoshi\" are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the Celestial Master, although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War. Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms, has experienced a strong development since the 1990s, and dominates the religious life of coastal provinces.\n\nChinese vernacular ritual masters, also referred to as practitioners of Faism (法教 \"Fǎjiào\", \"rites/laws' traditions\"), also named Folk Taoism (民间道教 \"Mínjiàn Dàojiào\"), or \"Red Taoism\" (in southeast China and Taiwan), are orders of priests that operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism. Such \"masters of rites\", \"fashi\" (法師), are known by a variety of names including \"hongtou daoshi\" (紅頭道士), popular in southeast China, meaning \"redhead\" or \"redhat\" daoshi, in contradistinction to the \"wutou daoshi\" (烏頭道士), \"blackhead\" or \"blackhat\" daoshi, as vernacular Taoists call the \"sanju daoshi\" of Zhengyi Taoism that were traditionally ordained by the Celestial Master. In some provinces of north China they are known as \"yīnyángshēng\" (阴阳生 \"sages of yin and yang\"), and by a variety of other names.\n\nAlthough the two types of priests, daoshi and fashi, have the same roles in Chinese society—in that they may marry and they perform rituals for communities' temples or private homes—Zhengyi daoshi emphasise their Taoist tradition, distinguished from the vernacular tradition of the fashi. Some Western scholars have described vernacular Taoist traditions as \"cataphatic\" (i.e. of positive theology) in character, while professional Taoism as \"kenotic\" and \"apophatic\" (i.e. of negative theology).\n\n\"Fashi\" are \"tongji\" practitioners (southern mediumship), healers, exorcists and they officiate \"jiao\" rituals of \"universal salvation\" (although historically they were excluded from performing such rites). They are not shamans (\"wu\"), with the exception of the order of Mount Lu in Jiangxi. Rather, they represent an intermediate level between the \"wu\" and the Taoists. Like the \"wu\", the \"fashi\" identify with their deity, but while the \"wu\" embody wild forces, vernacular ritual masters represent order like the Taoists. Unlike the Taoists, who represent a tradition of high theology which is interethnic, both vernacular ritual masters and \"wu\" find their institutional base in local cults to particular deities, even though vernacular ritual masters are itinerant.\n\nShamanism was the prevalent modality of pre-Han dynasty Chinese indigenous religion. The Chinese usage distinguishes the Chinese \"Wuism\" tradition (巫教 \"Wūjiào\"; properly shamanic, in which the practitioner has control over the force of the god and may travel to the underworld) from the \"tongji\" tradition (童乩; southern mediumship, in which the practitioner does not control the force of the god but is guided by it), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms (萨满教 \"sàmǎnjiào\") which are practised in northern provinces.\n\nWith the rise of Confucian orthodoxy in the Han period (206 BCE–220 CE), shamanic traditions found an institutionalised and intellectualised form within the esoteric philosophical discourse of Taoism. According to Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the Shang dynasty (~1600 BCE–1046 BCE). What Confucianism did was to marginalise the features of old shamanism which were dysfunctional for the new political regime. However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.\n\nIn the Shang and later Zhou dynasty (~1046 BCE–256 BCE), shamans had an important role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (大宗拍). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and humanity. The mission of a shaman (巫 \"wu\") is \"to repair the disfunctionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth\":\n\nSince the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a great revival in Chinese religion as a mean to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialisation. Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as \"teacher and spirit\" of peoples. The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in Jilin City in 1988.\n\nIn China, Buddhism (佛教 \"Fójiào\") is represented by a large number of people following the \"Mahayana\", divided between two different cultural traditions, namely the schools of Chinese Buddhism followed by the Han Chinese, and the schools of Tibetan Buddhism followed by Tibetans and Mongols, but also by minorities of Han. The vast majority of Buddhists in China, counted in the hundreds of millions, are Chinese Buddhists, while Tibetan Buddhists are in the number of the tens of millions. Small communities following the \"Theravada\" exist among minority ethnic groups who live in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, bordering Burma, Thailand and Laos, but also some among the Li people of Hainan follow such tradition.\n\nWith the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, religion came under the control of the new government, and the Buddhist Association of China was founded in 1953. During the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism was suppressed and temples closed or destroyed. Restrictions lasted until the reforms of the 1980s, when Buddhism began to recover popularity and its place as the largest organised faith in the country. While estimates of the number of Buddhists in China vary, the most recent surveys found an average 10–16% of the population of China claiming a Buddhist affiliation, with even higher percentages in urban agglomerations.\n\nBuddhism was introduced into China by its western neighbouring populations during the Han dynasty, traditionally in the 1st century. It became very popular among Chinese of all walks of life; admired by commoners, and sponsored by emperors in certain dynasties. The expansion of Buddhism reached its peak during the Tang dynasty, in the 9th century, when Buddhist monasteries had become very rich and powerful. The wealth of Buddhist institutions was among the practical reasons—the ideal reason was that Buddhism was a \"foreign religion\"—why the Tang emperors decided to enact a wave of persecutions of the religion, starting with the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution (845) by Emperor Wuzong, through which many monasteries were destroyed and the religion's influence in China was greatly reduced. However, Buddhism survived the persecutions and regained a place in the Chinese society over the following centuries.\n\nSpreading in China, Buddhism had to interact with indigenous religions, especially Taoism. Such interaction gave rise to uniquely Han Chinese Buddhist schools (汉传佛教 \"Hànchuán Fójiào\"). Originally seen as a kind of \"foreign Taoism\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. Chan Buddhism in particular was shaped by Taoism, developing distrust of scriptures and even language, as well as typical Taoist views emphasising \"this life\", the \"moment\", and dedicated practices. Throughout the Tang period, Taoism itself developed elements drawn from Buddhism, including monasticism, vegetarianism, abstention from alcohol, and the doctrine of emptiness. During the same period, Chan Buddhism grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism was not universally welcomed, particularly among the gentry. The Buddha's teaching seemed alien and amoral to conservative Confucian sensibilities. Confucianism promoted social stability, order, strong families, and practical living, and Chinese officials questioned how monasticism and personal attainment of Nirvana benefited the empire. However, Buddhism and Confucianism eventually reconciled after centuries of conflict and assimilation.\n\nIn contemporary China, the most popular forms of Chinese Buddhism are the Pure Land and Chan schools. Pure Land Buddhism is very accessible for common people, since in its doctrine even lay practitioners may escape the cycle of death and rebirth. The goal for followers of this popular form of Buddhism is to be reborn in the Pure Land, which is a place rather than a state of mind. In the 2000s and 2010s, the influence of Chinese Buddhism has been expressed through the construction of large-scale statues, pagodas and temples, including the Great Buddha of the Central Plains, the second highest statue in the world. Many temples in China also claim to preserve relics of the original Gautama Buddha.\n\nThe revival of Chinese Buddhism in the 21st century has also seen the development of the Humanistic Buddhist movement, reintroduced from Taiwan and Chinese overseas communities, with organisations such as the \"Cíjì\" (慈济), which has been working in mainland China since 1991 and has opened its mainland headquarters in the 2010s in Suzhou.\n\nThe Buddhist schools that emerged in the cultural sphere of Tibet (藏传佛教 \"Zàngchuán Fójiào\" or 喇嘛教 \"Lǎmajiào\", \"Lamaism\") also have an influence throughout China that dates back to historical interactions of the Han Chinese with neighbouring populations. Tibetan Buddhism and its clergy, the lamas, were introduced in China proper since the 7th century; its emphasis on ritual action was a shared element with Taoism. It spread significantly much later, with Tibetan influence in the west, and with the Mongols and Manchus in the north, especially under the dynasties which they established in China, the Yuan and the Qing dynasty.\n\nToday, Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in Tibet, among Tibetans in Qinghai and other provinces, and has a historical and significant presence in Inner Mongolia (where its traditional name is \"Burkhany Shashin\", \"Buddha's religion\", or \"Shira-in Shashin\", the \"Yellow religion\"—黄教 \"Huángjiào\" in Chinese). However, there are many Tibetan Buddhist temples as far as northeast China, the Yonghe Temple in Beijing being just one example.\n\nThere are controversies surrounding the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, specifically the succession of Tenzin Gyatso the 14th Dalai Lama—the spiritual leader of the Gelug school, the major school of Tibetan Buddhism—, who before fleeing China during the 1959 Tibetan uprising had full political power in Tibet. The Panchen Lama, the Tibetan hierarch in charge of the designation of the future successor of the Dalai Lama, is the matter of controversy between the Chinese government and Tenzin Gyatso. The government of China asserts that the present (11th) incarnation of the Panchen Lama is Gyancain Norbu, while the 14th Dalai Lama asserted in 1995 that it was Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, who from that year has been detained by the Chinese government and never seen in public.\n\nAfter the liberalisation of religions in China in the 1980s, there has been a growing movement of adoption of the Gelug sect, and other Tibetan-originated Buddhist schools, by the Han Chinese. This movement has been favoured by the proselytism of Chinese-speaking Tibetan lamas throughout China.\n\nTheravada Buddhism is a major form of Buddhism, practised mostly in Southeast Asia but also among some minority ethnic groups in southwest China. Theravada Buddhism spread from Myanmar to present day Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Simao, Lincang, and Baoshan, all in Yunnan, during the 6th and 7th century. Today, this school of Buddhism is popular among the Dai people, and also the Palaung, Blang, Achang, and Jingpo ethnic groups.\n\nThe first Buddhist temple in Yunnan province, the Wabajie Temple in Xishuangbanna, was erected in 615. After the 12th century, Theravada Buddhist influence into the region began to come from Thailand. Thais began to bring copies of the Pali canon to Yunnan, to translate the scriptures and to build new temples. The people living in Yunnan where Theravada Buddhism is widespread follow norms similar to those of Thai Buddhists, and their Buddhism is often blended with local folk beliefs. Theravada Buddhism suffered from persecution in during the Cultural Revolution, but after the 1980s it was revived.\n\nBesides Tibetan Buddhism and the Vajrayana streams found within Chinese Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism is practised in China in some other forms. For instance, Azhaliism (Chinese: 阿吒力教 \"Āzhālìjiào\") is a Vajrayana Buddhist religion practised among the Bai people.\n\nThe Vajrayana current of Chinese Buddhism is known as Tangmi (唐密 \"Tang Mysteries\"), as it flourished in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) just before the great suppression of Buddhism by imperial decision. Another name for this body of traditions is \"Han Chinese Transmission of the Esoteric (or Mystery) Tradition\" (汉传密宗 \"Hànchuán Mìzōng\", where \"Mizong\" is the Chinese for Vajrayana). Tangmi, together with the broader religious tradition of Tantrism (in Chinese: 怛特罗 \"Dátèluō\" or 怛特罗密教 \"Dátèluó mìjiào\"; which may include Hindu forms of religion) has undergone a revitalisation since the 1980s together with the overall revival of Buddhism.\n\nThe Gateway of the Hidden Flower (华藏宗门 \"Huácáng Zōngmén\") and the True Awakening Tradition (真佛宗 \"Zhēnfó Zōng\") are two new Han Chinese movements within the Vajrayana, and are among the Buddhist sects which are officially proscribed as evil by the government.\n\nFrom the 1890s to the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, the \"Hompa Honganji-ha\" organisation of the \"Jōdo Shinshū\" (淨土真宗; Chinese reading: \"Jìngtǔ Zhēnzōng\", \"True Tradition of the Pure Land\"), or Shin Buddhism (\"True Buddhism\"), which is a Japanese variation of Pure Land Buddhism, carried out missionary activity throughout East Asia, including Manchuria, Taiwan and China proper. With the unconditional surrender of Japan at the end of the war, the missions were shut down.\n\nStarting in the 1990s there has been a revival of Shin Buddhism among the Chinese, which has taken a formal nature with the foundation of the Hong Kong Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (香港法雷念佛会) in 2000, followed by the Fuzhou Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (福州法雷念佛会) founded in 2006 and the Shaanxi Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (陕西法雷念佛会) founded in 2010. There are Shin Buddhist groups also in Henan, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan and other provinces.\n\nThe propagation of Shin Buddhism in China has faced some critiques for cultural, historical and doctrinal reasons. Cultural critiques point to the fact that Shin Buddhist clerics may marry and eat meat; modern Chinese Shin Buddhist groups, however, tend to follow the norms of celibacy and vegetarianism of Chinese Buddhism. Historical critiques have to do with the links that Jodo Shinshu had with Japanese militarism and colonialism prior to 1945. Doctrinal critiques are based on the attribution of \"unfiliality\" to Shin Buddhism, because it was not influenced by Chinese folk religion as Chinese Buddhism was, and therefore does not have firmly established practices for ancestor worship.\n\nNichiren Buddhism, a denomination of the Buddhist religion that was founded in Japan in the 13th century, has been spreading in China in the 21st century in the form of the Soka Gakkai (in Chinese: 创价学会 \"Chuàngjià xuéhuì\"). Nichiren Buddhism was founded by the monk Nichiren (1222–1282), who elaborated his teachings upon the \"Lotus Sutra\" aspiring to reform Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism promises both immediate relief from daily problems as well as this-worldly benefits. This society has engaged in missionary efforts in China partially aided by the good relationship it has interlaced with the Chinese government. Delegations from the Japanese Soka Gakkai and the Chinese government and intellectual class have made visits to each other, so that the society has been called an \"intimate friend of the Chinese government\". Soka Gakkai members in China are organised in the form of the house church, as they \"meet quietly in small groups in the homes of other members\", with little interference from the government.\n\nVarious Chinese non-Han minority populations practise unique indigenous religions. The government of China protects and valorises the indigenous religions of minority ethnicities as the foundations of their culture and identity.\n\nBenzhuism (本主教 \"Běnzhǔjiào\", \"religion of the patrons\") is the indigenous religion of the Bai people, an ethnic group of Yunnan. It consists in the worship of the \"ngel zex\", Bai word for \"patrons\" or \"source lords\", rendered as \"benzhu\" (本主) in Chinese. They are local gods and deified ancestors of the Bai nation. Benzhuism is very similar to Han Chinese religion.\n\nBimoism (毕摩教 \"Bìmójiào\") is the indigenous religion of the Yi people(s), the largest ethnic group in Yunnan after the Han Chinese. This faith is represented by three types of religious specialists: the \"bimo\" (毕摩, \"ritual masters\", \"priests\"), the \"sunyi\" (male shamans) and the \"monyi\" (female shamans).\n\nWhat distinguishes the \"bimo\" and the shamans is the way through which they acquire their authority. While both are regarded as the \"mediators between humanity and the divine\", the shamans are initiated through a \"spiritual inspiration\" (which involves illness or vision) whereas the \"bimo\"—who are always males with few exceptions—are literates, who may read and write traditional Yi script, have a tradition of theological and ritual scriptures, and are initiated through a tough edicational process.\n\nSince the 1980s, Bimoism has undergone a comprehensive revitalisation, both on the popular level and on the scholarly level, with the \"bimo\" now celebrated as an \"intellectual class\" whose role is that of creators, preservers and transmitters of Yi high culture. Since the 1990s, Bimoism has undergone an institutionalisation, starting with the foundation of the Bimo Culture Research Center in Meigu County in 1996. The founding of the centre received substantial support from local authorities, especially those whose families were directly affiliated with one of the many \"bimo\" hereditary lineages. Since then, large temples and ceremonial complexes for Bimoist practices have been built.\n\n\"Bon\" (Tibetan: བོན་; Chinese: 苯教 \"Běnjiào\") is the post-Buddhist name of the pre-Buddhist folk religion of Tibet. Buddhism spread into Tibet starting in the 7th and 8th century, and the name \"Bon\" was adopted as the name of the indigenous religion in Buddhist historiography. Originally, \"bon\" was the title of the shamans of the Tibetan indigenous religion. This is in analogy with the names of the priests of the folk religions of other peoples related to the Tibetans, such as the \"dong ba\" of the Nakhi or the \"bø\" of Mongolians and other Siberian peoples. Bonpo (\"believers of Bon\") claim that the word \"bon\" means \"truth\" and \"reality\".\n\nThe spiritual source of Bon is the mythical figure of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. Since the late 10th century, the religion then designated as \"Bon\" started to organise itself adopting the style of Tibetan Buddhism, including a monastic structure and a Bon Canon (\"Kangyur\"), which made it a codified religion. The Chinese sage Confucius is worshipped in Bon as a holy king, master of magic and divination.\n\nDongbaism (東巴教 \"Dōngbajiào\", \"religion of the eastern \"Ba\"\") is the main religion of the Nakhi people. The \"dongba\" (\"eastern \"ba\"\") are masters of the culture, literature and the script of the Nakhi. They originated as masters of the Tibetan Bon religion (\"Ba\" in Nakhi language), many of whom, in times of persecution when Buddhism became the dominant religion in Tibet, were expelled and dispersed to the eastern marches settling among Nakhi and other eastern peoples.\n\nDongbaism historically formed as beliefs brought by Bon masters commingled with older indigenous Nakhi beliefs. Dongba followers believe in a celestial shaman called \"Shi-lo-mi-wu\", with little doubt the same as the Tibetan \"Shenrab Miwo\". They worship nature and generation, in the form of many heavenly gods and spirits, chthonic \"Shu\" (spirits of the earth represented in the form of chimera-dragon-serpent beings), and ancestors.\n\nManchu folk religion is the ethnic religion practised by most of the Manchu people, the major of the Tungusic peoples, in China. It may also be called \"Manchu Shamanism\" (满族萨满教 \"Mǎnzú sàmǎnjiào\") by virtue of the word \"shaman\" being originally from Tungusic \"šamán\" (\"man of knowledge\"), later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures.\n\nIt is a patheistic system, believing in a universal God called \"Apka Enduri\" (\"God of Heaven\") that is the omnipotent and omnipresent source of all life and creation. Deities (\"enduri\") enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity. Many of the deities are original Manchu kins' ancestors, and people with the same surname are viewed as being generated by the same god.\n\nMost of the Miao people (or Hmong) in China have retained their traditional folk religion. It is pantheistic and deeply influenced by Chinese religion, sharing the concept of \"yeeb ceeb\" and \"yaj ceeb\" representing, respectively, the realm of the gods in potentiality and the manifested or actual world of living things as a complementary duality.\n\nThe Miao believe in a supreme universal God, \"Saub\", who may be defined a \"deus otiosus\" who created reality and left it to develop according to its ways, but nonetheless may be appealed in times of need. He entrusted a human, \"Siv Yis\", with healing powers so that he became the first shaman. After his death, Siv Yis ascended to heaven, but he left behind his ritual tools that became the equipment of the shaman class. They (\"txiv neeb\") regard Siv Yis as their archetype and identify as him when they are imbued by the gods.\n\nVarious gods (\"dab\" or \"neeb\", the latter defining those who work with shamans) enliven the world. Among them, the most revered are the water god Dragon King (\"Zaj Laug\"), the Thunder God (\"Xob\"), the gods of life and death (\"Ntxwj Nyug\" and \"Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem\"), Lady Sun (\"Nkauj Hnub\") and Lord Moon (\"Nraug Hli\"), and various deified human ancestors.\n\nMongolian folk religion, that is Mongolian shamanism (蒙古族萨满教 \"Ménggǔzú sàmǎnjiào\"), alternatively named Tengerism (腾格里教 \"Ténggélǐjiào\"), is the native and major religion among the Mongols of China, mostly residing in the region of Inner Mongolia.\n\nIt is centred on the worship of the \"tngri\" (gods) and the highest \"Tenger\" (Heaven, God of Heaven, God) or \"Qormusta Tengri\". In Mongolian folk religion, Genghis Khan is considered one of the embodiments, if not the most important embodiment, of the Tenger. In worship, communities of lay believers are led by shamans (called \"böge\" if males, \"iduγan\" if females), who are intermediaries of the divine.\n\nSince the 1980s there has been an unprecedented development of Mongolian folk religion in Inner Mongolia, including böge, the cult of Genghis Khan and the Heaven in special temples (many of which built in a style resembling yurts), and the cult of \"aobao\" as ancestral shrines. Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia have easily assimilated into the traditional Mongolian spiritual heritage of the region. The cult of Genghis is also shared by the Han, claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the Yuan dynasty.\n\nAobaoes (敖包 \"áobāo\") are sacrificial altars of the shape of mounds that are traditionally used for worship by Mongols and related ethnic groups. Every aobao represents a god; there are aobaoes dedicated to heavenly gods, mountain gods, other gods of nature, and also to gods of human lineages and agglomerations.\n\nThe aobaoes for worship of ancestral gods may be private shrines of an extended family or kin (people sharing the same surname), otherwise they are common to villages (dedicated to the god of a village), banners or leagues. Sacrifices to the aobaoes are made offering slaughtered animals, joss sticks, and libations.\n\nQiang people are mostly followers of a native Qiang folk religion. It is pantheistic, involving the worship of a variety of gods of nature and of human affairs, including Qiang progenitors. White stones are worshipped as it is believed that they may be invested with the power of the gods through rituals. Qiang people believe in an overarching God, called \"Mubyasei\" (\"God of Heaven\"), which is related with the Chinese concept of \"Tian\" and clearly identified by the Qiang with the Taoist-originated Jade Deity.\n\nReligious ceremonies and rituals are directed by priests called \"duāngōng\" in Chinese. They are shamans who acquire their position through years of training with a teacher. \"Duāngōng\" are the custodians of Qiang theology, history and mythology. They also administer the coming of age ceremony for 18 years-old boys, called the \"sitting on top of the mountain\", which involves the boy's entire family going to mountain tops, to sacrifice a ship or cow and to plant three cypress trees.\n\nTwo of the most important religious holidays are the Qiang New Year, falling on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar (though now it is fixed on 1 October), and the Mountain Sacrifice Festival, held between the second and the sixth month of the lunar calendar. The former festival is to worship the God of Heaven, while the latter is dedicated to the god of mountains.\n\nThe Yao people, who reside in Guangxi and Hunan and surrounding provinces, follow a folk religion that is deeply integrated with Taoism since the 13th century, so much that it is frequently defined as \"Yao Taoism\". Yao folk religion was described by a Chinese scholar of the half of the 20th century as an example of deep \"Taoisation\" (道教化 \"Dàojiàohuà\"). In the 1980s it was found that the Yao clearly identified themselves with Chinese-language Taoist theological literature, seen as a prestigious statute of culture (文化 \"wénhuà\").\n\nThe reason of such strong identification of Yao religion with Taoism is that in Yao society every male adult is initiated as a Taoist. Yao Taoism is therefore a communal religion, not identifying just a class of priests but the entire body of the society; this contrasts with Chinese Taoism, which mostly developed as a collection of sacerdotal orders. The shared sense of Yao identity is further based on tracing back Yao origins to a mythical ancestor, Panhu.\n\nZhuang folk religion, sometimes called Moism (摩教 \"Mójiào\") or Shigongism (师公教 \"Shīgōngjiào\", \"religion of the [Zhuang] ancestral father\"), after two of its forms, is practised by most of the Zhuang people, the largest ethnic minority of China, who inhabit the province of Guangxi. It is a polytheistic-monistic and shamanic religion centered on the creator god usually expressed as \"Buluotuo\", the mythical primordial ancestor of the Zhuang. Its beliefs are codified into a mythology and a sacred scripture, the \"Buluotuo Epic\". A very similar religion, also called by the same name, is that of the Buyei people, who are kindred to the Zhuang.\n\nThe Zhuang religion is intertwined with Taoism. Indeed, Chinese scholars divide the Zhuang religion into several categories according to the type of ritual specialists who conduct the rites; these categories include Shigongism, Moism, Daogongism (道公教 \"Dàogōngjiào\") and shamanism (巫教 \"wūjiào\").\n\n\"Shigongism\" refers to the dimension led by the \"shīgōng\" (师公) ritual specialists, a term which may be translated variously as \"ancestral father\" or \"teaching master\", and which refers both to the principle of the universe (God) and to the men who are able to represent it. \"Shīgōng\" specialists practise masked dancing and worship the Three Primordials, the generals Tang, Ge and Zhou. \"Moism\" refers to the dimension led by \"mógōng\" (摩公), who are vernacular ritual specialists able to transcribe and read texts written in Zhuang characters and lead the worship of \"Buluotuo\" and of the goddess \"Muliujia\". \"Daogongism\" is Zhuang Taoism, that is the indigenous religion directed by Zhuang Taoists, known as \"dàogōng\" (道公 \"lords of the Tao\") in the Zhuang language, according to Taoist doctrines and rites. Zhuang shamanism entails the practices of mediums who provide direct communication between the material and the spiritual worlds; these shamans are known as \"momoed\" if female and \"gemoed\" if male.\n\nSince the 1980s and the 1990s there has been a revival of Zhuang folk religion, which has followed two directions. The first is a grassroots revival of cults dedicated to local deities and ancestors, led by shamans; the second way is a promotion of the religion on the institutional level, through a standardisation of Moism elaborated by Zhuang government officials and intellectuals.\n\nChristianity (基督教 \"Jīdūjiào\", \"religion of Christ\") in China comprises Protestantism (基督教新教 \"Jīdūjiào xīnjiào\", \"New-Christianity\"), Roman Catholicism (天主教 \"Tiānzhǔjiào\", \"religion of the Lord of Heaven\"), and a small number of Orthodox Christians (正教 \"Zhèngjiào\"). Also Mormonism (摩爾門教 \"Mó'ěrménjiào\") has a tiny presence. The Orthodox Church, which has believers among the Russian minority and some Chinese in the far northeast and far northwest, is officially recognised in Heilongjiang. The category of \"Protestantism\" in China also comprehends a variety of heterodox sects of Christian inspiration, including Zhushenism (主神教 \"Zhǔshénjiào\", \"Church of Lord God\"), Linglingism (灵灵教 \"Línglíngjiào\", \"Numinous Church\"), Fuhuodao, the Church of the Disciples (门徒会 \"Méntúhuì\") and Eastern Lightning or the Church of Almighty God (全能神教 \"Quánnéngshénjiào\").\n\nChristianity existed in China as early as the 7th century, living multiple cycles of significant presence for centuries, then disappearing for other centuries, and then being re-introduced by foreign missionaries. The arrival of the Persian missionary Alopen in 635, during the early period of the Tang dynasty, is considered by some to be the first entry of Christianity in China. What Westerners referred to as Nestorianism flourished for centuries, until Emperor Wuzong of the Tang in 845 ordained that all foreign religions (Buddhism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism) had to be eradicated from the Chinese nation. Christianity was reintroduced in China in the 13th century, in the form of Nestorianism, during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which also established relations with the papacy, especially through Franciscan missionaries in 1294. When the native Han Chinese Ming dynasty overthrew the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, Christianity was again expelled from China as a foreign influence.\n\nAt the end of the Ming dynasty in the 16th century, Jesuits arrived in Beijing via Guangzhou. The most famous amongst them was Matteo Ricci, an Italian mathematician who came to China in 1588 and lived in Beijing. Ricci was welcomed at the imperial court and introduced Western learning into China. The Jesuits followed a policy of adaptation of Catholicism to traditional Chinese religious practices, especially ancestor worship. However, such practices were eventually condemned as polytheistic idolatry by the popes Clement XI, Clement XII and Benedict XIV. Roman Catholic missions struggled in obscurity for decades afterwards.\n\nChristianity began to take root in a significant way in the late imperial period, during the Qing dynasty, and although it has remained a minority religion in China, it influenced late imperial history. Waves of missionaries came to China in the Qing period as a result of contact with foreign powers. Russian Orthodoxy was introduced in 1715, and Protestant missions began entering China in 1807. The pace of missionary activity increased considerably after the First Opium War in 1842. Christian missionaries and their schools, under the protection of the Western powers, went on to play a major role in the Westernisation of China in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion (1850–1871) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings, and the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China. Christians in China established the first clinics and hospitals practising modern medicine, and provided the first modern training for nurses. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants founded numerous educational institutions in China from the primary to the university level. Some of the most prominent Chinese universities began as religious institutions. Missionaries worked to abolish practices such as foot binding, and the unjust treatment of maidservants, as well as launching charitable work and distributing food to the poor. They also opposed the opium trade and brought treatment to many who were addicted. Some of the early leaders of the early republic (1912–49), such as Sun Yat-sen, were converts to Christianity and were influenced by its teachings. By 1921, Harbin, Manchuria's largest city, had a Russian population of around 100,000, constituting a large part of Christianity in the city.\n\nChristianity, especially in its Protestant form, gained momentum in China between the 1980s and the 1990s, but, in the following years, folk religion recovered more rapidly and in greater numbers than Christianity (or Buddhism). The scholar Richard Madsen noted that \"the Christian God then becomes one in a pantheon of local gods among whom the rural population divides its loyalties\". Similarly, Gai Ronghua and Gao Junhui noted that \"Christianity in China is no longer monotheism\" and tends to blend with Chinese folk religion, as many Chinese Christians take part in regional activities for the worship of gods and ancestors.\n\nProtestants in the early 21st century, including both official and unofficial churches, had between 25 and 35 million adherents. Catholics were not more than 10 million. In the 2010s the scholarly estimate was of approximately 30 million Christians, of whom less than 4 million were Catholics. In the same years, about 40 million Chinese said they believed in Jesus Christ or had attended Christian meetings, but did not identify themselves with the Christian religion. Demographic analyses usually find an average 2–3% of the population of China declaring a Christian affiliation. Christians were unevenly distributed geographically, the only provinces in which they constituted a population significantly larger than 1 million persons being Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. Protestants were characterised by a prevalence of people living in the countryside, women, illiterates and semi-literates, and elderly people. A 2017 study on the Christian community of Wuhan found the same socio-economic characteristics, with the addition that Christians were more likely than the general population to suffer from physical and mental illness.\n\nA significant number of members of churches unregistered with the government, and of their pastors, belong to the Koreans of China. Christianity has a strong presence in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, in Jilin. Yanbian Koreans' Christianity has a patriarchal character; Korean churches are usually led by men, in contrast to Chinese churches that most often have female leadership. For instance, of the twenty-eight registered churches of Yanji, only three of which are Chinese congregations, all the Korean churches have a male pastor while all the Chinese churches have a female pastor. Also, Korean church buildings are stylistically very similar to South Korean churches, with big spires surmounted by red crosses. Yanbian Korean churches have been a matter of controversy for the Chinese government because of their links to South Korean churches.\n\nIn recent decades the Communist Party of China has become more tolerant of Christian churches outside party control, despite looking with distrust on organisations with international ties. The government and Chinese intellectuals tend to associate Christianity with subversive Western values, and many churches have been closed or destroyed. Since the 2010s policies against Christianity have been extended also to Hong Kong.\n\nThe introduction of Islam (伊斯兰教 \"Yīsīlánjiào\" or 回教 \"Huíjiào\") in China is traditionally dated back to a diplomatic mission in 651, eighteen years after Muhammad's death, led by Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas. Emperor Gaozong is said to have shown esteem for Islam and to have founded the Huaisheng Mosque (Memorial Mosque) at Guangzhou, in memory of the Prophet himself.\n\nMuslims, mainly Arabs, travelled to China to trade. In the year 760, the Yangzhou massacre killed large numbers of these traders, and a century later, in the years 878–879, Chinese rebels fatally targeted the Arab community in the Guangzhou massacre. Yet, Muslims virtually came to dominate the import and export industry by the Song dynasty (960–1279). The office of Director General of Shipping was consistently held by a Muslim. Immigration increased during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), when hundreds of thousands of Muslims were relocated throughout China for their administrative skills. A Muslim, Yeheidie'erding, led the construction project of the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq, in present-day Beijing.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Muslims continued to have an influence among the high classes. Zhu Yuanzhang's most trusted generals were Muslim, including Lan Yu, who led a decisive victory over the Mongols, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China. The admiral Zheng He led seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean. The Hongwu Emperor even composed \"The Hundred-word Eulogy\" in praise of Muhammad. Muslims who were descended from earlier immigrants began to assimilate by speaking Chinese dialects and by adopting Chinese names and culture, mixing with the Han Chinese. They developed their own cuisine, architecture, martial arts' styles and calligraphy (\"sini\"). This era, sometimes considered a Golden Age of Islam in China, also saw Nanjing become an important center of Islamic study.\n\nThe rise of the Qing dynasty saw numerous Islamic rebellions, including the Panthay Rebellion which occurred in Yunnan from 1855 to 1873, and the Dungan Revolt, which occurred mostly in Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Gansu from 1862 to 1877. The Manchu government ordered the execution of all rebels, killing a million Muslims after the Panthay Rebellion, and several million after the Dungan Revolt. However, many Muslims like Ma Zhan'ao, Ma Anliang, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Qianling and Ma Julung, defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang to exterminate the rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the \"Khufiyya\" sect, while rebels belonged to the \"Jahariyya\" sect. In 1895, another Dungan Revolt (1895–96) broke out, and loyalist Muslims like Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Guoliang, Ma Fulu, and Ma Fuxiang massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan, Ma Yonglin, and Ma Wanfu. A few years later, an Islamic army called the Kansu Braves, led by the general Dong Fuxiang, fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing, Sun Yat-sen proclaimed that the country belonged equally to the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Hui people. In the 1920s, the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia came under the control of Muslim warlords known as the \"Ma clique\", who served as generals in the National Revolutionary Army. During the Cultural Revolution, mosques were often defaced, closed or demolished, and copies of the Quran were destroyed by the Red Guards.\n\nAfter the 1980s Islam experienced a renewal in China, with an upsurge in Islamic expression and the establishment Islamic associations aimed to coordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims. Muslims are found in every province of China, but they constitute a majority only in Xinjiang, and a large amount of the population in Ningxia and Qinghai. Of China's recognised ethnic minorities, ten groups are traditionally Islamic. Accurate statistics on China's Muslim population are hard to find; various surveys found that they constitute 1–2% of the population of China, or between 20 and 30 million people. In the 2010s they were served by 35,000 to 45,000 mosques, 40,000 to 50,000 imams (\"ahong\"), and 10 Quranic institutions.\n\nJudaism (犹太教 \"Yóutàijiào\") was introduced during the Tang dynasty (618-907) or earlier, by small groups of Jews settled in China. The most prominent early community were the so-called Kaifeng Jews, in Kaifeng, Henan province. In the 20th century many Jews arrived in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Harbin, during a period of great economic development of these cities. Many of them sought refuge from anti-Semitic pogroms in the Russian Empire (early 1900s), the communist revolution and civil war in Russia (1917–1918), and anti-Semitic Nazi policy in central Europe, chiefly in Germany and Austria (1937–1940). The last wave of Jewish refugees came from Poland and other eastern European countries in the early 1940s.\n\nShanghai was particularly notable for its numerous Jewish refugees, who gathered in the so-called Shanghai Ghetto. Most of them left China after the war, the rest relocating prior to, or immediately after, the establishment of the People's Republic. Today, the Kaifeng Jewish community is functionally extinct. Many descendants of the Kaifeng community still live among the Chinese population, mostly unaware of their Jewish ancestry, while some have moved to Israel. Meanwhile, remnants of the later arrivals maintain communities in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In recent years a community has also developed in Beijing through the work of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.\n\nSince the late 20th century, along with the study of religion in general, the study of Judaism and Jews in China as an academic subject has blossomed with the establishment of institutions such as Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies and the China Judaic Studies Association.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith (巴哈伊信仰 \"Bāhāyī xìnyǎng\", 巴哈伊教 \"Bāhāyījiào\", or, in old translations, 大同教 \"Dàtóngjiào\") has a presence in China since the 19th century.\n\nHinduism (印度教 \"Yìndùjiào\") entered China around the same time as Buddhism, generally imported by Indian merchants, from different routes. One of them was the \"Silk Route by Sea\" that started from the Coromandel Coast in southeast India and reached Southeast Asia and then southeastern Chinese cities; another route was that from the ancient kingdom of Kamrupa, through upper Burma, reaching Yunnan; a third route is the well-known Silk Route reaching northwest China, which was the main route through which Buddhism spread into China. Archeological remains of Hindu temples and typical Hindu icons have been found in coastal cities of China and in Dali, Yunnan. It is recorded that in 758 there were three Brahminic temples in Guangzhou, with resident brahmins, and Hindu temples in Quanzhou. Remains of Hindu temples have also been discovered in Xinjiang, and they are of an earlier date than those in southeast China.\n\nHindu texts were translated into Chinese, including a large number of Indian Tantric texts and the Vedas, which are known in Chinese as the \"Minglun\" or \"Zhilun\", or through phonetic transliteration as the \"Weituo\", \"Feituo\" or \"Pituo\". Various Chinese Buddhist monks dedicated themselves to the study of Hindu scriptures, thought and practice. In the Sui (581–618) and later Tang dynasty (618–907), Hindu texts translated into Chinese included the \"Śulvasūtra\", the \"Śulvaśāstra\" and the \"Prescriptions of Brahmin Rishis\". The Tibetans contributed with the translation into Chinese of the \"Pāṇinisūtra\" and the \"Rāmāyaṇa\".\n\nIn the 7th century there was an intellectual exchange between Taoists and Shaktas in India, with the translation of the \"Daodejing\" in Sanskrit. Some breathing techniques practised in Shaktism are known as \"Cīnācāra\" (\"Chinese Practice\"), and the Shakta tantras that discuss them trace their origin to Taoism. Two of these tantras report that the Shakta master Vaśiṣṭha paid visit to China specifically with the purpose of learning Cīnācāra from the Taoists. According to the Tamil text \"Śaivāgama\" of Pashupata Shaivism, two of the eighteen \"siddha\" of southern Shaktism, Bogar and Pulipani, were ethnically Chinese. Shaktism itself was practised in China in the Tang period.\n\nThe effect of Hinduism in China is also evident in various gods, originally of Hindu origin, which have been absorbed into the Chinese folk religion. A glaring example is the god Hanuman, who gave rise to the Chinese god \"Hóuwáng\" (猴王 \"Monkey King\"), known as Sun Wukong in the \"Journey to the West\". In the last decades there has been a growth of modern, transnational forms of Hinduism in China: Yogic (\"Yoga\" is rendered as 瑜伽 \"Yújiā\", literally the \"Jade Maiden\"), Tantric, and Krishnaite groups (the \"Bhagavad Gita\" has been recently translated and published in China) have appeared in many urban centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Harbin.\n\nManichaeism (摩尼教 Móníjiào or 明教 Míngjiào, \"bright transmission\") was introduced in China together with Christianity in the 7th century, by land from Central Asia and by sea through south-eastern ports. Based on Gnostic teachings and able to adapt to different cultural contexts, the Manichaean religion spread rapidly both westward to the Roman Empire and eastward to China. Historical sources speak of the religion being introduced in China in 694, though this may have happened much earlier. Manichaeans in China held that their religion was first brought to China by Mōzak under Emperor Gaozong of Tang (650–83). Later, the Manichaean bishop Mihr-Ohrmazd, who was Mōzak's pupil, also came to China, where he was granted an audience by empress Wu Zetian (684–704), and according to later Buddhist sources he presented at the throne the \"Erzongjing\" (\"Text of the Two Principles\") that became the most popular Manichaean scripture in China.\n\nManichaeism had bad reputation among Tang dynasty authorities, who regarded it as an erroneous form of Buddhism. However, as a religion of the Western peoples (Bactrians, Sogdians) it was not outlawed, provided that it remained confined to them not spreading among Chinese. In 731 a Manichaean priest was asked by the current Chinese emperor to make a summary of Manichaean religious doctrines, so that he wrote the \"Compendium of the Teachings of Mani, the Awakened One of Light\", rediscovered at Dunhuang by Aurel Stein (1862–1943); in this text Mani is interpreted as an incarnation of Laozi. As time went on, Manichaeism conflicted with Buddhism but appears to have had good relations with the Taoists; an 8th-century version of the \"Huahujing\", a Taoist work polemical towards Buddhism, holds the same view of the Manichaean Compendium, presenting Mani as Laozi's reincarnation among the Western barbarians.\n\nIn the early 8th century, Manichaeism became the official religion of the Uyghur Khaganate. As Uyghurs were traditional allies of the Chinese, also supporting the Tang during the An Lushan Rebellion at the half of the century, the Tangs' attitude towards the religion relaxed and under the Uyghur Khaganate's patronage Manichaean churches prospered in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Jingzhou, Shaoxing and other places. When the Uyghur Khaganate was defeated by the Kyrgyz in 840, Manichaeism's fortune vanished as anti-foreign sentiment arose among the Chinese. Manichaean properties were confiscated, the temples were destroyed, the scriptures were burnt and the clergy was laicised, or killed, as was the case of seventy nuns who were executed at the Tang capital Chang'an. In the same years all foreign religions were suppressed under Emperor Wuzong of Tang (840–846).\n\nThe religion never recovered from the persecutions, but it persisted as a distinct underground movement at least until the 14th century, particularly among southeastern Chinese, resurfacing from time to time supporting peasant rebellions. The Song dynasty (960–1279) continued to suppress Manichaeism as a subversive cult. In 1120, a rebellion led by Fang La was believed to have been caused by Manichaeans, and widespread crackdown of unauthorised religious assemblies took place. During the subsequent Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), foreign religions were generally granted freedom, but the following Ming dynasty (1368–1644) renewed discriminations against them. Small Manichaean communities are still active in modern China. Manichaeism is thought to have exerted a strong influence on some of the currents of popular sects, such as that which gave rise to Xiantiandao.\n\nZoroastrianism (琐罗亚斯德教 \"Suǒluōyàsīdéjiào\" or 祆教 \"Xiānjiào\", \"Heaven worship teaching\"; also named 波斯教 \"Bōsījiào\", \"Persian teaching\"; also 拜火教 \"Bàihuǒjiào\", \"fire-worshippers' transmission\"; also 白頭教 \"Báitóujiào\", \"old age teaching\") was first introduced in northern China in the 4th century, or even earlier, by the Sogdians, and it developed through three stages. Some scholars provide evidences that would attest the existence of Zoroastrianism, or broader Iranian religion, in China, as early as the 2nd and 1st century BCE. Worship of Mithra was indeed performed at the court of Emperor Wu of Han (187-87 BCE).\n\nThe first phase of Zoroastrianism in China started in the Wei and Jin dynasties of the Northern and Southern dynasties' period (220–589), when Sogdian Zoroastrians advanced into China. They did not proselytise among Chinese, and from this period there are only two known fragments of Zoroastrian literature, both in Sogdian language. One of them is a translation of the \"Ashem Vohu\" recovered by Aurel Stein in Dunhuang and now preserved at the British Museum. The Tang dynasty (618–907) prohibited Chinese people to profess Zoroastrianism, so it remained primarily a religion of foreign residents. Before the An Lushan Rebellion (756–763), Sogdians and Chinese lived as segregated ethnic groups; however, after the rebellion intermarriage became common and the Sogdians were gradually assimilated by the Chinese.\n\nIn addition to the Sogdian Zoroastrians, after the fall of the Sasanid dynasty (651), through the 7th and 8th centuries Iranian Zoroastrians, including aristocrats and \"magi\", migrated to northern China. Fleeing the Islamisation of Iran, they settled in the cities of Chang'an, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Yangzhou, Taiyuan and elsewhere. In the Tang period it is attested that there were at least twenty-nine Zoroastrian fire temples in northern urban centres. During the great purge of foreign religions under Emperor Wuzong of Tang also Zoroastrianism was target of suppression.\n\nThe second phase of Zoroastrianism in China was in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and saw the development of an indigenous Chinese Zoroastrianism that lasted until modern times. During this period, the gods of Sogdian Zoroastrianism were assimilated into the Chinese folk religion; Zoroastrian currents of the Chinese folk religion were increasingly practised by the Chinese and survived until the 1940s. Chinese Zoroastrian temples were witnessed to be active in Hanyang, Hubei until those years.\n\nThe third phase started in the 18th century when Parsi merchants sailed from Mumbai to Macau, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Parsi cemeteries and fire temples were built in these coastal cities, in east China. The Parsis were expelled when the Communist Party of China rose to power in 1949. A Parsi fire temple was built in Shanghai in 1866, and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Starting in the 1980s there has been a new wave of Parsis settling in China.\n\nIn Classical Chinese, Zoroastrianism was first referred to as 胡天 \"Hútiān\", which in the Wei-Jin period became the appellation of all northern nomads. In the early Tang, a new character was invented specifically for Zoroastrianism, 祆 \"xiān\", meaning the \"worship of Heaven\". Curiously, in the Far East the Zoroastrians were regarded as \"Heaven worshippers\" rather than \"fire worshippers\" (in Japanese the name of the religion is \"Kenkyō\", the same as in Chinese). At the time it was rare for the Chinese to create a character for a foreign religion, and this is an evidence of the effect of Zoroastrians in Tang Chinese society.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1945, with the establishment of the Japanese-controlled \"Manchukuo\" (\"Manchu Country\") in northeast China (Manchuria), many shrines of State Shinto (神社, Chinese: \"shénshè\", Japanese: \"jinja\") were established in the area.\n\nThey were part of the project of cultural assimilation of Manchuria into Japan, or Japanisation, the same policy that was being applied to Taiwan. With the end of the Second World War and of the Manchu Country (Manchukuo) in 1945, and the return of Manchuria and Taiwan to China under the Guomindang, Shinto was abolished and the shrines were destroyed.\n\nDuring Japanese rule also many Japanese new religions, or independent Shinto sects, proselytised in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the Omoto teaching, the Tenri teaching and the Konko teaching of Shinto.\n\nChina has a history of schools of thought not relying upon conceptions of an absolute, or putting absolutes into question. Mark Juergensmeyer observes that Confucianism itself is primarily pragmatic and humanist, in it the \"thisworldliness\" being the priority. Given the differences between Western and Chinese concepts of \"religion\", Hu Shih stated in the 1920s what has been translated in Western terminology as \"China is a country without religion and the Chinese are a people who are not bound by religious superstitions\".\n\nThe \"Classic of Poetry\" contains several catechistic poems in the \"Decade of Dang\" questioning the authority or existence of the God of Heaven. Later philosophers such as Xun Zi, Fan Zhen, Han Fei, Zhang Zai, and Wang Fuzhi also criticised religious practices prevalent during their times. During the efflorescence of Buddhism in the Southern and Northern dynasties, Fan Zhen wrote \"On the Extinction of the Soul\" (神灭论 \"Shénmièlùn\") to criticise ideas of body-soul dualism, \"samsara\" and \"karma\". He wrote that the soul is merely an effect or function of the body, and that there is no soul without the body—after the death and destruction of the body. Further, he considered that cause-and-effect relationships claimed to be evidence of \"karma\" were merely the result of coincidence and bias. For this, he was exiled by Emperor Wu of Liang (502–549).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32058165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32058165", "title": "Saltigue", "text": "Saltigue\n\nSaltigue, sometimes spelt \"Saltigué\" or wrongly \"Saltigui\", are Serer high priests and priestesses who preside over the religious ceremonies and affairs of the Serer people, such as the \"Xoy\" ceremony, the biggest event in the Serer religious calendar. They usually come from ancient Serer paternal families. Such a title is usually inherited by birthright. The term \"Saltigi\" is also adopted by the Fula people. They were the leaders of the Fulas in some Fula areas, belonging to the Denianke Dynasty of the Empire of Great Fulo founded by Koli Tengella Bâ in the 16th century. It is proposed that the word \"Saltigi\", used in reference to the Fulas, comes from the Mandinka language, in which it means \"master of the road\", used in reference to their neighbors who are Fulani herders and tenders of the flock, the traditional activity of Fulani leaders. In Serer country, \"Saltigue\", not to be confused with \"Saltigi\", are always diviners. In Wolof areas, they were the assistant chiefs. The scope of this article deals only with \"Saltigue\" or \"Saltigué\" – \"diviners\" (the high priests and priestesses) and termed by some scholars as \"the ministers of the religious cult\"; \"pastors of the people\" or within the remits of these definitions.\n\nThe Saltigues were advisers to Serer governments, for example in the old Serer Kingdoms of Sine, Saloum and Baol. Their principal role was and still is for the prosperity of the country. In this role, they were responsible for predicting the future of kings; the weather to come (for the purposes of agriculture); any natural disaster or political catastrophe that could befall the country; etc. As such, they were frequently consulted by the Serer kings (Maad a Sinig and Maad Saloum) preferably at the beginning of the rainy season.\n\nBefore a king launches a war against another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict the outcome of the battle, as was the case of Saltigué and \"Diaraf\" Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof. The assembly of Saltigues will predict the outcome, offer precautionary advice on when to launch the attack, the route to take to the battlefield and the animals to be sacrificed, etc. The role of Saltigue was not political. They are not government ministers or politicians, but spiritual advisors and elders. They are the Serer hereditary \"Rain priests\" – guardians of the Serer religion and customs, a birthright they inherited from their ancient Lamanic ancestors.\n\nIn the precolonial period, during the \"Raan Festival\" which takes place in Tukar annually on the second Thursday after the onset of the new moon in April, the kings (during the Guelowar period) will attend the Raan Festival of Tukar, making their way from the capital (Diakhao). However, the king was extremely careful never to arrive before the Lamane and always avoid direct encounters with the Lamane of Tukar. Whilst the Lamane was busy self-meditating, touring Tukar and making offerings to the pangool Jegan Joof, the Chief Saltigue and his associates drink \"sum-sum\" alcohol all morning before the Festival. It is reported that drinking \"sum-sum\" improves the Saltigue's vision of the future and the supernatural world.\n\nHaving prepared himself sufficiently, the Saltigue and his close associates leave the house and mount their horses, then start their own tour of some of the sacred places of the country. The Saltigué's tour is programmed to follow the king, but ultimately to cross his path at a location known as 'Nenem\". In this location, the king, aware that the Saltigue is coming, stops the royal entourage. The king and the royal entourage must wait for the Saltigue and his companions to pass. After these high priests and priestesses have passed, the king then gives the signal to the royal entourage to pass as they proceed to their next destination. This is the kind of respect that is afforded to the Saltigue. Scholars like Alioune Sarr note that Saltigues are famously celebrated and respected in Serer Kingdoms because of their knowledge.\n\nThe Lebu people share many cosmo-spiritual beliefs with the Serers. Many Lebu \"rab\" (jinn) are actually Serer \"pangool\" (ancestral spirits or saints). The sacred dwelling place of the Lebu \"rab\" is the same as the Serer \"pangool\" called \"Sangomar\", based on the ancient Serer and Diola legend of \"Jambooñ and Agaire\". – two young sisters whose boat split into half around the Point of Sangomar. One sails to the north, the other sails south. Those traveling south became the ancestors of the Diolas and the other became the ancestor of the Serers. The healing method of the Lebu is called \"ndepp\" while the Serer healing method is called \"Loup\".\n\n"}

At its peak it had a circulation of over 100,000.\n\nAs of May 2013, \"The Jewish Tribune\" had a circulation of 60,500 copies a week which made it, for a time, the largest Jewish weekly publication in Canada. It was distributed in Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Hamilton, and Windsor, both by regular mail and by the internet and is available for free from newspaper boxes, news stands, businesses, synagogues and various outlets, mostly in Jewish neighbourhoods.\n\nPolitically, the newspaper was generally conservative both in Canadian and Israeli politics and may be considered an ideological successor to the \"Jewish Times\", a newspaper published by M.J. Nurenberger from 1974 to 1992 as a right-wing rival to the more centrist \"Canadian Jewish News\".

In Vedic texts, the Tula month is called Issa (IAST: Issa), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations. The solar month of Tula overlaps with its lunar month Kartik, in Hindu lunisolar calendars. The Tula marks the end of monsoon harvests, a period of cooler autumn, a break before the winter crop, and many annual festivals and fairs set by the lunar cycle are observed in and about this part of the calendar across the Indian subcontinent. It is preceded by the solar month of Kanyā, and followed by the solar month of Vṛścik‌‌‌a. The sun, according to the Hindu texts, begins it southward journey and days begin to get shorter.\n\nThe Tula month is called \"Aipassi\" in the Tamil Hindu calendar. The ancient and medieval era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Tula, just like they do with other months. For example, the \"Surya Siddhanta\", dated to c. 400 CE, calculates the duration of Tula to be 29 days, 21 hours, 26 minutes and 24 seconds. In contrast, the \"Arya Siddhanta\" calculates the duration of the Tula month to be 29 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 48 seconds.\n\nThe Indian solar month names are significant in epigraphical studies of South Asia. For example, \"Tula\" month, along with other solar months, are found inscribed in medieval era Hindu temples.\n\nTula is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Libra (astrology).\n"}
