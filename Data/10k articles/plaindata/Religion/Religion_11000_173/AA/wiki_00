The emperors of the dynasty had been, in order, Alexios I Komnenos () (alpha), Ioannes II Komnenos () (iota), and Manuel I (mu) (whose succession was unexpected since he was the fourth son of Ioannes). Because of his belief that his successor's name would have to start with the letter alpha, Manuel had the name Alexios bestowed on Béla, the fiancé of his daughter Maria and his designated heir from 1168 to 1169, when his second wife bore Manuel a son, who was named again in accordance with the prophecy as Alexios II Komnenos (), rather than Ioannes after his paternal grandfather, as was customary among the Byzantines. Manuel also gave the name to at least one and perhaps two of his own illegitimate sons.\n\nThe reign of Alexios II lasted only three years, before he was deposed and killed by his cousin, Andronikos I Komnenos (), with whom, apparently, the AIMA sequence began again. In accordance with this, Andronikos would be succeeded in turn by an emperor whose name began with the letter iota. For that reason, he bypassed his firstborn son Manuel Komnenos in favour of the younger Ioannes, who was crowned co-emperor in 1184. Andronikos also feared his throne would be usurped by another cousin, Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Stephen Hagiochristophorites, the Logothete of the Drome, suspected a different Isaac, Isaac II Angelos (), who had been seen in Constantinople. On September 11, 1185 Hagiochristophorites visited Isaac Angelos at his hideout. Isaac Angelos slew Hagiochristophorites with his sword and fled to Hagia Sophia seeking sanctuary. In the ensuing uprising, Isaac was crowned emperor, while Andronikos was overthrown and killed a few days later.\n\nThe AIMA line continued, however, from Andronikos' eldest son Manuel to his own descendants—the only male-line branch of the Komnenoi to survive the 12th century—the \"Grand Komnenoi\" emperors of Trebizond: Andronikos I, Ioannes as co-emperor, Manuel, who would have been the legitimate successor, and Manuel's son Alexios I Megas Komnenos (), founder of the Empire of Trebizond. The sequence re-appears again with Andronikos I Gidos (), Ioannes I Axouchos (), Manuel Megas Komnenos (), and Andronikos II Megas Komnenos ().\n\n"}
{"id": "2784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2784", "title": "Ahimsa", "text": "Ahimsa\n\nAhimsa (Sanskrit: अहिंसा IAST: ', Pāli: ') means 'not to injure' and 'compassion' and refers to a key virtue in Indian religions. The word is derived from the Sanskrit root \"hiṃs\" – to strike; \"hiṃsā\" is injury or harm, \"a-hiṃsā\" is the opposite of this, i.e. cause no injury, do no harm. Ahimsa is also referred to as nonviolence, and it applies to all living beings—including all animals—in ancient Indian religions.\n\nAhimsa is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of \"ahimsa\".\n\nAhimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' includes one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical literature of Hinduism such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, as well as modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring self-defence. The historic literature from India and modern discussions have contributed to theories of Just War, and theories of appropriate self-defence.\n\nThe word \"Ahimsa\"—sometimes spelled as \"Ahinsa\"—is derived from the Sanskrit root \"hiṃs\" – to strike; \"hiṃsā\" is injury or harm, \"a-hiṃsā\" is the opposite of this, i.e. \"non harming\" or \"nonviolence\".\n\nNonviolence or \"Ahimsa\" is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. It is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of \"Ahimsa\", the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.\n\nParsvanatha, the twenty-third \"tirthankara\" of Jainism, revived, advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC. Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and the last \"tirthankara\" further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara Rushabhdev over a million years ago.\n\nAhimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, \"may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend\".\n\nThe term \"Ahimsa\" appears in the text Taittiriya Shakha of the Yajurveda (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself. It occurs several times in the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" in the sense of \"non-injury\". The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture. The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (\"pashu-Ahimsa\"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.\n\nBowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads. Kaneda gives examples of the word \"Ahimsa\" in these Upanishads. Other scholars suggest \"Ahimsa\" as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.\n\nThe Chāndogya Upaniṣad, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest Upanishads, has the earliest evidence for the Vedic era use of the word \"Ahimsa\" in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against \"all creatures\" (\"sarvabhuta\") and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of rebirths (CU 8.15.1). Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism. Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.\n\nChāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), Danam (charity), Tapo (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).\n\nThe Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: \"Ahimsa\", \"Satya\", \"Asteya\", \"Brahmacharya\", \"Daya\", \"Arjava\", \"Kshama\", \"Dhriti\", \"Mitahara\" and \"Saucha\". According to Kaneda, the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.\n\nThe Mahabharata, one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase \"Ahimsa Paramo Dharma\" (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, Mahaprasthanika Parva has the verse:\n<poem>\nअहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।\nअहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।\nअहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।\nअहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।\nअहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥\n</poem>\nThe above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means:\n<poem>\nAhimsa is the highest virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, \nAhimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, \nAhimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, \nAhimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, \nAhimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.\n</poem>\nSome other examples where the phrase \"Ahimsa Paramo Dharma\" are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.\n\nThe classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.\n\nThe precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.\n\nIn matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.\n\nAlternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.\n\nTähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.\n\nOther scholars conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.\n\nThere is no consensus on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where human's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.\n\nThe Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.\n\nHindu texts dated to 1st millennium BC, initially mention meat as food, then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.\n\nLater texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against \"dharma\" (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the Charaka Samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.\n\nAcross the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.\n\nMany of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.\n\nThe ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits (sannyasins) were urged to live on a fruitarian diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants. Scholars claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.\n\nThe classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, the \"Tirukkural,\" written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. The Kural dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book I to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, vegetarianism, non-harming, and non-killing, respectively. The Kural says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as Shrimad Rajchandraji and Swami Vivekananda emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi promoted the principle of Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics (Swaraj). His non-violent resistance movement satyagraha had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various civil and political rights movements such as the American civil rights movement's Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Bevel. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa. Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, \"Divine Truth\". Sri Aurobindo criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation. \n\nGandhi stated that he viewed \"Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam.\" He added, \"Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism).\" When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, \"I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (... The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis.\"\n\nA historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of Albert Schweitzer's principle of \"reverence for life\". Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for ethics of Ahimsa as, \"the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind\", but suggested that \"not-killing and not-harming\" is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.\n\nAhimsa is imperative for practitioners of Patañjali's eight limb Raja yoga system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five Yamas (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy. Ahimsa is also one of the ten \"Yamas\" in Hatha Yoga according to verse 1.1.17 of its classic manual \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\".\nThe significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in thought, word and deed through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.\n\nIn Jainism, the understanding and implementation of \"Ahimsā\" is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion. Killing any living being out of passions is considered \"hiṃsā\" (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is \"ahimsā\" (noninjury). The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā. In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons (sravakas) who have undertaken \"anuvrata\" (Smaller Vows) than for the Jain monastics who are bound by the Mahavrata \"Great Vows\". The statement \"\" is often found inscribed on the walls of the Jain temples. Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma. When Mahavira revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE, Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. Rishabhanatha (Ādinātha), the first Jain Tirthankara, whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by Parshvanatha (Pārśvanātha) the twenty-third Tirthankara lived in about the 8th century BCE. He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged. Ahimsa was already part of the \"Fourfold Restraint\" (\"Caujjama\"), the vows taken by Parshva's followers. In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa. According to the Jain tradition either lacto vegetarianism or veganism is mandatory.\n\nThe Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.\n\nTheoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.\n\nIn Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and \"non-violence is one's highest religious duty\".\n\nMahatma Gandhi, who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:\nIn Buddhist texts \"Ahimsa\" (or its Pāli cognate ) is part of the Five Precepts (), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.\n\nThe Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth. Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:\n\nUnlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion of a monk from \"sangha\" follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic \"nikaya\" code of conduct.\n\nViolent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism, but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged. The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.\n\nNonviolence is an overriding theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal queen/king as a pacifist, such a queen/king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.\n\nThe early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such. Some argue that a sutta in the \"Gamani Samyuttam\" rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.\n\nSome Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war. One example is the \"Kosala Samyutta\", in which King Pasenadi, a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King Ajatasattu and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of Magadha has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him. Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi \"is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue\", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.\n\nAccording to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.\n\nAccording to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, \"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.\" Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.\n\nThe emperors of Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty and early Song dynasty banned killing in Lunar calendar 1st, 5th, and 9th month. Empress Wu Tse-Tien banned killing for more than half a year in 692. Some also banned fishing for some time each year.\n\nThere were bans after death of emperors, Buddhist and Taoist prayers, and natural disasters such as after a drought in 1926 summer Shanghai and an 8 days ban from August 12, 1959, after the August 7 flood (), the last big flood before the 88 Taiwan Flood.\n\nPeople avoid killing during some festivals, like the Taoist Ghost Festival, the Nine Emperor Gods Festival, the Vegetarian Festival and many others.\n\n\n"}

It spawned two direct-to-video sequels, \"Angels in the Endzone\" and \"Angels in the Infield\".

Due to the much needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their division. Meanwhile, Roger's father permanently gives up custody of his son, believing it's in Roger's best interest.\n\nAs Roger laments his loss, J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sports broadcaster Ranch Wilder that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger's given him. Hoping to destroy George due to a longtime rivalry between the two, Ranch informs the press of this and their owner Hank Murphy threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson about his special ability and at a press conference they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows George to remain as manager of the Angels.\n\nDuring the championship game none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al explains that championships must be played without help from the angels and that he was there just checking on pitcher Mel Clark who will be one of them soon as he has been a chain smoker. Mel starts struggling, and is getting tired after throwing 159 pitches. When George goes out to the mound, everyone thinks he's going in to take Mel out, but instead, George gives him some motivation, and with encouragement from Roger, the team, and finally, the entire stadium audience as well as owner Murphy and the broadcasters.\n\nThe Angels ultimately win the final game of the regular season without the help of the angels and clinch the division pennant over the rival Chicago White Sox, thanks to Mel. Murphy dismisses Ranch because of his denigration of the team. The film ends with George adopting both Roger and J.P. as he wants to try be a father. J.P. sees Al at the window and says \"I knew it could happen.\" Al circles around the house and says \"We're always watching\" and flying off into the stars, which re-enact a baseball game.\n\nThe film has a rating of 35% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10.\n\nUnlike the original film, which focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates as the team in heavenly need, the 1994 remake focuses on the California Angels, who did not exist when the original film was released in 1951. Some scenes in the original film were shot at Wrigley Field (Los Angeles), home of the original Los Angeles Angels (PCL) of the Pacific Coast League. The Walt Disney Company, which distributed it, was a minority owner of the Angels at the time. The film did, however, premiere at the Pirates' home stadium at the time, Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The premiere would be the only reference to the Pirates, due to the two teams playing in separate leagues (Angels in the American League, Pirates in the National League) and the film being released three years before the start of interleague play. The two teams would finally meet head-to-head for the first time in 2002 in Anaheim.\n\nThe film opened at #4 at the North American box office, making $8,916,463 USD in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $50.2 million at the box office domestically.\n\n"}

The precept of \"aparigraha\" is a self-restraint (temperance) from the type of greed and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.\n\nAparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of dāna (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.\n\nAparigraha is a compound in Sanskrit, made of \"\"a-\" and \"parigrah\". The prefix \"a-\"\" means \"non-\", so \"\"aparigrah\" is the opposite of \"parigrah\"\", so \"aparigraha\" is speech and actions that oppose and negate \"parigraha.\"\n\nThe word \"parigrah\" means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others. The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes. The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first \"tirthankara\" in Jainism, Rishabhdeva.\n\nMonier-Williams states that the word \"parigraha\" has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something. In the Brahmanas and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others. In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.\n\nThe virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as \"abstaining from accepting gifts\", \"not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person\", and \"not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted\". The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness, and non-possessiveness. Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of \"letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears\" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.\n\nAparigraha is one of the virtues in Jainism. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (\"Śrāvaka\") and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (\"parimita-parigraha\") and limiting one’s desires (\"iccha-parimana\").\n\nIn Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires. Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy. Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence. Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life. After ahiṃsā, Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.\n\nIn the Yoga Sūtras (II.30), \"aparigraha\" is listed as the fifth Yamas or code of self-restraint, after with Ahimsa (nonviolence), Satya (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), Asteya (not stealing), and Brahmacharya (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).\n\nAparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (\"yamas\", \"the don'ts\") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (\"niyamas\", \"the dos\") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten \"yamas\" and \"niyamas\", these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts. It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.\n\nJames Wood states, \"aparigraha\" is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in \"acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them\". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature. Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,\n\nRestraint from possessiveness and greed, or \"aparigraha\", leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins. The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of Sādhanā, path of spiritual existence. In outer world, \"aparigraha\" manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.\n\nSome suggest \"aparigraha\" implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.\n\nScholars suggest \"aparigraha\" allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.\n\nAsteya is also one of the five vows taken by Jain ascetic monks to attain liberation. It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else. Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.\n\n"}

{"id": "7382910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7382910", "title": "Astrological symbols", "text": "Astrological symbols\n\nSymbols used in astrology overlap with those used in astronomy because of the historical overlap between the two subjects. Frequently used symbols include signs of the zodiac and for the classical planets. These have their origin in medieval Byzantiny, but in their current form are a product of the European Renaissance. Other symbols for astrological aspects are used in various astrological traditions.\n\nSymbols for the classical planets, zodiac signs, aspects, lots, and the lunar nodes appear in the medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved. In the original papyri of these Greek horoscopes, there were found a circle with the glyph representing shine() for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon. The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri. The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the initial letters of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized caduceus. A. S. D. Maunder finds antecedents of the planetary symbols in earlier sources, used to represent the gods associated with the classical planets. \"Bianchini's planisphere\", produced in the 2nd century, shows Greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols: Mercury has a caduceus; Venus has, attached to her necklace, a cord connected to another necklace; Mars, a spear; Jupiter, a staff; Saturn, a scythe; the Sun, a circlet with rays radiating from it; and the Moon, a headdress with a crescent attached. A diagram in Johannes Kamateros' 12th century \"Compendium of Astrology\" shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter \"zeta\" (the initial of Zeus, Jupiter's counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. The modern sun symbol, pictured as a circle with a dot (☉), first appeared in the Renaissance.\n\nSymbols for Uranus and Neptune were created shortly after their discovery. For Uranus, two variant symbols are seen. One symbol, , invented by J. G. Köhler and refined by Bode, was intended to represent the newly discovered metal platinum; since platinum, sometimes confused with white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for iron, ♂, and gold, ☉. Another symbol, , was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name\"). After Neptune was discovered, the Bureau des Longitudes proposed the name Neptune and the familiar trident for the planet's symbol.\n\nThe astrological symbols for the first three objects discovered at the beginning of the 19th century —Ceres, Pallas, and Juno—were also created after their discovery. Firstly, they were listed as planets, and half a century later, renamed as Asteroids. Shortly after Giuseppe Piazzi's discovery of Ceres, a group of astronomers ratified the name, proposed by the discoverer, and chose the sickle as a symbol of the planet. The symbol for Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, and introduced in his \"Monatliche Correspondenz zur Beförderung der Erd- und Himmels-Kunde\". Karl Ludwig Harding, who discovered and named Juno, assigned to it the symbol of a scepter topped with a star.\n\nThe modern astrological symbol for Vesta was created by Eleanor Bach, who is credited with pioneering the use of the Big Four asteroids with the publication of her \"Ephemerides of the Asteroids\". Bach's symbol for Vesta is a simplified version of other representations of Vesta's altar. The original form of the symbol for Vesta, , was created by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Olbers, having previously discovered and named one new planet (as the asteroids were then classified), gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the planet for the goddess Vesta, and also specified that the symbol should be the altar of the goddess with the sacred fire burning on it.\n\nPluto, like Uranus, has multiple symbols in use. One symbol, a monogram of the letters \"PL\" (which could be interpreted to stand for Pluto or for astronomer Percival Lowell), was announced with the name of the new planet by the discoverers on May 1, 1930. Another symbol, which was popularized in Paul Clancy's astrological publications, is based on the symbol for Mercury, with the circle and arc of Mercury trading positions. This symbol is described by Dane Rudhyar as \"suggest[ing] the planetary character of the Pluto mind by the circle, floating above the open cup.\" Although, this meaning is readily debatable due to Blavatskian origins, rather than a properly traditional understanding, such as may be found in the hermetic sciences.\n\nThe symbol for the centaur Chiron, a key with the letter K (for discoverer Charles T. Kowal) was proposed by astrologer Al Morrison, who presented the symbol as \"an inspiration shared amongst Al H. Morrison, Joelle K.D. Mahoney, and Marlene Bassoff.\"\n\nThe symbol for retrograde motion is ℞, a capital R with a tail stroke. An R with a tail stroke was used to abbreviate many words beginning with the letter R; in medical prescriptions, it abbreviated the word \"recipe\" (from the Latin imperative of \"recipere\" \"to take\"), and in missals, an R with a tail stroke marked the responses.\n\nThe glyphs of the planets are usually (but not always) broken down into four common elements: A circle denoting spirit, a crescent denoting the mind, a cross denoting practical/physical matter and an arrow denoting action or direction.\n\nThe Hamburg School of Astrology, also called Uranian Astrology, is a sub-variety of western astrology. It adds eight hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets to the normal ones used by western astrologers:\n\nIn astrology, an aspect is an angle the planets make to each other in the horoscope, also to the ascendant, midheaven, descendant, lower midheaven, and other points of astrological interest. The following symbols are used to note aspect:\n\nIn addition to the aspect symbols above, some Russian astrologers use additional or unique aspect symbols:\n\n\n"}

The course has been described as helping \"Christians develop an informed response to the religious and cultural diversity around them by being centered in their faith and secure in their identity.\" It is co-written by retired bishop Michael Marshall and Nadim Nassar, who is the only Syrian priest in the Church of England.\n\nThe Awareness Course has been taught in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine in the Middle East and in Hong Kong. Denominations offering the Awareness Course include the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Episcopal Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist churches, Middle Eastern Evangelical churches, and several charismatic evangelical churches in the UK. Teachers are known as \"course leaders\" and their role is primarily that of a facilitator and motivator rather than lecturer.\n\nThe Awareness Course comprises a number of course modules or varying lengths:\n\n1. 8 Session DVD Module\n\nEight sessions designed to last 60 to 90 minutes each depending on the Course Leader. Every session includes two 12 to 16 minute videos presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos for The Diversity Code feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.\n\na. The Diversity Code\n\nToday, diversity is a major issue for us all. The Diversity Code uses a series of ‘Biblical Case Studies’ to reveal the wonderful examples for dealing positively with diversity that Jesus set throughout His life and teachings, as did St Paul. The course also studies the lessons learned by the early Church as she struggled to accept her universal mission.\n\n2. 5 Session Module (Suitable For Lent)\n\nFive sessions designed to last 60 minutes each. Every session includes one 15 minute video presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.\n\na. Living in a Global Village\n\nThis shorter course examines how participants can affirm their faith in the midst of a new, globalised world. The sessions cover topics such as hospitality & generosity in faith, preaching the Gospel by living it in our daily lives, and how we can celebrate difference and diversity without having to compromise our faith. Originally marketed as a Lent course, Living in a Global Village is described as being \"suitable for any time of the year\".\n\n3. Day/Half-Day Workshop\n\nDesigned to last either a complete day or half a day according to the Course Leader’s wishes. The workshop includes four 15 minute videos presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.\n\na. Speak Out!\n\nThis workshop is subtitled, ‘How to articulate our faith, and why’. To live an abundant life, Christians must reclaim their faith and be able to relate its meaning and its joys to others. Participants study why we should openly and respectfully share our faith, and how we can do so positively with people of other faiths and none. The Foundation say that 'Speak Out!' is intended to \"help people of faith to understand the need for us to be able to speak about our faith to others, especially in today's increasingly fragmented world, and to guide people in how to speak out whilst retaining respect for people of other faiths, or none.\"\n\n“Christians must be able to speak out with authority about their faith and how it applies to the real issues of the day,” says Nadim Nassar, the Director of the Awareness Foundation and author of the course materials.\n\nThe workshop, which features powerful videos with speakers from the three Abrahamic faiths, enables participants over half a day to understand the importance of their own role in spreading the message that faith matters, and that the true values of the Abrahamic faiths are love, forgiveness, respect and understanding.\n\nEach module is packaged as DVD which contains the teaching videos, a course leader's book (approximately 32 pages) plus study sheets for those attending the course. These modules are available without charge within the UK.\n\nMichael Marshall is President of the Awareness Foundation and Nadim Nassar is director. They are co-founders of the Awareness Foundation and co-authors of the Awareness Course. The director of the Awareness Course is the foundation's operations director, St John Wright, who has been with the Awareness Foundation since 2004; he is the son of British jazz guitarist Denny Wright.\n"}

{"id": "27367714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27367714", "title": "Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans", "text": "Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans has a history reaching back to the lifetime of `Abdu'l-Bahá and has multiplied its relationships across the Americas. Individuals have joined the religion and institutions have been founded to serve Native Americans and conversely have Native Americans serve on Bahá'í institutions.\n\nBy 1963 Bahá'í sources claim members of some 83 tribes of Native Americans had joined the religion. In North America diversification is an ever-present theme in Bahá'í history. Native American Indians have been attracted to the Bahá'í Faith in increasing numbers since the 1940s; currently there are several thousand Indian and Eskimo Bahá'ís, especially in rural Alaska and among the Navajo and Lakota peoples. Among the Central and South American indigenous there are also substantial populations of native Bahá'ís. There is an estimate of some 8,000 Guaymi Bahá'is in the area of Panama, about 10% of the population of Guaymi in Panama. An informal summary of the Wayuu (a tribe living in La Guajira Desert) community in 1971 showed about 1000 Bahá'ís. The largest population of Bahá'ís in South America is in Bolivia, a country whose population is estimated to be 55%–70% indigenous and 30%–42% Mestizo, with a Bahá'í population estimated at 206,000 in 2005 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives.\n\nShoghi Effendi, head of the religion 1921–1957, stated: \"The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh, the followers of his Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society.\"\n\nIn principle, a Bahá'í can certainly affirm that Messengers of God have indeed been sent to all peoples, according to Bahá'í belief, but that there is simply no conclusive way to attest legendary culture heroes individually. Under no circumstances does this prevent a real appreciation of such legends, and of the spiritual and cultural values enshrined in them. Thus, Bahá'í authorities may consider adding the \"category\" of (rather than \"names\" of) Messengers of God to First Nations, or Messengers of God to Indigenous Peoples. The problem now is no longer the principle, but rather the question of \"names\". \n\nThe National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Canada took a position of advocacy on behalf of First Nations Canadians in its formal submission to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in the fall of 1993 on behalf of indigenous people (not in relation to their religion, per se.) Bahá'í pioneers to regions with aboriginal peoples have extended Bahá'í universalism in religion to a recognition of the richness and authenticity of native cultural values. Individual Bahá'ís are free to express their own understanding, but this does not imply endorsement by the institutions of the religion though such recognition has been supported by local Bahá'í policy validating the concept of First Nations Manifestations of God. Explicit recognition of individual native messengers of God has yet to be formalised in Bahá'í doctrine. The quote from an authenticated source most directly reflecting on the issue is:\n\nIn this particular context, the expression \"Call of God\" () is a transparent, according to Christopher Buck, reference to Prophets of God and who give revelation. Scholars like Susan Maneck and William Collins have taken note of the strength of this quote. However the language is not specific. The Universal House of Justice notes that \"The Bahá'í Teachings do not explicitly confirm, nor do they rule out, the possibility that Messengers of God have appeared in the Americas. In the absence of a clear Text the Universal House of Justice has no basis for issuing the kind of statement you propose which would confirm, \"in principle, that God sent Manifestations to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\"\" Nevertheless the figure of Deganawida, The Great Peacemaker, is mentioned as a leading example in scholarly research; others mentioned by individuals include Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha. David Ruhe, a former member of the Universal House of Justice, has written mentioning his own view of Deganawida as a Prophet. Since no individual or institution can add to Bahá'í scripture it is impossible to add a specific name to a list of accepted Manifestations of God that would be binding on all Bahá'ís and Bahá'í institutions. However individuals and institutions may accept for their own purposes that various cultural heroes may have been in fact a Manifestation of God and Bahá'ís and institutions of the religion can accept the fact that sacred Indian tradition has mentioned specific names for individuals acting in the role of a Prophet.\n\nIn 1986 North American Bahá'í Lee Brown gave a talk at the 1986 Bahá'í \"Continental Indigenous Council\" held at Tanana Valley Fairgrounds, Fairbanks, Alaska, which was recorded and transcribed—it includes his interpretation of Native American, especially Hopi, prophecies. Brown also appeared with Martha Many Grey Horses on a Bahá'í program discussing these prophecies.\n\nGuaymi Bahá'ís have stated there are prophecies from their own tribe's religion that they interpret to relate to the Bahá'í Faith. The prophecies of the Chilam Balam have been examined as well.\n\nThere has been comment among prominent Bahá'ís about the White Buffalo Calf Woman and the appearance of the white buffalo.\n\nChief Albert Isaac of Aishihik is recorded as having identified a near death experience of his in 1957 with the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nThe first dated contact between the Bahá'í Faith and Indigenous Americans was second hand through the life of Honoré Jackson who had been involved in a First Nations protest movement in Canada circa the early 1880s and then in the later 1890s joined the religion but after some efforts in Canada in the New York area he was not much heard of after circa 1910.\n\nIn 1912 then head of the religion `Abdu'l-Bahá took a journey to the West from what was then Palestine. On one leg of his trips as he was leaving Canada, on the way back to the States, and he traveled through several villages. As the train passed through the town of Belleville, Ontario, a four-year-old Mohawk boy, Jimmy Loft, was sitting on a fence as the train passed. `Abdu'l-Bahá took that moment to stand up and, facing the window, smile and wave. Loft was so surprised he toppled off the fence. In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bahá'ís of Canada.\n\nDuring his tour of North America, `Abdu'l-Bahá gave a talk on September 2, 1912 in the Montreal home of William Sutherland Maxwell (later named a Hand of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi in 1951) and May Maxwell, the parents of Mary Maxwell, the future Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum, wife of Shoghi Effendi.\n\nConsider this Canadian country during the early history of Montreal when the land was in its wild, uncultivated and natural condition. The soil was unproductive, rocky and almost uninhabitable—vast forests stretching in every direction. What invisible power caused this great metropolis to spring up amid such savage and forbidding conditions? It was the human mind. Therefore, nature and the effect of nature's laws were imperfect. The mind of man remedied and removed this imperfect condition, until now we behold a great city instead of a savage unbroken wilderness. Before the coming of Columbus America itself was a wild, uncultivated expanse of primeval forest, mountains and rivers—a very world of nature. Now it has become the world of man. It was dark, forbidding and savage; now it has become illumined with a great civilization and prosperity. Instead of forests, we behold productive farms, beautiful gardens and prolific orchards. Instead of thorns and useless vegetation, we find flowers, domestic animals and fields awaiting harvest. If the world of nature were perfect, the condition of this great country would have been left unchanged.\n\nA tablet of Abdu'l-Bahá's undated but certainly before his death in 1921 and probably after 1892, is called the Tablet to Amr Khan, in which he acknowledges that \"the Call of God\" must have arisen in the Americas though its spiritual affect had been forgotten.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá also wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in \"Star of the West\" magazine on December 12, 1919. After mentioning the need for the message of the religion to visit the Latin American countries `Abdu'l-Bahá continued:\n\nAttach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muḥammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Muḥammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world ...\n\nFollowing the Tablets and about the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's passing in 1921, a few other Bahá'ís began moving to, or at least visiting, Latin or South America. First Martha Root followed by Leonora Armstrong were among the first to make this trips before 1928.\n\nThe next known contact between Indians and Bahá'ís is the case of Albert T. Freeman, also known as Gai-wah-go-wah, who was an award winning orator as an Indian of the Lakota people in 1917. He was soon a graduate of Depauw University and visible as a Christian and an actor. Around 1920-1924 he was a student at University of Southern California and took up the Chautauqua educational speaker platforms similar to Nipo T. Strongheart of the Yakama Nation. Many of his talks were at Churches though some were at museums but in 1926 on a tour of the West he gave a lecture/performance at the Bahá'í center in Portland Oregon and was then invited from there to present at the Bahá'í national convention. He continued on afterwards in various churches and colleges into the 1930s. Record of his service has been noted in educational materials in recent decades.\n\nSara E. Whitt was held the leader of a series of banquets in cooperation with the Local Assembly of Los Angeles \"widening the circle of racial amity activities so as to include not only the white and coloured, but the red Indians, aborigines of America, also the Chinese and Japanese ...\" A number of banquets were held - one on Feb 27, 1932 was noted with particular prominence with Nellie S. French representing the national assembly and Luther Standing Bear offered a prayer and spoke on peace. Other speakers included Robert Theiss, Joseph R. Scherer, Emmett R. Smith, J. Kam Machida, W. J. Clarendon, Nipo Strongheart, and Willard P. Hatch and a farewell by Shahnaz Waite.\n\nShoghi Effendi, who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin and its first large focus was the entire southern American region and its peoples. In his cable he wrote:\n\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\n\nFollowing the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís communities and assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America.\n\nAcross the Americas by 1947 the Bahá'í Faith had contacted peoples among the Eskimos of Alaska and Greenland, the Cree Indians of Prairie Provinces, Canada, the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, the Oneida Indians in Wisconsin, the Omaha Indians in Nebraska, the Seminole Indians in Florida, the Mexican Indians in Mexico, the Indians of the San Blas Islands, the Indians of Chichicastenango in Guatemala, the Mayans in Yucatán, the Patagonian Indians in Argentina, the Indians of La Paz in Bolivia and the Inca Indians in Peru. In 1944 Gerardo Vega, of Costa Rica, was the first Latin-American native to pioneer when he began work in Panama. Regional committees overseeing various countries of Latin and South America were appointed. Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. Back in North America, the first all-Indian assembly in the Americas was first established in 1948 on the Omaha Indian Reservation at Macy, Nebraska. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. Shoghi Effendi then called for two international conventions to be held at April 1951; one was held in Panama City for the purpose of electing a regional National Spiritual Assembly\n\nThe nineteenth objective of that portion of the Ten Year Crusade entrusted in 1953 to the American Bahá'í Community by its architect was the \"conversion to the Faith of members of the leading Indian tribes.\" In August 1957 Shoghi Effendi reminded the regional assembly of the comment of Abdu'l-Baha and would therefore \"devote considerable energy\" on the matter. A Bahá'í made a trip to Dominica specifically to try to reach the Carib Indians on May 7, 1959. In Mexico in March 1957 the first Indians joining the religion are noted. A committee focused on that need was active by April 1958 in making contacts and translating materials. Bahá'í observers were welcomed at an Inter-American Indian Congress in the city of Guatemala in 1959 thanks to their contacts with local versions of inter-American Indian institutes in the region and included opportunities for sharing native and Spanish translations of Bahá'í pamphlets. The first all-Indian assembly of Mexico was elected in San Rafael Comac near Cholula, Puebla in 1960. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga specifically visited this assembly in May 1961.\n\nBy 1961 a number of developments had been achieved. There was the election of the Bolivian national assembly—representative of a community the vast majority of whom were of the Aymara people. Some thirteen hundred of these Indians, in over one hundred localities had joined the religion and over twenty local assemblies in Bolivia had been elected. There were elections of Indian assemblies in Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico—regions of the former Incas, Mayas, and Aztecs and the formation four assemblies representative of Canadian Indians in the Yukon, Alberta and Saskatchewan. At that time there were over forty Indian and Eskimo tribes represented in the Bahá'í Community throughout the Western Hemisphere—more than double the number in 1957. In 1961 each country of a regional assembly of southern South America elected its own National Spiritual Assembly. In 1961 the Hands of the Cause of the Americas took special note of the spread of the religion among the Indians across the continents. Paraguay's national convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, Dr. Ramatu'llah Muhajir. At the convention Dr. Muhajir and the delegates drew up plans for reaching the Indian populations as well as ways to reinforce the communities that already existed. Still in 1961 the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama sent two official representatives, Edna Moses and Donald R. Witzel, to a congress of natives on the San Blas Islands. The Bahá'ís presented an outline of the religion. A chief countered that other religionists had presented their religions as a means to divide the people from their tribal religion.\n\nBefore 1963 the first two all-Indian Local Spiritual Assemblies in South America were Huanuni and then Vilcollo, Bolivia—by 1963 there were twenty five such assemblies in Bolivia and about 1000 Baha'is among the Bolivian Indian peoples. A team formed to promulgate the religion—a chief of the Peigan Reserve, also chair of its first Bahá'í assembly, and an elected member of the Band Council for the Peigan Band of the Blackfoot and John Hellson, a Bahá'í formerly of Cornwall, England, now of Alberta, who is an adopted member of the Mohawk nation. Together they carried letters of introduction to the chiefs of all the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Ontario and Quebec and were welcomed with a special ceremony on some of the Reserves. Their itinerary included Reserves of Nanaimo and Capilano of British Columbia, Ohsweken, Kettle Point, Tyendinaga, and Curve Lake of Ontario, and Kahnawake, Quebec.\n\nBy 1963 there was a small group in Pedro Juan Caballero in Costa Rica and some of whom were from the \"Caygüa\", who were possibly the Kadiweu people. In the United States, following initial presences among several Indian nations in the 1950s, in late February 1963 a gathering of Indian Bahá'ís in Arizona for a \"Great Council Fire\", which was attended by Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem at a time when members of 34 American tribes were represented within the Bahá'í Faith and twenty six were present. Asking attendees who had most recently joined the religion to speak up, and echoing a Bahá'í teaching on the unity of religions, Strongheart said:\n\nIn the national convention of 1964 of Costa Rica members of the Talamanca and Terraba were among the delegates. The first native American Bahá'í of Paraguay, Rosendo Segundo, joined the religion in 1964. Segundo was a member of the Guarani of the Chaco tribe. A national plan of the Bahá'ís of the United States in 1964 included officially translating basic literature of the religion \"for an increasing number of American Indian believers\" and later added a goal to raise the number of assemblies, local organizational and administrative units of the religion, on reservations. In 1965 actual contact with the Chaco tribe began. Grandchildren of Sitting Bull and Bull Head were noted as friends in meetings in 1966. A Pennacook Indian, Gerard Morin aka Little Bishop, presented on local Indian culture in Green Acre Bahá'í School in 1966. A multi-national group including an Indian toured North Bay, Ontario, Canada, in 1967. In 1969 members of the Chulupi speaking and Lengua tribes had converted to the religion and first all-Indian institute in northern Gran Chaco area, in Paraguay with members of the Guarani, Guasurango, (a Tapieté speaking) and Chulupi attending. In 1970 the first Yanaigua (another Tapieté speaking) tribe member joined the religion and that year was first time an indigenous Bahá'í was elected to the national assembly, (in 1982 there were three indigenous members of the national assembly.) In February 1970 pioneer family of Samuel and Teresa Garcia and their four children, native Costa Ricans, in February 1970 to the area of Guanacaste seeking to identify members of lapsed communities. Come April 1970 eight Local Assemblies were re-established following which a number of programs were initiated to solidify the understanding of some of these new Bahá'ís.\n\nIn 1975–6 Rúhíyyih Khanum travelled by boat through the tributaries of the Amazon River of Brazil and also visiting the high mountain ranges of Peru and Bolivia. Thirty six tribal groups were visited over a period of six months; the trip was called \"The Green Light Expedition,\" which followed Khanum's \"The Great African Safari.\" There have also been projects developed from the original expedition - \"In the Footsteps of the Green Light Expedition\" and \"Tear of the Clouds\". And in 1977 a radio campaign began in Paraguay. The first Guaymí Bahá'í dates back into the 1960s, and since the 1980s there have been several projects started and evolving in those communities.\n\nFebruary 1977 a conference looking at promulgating the religion in Mexico also took place in Mérida with more than 2000 Bahá'ís attending. One third of the participants were indigenous believers from across Central America 150 of whom were Mayans. Non-Bahá'í family members of the Indians were allowed to fully attend the meeting. Three Hands of the Cause were present - Paul Haney, Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir, and Enoch Olinga, as well as Counsellor Florence Mayberry who had been on the first national assembly of Mexico. From 1978 a series of Indian \"Council Fires\" began to be held and initiatives adopted - see below.\n\nIn 1990 the first assembly entirely composed of indigenous people in Brazil was elected from the Mura people in Beruri, Brazil. In 1994 Elizabeth Dahe, a long-time Bahá'í and Hopi elder, invited the other Hopi elders to gather and meet Kevin Locke who presented the claims of the Bahá'í Faith directly to 100 Hopi elders. Bahá'ís claim nearly half of the Chilean Bahá'í community is of the indigenous Mapuche people.\n\nBahá'ís in Cape Dorset acted with support and coordination through the spiritual assembly of the Omaha Reservation and of Springfield Illinois. And an assembly was elected in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin.\n\nThe cultural norms in the Bahá'í Faith have gone through major transitions. The first occurred at about the turn of the 20th century when the religion became known beyond its mainly Muslim Middle-Eastern population and spread to Christian North America and Europe. The foundations of this achievement had been laid from the earliest days of the new religion when Bahá'u'lláh in two of his writings from the Baghdad period addressed Christian issues. Then towards the end of the nineteenth century, the famous Bahá'í scholar, Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl, extended these foundations by writing extensively on Bahá'í approaches to the New and Old Testaments. This was followed by the conversion of numerous Jews, in Iran, and Christians, in Syria and Egypt, to the religion. It was Syrian Christian converts in particular who were largely responsible for taking the Bahá'í Faith to Christian North America, from where there was further spread to Europe and Australia. See also `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West. The second major breakthrough started post-World War II when the religion began to spread rapidly in the villages of the Third World. Some idea of the extent of this comparatively sudden change can be gleaned from the fact that prior to 1954, approximately 94% of the world Bahá'í population consisted of Iranians. By 1989, that figure is about 7% while Bahá'ís from the non-Muslim Third World represent some 90% of the Bahá'ís.\n\nIn Latin and South America the religion spread in the 1940s following specific plans of promulgating the religion. A stated purpose for the coordinating committees appointed to oversee the process was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. However a period of \"re-activating\" core communities was necessary in 1950, while other communities failed to re-elect their institutions initially though the regional committees continued operation. Nevertheless regional National Spiritual Assemblies for the region were elected in 1950 and 1951. By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly.\n\nIn Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s. It was emphasized that western pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. Enoch Olinga is specifically mentioned as an example of this process unfolding as he arose out of Uganda and repeated the quick growth of the religion. Because of the successive waves of people becoming Knights of Bahá'u'lláh, Enoch Olinga was entitled \"Abd'l-Futuh\", a Persian name meaning \"the father of victories\" by Shoghi Effendi though he too implemented changes in character by giving up alcoholism and eventually polygamy.\n\nIn India where the Bahá'í message had for decades been primarily addressed to Indian Muslims and Parsees (Zoroastrians), a re-interpretation of the Bahá'í message in accordance with Hindu ideas was necessary to reach the masses of Hindus. India became the largest Bahá'í community in the world in 2000 after less than a century of mass teaching though it also entailed systematically reaching a large community of Untouchables or Harijans. See Bahá'í Faith in India.\n\nUnlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country in the United States, the Bahá'í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised their great past. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that \n\"[The Bahá'í Faith] does not deny the validity of native Indian beliefs, [and] ... appeals to many Indians who are seeking a religion that is neither exclusively Indian nor dominated by white values and customs.\" However another researcher observed in 2007: \"Most white Canadians and Americans have no clue with respect to how constantly they reinforce their own cultural assumptions, right or wrong, and pile them upon Indians, never willing or even interested in hearing our own Native view. I agree that the Bahá'ís in Canada and the U.S. have made some good headway in the honoring and validating native spiritual prophecies and principles. However, much more transformation along the lines of intercultural interactions within the Bahá'í international community needs to take place. In particular, I am referring specifically to most (but not all) of our non-Native Bahá'ís who find it impossible to break through the inner barriers of their own Euro-American culture.\"\n\nPatterns of encounters between non-Aboriginal Baha'is and Aboriginal people in British Columbia were studied and the result demonstrated a middle ground between romanticization and violent confrontation was possible, though not fully realized. However, in the words of an historian the encounter with the religion \"has nevertheless served as a potent source of empowerment for Aboriginal adherents.\" The traditions of the people weren't left and again served to solidify community. But there is progress in appreciation of Indian cultural and spiritual experience coming through Bahá'í publishing channels just as there has been of Islam over a century ago.\n\nBahá'í radio in Ecuador evolved as a way to serve the thousands of converts in the late 1960s and 1970s. A native of Otavalo, Ecuador and chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador investigated using radio as a tool for spreading the religion and serving the newly forming communities. In early 1973, Raul Pavon leased Radio Turismo station and initiated fourteen hours of daily broadcasts. None involved had backgrounding in running a radio station. Initial success was based on playing local and national music genre. In July 1973 the national assembly added the goal of a radio station to its budget and a committee to create programing. Programming was developed and aired in eight cities between 15-minute segments up to hour-long bilingual (Spanish-Quichua) programs of Bahá'í prayers, and drawing from Bahá'í literature as well as information of its world-wide community. In 1975, training workshops were organized for scriptwriters. Other trainings continued in 1976. By 1976 the committee had produced 1286 hours of programming at a cost of approximately $2000 as well as documentation to support sister projects. A low-power AM radio station which was finally granted in 1977. There were challenges of coordination and staffing to overcome. Outside trainers or professional staff were able to come in 1977, 1978, and 1980. A commission was developed, typically including a body composed of an indigenous person, a \"white\" person, technical experts, senior Bahá'ís and a veteran of the station, with a balance of majority of local people while also one member to be literate and capable of dealing with the administration of the commission.\n\nWith regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the Bahá'í World Centre, progress was maintained and Dr. David Ruhe, then a member of the Universal House of Justice, visited in 1980 and acted as liaison between the radio station and the Audio-Visual Department at the Bahá'í administrative offices. In 1980 almost the entire staff traveled to Peru to make extensive presentations to the international Bahá'í media conference in Puno where the second Bahá'í Radio station would be set up. It was not until 1981 that a suitable director was able to take up service by combining the qualities of being a Bahá'í, an experienced radio professional, and an Ecuadoran and able to volunteer. In addition to Quinteros, six other indigenous had systematically begun to serve at the station as full-time staff as well as larger numbers of part-time staff amounting to some 200 persons including indigenous youth in the first four years of the operation of the station. Indigenous staff were able to conduct workshops for other indigenous staff, in Spanish and Quichua, for the first time in 1981. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. The Commission wrote to the Chilean Bahá'ís about the development of their radio station that:\n\nThe most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it.\n\nBy 1983 training of staff at Radio Bahá'í Ecuador was almost entirely in the hands of indigenous staff. There has also been training at the Amoz Gibson Training Center for Bahá'í Media in Puerto Rico operated by CIRBAL (Centro para Intercambio Radiofonico Bahá'í de America Latina.)\n\nIn 1978 some 60 Native Bahá'ís and their pioneer friends (40 of whom were from Navajo-Hopi land) attended the U.S. Bahá'í National Convention at the invitation of the U.S. National Spiritual Assembly to honor the achievement of winning the first goal of the 5-Year-Plan—the establishment of 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies on Indian Reservations. They wanted to build a \"Bahá'í place\" on the Navajo Reservation, and they wanted the Convention to show their support. With the assent of the Convention, the National Spiritual Assembly members hurriedly met and announced their approval of this new institution. Two years later, the Houck, Arizona property was secured and the institute became manifest. Named the Native American Bahá'í Institute (NABI) by the National Spiritual Assembly, NABI was designated an agency of the National Spiritual Assembly thereby becoming one of the five permanent school and institutes. Over the years it has been focused upon various goals. Since 1998, it has been designated a Regional Training Institute by the National Spiritual Assembly, and has been immersed in advancing the goals of the Training Institute process among Native Americans. In 2001 it began publishing the Navaho–Hopi Bahá'í Newsletter. In 2005 a socio-economic development project carried out at NABI was \"Media Training Pilot\" which trained youth to conduct film interviews of two Navajo artists which was released as a local video. Arya Laghaie was a volunteer who is buried there in 2007.\n\nFrom May to August 2000 \"Spirit Runners\" extended the engagement of native Bahá'ís, and one of the members of the \"Trail of Light\" expeditions, traveling across North America from Seattle, Washington to Shinnecock, New York.\n\nThere have been successive trips by groups from the 1990s into 2002 when the Native American Bahá'í Institute hosted a gathering for \"Trail\" travelers.\n\nIn late February 1963 Native Bahá'ís and others gathered for a \"Great Council Fire\" which was attended by Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem at a time when members of some 34 American tribes were represented within the religion and twenty six were present.\n\nDuring the international convention for the election of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa in April 1978 a meeting was held with representatives of the other circumpolar national Bahá'í communities: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark (on behalf of Greenland), and Canada. It was decided then to form a \"Continental Indigenous Council\" committee under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska, and a four-member Eskimo-Indian team was formed to travel for 45 days in 10 European countries during the summer. The Indian members of the team were Scott Tyler of the United States and Melba Loft of Canada; the Eskimos were Ida Bergamaschi and Maynard Eakan of Alaska. The idea for the Trail of Light occurred during preparations for the first Baha'i Native Council, held in 1978 on the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington State when the national assemblies of Canada, Alaska and the United States were discussing the event. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the Pacific Rim that was described by the Hand of the Cause Rahmátu'llah Muhájir in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as \"Camino del Sol\", was defined as a process whereby native Bahá'ís engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first \"Trail of Light\" traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council.\n\nIn 1980 an estimated 1,000 native American members of the religion and their guests gathered for the second American Bahá'í Native Council at a pow-wow along with Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem and Amoz Gibson, with long contact with Indian populations and then a member of the Universal House of Justice. The event was sponsored by the Bahá'í Continental Indigenous Council which was composed of three indigenous believers from each of the national assemblies of North America. After the council meeting, a three-day training and deepening program developed plans and teams of Bahá'ís to travel to different regions to promulgate the religion among the native Americans. These teams of Native American Bahá'ís from Alaska, Canada and the 48 contiguous United States represented 10 tribes under the name \"Trail of Light\".\n\nOne team visited six native villages in Alaska from July 18 to August 1. Team members were Tina Salomon, an Osage-Cherokee from Sparks, Nevada; Mary Jane Tevuk, an Inupiat Eskimo from Nome, Alaska; Regina Steffes, a Navajo-Oneida from Fontana, California; and team captain Chester Kahn, a Navajo from Houck, Arizona (later a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States); Bill Ekomiak, an Inuit Eskimo from Daysland, Alberta, Canada; Johan Lyberth, an Inuit Eskimo from Nuuk, Greenland.\n\nA second team visited Indian Reserves and cities in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, included Henry Bainbridge, a Navajo from Teec Nos Pos, Arizona; Ernestine Moore, a Paiute-Washoe from Reno, Nevada; Maynard Eakan, an Inupiaq Eskimo from Anchorage, Alaska, and member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska; Shirley Lindstrom, a Tlingit from Mayo, Yukon, Canada; team captain Noni Nelson, a Metis from Enderby, British Columbia, Canada; Peter Singyke, an Inupiaq from Anchorage, Alaska; Rita Blumenstein, an Aleut-Athabascan-Yupik Eskimo from Palmer, Alaska; Dennis Bainbridge, age 9, a Navajo from Teec-Nos-Pos, Arizona.\n\nOne of the teams split in two and traveled from the north to the south starting mid June and traveled among the people in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. While in Panama they gathered with more than 1,000 Guaymi Bahá'ís joined by Costa Rican Guaymi, Talamanca, and Teribe representatives and they agreed on founding a Native Council for the Panamanian and Costa Rican tribes. The Trail of Light team then continued through Bolivia, Chile, Peru and finally Ecuador. In Ecuador the team was presented to the audience at a conference in May 1982 dedicated to the anniversary of the death of Bahiyyih Khánum. Representatives of 24 of the 29 national assemblies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and members of 21 Indian tribes from Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela were present.\n\nIn August 1982 the third North American Native Council was held gathering Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum and four hundred forty-six Bahá'ís and their guests from 10 countries and representing 60 Indian tribes on the Blood Indian Reserve in southwestern Alberta, Canada. Following this conference, Rúhíyyih Khanum traveled across Canada and into Greenland and Iceland visiting civic leaders and Bahá'í communities. She met people from Fountain Reserve and Thunderbird Reserve. At the close of the tour in September the team presented an Indian ceremonial blanket to Rúhíyyih Khanum who responded by joining them in a dance. Follow-up meetings after the Trail travelers came through occurred in November in Alaska and December in Honduras.\n\nIn 1984 a reprise of the \"Trail of Light\" was undertaken when an international team of five Bahá'ís spent 17 days in Guatemala; they were a Mapuche Indian from Chile, a Quechua from Peru, a Bribri from Costa Rica, and two Guaymis from Panama.\n\nA 1984-5 continuation of the \"Trail of Light\" process brought Costa Rican indigenous Bahá'ís into Veracruz Mexico.\n\nAfter the religion grew among the Guaymi, they in turn offered service in 1985-6 with the Trail of Light project included indigenous Guaymí Bahá'ís of Panama traveling with the Venezuelan indigenous Carib speaking and Guajira Bahá'ís through the Venezuelan states of Bolívar, Amazonas and Zulia sharing their religion. The Bahá'í Guaymí Cultural Centre was built in the Chiriqui district (which was split in 1997 to create the Ngöbe-Buglé district) and used as a seat for the Panamanian Ministry of Education's literacy efforts in the 1980s. In 1985 Trail of Light began its work in Colombia. Among the participants were two youth from the Guaymi tribe in Panama; six members from the Guajiros, the Colombo-Venezuelan tribe, and two youth from the Paez, a tribe in southern Colombia. The traveled to the Guajira region and re-affirmed the religion among the Bahá'ís there and the group performed dances which inspired the Guajiros to offer their own dance, the Chichamaya. The group was invited to the local high school where the Guaymis shared the story of the impact of the religion among their people (see Bahá'í Faith in Panama). The group was then invited to the elementary school. From Guajira the group headed to Valledupar and then on to the homeland of the Arhuaco tribe in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. There the group met with the leadership, the Mamos, or elders of the community for permission to present the message they had come to give. Various of the group presented to the Mamos including the Guaymi and their interpretation of their own prophecies. An elder shared that the Arhuaco had a similar prophecy. The Trail of Light group was allowed to make their presentations and exchanges of dances and talks followed. From there the group traveled to see the Yukpa (Yuko) tribe. With the Yuko the group was able to hold a unity feast and shared dances and stayed for three days before heading home.\n\nThe 1988 North American Native Council as sponsored by the National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and the group met with members of the assembly. The members of the U.S. National Assembly hosted a reception for the Tribal Council chairman and Councils of North and South Dakota and also met with the Cheyenne River Tribal Council and the Looking Horse family which keeps the original sacred pipe of the Lakota. Hooper Dunbar, a member of the Universal House of Justice, attended. The council opened recalling a vision -Jack Wilson's vision - that Sitting Bull attempted to call for but was killed before it could come about. See also Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee Massacre.\n\nSmaller scale \"Trails of Light\" efforts continued to be carried out from the Native American Bahá'í Institute among the Navajo.\n\nDesert Rose began in 1988 in Tucson with the four-day Desert Rose Bahá'í School initiated by Hand of the Cause William Sears and his wife, Marguerite, along with a core group of dedicated friends. When Mr. Sears died in 1992, Marguerite continued Desert Rose Bahá'í School, but, with the knowledge and encouragement of the Universal House of Justice, decided to expand the four-day school into a permanent institute.\n\nBy 1994 a radio station was established in Chile to nurture and preserve the local culture by featuring local story-tellers and music recorded at station-sponsored annual indigenous music festivals.\n\nIt was also in 1961 that the religion was brought to the region of the Guajira department. In 1962 four new assemblies were elected -one of them all-Indian. A new organizational unit, the \"Institute\" or \"Training Institute\", was a goal of the \"Nine Year Plan\" started in 1964 by the Universal House of Justice and Colombia's first one began to organize and operate in 1965 as part of initiatives focused on the Indian population in the La Guajira region. By winter 1965 there were many Baha'is among both the Colombian and Venezuelan Guajiros, about 1,000 on the Colombian side and 1,500 on the Venezuelan side. Another stated goal was in the realm of international cooperation - the newly developing Indian Institute of Riohacha was shared with the Venezuelans during the first Guajiro Teacher Training Institute held at Riohacha. Among the participants in this first training were: Rosalba Pimienta, Tiana Arpushana, Tomas Pimienta, Juan Artiz Pimienta, Martha Duarte Arpushana, Maria Teresa Duarte Arpushana, Carmen Pimienta Arpushana, and Martha Epiaya all of Colombia and Rogelio Hernández, José Martin Sempron, Cecilia del Carmen Iguaran, and Maria Cecilía González all of Venezuela. The next institute was held in January 1966 at which the dedication of the building was set and the building, called the \"Villa Rahmat\", as an Institute was completed by August. After constructing the Guajiro Teaching Institute the community united in sending financial aid to Kenya, thus fulfilling that goal. By 1967 eight local assemblies were formed among the Motilones. In late 1967 into 1968 Vicente Montezuma, a Panamanian Guaymí who had previously served in the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Panama, pioneered to the rural areas of Colombia and promulgated the religion especially among the Choco speaking Indians. Cross border activity in La Guajira continued in 1969 with Venezuelan Guajiri Bahá'ís traveling in Colombia and Colombian Guajiri Bahá'ís attending activities in Venezuela. At the 1969 national convention a number of Yukon/Yukpa delegates attended. In May 1970 an all-Guajira Bahá'í conference brought together some 200 Bahá'ís from the region for talks and lessons offered in Spanish and Guajira languages including a history of the religion in the region including noting 110 local assemblies being elected that year: 57 in Colombia: 53 in Venezuela, as well as the dedication of a local Bahá'í House of Worship. In 1973 Luis Montenegro, former long term member of the National Assembly of Colombia died while climbing the mountains of the Yukpa(Yuko), or Motilon, Indians. The first of the Paez people joined the religion in 1974 due to the service of a Panamanian Bahá'í traveling in Colombia. The fifth All-Guajira Conference was held in July in Venezuela in 1977.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of serious social disruption and violence across Colombia Bahá'ís turned to service to the people living in the countryside. In 1974 FUNDAEC was founded by group of professors at the University of Valle. According to Gustavo Correa, director of FUNDAEC, it was originally inspired by a quotation from Bahá'u'lláh - \"Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.' He says that 'education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom'.\n\nOne of the authors was Farzam Arbab and president of FUNDAEC from 1974 to 1988, would also serve in several capacities for the religion including being a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Colombia, a Continental Counsellor, appointed to the International Teaching Centre and eventually elected to the Universal House of Justice in 1993.\n\nFUNDAEC has instituted a number of development projects: the \"Centro Universitario de Bienestar Rural\", the \"Tutorial Learning System\" or \"SAT\" (the Spanish acronym for \"Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial\") and a micro-finance Project. The SAT was particularly successful with cutting the process of urbanization, increases in democratic behavior and aspects of gender equality, extra curricular activities in communities, stopping migratory movement of populations, and established public-private cooperation in Colombia. By 2002 the SAT system was in use in Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia and the first phases of the implementation of the program have started in Zambia. Parallel to SAT, FUNDAEC began a micro-finance initiative as well.\n\nIn Colombia the Ruhi Institute, a Bahá'í study circle, began as an initiative of the community with a commitment starting in 1970. About 1980 one of the Auxiliary Board members in Colombia entered into a process of consultation with several rural communities around the town of Puerto Tejada in order to help them identify steps they could take to improve their own social conditions. An early aim was to establish nurseries and kindergartens. In 1983 it published its first course \"Principles and Beliefs, Course 1: Life and Death\". The courses developed as a \"Core Activities Initiative\". In 1987 the institute wrote its first course book on the education of children. In 1988 the national assembly decided to seek legal recognition for the Ruhi Institute by incorporating it as an organization with its own Board of Directors appointed by the assembly. It dedicates its efforts to the development of human resources for the spiritual, social, and cultural development of the Colombian people. Although its center is in the town of Puerto Tejada in the department of Cauca, its area of influence extends throughout the entire country. Especially in recent years, its educational programs have been adopted by an increasing number of agencies worldwide.\n\nIf individuals developed interests in contributing to society beyond those of the formal Ruhi courses they were introduced to the opportunities provided by FUNDAEC.\n\nThe first Indian of Bolivia formally joined the religion in 1956 which soon spread widely among that subculture. The election of the Bolivian national assembly in 1961 - representative of a community the majority of whom were of the Aymara people - were (in alphabetical order by last name): Estanislao Alverez, recording secretary, Athas Costas, Sabino Ortega (first Indian teacher), Andres Jachakovo (this first Indian adherent in Bolivia), vice-chairman, Yolanda de Lopez, secretary, Daniel Mauricio (founder of first Baha'i school), Massoud Khamsi, chairman, Alberto Saldias, treasurer, and Alberto Rocabado. By 1963 there were hundreds of local assemblies. Andres was appointed as an Auxiliary Board member in 1969 after serving on the national assembly since 1961 and often living for periods of times in different Indian communities. After the 1960s the focus on service through socio-economic development began to work in a context of sustainable growth of the religion - many projects were developed including the 'Yachay Wasi' Bahá'í Tutorial Center which was to train the teachers for one hundred tutorial schools to be established in the country, a Bahá'í radio station with indigenous support staffing following developments in Ecuador - its call letters are CP-220 - and Nur University. The Bahá'í Faith is currently the largest international religious minority in Bolivia. The largest population of Bahá'ís in South America is in Bolivia, a country whose general population is estimated to be 55%-70% indigenous and 30%-42% Mestizo, with a Bahá'í population estimated at 217000 in 2005 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives.\n\nThe national assembly of Costa Rica sponsored a four-day Indian school in Amubre, Talamanc near the Sixaola River. In 1966 construction began on a new teaching institute on the Bahá'í endowment property in Alajuela and also in 1966 the community raised the number of assemblies from fourteen to twenty. A beautification project in 1984 was held in Guanacaste province inspired by the Bahá'í gardens on Mt. Carmel as well as reading prayers - thirty people joined the religion during the project. There was also a chance to record some Bribri chanted prayers which would be broadcast on the radio.\n\nA Bahá'í Radio station on AM broadcasting from Boca del Monte with programs and news in Guaymí native language, Ngabere, leading to maintaining the usefulness of the language and in the telling of stories and coverage of issues to the support of Guaymí traditions and culture.\n\nIn Panama's remote indigenous villages Bahá'í volunteers run ten primary schools where the government does not provide access to a school. Later a FUNDESCU stipend of $50 per month was made available for 13 teachers and the Ministry of Education added funds for a 14th. As subsistence farmers, the villagers have no money or food to offer. Instead they take turns providing firewood for an outdoor kitchen or build small wood-framed shelters with corrugated zinc panels and a narrow wooden platform for a bed. The teachers and administrators do not seek to convert the students. Some of the villagers are Bahá'ís, some are Catholics, some Evangelicals, and some follow the native Mama Tata religion. In all, about half the students are Bahá'ís (about 150). Nevertheless there is a strong moral component to the program including a weekly class on \"Virtues and Values.\" Over the years, some training for the teachers has been provided but many have not finished the twelfth grade including some women who have faced difficulties getting even that much education.\n\nAmong the formal schools established there are:\n\n\nJacqueline Left Hand Bull was elected as Chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States, for the first time, in 2007. She was the first American Indian woman to so serve, and the third woman to do so since its formation in 1925. She served as Chair through 2011. Other Indians had been elected to the institution - MacArthur Fellow Patricia Locke, Lakota hoop dancer and flutist Kevin Locke, and Navajo artists and brothers Franklin and Chester Kahn.\n\nPhil Lucas was a prominent Bahá'í Indian documentarian, and Nipo T. Strongheart worked as a technical advisor and performance-lecturer before joining the religion before February 1963. Buffy Saint Marie, a singer indigenous friend of the religion, appeared in the musical event prelude to the second Bahá'í World Congress as well as seen on the \"Dini Petty Show\" explaining the Bahá'í teaching of progressive revelation.\n\nDeloria Bighorn was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Canada in 2009, and has served as the Chair of that institution since 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

However, unlike Chōsai, his teachings still emphasized repeated recitations of the nembutsu as the primary practice in Jōdo-shū. In the spectrum of followers of Hōnen, Benchō balances faith in the nembutsu with acceptance of other practices leading to rebirth in the Pure Land of Amida Buddha.\n\nAfter Hōnen died, Benchō attempted to counter divergences in Hōnen's teachings among other disciples by writing a treatise titled , which contained a full account of the teachings that Benchō heard directly from Hōnen.

It is also the prototype of a class of compounds known as β-carbolines.\n\nβ-Carboline alkaloids are widespread in plants and animals, and frequently act as benzodiazepine inverse agonists. As components of the liana \"Banisteriopsis caapi\", the β-carbolines harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine play a pivotal role in the pharmacology of the indigenous psychedelic drug ayahuasca by preventing the breakdown of dimethyltryptamine in the gut by reversibly inhibiting monoamine oxidase, thus making it psychoactive upon oral administration. Some β-carbolines, notably tryptoline and pinoline, may be formed naturally in the human body. The latter is possibly implicated along with melatonin in the role of the pineal gland in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. β-carboline is a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist and can therefore have convulsive, anxiogenic and memory enhancing effects. 9-Methyl-β-carbolines appear to induce DNA damage when exposed to ultra-violet light.\n\nβ-Carboline belongs to the group of indole alkaloids and consist of pyridine ring that is fused to an indole skeleton. The structure of β-carboline is similar to that of tryptamine, with the ethylamine chain re-connected to the indole ring via an extra carbon atom, to produce a three-ringed structure. The biosynthesis of β-carbolines is believed to follow this route from analogous tryptamines. Different levels of saturation are possible in the third ring, which is indicated here in the structural formula by colouring the optionally double bonds red and blue:\n\nSome of the more important β-carbolines are tabulated by structure below.\n\nEight plant families are known to express 64 different kinds of β-carboline alkaloids.

{"id": "5276768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5276768", "title": "Bhaktivedanta Manor", "text": "Bhaktivedanta Manor\n\nBhaktivedanta Manor is a Gaudiya Vaishnava temple set in the Hertfordshire countryside of England, in the village of Aldenham near Watford. The Manor is owned and run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), better known as the Hare Krishna movement. It is ISKCON's largest property in the United Kingdom, and one of the most frequently visited Radha Krishna temples in Europe. It stands in of landscaped grounds, consisting of lawns, flower gardens, a children's playground, an artificial lake that attracts many water fowl, and a substantial car park.\n\nThe house is listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England.\n\nPreviously known as Piggott's Manor, the property was donated to the Hare Krishna movement in February 1973 by former Beatle George Harrison, after the Radha Krishna Temple in central London had become inadequate to house the growing number of devotees. The donation included 17 acres of land, following which the estate was extended through the acquisition of neighbouring properties. Harrison had a close relationship with ISKCON's founder-acharya, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, and visited him at the Manor on several occasions.\n\nBeginning in 1981, ISKCON was engaged in a campaign to save Bhaktivedanta Manor from closure as a public temple, as the popularity of the site led to increased traffic through Aldenham. After a series of court hearings and appeals, the Department of the Environment granted permission for the building of a road bypassing the village in 1996. With the improved access, the Manor hosts up to 60,000 visitors for annual religious festivals such as Janmashtami.\n\n\nBy 1972, three years after its founding, ISKCON's Radha Krishna Temple at Bury Place, in central London, was proving too small to accommodate the growing number of devotees there. The popularity of the movement had much to do with former Beatle George Harrison, who had helped establish the temple, in addition to endorsing Krishna Conscious principles in his 1970 solo album \"All Things Must Pass\". One of the first British devotees, Dhananjaya Das, recalls Prabhupada suggesting that he ask Harrison if he would care to help with their predicament, to which the musician replied: \"I would be very much honoured.\"\n\nHarrison began looking for a new premises but then left the search to Dhananjaya and others, aware that property owners were immediately raising their asking price due to the involvement of a celebrity musician. Dhananjaya came upon Piggott's Manor in the Hertfordshire village of Aldenham, north-west of London; he recalls that the owner had been considering using the house and 17 acres of grounds as a nursing home. Harrison purchased the property in February 1973 and donated it to ISKCON's London chapter.\nThe devotees endured financial hardship during their early years at the Manor, due to the substantial costs involved in maintaining the large property. A habitual international traveller, Prabhupada visited Bhaktivedanta Manor in the summer of 1973 and was delighted with the new UK base. During their meeting there in August, he told Harrison: \"You have given us this shelter, and Krishna will give \"you\" shelter – at his lotus feet.\" Prabhupada later referred to Harrison as ISKCON's \"archangel\" for this and other gifts to the movement; in November 1977, while on his deathbed in the Vrindavan temple, the acharya removed a ring from his hand and instructed devotees to deliver it to Harrison. Prabhupada's final trip outside India, over August and September 1977, was a visit to the UK centres at Bury Place and Aldenham. While staying at the Manor, he became too sick to undertake a planned tour of the United States, and instead returned to Bombay before being transported to Vrindavan.\n\nHarrison said he envisaged that the Manor would be a \"guide to Krishna consciousness\" and \"A place where people could get a taste of the splendor of devotional service to the Supreme Lord\". Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of Bhaktivedanta Manor in 2013, \"The George Harrison Memorial Garden\" was officially opened to the public. His widow, Olivia Harrison, together with celebrity gardener Monty Don and author Peter Owen-Jones, attended a private ceremony to unveil the garden on 25 May that year. A road on the property, which was earlier an unnamed track across a park, is now named Dharam Marg, which is Hindi for \"the way of truth\".\nBy the late 1970s, Bhaktivedanta Manor had become a popular visiting place for London's large Hindu population, particularly since, unlike in areas of the UK such as the Midlands, it was a rare example of a local temple for Krishna worship. The 1979 and 1980 Janmashtami festivals attracted up to 15,000 visitors per day, resulting in increased road traffic through Aldenham and complaints to Hertsmere Borough Council. Having originally permitted ISKCON to use the site as a theological college, in line with the educational function that the property served under St Bart's ownership, Hertsmere Council moved to ban all religious festivals at Bhaktivedanta Manor in 1981. ISKCON subsequently acquired a property near Worcester – Croome Court – which became the movement's UK headquarters temporarily, including the site of its school. An agreement between the council and the ISKCON devotees, made in January 1983, then allowed for six days each year where the number of people attending Bhaktivedanta Manor could exceed 1000. Financial difficulties forced the closure of the Croome Court base in July 1984, however, leading to a renewed dependence on the Aldenham property.\nDuring 1985, the devotees tried to buy adjoining land to make road access to the Manor that would bypass the village. Meanwhile, the council received many more local complaints, leading it to issue an enforcement notice in January 1987 to have the temple closed to the public, citing a breach of the 1000-person daily limit. The temple submitted an appeal to the UK's Department of the Environment. A series of government inquiries over 1987–89 recognised the importance of Aldenham's position within the Letchmore Heath Conservation Area, and in 1990 the Secretary of State announced that Bhaktivedanta Manor would have to close as a temple. Appeals to the British High Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court for Human Rights – the latter heard as \"ISKCON and 8 Others v. United Kingdom\" – all similarly failed, and a date of 16 March 1994 was set for the closure. In the months leading up to the deadline, the devotees bought the neighbouring land, and submitted a development proposal to Hertsmere Council, with a view to making a road that would bring all traffic into the Manor from the A41, on the opposite (west) side of the property from the village. On the day of the proposed closure, a crowd estimated at 36,000 marched on the British government's offices at Westminster in protest,<ref name=\"Mahadevan/B&E Times\"></ref> as the council deliberated over the application for a new road.\n\nThe Hertsmere councillors declined the proposal, leading to further campaigning by the devotees and, in early 1996, another appeal to the Department of the Environment. By this point, ISKCON's cause had attracted support from the BBC and members of the national Parliament. Six months after the appeal was lodged, the Department of the Environment granted permission for the proposed road, with the Secretary of State concluding:\n[Bhaktivedanta Manor] is unique in the UK because there is no comparable alternative place for teaching, worship and meditation; and the level of provision of these religious facilities is to an exceptionally high standard. Furthermore, the close association of the Hare Krishna movement's founder with the Manor makes it a special, if not unique place …\n\nThe road was duly built, through what was now a 70-acre property, bypassing the village of Aldenham. In September 1998, visitors to the Janmashtami festival numbered 60,000 – a figure described by the local \"Borehamwood & Elstree Times\" in 2007 as \"the average number of people\" attending the festival each year. According to a 2013 BBC News report, the grounds of Bhaktivedanta Manor now include \"a theological college, organic farm, herb gardens, a cow sanctuary, primary school and kitchens providing meals for the homeless\".\n\nAll activity at Bhaktivedanta Manor focuses around the temple room with its altar of carved wood and gilt containing three domed shrines. The first houses deity forms of Radha and Krishna, named \"Radha Gokulananda\". The second houses Gaura-Nitai deities, and the third, Sita, Rama, his brother Lakshmana and Hanuman. The rest of the property comprises a shop selling souvenirs and devotional paraphernalia, a bakery, a farm with working oxen, college facilities, ashrams, a primary school, and a small theatre. The latter is used for performances of the dramatic arts illustrating bhakti yoga and stories about Krishna. The theatre is frequently used as a venue for Vaishnava religious festivals, Hindu family gatherings, general open days and civil weddings.\n\nThe musician Jahnavi Harrison grew up and teaches kirtan call-and-response singing at Bhaktivedanta College.\n\n\n"}

In addition, we find that MMLs in inland states lead to a reduction in crime in the nearest border state.

Marijuana-related hospital visits have nearly doubled between 2011, prior to legalization, and 2014. Top public health administrators in Colorado have cited the increased potency of today's infused products, often referred to as \"edibles\", as a cause for concern. They have also highlighted the risk that edibles pose to children, as they are often undistinguishable from ordinary foods once they are removed from their packaging. Youth usage has also been a major aspect of the debate surrounding marijuana legalization and a concern for state officials. Overall youth usage rates have increased, although not enough to be deemed statistically significant.

Effects have included an increase in cannabis-related calls to the Oregon state poison center, an increase in perception among youth that Marijuana use is harmful, a decrease in arrest rates for cannabis related offenses, stores sold $250 million in cannabis products which resulted in $70 million in state tax revenue (higher than a predicted $36 million in revenue), 10% decrease in violent crime, and 13% drop in murder rate.\n\nWashington D.C. legalized Cannabis in 2015.

It has an area of and a population of 458,000, according to the National Statistics Institute. More than 85 percent of the population is nominally Roman Catholic, according to an informal poll taken by local churches. The largest Protestant denomination is the Church of the Nazarene. Other groups include the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), the Assemblies of God, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, and various other Pentecostal and evangelical groups. There are small Bahá'í communities and a small but growing Muslim community.

While many Catholics once were hostile toward the Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), which became the governing party in 2001, some have become supporters of the PAICV due to conflict within the MPD party and dissatisfaction over the latter's performance.\n\nThere were foreign missionary groups operating in the country.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice.

This is particularly associated with the Hajong people and represents a distinct form of Hindu worship incorporating tribal animism. \nHajong Hinduism is the mixture of Hinduism and the animistic beliefs of the Hajong people. This sect of Hinduism includes worship of gods and deities of Hindu origin, demigods and spirits, all referred to as Dyao.\n\nThe Hajong people have been practicing Hinduism since a long time. It is not known when the process of Hinduisation started. During the pre-Hindu period, among the Hajongs animism was the indigenous religion. As it was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship, Hinduism started to blend in with animism.\n\nShiva (Shib Dyao), Vishnu (Bisnu Dyao) and Durga (Durgâ Dyao) or Kali (Kali Dyao) are the supreme gods. Other Hindu deities like Lakshmi (Lukkhi Dyao), Sarasvati (Sorosuti Dyao), Krishna (Krisno Dyao), Ganesha (Gones Dyao) are worshipped by the Hajongs. Along with the Hindu deities a number of traditional deities are worshipped by the Hajong Hindus. Minor deities include disease causing spirits, river spirits and animal spirits. Hajongs are agrarian people, near the paddy fields animals like monkeys, elephants and foxes are offered rice and side dishes associated with each animal. The bastu group of deities also include a horse and an elephant.\n\nThere are two types of priests who performs the worship of the Dyaos.\n\nThe Hajong equivalent of the Hindu Brahmin. They are Vegetarians and perform the wedding ceremonies. But now they are largely replaced by Bengali Brahmins.\n\nThe are the shamans who perform all the worship of the village to appease the deities. A Dyaoshi is selected by Hil jaga or Barun jaga.\n\nThere are a number of Hindu and traditional festivals observed by the Hajong people. Pusnâ is a majour harvest festival. A traditional festival is celebrated to honour the Bastu, Paabni and other group of deities. It is conducted by a \"Dyaoshi\" or \"Nungtang\", a Hajong shaman. Bastu pujâ does not involve idol worship and is celebrated in a particular location outside the village premises. Another festival is called \"chormaga\" in Mymensingh and \"chorkhila\" in India. Chorkhila is celebrated during the month of October in South-West Garohills Districts of Meghalaya. During this festival, group of young people go around from house to house in the village, or from village to village, playing music and performing folklores, sometimes stories from the Ramayana. The parties receive some rice or money in return for their performance. Since every person, young and old, comes out to watch the play, this is considered a chance to check out prospective brides and grooms. The Hajongs also celebrate their pre monsoon harvest festival known as 'Biswâ'. Kani pujâ, Kâtkâ pujâ, are also performed.\n\nHajong people also practise some of their traditional religious rituals. The Hajongs believe in some evil spirits like Machang Dyao, Jarang Dyao, Bhut, Muilâ Dyao, Jugni Dyao, Daini etc. They adore and worship different gods and goddess like Kali, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kamakhya, Manasa, Basanti and others. Kartik puja among the Hajongs are known as Kâtkâ pujâ and Manasa puja is known as Kani Dyao puja. The day of Lakshmi puja is referred to as 'Kujâi Ghor' . In Bastu Pujâ tortoises and pigeons are sacrificed for Bastu.\n\n"}
{"id": "1020063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1020063", "title": "Hayley Cropper", "text": "Hayley Cropper\n\nHayley Cropper (also Harry Patterson and Hayley Patterson) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", played by Julie Hesmondhalgh. The character first appeared in the episode first broadcast on 26 January 1998. Hayley was the first transgender character in a British soap opera and was the first permanent transgender character in the world of serialised drama. She is perhaps best known for her marriage to Roy Cropper (David Neilson).\n\nHesmondhalgh won numerous awards for her portrayal of Hayley, but announced her departure from the show on 11 January 2013. Her final scenes were filmed on 18 November 2013 and aired on 22 January 2014. In the episode, Hayley takes her own life, after living with terminal pancreatic cancer. Hesmondhalgh has insisted that it was not a \"right to die\" storyline. Hayley's funeral aired on 31 January 2014.\n\nHesmondhalgh's portrayal of Hayley, and her on-screen chemistry with fellow actor David Neilson, encouraged the writers to allow the character to evolve from a brief love interest for Roy to a popular long-term character. Hayley would go on to spend 16 years on \"Coronation Street\", always seeing the good in people and nurturing Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) from troubled young women to kind, caring, individuals. In her later years, Hayley formed an unlikely, yet notably close, friendship with Carla Connor (Alison King) and although it was obvious the pair were from completely different walks of life, they came to respect and care for each other.\n\nHayley Patterson was a shy shop supervisor at Firman's Freezers. Her friend and colleague Alma Baldwin (Amanda Barrie) introduced her to Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and they became friends — until Hayley told him that she was a pre-operative male-to-female transsexual and used to be called Harold. Roy cannot cope and initially rejects her but realizes that their friendship is more important than Hayley's secret. After affirming their mutual attraction, Hayley goes to Amsterdam for private sex reassignment surgery. When she returns to Weatherfield, she starts work at Underworld. Hayley chooses not to disclose her transgender status but her secret is revealed when Alma's husband and factory boss Mike discovers a Tax Office error, showing her birth name, Harold. Mike sacks her as a result and although the factory staff and Street residents initially taunt her, she gets her job back and most Street residents gradually accept her.\n\nIn 2001, Roy and Hayley decide to become foster parents. Their first child is teenager Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), who returns to care after falsely claiming that Roy hit her. Fiz returns later that year and becomes good friends with Roy and Hayley. Hayley and Roy then foster a young boy, Wayne Hayes (Gary Damer), but go on the run with him, wanting to protect him from his abusive stepfather. They are arrested for kidnap and Hayley is held on remand for objecting to her bail conditions but is released when Wayne's mother makes a statement about her marriage. This prevents Roy and Hayley fostering, or working with, any more young people.\n\nIn 2003, while Hayley is away, nursing her sick aunt, scheming Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) bets Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) that she can bed the man supposedly least likely to be unfaithful — Roy. Tracy drugs Roy at Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Shelley Unwin's (Sally Lindsay) wedding reception and claims to have slept with him. Roy is desperate to keep this from Hayley but breaks down and admits everything. Upon confronting Tracy, the Croppers are stunned when Tracy tells them that she is pregnant with Roy's baby and plans to have a termination if the Croppers do not want to adopt it. Roy and Hayley see an opportunity to raise a child and pay Tracy £25,000. The Croppers' relationship becomes increasingly strained, including a suicide attempt by Roy, but they pull through. Roy gets suspicious when Tracy goes on holiday for 3 weeks and realizing how easy it would be for Tracy to disappear with the cash and the baby, Roy insists she marry him (giving him parental responsibility of the baby) or the deal is off. She agrees and they marry. After the baby is born, Tracy admits to Peter that Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) is the father (they had a one-night stand shortly before she spent the night with Roy). The baby's true paternity is revealed at Steve's wedding to Karen (Suranne Jones), when Tracy demands baby Patience be returned to her and the Croppers, heartbroken, do so and Tracy repays the cash Roy and Hayley. Steve and Karen marry, despite Tracy's bombshell, and Karen gets her revenge by gatecrashing the christening. Patience Cropper is renamed Amy Barlow and the Croppers are her godparents.\n\nFollowing the death of her aunt Monica in September 2007, Hayley discovers she has a son, Christian Gatley (Andrew Turner). She hires a private investigator to track him down and introduces herself as his aunt. Roy confronts Hayley when he sees money has withdrawn from their joint bank account and she tells Roy everything. Disapproving of lies, Roy insists Hayley tell Christian the truth about how they are related and Hayley does but Christian does not react well and storms off. When Hayley finds him later, Christian is still angry and punches her when she refuses to leave him alone. On her return to the café, she makes it clear that she blames Roy and this causes problems. They decide to go camping in a bid to mend their issues. Following this, in October 2007, Hayley leaves the Street to go on volunteer work in Mozambique for a year.\n\nHayley returns in November 2008; it is clear that she is not entirely happy, appearing evasive and she tells Roy that she wants to return to her charity work, as she has fallen for Olaf, the project team leader. When catching up with Tilly, another volunteer, she learns Olaf is not the man she thought he was and decides to stay with Roy. She decides not to return to \"Underworld\" and wants to become a social worker but her police record (for the abduction of Wayne in 2001), rules her ineligible to work with children. She works in the café and then becomes supervisor at the factory in 2009.\n\nIn May 2010, Hayley and Roy argue when she suggests that they have a lavish wedding, now that the law has changed and their union can now be officially recognized. Roy agrees but he is more concerned with inheritance law, upsetting Hayley, so she moves in with friend Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). On 1 June 2010, Robbie Sloan (James Fleet) tricks Hayley to go to the factory, telling her that Carla Connor (Alison King) has had an accident, when in reality Robbie has tied Carla to a chair and duct taped her mouth shut. Once there, Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged but Robbie pulls out a gun on her before she can escape, and ties her to a chair too. Killer Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) arrives, takes the gag off Carla's mouth and threatens them, revealing that Hayley is there as revenge against Roy, who convinced Tony to confess his crimes to the police, and says he will kill her and Carla. After Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) accidentally interrupts and raises the alarm, Roy rushes to \"Underworld\" but can not help her, while Carla pleads with Tony to let Hayley go – Tony eventually relents and throws Hayley out. She is taken care of by paramedics and she and Roy tell one another they love each other before watching the factory blow up, after Tony sets fire to the building, killing himself but Carla manages to untie herself and escapes.\n\nLater that week, Roy proposes to Hayley and she accepts. Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) intervenes in the wedding preparations and after weeks of muscling in, Hayley and Roy tell her they do not want her to be a part of the wedding, despite Hayley wearing her vintage wedding dress. On 30 August 2010, the train carriage that Hayley and bridesmaids Fiz and Becky (Katherine Kelly) decouples from the steam train that is transporting the groom and wedding guests to the venue, due to Mary's meddling. However, they do get to the venue on time and Hayley marries Roy. In June 2011, Roy's mother Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) – who moved in with the Croppers' earlier in the year – is suspicious when, after expressing a longing for grandchildren, finds out Hayley cannot have children. After rummaging through her things, she finds a prescription for some hormone tablets and assumes Hayley is menopausal until Tracy tells her that Hayley used to be a man. Sylvia is initially outraged but, as of July 2011, appears to be coming round and accepts Hayley for who she is.\n\nHayley is heartbroken when Becky decides to leave Weatherfield in January 2012 but gets a call a few months later, telling her that she is engaged to her new boyfriend. Later in the year, Roy and Hayley visit Palm Springs, California to visit Sylvia and her companion Milton Fanshaw (Robert Vaughn). Roy returns without Hayley, who is caring for Sylvia as she isn't well. Hayley returns later that year and supports Roy when they discover that his father died in May 2013. Strange happenings begin occurring in the café and Roy thinks Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and her family are responsible. Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) finds Roy sleepwalking on the Red Rec and returns him to Hayley and Sylvia. They watch the CCTV footage and it proves that Roy is behind all of the rearranged furniture. Hayley decides that Roy should see a doctor and tells him she will have the same tests done, which Roy finds comfort in. Hayley is called back to the Medical Centre the following week and the doctor tells Hayley that she has abnormal liver function and needs an ultrasound scan for further investigation. Hayley confides in Sylvia on the day of her scan but swears her to secrecy. The doctor tells Hayley that there is a blockage in her bile duct and Hayley tells Sylvia that she may have cancer and breaks down in her arms. The following week, Carla insists on going with Hayley for a CT scan where Hayley is diagnosed with stage-two pancreatic cancer. She is told she needs an operation and chemotherapy to get rid of the cancer. Later, Hayley breaks down at work and Carla comforts her. Hayley realizes that she has to tell Roy so goes home and tells Roy and Sylvia. When Sylvia leaves Roy and Hayley alone, Roy holds Hayley's hand and starts pestering Hayley to drink herbal tea, so she confides in Carla again. Hayley goes for the operation to unblock her bile duct, accompanied by Roy. Hayley does well and is invited to Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) birthday party at the Bistro. Hayley and Sylvia go but is devastated when Roy tells everyone that she has pancreatic cancer. Upset, Hayley runs home and is followed by Sylvia. Later, Roy tells her that he wishes he could halve her pain and Hayley tells him that she could die and the pair embrace passionately. When Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and her half-sister Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), argue at the factory, Leanne pushes Eva into Hayley, so Carla throws Leanne out. Hayley gets fed up with people being sympathetic so she and Roy go on holiday before her operation to remove her tumour. Carla gives Hayley have the time off and Mary lends them her motor home. Hayley and Roy return a couple of weeks later and learn that Sylvia has gone to live with her sister, Roy's aunt Jean.\n\nRoy organizes a romantic dinner for their third wedding anniversary but Hayley is upset as she completely forgot. Roy then assures Hayley that he is not angry, and she confides in Carla before going to the hospital, preparing for her operation. Roy and Hayley are told that the operation – if successful – should last six hours. Hayley goes down to theatre at 13:05 and gives Roy her wedding ring to look after. Roy is devastated when the consultant tells Roy and Hayley that her cancer is terminal. He says she could live up to about six months to a year. Devastated but philosophical, Hayley begins to make a bucket list of everything that she wants to do before she dies, one of which is teaching Roy how to drive. Hayley has a nightmare about being \"Harold\" again, making her regret the way things ended with her son, Christian. She decides to tell Fiz about Christian, confusing Roy but he comes round to the idea of Hayley contacting Christian, so she leaves a message on his mobile. While waiting for him to call back, she focuses on throwing a birthday party for Roy in The Rovers. She goes with Roy to his driving lesson, which was a disaster. Hayley gets a message from Christian, wanting to meet in a café in Bury. Roy goes with Hayley but Christian sends her a text, saying that he cannot go through with it. Roy and Hayley take Fiz's daughter, Hope, and Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) baby girl Ruby to the park, Christian arrives and asks Anna where Hayley is. He decides to call her but she left her phone behind. Christian decides to wait and they talk but Hayley decides to take Roy and Christian to The Rovers, where Christian reveals that he is married and has two children, Sam and Maisie. Hayley says she would love to meet them but Christian wants to wait until they are 16 years of age, upsetting Hayley. Christian repeatedly makes inappropriate remarks unintentionally so Roy shouts at him, before taking Hayley home. Hayley insists that they attend a cancer support group, where they meet Jane Rayner (Heather Bleasdale) and her husband Jeff (Jim Millea). Hayley is inspired by Jane's strength and confidence, despite dying from pancreatic cancer, but Roy tells Hayley that he found her highly inappropriate and inconsiderate. Hayley is delighted to learn that Roy has booked a day off so they can go to Blackpool. They have a wonderful time but their joy is cut short when they are told that Jane has been rushed to a hospice.\n\nThe couple visit, and Hayley is shocked to see how dazed Jane is after taking morphine. Hayley and Roy then sit down as talk about Hayley's final days, where she tells Roy that she intends to end her own life when the cancer spreads. This causes an argument and Hayley moves in with Fiz and Tyrone. The following day, Hayley collapses and Fiz calls an ambulance to take Hayley to hospital. Roy and Fiz go too. At the hospital, the consultant explains that Hayley has an infection and needs to stay overnight. While Hayley is recovering, Roy accidentally tells Anna about her suicide wish. When she comes home, she is stunned to find Roy, Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) re-decorating their bedroom. Hayley secretly does not like the new wallpaper but keeps quiet so she does not upset Roy. Hayley insists on visiting Jane in the hospice and Jeff reveals that Jane has died. Hayley is devastated and furious with Roy. The pair argue again about the way Hayley wants to die. A few days later, Roy and Hayley attend Jane's funeral and meet her young sons, Zac and Henry. Hayley tries to comfort Henry as he is not coping. After the funeral, Roy tells Hayley that he thinks he can accept her suicide plot. Hayley is delighted but Roy tells Anna that he lied and feels he has betrayed her. Roy decides not to tell Hayley his true feelings and they listen to music together after a stressful day. Hayley later breaks down in Roy's arms, saying that she does not want to die and does not want to leave him. Hayley is delighted when asked by Carla to make her wedding dress. The dress is a success and Roy and Hayley attend Carla and Peter's wedding. While there, Christian returns to the street and winds Fiz up about Hayley so she tells him that Hayley has cancer in an angry outburst. On getting home, Hayley is stunned to see Christian and tells him that she is too tired but will see him another time. The following day, Christian visits again and is stunned when Christian says she can see the children. Hayley is thrilled but Christian demands Hayley give him money in return as he is in a lot of debt. Christian brings Sam and Maisie to the café and Maisie is intrigued by Roy's train collection, while Hayley and Christian talk upstairs. Hayley is shocked when Christian turns violent and starts pushing her for the money. She subsequently writes him a cheque. Maisie, however, tells her that she hopes she gets better soon and that she would love to come again. Fiz takes Hayley and Roy to The Rovers and Hayley tells them that she gave Christian the money. In December, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment where she tells the nurse that her pain is getting worse and she is prescribed with stronger painkillers.\n\nHayley and Roy enjoy their last Christmas together. They buy each other gifts and want to be alone, but the day is interrupted by visits from friends and neighbours. Hayley enjoys their company, but after Fiz and Tyrone arrive with their young children, Hayley finds herself falling asleep. After a nap, Hayley is determined to go to The Rovers for a Christmas drink, but Roy wants her to take it easy. Later that week, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment following her scan and learn that the cancer is a lot more aggressive than anticipated, meaning Hayley only has weeks left to live. Hayley takes her frustration out on the Christmas tree, wrecking Hope's decoration. The following day, Hayley tells Roy to let a few people know that she only has weeks left but does not want visitors. Roy breaks the news to Anna, Fiz, Tyrone, Peter, Carla, Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) and Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie). Carla is determined to visit Hayley and she is glad that Carla came. She confides in her, telling her that she is frightened of dying. When Carla returns home, she breaks down after seeing Hayley in such a state. In her final week, Tyrone takes Hayley to the salon for a makeover although Roy wanted her to stay at home and rest. On 20 January 2014, she tells Roy she wants to die that day and whilst Roy is in The Kabin, Hayley irons his best shirt for her funeral. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) notices that Roy is even more unhappy than usual, and asks if he is alright, but he claims to be fine. Roy arrives back at the café and is confronted by Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) with \"customer feedback\". Hayley begins to write letters for Tyrone and Fiz's children, but stops when she realizes Hope and Ruby will not remember her, as they are too young. Roy tries one last time to stop Hayley but she is adamant. Roy makes sure that she is comfortable and selects a piece of music that they both like. Hayley tells Roy that he must not touch the glass containing the lethal cocktail. Prepared to drink the cocktail, Hayley is interrupted by Tyrone who is looking for Ruby's toy. Roy plays \"The Lark Ascending\" by Vaughan Williams, and sits on the bed with Hayley. After one last moment together, she drinks the cocktail. Worried something is not right, Anna closes the café and sits downstairs and Carla knocks on the door, demanding to see Hayley. Anna lets her in and tries to stop Carla knocking on the flat door, but she does. There is no answer, so Anna eventually unlocks the door with her spare key and they enter the flat together. Calling out, Anna and Carla go to the bedroom and, to their shock, find a deceased Hayley on the bed, with Roy's arm around her. Hayley is later cremated following a humanist funeral.\n\nInitially, it was intended that Hayley would only appear for two months, it was thought that this would help increase ratings as well as show a new side to Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh first came to the attention of the casting director while dressed in drag in a production of 'Much Ado About Nothing'. Hesmondhalgh only knew she was auditioning to play a \"fun\" character, so arrived \"all Bet Lynch, in my leopard skin and red lippy\". When she learned Hayley would be transgender, she was nervous, but \"then it dawned on me that this was actually my ’dream job’ and I desperately wanted it.\" The character of Hayley Cropper is around four years older than Hesmondhalgh.\n\nWhat's on TV describes the character as quiet, and kind-hearted. For a short period of time, after the actor took a one-year break from the show, the producers decided to change her ways. After a brief period of resettlement, she resumed her more familiar temperament of being generally supportive and friendly to the other characters.\n\nHayley's only romantic relationship was with Roy Cropper. The characters were first friends and they started a relationship, until Hayley revealed her past history. Roy initially rejected her, but missed their friendship and three months later, followed her to Amsterdam where she was living on a houseboat, recuperating from her surgery. He persuaded her that they should work on their relationship, and as a result, she returned to Weatherfield where she became a machinist in Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) lingerie factory, \"Underworld\".\n\nRoy later proposed to Hayley at a fancy-dress disco on St. Valentine's Day 1999. At that time, they could not legally marry, since Hayley was still seen as a male in the eyes of the law. Eventually, they found a female vicar who would help them, and they were united in a blessing ceremony held in \"Roy's Rolls\" on 23 April 1999. As a wedding present to Roy, Hayley officially changed her name by deed poll to Hayley Anne Cropper.\n\nSince the passing of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in UK law, it has been possible for transgender people to change their birth certificates and marry legally. In 2010, following a discussion of the ramifications of their not being legally married, Roy and Hayley decided to make it official. It was revealed that Hayley had applied for, and received, her new birth certificate, and so, after some disagreements about the cost and motives for marriage, the plans were made for the wedding. The couple finally married on 30 August 2010 at a stately home in Cheshire, and almost everyone but the bride arrived by steam train.\n\nTheir relationship was tested by various storylines including Tracy Barlow's (Kate Ford) deceit, Hayley's secret son and Hayley's absence from the street. Briefly, upon her return, there was a difficult situation where she had developed a crush on one of her co-workers in Africa (further reading below). They eventually worked out their differences.\n\nOn 11 January 2013, it was announced that Hesmondhalgh would leave \"Coronation Street\" at the end of her contract. The actress recorded her final scenes on 18 November 2013, being screened on 20 January 2014, and the producers came up with a dramatic exit storyline for her character. Hesmondhalgh revealed that she wanted to pursue new projects, saying \"I've had the most wonderful and happy time in the life changing 15/16 years I've been in Corrie, and I owe so much to the show and the special team that make it happen. The decision to hang up Hayley's red anorak was a tough one, but doing the play at the Royal Exchange last year made me realise that there's life in the old dog yet (!) and that there are other things I want to try.\" Hayley's exit storyline saw her diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. On 20 January 2014, Hayley died in Roy's arms after drinking a lethal cocktail. The episode attracted 9.7 million viewers - the show's highest figure in almost a year.\n\nFor her portrayal of Hayley, Hesmondhalgh was nominated in the category of \"Most Popular Actress\" at the 1999 National Television Awards. The appearance of a transgender woman in a mainstream soap opera attracted initial opposition from some members of the public, as expressed in calls to the Granada duty office, and letters written to magazines and newspapers. A minority of people expressed their concern at having such \"bizarreness\" brought into their homes on a prime-time show. Transgender groups were also largely unhappy with the storyline, and found Hayley's original character traits, as written, cliched and ill-informed. Press for Change, the transgender campaign and information group, were particularly concerned with the direction of the storyline, but after the first two months a trans advisor connected to Press for Change, Annie Wallace, was regularly consulted for eighteen months by scriptwriters and the actor, and trans groups appeared happier with the stories and scripts that resulted from this liaison. In an interview with Hesmondhalgh in August 2015, it was revealed that in tribute to Wallace, the writers gave Hayley's middle name as Anne, and gave her the same birthday, as well as a mutual love for rock music, especially Queen (band). Wallace is now an actress in her own right, and appears as the character Sally St. Claire in the Channel 4 soap opera, \"Hollyoaks\".\n\nTransgender campaigners were initially upset that a cisgender woman had been chosen for the part but later praised Hesmondhalgh's dedication and sensitivity. Hayley was, for many viewers, the first transgender woman whose story they had seen unfold on TV. Hesmondhalgh has become an outspoken activist for trans rights, including becoming the first Friend of campaign group Trans Media Watch and as Hayley, she has heralded a new level of acceptance among people across the country. The official LGBT History Month website includes Hayley as one of the important famous LGBT people in their history, even though she is a fictional character.\n\nOn 22 January 2014, Hesmondhalgh won \"Best Serial Drama Performance\" at the National Television Awards. Also in 2014, Hesmondhalgh was nominated for the \"Best Actress\" award at The British Soap Awards. As well as being nominated for the \"Best Actress\" award, Hesmondhalgh's final appearance, entitled \"Hayley's Death\", was nominated for the \"Best Single Episode\" award, as well. Hesmondhalgh won both of these awards. Hesmondhalgh also won \"Best On-screen partnership\" and \"Best Storyline\" - both alongside David Neilson - at the ceremony.\n\n\"Coronation Street\" handling of transgender issues, the uncertainty of whether her partner would accept her gender identity and the inability of transgender people to adopt children or marry, has been praised by transgender groups. An Early Day Motion was also tabled in Parliament by Lynne Jones, MP, praising the story team and researchers, and Julie Hesmondhalgh for her portrayal.\n\nFollowing the screening of the \"wedding\" in 1999, the Labour Government announced that a Parliamentary Working Group was being created to assess how the United Kingdom could grant trans people the legal rights for which they had fought for decades. The result of this was the tabling, in 2004, of the Gender Recognition Act, granting trans people full legal status in their acquired sex. It has been said that the character of Hayley deserves partial credit for bringing the issues faced by trans people to public attention in a sympathetic manner, rather than the sensationalist coverage that had previously existed. It is also alleged that the resultant public support for this fictional character went in favour of the Bill.\n\n"}
{"id": "99585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99585", "title": "Hindu deities", "text": "Hindu deities\n\nHindu deities are the gods and goddesses in Hinduism. The terms and epithets for deity within the diverse traditions of Hinduism vary, and include Deva, Devi, Ishvara,Ishvari, Bhagavān and Bhagavati.\n\nThe deities of Hinduism have evolved from the Vedic era (2nd millennium BC) through the medieval era (1st millennium AD), regionally within Nepal, India and in southeast Asia, and across Hinduism's diverse traditions. The Hindu deity concept varies from a personal god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, to 33 Vedic deities, to hundreds of Puranics of Hinduism. Illustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Sri (Lakshmi), Shiva, Sati, Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. From ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Ardhanārīshvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same. Major deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism. Some Hindu traditions such as Smartism from mid 1st millennium AD, have included multiple major deities as henotheistic manifestations of Saguna Brahman, and as a means to realizing Nirguna Brahman.\n\nHindu deities are represented with various icons and anicons, in paintings and sculptures, called Murtis and \"Pratimas\". Some Hindu traditions, such as ancient Charvakas rejected all deities and concept of god or goddess, while 19th-century British colonial era movements such as the Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj rejected deities and adopted monotheistic concepts similar to Abrahamic religions. Hindu deities have been adopted in other religions such as Jainism, and in regions outside India such as predominantly Buddhist Thailand and Japan where they continue to be revered in regional temples or arts.\n\nIn ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism, the human body is described as a temple, and deities are described to be parts residing within it, while the Brahman (Absolute Reality, God) is described to be the same, or of similar nature, as the Atman (self, soul), which Hindus believe is eternal and within every living being. Deities in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.\n\nDeities in Hinduism are referred to as Deva (masculine) and Devi (feminine). The root of these terms mean \"heavenly, divine, anything of excellence\". According to Douglas Harper, the etymological roots of \"Deva\" mean \"a shining one,\" from *div- \"to shine,\" and it is a cognate with Greek dios \"divine\" and Zeus, and Latin deus (Old Latin deivos).\n\nIn the earliest Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called Asuras. By the late Vedic period (~500 BC), benevolent supernatural beings are referred to as \"Deva-Asuras\". In post-Vedic texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas of Hinduism, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. In some medieval Indian literature, \"Devas\" are also referred to as Suras and contrasted with their equally powerful, but malevolent half-brothers referred to as the Asuras.\n\nHindu deities are part of Indian mythology, both Devas and Devis feature in one of many cosmological theories in Hinduism.\n\nIn Vedic literature, Devas and Devis represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the Adityas, Varuna, and Mitra), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (\"Siddhis\").\nThe most referred to Devas in the Rig Veda are Indra, Agni (fire) and Soma, with \"fire deity\" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a yajna fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra (later given the exclusive epithet of Shiva), and Prajapati (later Brahma) are gods and hence Devas.\n\nThe Vedas describes a number of significant Devis such as Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the \"Rigveda\". Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BC to 200 AD), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Brahman, the Supreme power.\n\nAnanda Coomaraswamy states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to Angels-Theoi-Gods and Titans of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology. According to Coomaraswamy's interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, the tyrant and the angel is within each being, the best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one's own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.\n\nIn the Puranas and the Itihasas with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. According to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (\"daivi sampad\") and the demonic qualities (\"asuri sampad\") within each. The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults. According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms \"are facets of ordinary lives\", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).\nThe Epics and medieval era texts, particularly the Puranas, developed extensive and richly varying mythologies associated with Hindu deities, including their genealogies. Several of the Purana texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. Other texts and commentators such as Adi Shankara explain that Hindu deities live or rule over the cosmic body as well in the temple of human body. They remark that the Sun deity is the eyes, the Vāyu the nose, the Prajapati the sexual organs, the Lokapalas the ears, Chandra the mind, Mitra the inward breath, Varuna the outward breath, Indra the arms, Bṛhaspati the speech, Vishnu, whose stride is great, is the feet, and Māyā is the smile.\n\nEdelmann states that gods and anti-gods of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as \"narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves\". Hindu deities in Vedic era, states Mahoney, are those artists with \"powerfully inward transformative, effective and creative mental powers\".\n\nIn Hindu mythology, everyone starts as an Asura, born of the same father. \"Asuras who remain Asura\" share the character of powerful beings craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence. The \"Asuras who become Devas\" in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, aligned with \"Ṛta\" and \"Dharma\", knowledge and harmony.\n\nThe god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.\n\nAnother Hindu term that is sometimes translated as deity is Ishvara, or alternatively various deities are described, state Sorajjakool et al., as \"the personifications of various aspects of one and the same Ishvara\". The term \"Ishvara\" has a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism. In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, \"Ishvara\" means supreme soul, Brahman (Highest Reality), ruler, king or husband depending on the context. In medieval era texts, \"Ishvara\" means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self depending on the school of Hinduism.\n\nAmong the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of \"Ishvara\", i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.\n\nEarly Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of a deity as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits; but these early Nyaya scholars then rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists. Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent deity (God).\n\nVaisheshika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on creator deity. Later Vaisheshika school adopted the concept of \"Ishvara\", states Klaus Klostermaier, but as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He \"winds up the clock, and lets it run its course\".\n\nAncient Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism questioned what is \"Ishvara\" (deity, God)? They considered a deity concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).\n\nIn Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, \"Isvara\" is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God. This is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars. Others, such as , state that Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic. Deity is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.\n\nIn Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any \"personal deity\" (Ishta Deva or Ishta Devata) or \"spiritual inspiration\", but not a creator God. Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses in the Yogasutras can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of \"Isvara\" in Yoga philosophy functions as a \"transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation\".\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism asserted that there is no dualistic existence of deity (or deities). There is no otherness nor distinction between \"Jiva\" and \"Ishvara\". God (Ishvara, Brahman) is identical with the Atman (soul) within each human being in Advaita Vedanta school, and there is a monistic Universal Absolute Oneness that connects everyone and everything, states this school of Hinduism. This school, states Anantanand Rambachan, has \"perhaps exerted the most widespread influence\".\n\nThe Dvaita sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded in medieval era, \"Ishvara\" is defined as a creator God that is distinct from \"Jiva\" (individual souls in living beings). In this school, God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.\n\nYāska, the earliest known language scholar of India (~ 500 BC), notes Wilkins, mentions that there are three deities (\"Devas\") according to the Vedas, \"\"Agni\" (fire), whose place is on the earth; \"Vayu\" (wind), whose place is the air; and \"Surya\" (sun), whose place is in the sky\". This principle of three worlds (or zones), and its multiples is found thereafter in many ancient texts. The Samhitas, which are the oldest layer of text in Vedas enumerate 33 devas, either 11 each for the three worlds, or as 12 Adityas, 11 Rudras, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashvins in the Brahmanas layer of Vedic texts.\n\nThe Rigveda states in hymn 1.139.11,\n\nThirty-three divinities are mentioned in other ancient texts, such as the Yajurveda, however, there is no fixed \"number of deities\" in Hinduism any more than a standard representation of \"deity\". There is, however, a popular perception stating that there are 33 million deities in Hinduism. Most, by far, are goddesses, state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting \"how important and popular goddesses are\" in Hindu culture. No one has a list of the 33 category goddesses and gods, but scholars state all deities are typically viewed in Hinduism as \"emanations or manifestation of genderless principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality\".\n\nThis concept of Brahman is not the same as the monotheistic separate God found in Abrahamic religions, where God is considered, states Brodd, as \"creator of the world, above and independent of human existence\", while in Hinduism \"God, the universe, human beings and all else is essentially one thing\" and everything is connected oneness, the same god is in every human being as Atman, the eternal Self.\n\nHinduism has an ancient and extensive iconography tradition, particularly in the form of \"Murti\" (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or \"Vigraha\" or \"Pratima\". A \"Murti\" is itself not the god in Hinduism, but it is an image of god and represents emotional and religious value. A literal translation of \"Murti\" as idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a \"Murti\" is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a \"Murti\", it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.\n\nA Murti of a Hindu deity is typically made by carving stone, wood working, metal casting or through pottery. Medieval era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas particularly the Shilpa Shastras. The expressions in a \"Murti\" vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from \"Ugra\" symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence (Durga, Kali), as well as \"Saumya\" symbolism to express joy, knowledge and harmony (Saraswati, Lakshmi). Saumya images are most common in Hindu temples. Other Murti forms found in Hinduism include the Linga.\n\nA \"Murti\" is an embodiment of the divine, the Ultimate Reality or Brahman to some Hindus. In religious context, they are found in Hindu temples or homes, where they may be treated as a beloved guest and serve as a participant of Puja rituals in Hinduism. A murti is installed by priests, in Hindu temples, through the Prana Pratishtha ceremony, whereby state Harold Coward and David Goa, the \"divine vital energy of the cosmos is infused into the sculpture\" and then the divine is welcomed as one would welcome a friend. In other occasions, it serves as the center of attention in annual festive processions and these are called \"Utsava Murti\".\n\nIn Hinduism, deities and their icons may be hosted in a Hindu temple, within a home or as an amulet. The worship performed by Hindus is known by a number of regional names, such as \"Puja\". This practice in front of a murti may be elaborate in large temples, or be a simple song or mantra muttered in home, or offering made to sunrise or river or symbolic anicon of a deity. Archaeological evidence of deity worship in Hindu temples trace \"Puja\" rituals to Gupta Empire era (~4th century AD). In Hindu temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, it may be occasional.\n\nThe \"Puja\" practice is structured as an act of welcoming, hosting, honoring the deity of one's choice as one's honored guest, and remembering the spiritual and emotional significance the deity represents the devotee. Jan Gonda, as well as Diana L. Eck, states that a typical \"Puja\" involves one or more of 16 steps (\"Shodasha Upachara\") traceable to ancient times: the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, praise (hymns) with Dhupa or Aarti along with food (Naivedhya) is offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave, and with affection expresses good bye to the deity. The worship practice may also involve reflecting on spiritual questions, with image serving as support for such meditation.\n\nDeity worship (\"Bhakti\"), visiting temples and \"Puja\" rites are not mandatory and is optional in Hinduism; it is the choice of a Hindu, it may be a routine daily affair for some Hindus, periodic ritual or infrequent for some. Worship practices in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.\n\nMajor deities have inspired a vast genre of literature such as the Puranas and Agama texts as well their own Hindu traditions, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism. Vishnu and his avatars are at the foundation of Vaishnavism, Shiva for Shaivism, Devi for Shaktism, and some Hindu traditions such as Smarta traditions who revere multiple major deities (five) as henotheistic manifestations of Brahman (absolute metaphysical Reality).\n\nWhile there are diverse deities in Hinduism, states Lawrence, \"Exclusivism – which maintains that only one's own deity is real\" is rare in Hinduism. Julius Lipner, and other scholars, state that pluralism and \"polycentrism\" – where other deities are recognized and revered by members of different \"denominations\", has been the Hindu ethos and way of life.\n\nThe concept of Triad (or \"Trimurti\", \"Trinity\") makes a relatively late appearance in Hindu literature, or in the second half of 1st millennium BC. The idea of triad, playing three roles in the cosmic affairs, is typically associated with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (also called \"Mahesh\"); however, this is not the only triad in Hindu literature. Other triads include \"Tridevi\", of three goddesses – Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga in the text Devi Mahatmya, in the Shakta tradition, who further assert that Devi is the Brahman (Ultimate Reality) and it is her energy that empowers Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The other triads, formulated as deities in ancient Indian literature, include Sun (creator), Air (sustainer) and Fire (destroyer); Prana (creator), Food (sustainer) and Time (destroyer). These triads, states Jan Gonda, are in some mythologies grouped together without forming a Trinity, and in other times represented as equal, a unity and manifestations of one Brahman. In the Puranas, for example, this idea of threefold \"hypostatization\" is expressed as follows,\n\nThe triad appears in Maitrayaniya Upanishad, for the first time in recognized roles known ever since, where they are deployed to present the concept of three Guṇa – the innate nature, tendencies and inner forces found within every being and everything, whose balance transform and keeps changing the individual and the world. It is in the medieval Puranic texts, \"Trimurti\" concepts appears in various context, from rituals to spiritual concepts. The Bhagavad Gita, in verses 9.18, 10.21-23 and 11.15, asserts that the triad or trinity is manifestation of one Brahman, which Krishna affirms himself to be. However, suggests Bailey, the mythology of triad is \"not the influence nor the most important one\" in Hindu traditions, rather the ideologies and spiritual concepts develop on their own foundations.\n\nHindu mythology has nurtured the concept of Avatar, which represents the descent of a deity on earth. This concept is commonly translated as \"incarnation\", and is an \"appearance\" or \"manifestation\".\n\nThe concept of Avatar is most developed in Vaishnavism tradition, and associated with Vishnu, particularly with Rama and Krishna. Vishnu takes numerous avatars in Hindu mythology. He becomes female, during the Samudra manthan, in the form of Mohini, to resolve a conflict between the Devas and Asuras. His male avatars include Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki. Various texts, particularly the \"Bhagavad Gita\", discuss the idea of Avatar of Vishnu appearing to restore the cosmic balance whenever the power of evil becomes excessive and causes persistent oppression in the world.\n\nIn Shaktism traditions, the concept appears in its legends as the various manifestations of Devi, the Divine Mother principal in Hinduism. The avatars of Devi or Parvati include Durga and Kali, who are particularly revered in eastern states of India, as well as Tantra traditions. Twenty one avatars of Shiva are also described in Shaivism texts, but unlike Vaishnava traditions, Shaiva traditions have focussed directly on Shiva rather than the Avatar concept.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1178087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1178087", "title": "Jewish atheism", "text": "Jewish atheism\n\nJewish atheism refers to the atheism of people who are ethnically and (at least to some extent) culturally Jewish. Because Jewish identity encompasses ethnic as well as religious components, the term \"Jewish atheism\" does not inherently entail a contradiction.\n\nBased on Jewish law's emphasis on matrilineal descent, even religiously conservative Orthodox Jewish authorities would accept an atheist born to a Jewish mother as fully Jewish. A 2011 study found that half of all American Jews have doubts about the existence of God, compared to 10–15% of other American religious groups.\n\nThere has been a phenomenon of atheistic and secular Jewish organizations, mostly in the past century, from the Jewish socialist Bund in early twentieth-century Poland to the modern Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and the Society for Humanistic Judaism in the United States. Many Jewish atheists feel comfortable within any of the three major non-Orthodox Jewish denominations (Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist). This presents less of a contradiction than might first seem apparent, given Judaism's emphasis on practice over belief, with even mainstream guides to Judaism suggesting that belief in God is not a necessary prerequisite to Jewish observance. However, Orthodox Judaism regards the acceptance of the \"Yoke of Heaven\" (the sovereignty of the God of Israel in the world and the divine origin of the Torah) as a fundamental obligation for Jews. Even among non-Orthodox Jews, espousing atheism remains problematic outside of the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and the Society for Humanistic Judaism. The Reform movement, for example, has rejected efforts at affiliation by atheistic temples. The presence of atheists in all denominations of modern Judaism, from Secular Humanistic Judaism to Orthodoxy, has been noted.\n\nLiberal Jewish theology makes few if any metaphysical claims and is thus compatible with atheism on an ontological level. The founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, Mordechai Kaplan, espoused a naturalistic definition of God, while some post-Holocaust theology has also eschewed a personal god. The Jewish philosopher Howard Wettstein has advanced a non-metaphysical approach to religious commitment, according to which metaphysical theism-atheism is not the issue. Harold Schulweis, a Conservative rabbi trained in the Reconstructionist tradition, has argued that Jewish theology should move from a focus on God to an emphasis on \"godliness.\" This \"predicate theology\", while continuing to use theistic language, again makes few metaphysical claims that non-believers would find objectionable.\n\nHowever, some Jewish atheists remain deeply uncomfortable with the use of any kind of theistic language. For such Jews traditional practice and symbolism can still retain powerful meaning. They may continue to engage in Jewish rituals such as the lighting of Shabbat candles and find meaning in many aspects of Jewish culture and religion. For example, to an atheist Jew, the Menorah might represent the power of the Jewish spirit or stand as a symbol of the fight against assimilation. No mention of a divine force in Jewish history would be accepted literally; the Torah may be viewed as a common mythology of the Jewish people, not a faith document or correct history.\n\nMany Jewish atheists would reject even this level of ritualized and symbolic identification, instead embracing a thoroughgoing secularism and basing their Jewishness entirely in ethnicity and secular Jewish culture. Possibilities for secular Jewishness include an identification with Jewish history and peoplehood, immersion in Jewish literature (including such non-religious Jewish authors as Philip Roth and Amos Oz), the consumption of Jewish food, the use of Jewish humor, and an attachment to Jewish languages such as Yiddish, Hebrew or Ladino. A high percentage of Israeli Jews identify themselves as secular, rejecting the practice of the Jewish religion (see Religion in Israel). While some non-believers of Jewish ancestry do not consider themselves Jews, preferring to define themselves solely as atheists, some would argue that Judaism is arguably a culture and tradition that can be embraced without religious faith, despite Jewish culture revolving around Abrahamic conceptions of God.\n\nHistorically, many well-known Jews have rejected a belief in deities. Some have denied the existence of a traditional deity while continuing to use religious language. In 1656 the seventeenth-century Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza was excommunicated by Amsterdam's Sephardic synagogue after advancing a pantheist notion of God that, according to some observers, is both compatible with and paved the way for modern atheism. Deeply influenced by Spinoza, Albert Einstein used theistic language and identified strongly as a Jew, while rejecting the notion of a personal god. The astrophysicist Carl Sagan was born into a Jewish family and was a non-theist.\n\nKarl Marx was born into an ethnically Jewish family but raised as a Lutheran, and is among the most notable and influential atheist thinkers of modern history; he developed dialectical and historical materialism which became the basis for his critique of capitalism and his theories of scientific socialism. Marx became a major influence among other prominent Jewish intellectuals including Moses Hess. In one of his most cited comments on religion he stated: \"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people\".\n\nMany other famous Jews have wholeheartedly embraced atheism, rejecting religiosity altogether. Sigmund Freud penned \"The Future of an Illusion\", in which he both eschewed religious belief and outlined its origins and prospects. At the same time he urged a Jewish colleague to raise his son within the Jewish religion, arguing that \"If you do not let your son grow up as a Jew, you will deprive him of those sources of energy which cannot be replaced by anything else.\" The anarchist Emma Goldman was born to an Orthodox Jewish family and rejected belief in God, while the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, when asked if she believed in God, answered \"I believe in the Jewish people, and the Jewish people believe in God.\" More recently, the French Jewish philosopher Jacques Derrida stated somewhat cryptically, \"I rightly pass for an atheist\". In the world of entertainment, Woody Allen has made a career out of the tension between his Jewishness and religious doubt (\"Not only is there no God, but try getting a plumber on weekends\"). David Silverman, president of the American Atheists since 2010, swore after his bar mitzvah that he would never again lie about not being an atheist.\n"}

{"id": "309846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309846", "title": "Judy Chicago", "text": "Judy Chicago\n\nJudy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen; July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is \"The Dinner Party\", which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. \"The Dinner Party\" celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include \"International Honor Quilt\", \"The Birth Project,\" \"Powerplay,\" and \"The Holocaust Project.\"\n\nJudy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in Chicago, Illinois. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of rabbis, including the Vilna Gaon. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a labor organizer and a Marxist. He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a medical secretary. Arthur's active participation in the American Communist Party, liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief. During the McCarthyism era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil. In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an FBI agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house. Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from peritonitis. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved grief.\n\nMay loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a potter. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the Art Institute of Chicago to attend classes. By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she \"never wanted to do anything but make art\" and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute, and instead attended UCLA on a scholarship.\n\nWhile at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitch hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964.\n\nWhile in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called \"Bigamy,\" and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was \"stopped in flight\" before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.\n\nIn 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show. In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \"California Women in the Arts\" exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered, \"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\" Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented \"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\" another reference towards her husband's death.\nIn 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \"experimental\" gallery. \"Art in America\" noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the work as showing no signs of \"theoretical New York type art.\" Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be \"one of the boys\". Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create \"atmospheres\", which involved flashes of coloured smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \"feminize\" and \"soften\" the landscape.\n\nDuring this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the \"Pasadena Lifesavers,\" which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\" representing her own discovery that \"I was multi-orgasmic.\" Chicago credited \"Pasadena Lifesavers,\" as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.\n\nAs Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage. During this time, she married sculptor Lloyd Hamrol, in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.) Gallery owner Rolf Nelson nicknamed her \"Judy Chicago\" because of her strong personality and thick Chicago accent. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. She changed her last name from an ethnically charged, Gerowitz, to an ethnically neutral Chicago. In doing so, she freed herself from a certain social identity. Chicago was described as being \"appalled\" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally. To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a boxer, wearing a sweatshirt with her new last name on it. She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at California State University at Fullerton, that read: \"Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.\" An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in \"Artforum's\" October 1970 issue.\n\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.\n\nChicago is considered one of the \"first-generation feminist artists,\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.\n\nChicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \"feminine\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively.\n\nWomanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. It began in the fall of 1971. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. \n\"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women.\" Womanhouse is a \"true\" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.\n\nIn 1975, Chicago's first book, \"Through the Flower\", was published; it \"chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist.\"\n\nChicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about \"their\" history. This action would become Chicago's masterpiece, \"The Dinner Party\", now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. It took her five years and cost about $250,000 to complete. First, Chicago conceived the project in her Santa Monica studio: a large triangle, which measures 48-feet by 43-feet by 36-feet, consisting of 39 place settings. Each place setting commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists and martyrs. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in needlework, creating sculptures and other aspects of the process. When \"The Dinner Party\" was first constructed it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and \"The Dinner Party\", entitled \"The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970-2007\".\n\nThere were many art critics including Hilton Kramer from The New York Times, who were unimpressed by her work. Mr. Kramer felt Judy's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and \"it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination\". Although art critics, felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just \"vaginas on plates\", it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago was able to debut her work in 6 countries on 3 different continents. She was able to reach over a million people through her artwork. Her piece of work may not have agreed with critics but was able to captivate the public with her feminist message and honor the 39 historical figures and 999 other women featured in her work.\n\nFrom 1980 until 1985, Chicago created \"Birth Project\". It took five years to create. The piece used images of childbirth to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world. The installation reinterpreted the Genesis creation narrative, which focused on the idea that a male god created a male human, Adam, without the involvement of a woman. Chicago described the piece as revealing a \"primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.\" 150 needleworkers from the United States, Canada and New Zealand assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by quilting, macrame, embroidery and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from \"Birth Project\" are held in the collection of the Albuquerque Museum.\n\nChicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, \"There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had.\"\n\nAfter \"Birth Project\", Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created \"PowerPlay,\" a series of drawings, weavings, paintings, cast paper and bronze reliefs. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male gaze with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\" Chicago's \"The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light\" (1985–93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year's Eve 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both Jewish, it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage. Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an epic poem about the Holocaust. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish. The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from Lou Gehrig's disease, and the death of her mother from cancer.\n\nChicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty. To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary \"Shoah\", which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at Nazi concentration camps and other relevant Holocaust sites. They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust. They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited Israel. Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as environmentalism, Native American genocide, and the Vietnam War. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust. This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns. \"The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light\" consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at Sabbath. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer. \"The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light\" was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago. Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nOver the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims. Galit Mana of \"Jewish Renaissance\" magazine notes, \"This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition\", including \"Voices from the Song of Songs\" (1997), where Chicago \"introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.\"\n\nIn 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a \"Renewal Ketubah\" in 2010.\n\nIn 1994, Judy Chicago started \"Resolutions: A Stitch in Time\" which took 6 years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000.\n\nIn 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic Belen Hotel, an historic railroad hotel in Belen, New Mexico which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.\n\nChicago's archives are held at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College, and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the University of New Mexico. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded honorary degrees from Lehigh University, Smith College, Duke University and Russell Sage College. In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. Chicago was named a National Women's History Project honoree for Women's History Month in 2008. Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to Penn State University in 2011. She lives in New Mexico. In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the \"Concurrents\" exhibition at the Getty Museum. For the exhibition, she returned to the Pomona College football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.\n\nChicago had two solo exhibitions in the United Kingdom in 2012, one in London and another in Liverpool. The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about Virginia Woolf. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career. That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.\n\nChicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass. Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: \"I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\" Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of \"The Dinner Party\". In the words of the artist: \"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\"\n\nChicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, The British Museum, The Brooklyn Museum, The Getty Trust, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New Mexico Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, The National Museum of Women in the Arts, The Penn Academy of the Fine Arts, and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn her interview with Gloria Steinem, Chicago spoke of her \"goal as an artist\", stating that it \"…has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze.\"\n\nChicago trained herself in \"macho arts,\" taking classes in auto body work, boat building, and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned spray painting techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create fireworks for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring fiberglass and metal into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under Mim Silinsky to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in \"The Dinner Party\". Chicago also added the skill of stained glass to her artistic tool belt, which she used for \"The Holocaust Project\". Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed. Since 2003, Chicago has been working with glass.\n\nCollaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. \"The Dinner Party\", \"The Birth Project\" and \"The Holocaust Project\" were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to \"stereotypical\" women's arts such as textile arts. Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.\n\nIn 1978, Chicago founded Through the Flower, a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of \"The Dinner Party,\" before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a \"living curriculum\" for education about feminist art ideas and pedagogy. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to Penn State University in 2011.\n\nJudy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at UCLA in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn’t challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match -- both in her artwork and in her personal style --  what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed “masculine”, and attended motorcycle shows. This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago’s teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in feminism. Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which \"female-centered content,\" such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as \"personal is political\" content for art. Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as \"participatory art pedagogy.\"\n\nThe art created in the Feminist Art Program and Womanhouse introduced perspectives and content about women’s lives that had been taboo topics in society, including the art world. In 1970 Chicago developed the Feminist Art Program at California State University, Fresno, and has implemented other teaching projects that conclude with an art exhibition by students such as Womanhouse with Miriam Schapiro at CalArts, and \"SINsation\" in 1999 at Indiana University, \"From Theory to Practice: A Journey of Discovery\" at Duke University in 2000, \"At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman\" at Western Kentucky University in 2002, \"Envisioning the Future\" at California Polytechnic State University and Pomona Arts Colony in 2004, and \"Evoke/Invoke/Provoke\" at Vanderbilt University in 2005. Several students involved in Judy Chicago’s teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including Suzanne Lacy, Faith Wilding, and Nancy Youdelman.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts preparation, process, and art-making. Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1157501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1157501", "title": "Leningrad Codex", "text": "Leningrad Codex\n\nThe Leningrad Codex (Latin: \"Codex Leningradensis\", the \"codex of Leningrad\") is the oldest \"complete\" manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew, using the Masoretic Text and Tiberian vocalization. It is dated 1008 CE (or possibly 1009) according to its colophon. The Aleppo Codex, against which the Leningrad Codex was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.\n\nIn modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in \"Biblia Hebraica\" (1937) and \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" (1977). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.\n\nThe Leningrad Codex (a codex is a handwritten book as opposed to a scroll) is so named because it has been housed at the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg since 1863. In 1924, after the Russian Revolution, Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the Biblia Hebraica since 1937, it became internationally known as the \"Leningrad Codex\". Although in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city's original name was restored to St Petersburg, the National Library of Russia requested that \"Leningrad\" be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the Codex Petersburgensis or Petropolitanus, or the St. Petersburg Codex. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (916 CE), but contains only the later Prophets.\n\nThe biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian vowels and cantillation signs. In addition, there are masoretic notes in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather.\n\nThe Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The carpet page shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle.\n\nThe order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of Sephardic biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the Ketuvim. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below.\n\nAccording to its colophon, the codex was copied in Cairo from manuscripts written by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher. It has been claimed to be a product of the Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that Asher ever saw it. Unusual for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and cantillation) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher's tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not superb, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in many hundreds of places. There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by Moshe Goshen-Gottstein that an existing text not following Asher's rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules.\n\nThe codex is now preserved in the National Library of Russia, accessioned as \"Firkovich B 19 A\". Its former owner, the Crimean Karaite collector Abraham Firkovich, left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in St Petersburg.\n\nIn 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while Paul E. Kahle supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of \"Biblia Hebraica\" (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ).\n\nAs an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until Biblia Hebraica.\n\nThe Westminster Leningrad Codex is an online digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the Westminster Theological Seminary. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the University of Michigan in 1981-1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan, with further proofreading and corrections. The online version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax.\n\nThe Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two important modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh):\n\nFor minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.\n\nAs explained in the Contents section above, this is different from most modern Hebrew bibles:\n\nThe Torah:\n\nThe \"Nevi'im\":\n\nThe \"Ketuvim\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43574212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43574212", "title": "Northeast China folk religion", "text": "Northeast China folk religion\n\nNortheast China folk religion is the variety of Chinese folk religion of northeast China, characterised by distinctive cults original to Hebei and Shandong, transplanted and adapted by the Han Chinese settlers of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang (the three provinces comprising Manchuria) since the Qing dynasty. It is characterised by terminology, deities and practices that are different from those of central and southern Chinese folk religion. Many of these patterns derive from the interaction of Han religion with Manchu shamanism.\n\nProminence is given to the worship of zoomorphic deities, of a \"totemic\" significance. In the region the terms \"shen\" 神 (\"god\") and \"xian\" 仙 (\"immortal being\") are synonymous. Figures of ritual specialists or shamans perform various ritual functions for groups of believers and local communities, including \"chūmǎxiān\" (出馬仙 \"riding for the immortals\"), dances, healing, exorcism, divination, and communication with ancestors.\n\nThe formation of northeast China's folk religion and shamanism can be traced back to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), when a large number of Han Chinese settled in the northeast of China mixing with Manchus. Either in the Qing period, and in the later Republic of China (1912-1949) and subsequent People's Republic, the worship of zoomorphic deities and the practice of \"chumaxian\" had bad relationship with the governments, which considered it \"feudal superstition\" (封建迷信 \"fēngjiàn míxìn\") and banned through different decrees.\n\nThe popular worship of animal gods began to resurface in the 1980s, and soon also the \"chumaxian\" practice was revived. In the 2010s there have been attempts to protect \"chumaxian\" under the policy of \"intangible cultural heritage\".\n\nThe study of northeast China's folk religion owes much to the scholarly enterprise that the Japanese conducted on the subject during the period of \"Manchukuo\" (1932–1945) that they established after they occupied Manchuria. Unlike Japanese-occupied Korea and occupied Taiwan, Manchuria was conceived as an autonomous nation, not to be assimilated into Japan, but rather to be modeled after the latter's social and religious structure keeping an independent identity.\n\nŌmachi Tokuzo (1909-1970), a pupil of Yanagita Kunio (the founder of academic ethnography in Japan), conducted field research on local religion in Manchuria through the war years. He later acted as the head of the Society for the Study of Manchurian Customs, producing an impressive body of research on local religion in Manchuria and north China. Ōmachi identified the rural village, each with a Tudishen shrine, as the fundamental unit of northeast China's local religion and of the religious character of the Han Chinese race. He also studies local Chinese goddess worship and the great similarity and integration of the Han and the Manchus. Ōmachi does not appear to have supported the institution of Shinto shrines in Manchurian villages, which in Korea and Taiwan were intended for the spiritual transformation of the locals into Japanese citizens by their integration into Shinto communities.\n\nAnother scholar, Tokunaga Takeshi, sought to demonstrate the spiritual unity of Japan, Manchuria and China by highlighting the similarities between ancient religious structures of the three nations:\n\nJapanese ancient shrines are of the \"kannabi\" (popularly known as Mt. Fuji-style) shape. There are many of these in Manchuria, as well ... [The artifacts] develop from the same agrarian culture and philosophy as Japanese Shinto (\"kannagara no michi\") ... Modern [Chinese] matron temples have these elements, as well. Therefore, since the temples were built later, it is thought that matron worship was grafted onto this earlier pattern of belief.\n\nOther scholars studied the similarities between local and Japanese shamanisms. The \"Manchukuo\" generally promoted a racially centered spiritual revival, that is an ethnic religion for each of the races inhabiting Manchuria. For example, under the suggestions of Ogasawara Shozo that the Mongols \"need(ed) a new religion, specifically a new god\" they promoted the worship of Genghis Khan that continues today in northern China. The Shinto shrine of Kalgan (now Zhangjiakou, Hebei) incorporated Genghis Khan worship and was opened to local Mongols.\n\nBesides common Chinese deities such as \"Guāndì\" (关帝 \"\"Divus\" Guan\", the god of war), people of north China and Manchuria have distinctive zoomorphic deities, and the worship of clusters of goddesses is popular. The gods are ordained in hierarchies, a pattern inherited from the Chinese Confucian lineage system. Fox deities have a very important position, with evident parallels in the Japanese cult of Inari Ōkami. Usually at the head of the pantheon are placed the \"Great Lord of the Three Foxes\" (胡三太爷 \"Húsān Tàiyé\") and the \"Great Lady of the Three Foxes\" (胡三太奶 \"Húsān Tàinǎi\").\n\nThe Five Great Immortals (五大仙 \"Wǔdàxiān\") are deities who reproduce cosmological structures of common Chinese theology. The cult generally includes: ① \"Húxiān\" (狐仙=胡仙 \"Fox Immortal\") or \"Húshén\" (狐神 \"Fox God\"), the most important deity in northeast China; ② \"Huángxiān\" (黃仙 literally \"Yellow Immortal\") the Weasel God, who holds the position of the Yellow Deity of Chinese theology; ③ \"Shéxiān\" (蛇仙 literally \"Snake Immortal\"), also called \"Liǔxiān\" (柳仙 \"Immortal Liu\") or \"Mǎngxiān\" (蟒仙 \"Python (or Boa) Immortal\"), who can represent the Dragon God, Fuxi and Nüwa; ④ \"Báixiān\" (白仙 \"White Immortal\") is the Hedgehog God; and ⑤ \"Hēixiān\" (黑仙 \"Black Immortal\") who can be the \"Wūyāxiān\" (乌鸦仙 \"Crow Immortal\") or the \"Huīxiān\" (灰仙 \"Rat Immortal\").\n\nWhile the Fox God and the Weasel God always remain the two prominent members of the cult of the zoomorphic deities, the other positions vary in some regions including the Tiger, the Wolf, the Hare and the Turtle Gods. Other areas host the worship of the Leopard, the Mole, the Toad and the Rabbit Gods. In certain counties of Hebei they are reduced to four (四大仙 \"Sìdàxiān\") including the Fox, the Weasel, the Hedgehog and the Snake Gods.\n\nCommon Chinese deities are associated to the cult of the zoomorphic gods. For instance, \"Huáng Dàxiān\" (黄大仙 \"Great Yellow Immortal\") is popular in north and northeast China, although he has no relation to Taoism as in southeastern China, and is rather identified as the Weasel God.\n\nLocal terminology distinguishes the animal gods as the middle way between the \"shàngfáng shénxiān\" (上房神仙 \"everlasting gods\") gods of the greater cosmos important in Taoism, that are only worshipped and do not take possession of shamans; and the \"yīnxiān\" (陰仙 \"underworld gods\"), deceased beings who became gods through self-cultivation (ancestors and progenitors). In northeastern Taoism, besides the Fox Gods, the pantheon is headed by a goddess, the \"Black Mother\" (黑媽媽 \"Hēi māmā\").\n\nNortheastern shamans consider themselves to be \"disciples\" (\"dìzǐ\" 弟子) of the gods rather than mere channels of communication between the gods and the human world. Another name used to refer to these ritual masters is \"xiāngtóu\" (香頭 \"incense heads\"). Their practice is generally called \"chumaxian\" (出马仙), which means \"the gods who take action\" or more literally \"riding for the immortals\", a definition which implies that the gods and their disciples act as an organic whole, and in their action, form and content they express themselves together.\n\nThere are two types of possession that the northeastern shamans experience in terms of consciousness: \"quánméng\" (全蒙 \"complete unconsciousness\", in which the disciple is not aware of what happens and what the god says) and \"bànméng\" (半蒙 \"semi-unconsciousness\", in which the disciple is aware of what happens during the possession).\n\nThey also practise a communication with ancestors through an ecstatic experience called \"guòyīn\" (过阴 \"passing to the underworld\"). This is part of the practices of both \"chumaxian\" and related communal rites of broader Chinese local religion.\n\nNortheastern Chinese shamanism shares similarities with southern Chinese mediumship (\"jitong\"), Japanese Shinto practices, and various other shamanisms in the region (Tungus and Manchu shamanism, Mongolian shamanism, Korean shamanism, broader Siberian shamanism). Historically it is the result of the encounter of Han Chinese and Manchu cultures, especially the Han cult of the fox and Manchu \"wild ritual\" (\"wuwate\", Chinese: \"yějì\" 野祭).\n\nNortheastern Chinese shamans are predominantly women, like the shamans of Northeast Asian shamanism, while southern Chinese mediums are almost exclusively men. Moreover, while northeastern shamans are usually independent from formal religious institutions, southern medium specialists often collaborate with Taoist priests. Another distinction is that while southern mediums can acquire their role through training, and they are possessed mostly by Taoist and strictly Chinese gods, northeastern shamans are \"chosen\" or \"ordained\" by gods themselves (through \"mo\", \"sickness\") as in other shamanic traditions, and their gods are animal totems. When a future disciple is chosen, she experiences \"mo\" (\"sickness\").\n\nIn northeast China terminology for religious places and groups may follow the common Chinese model, with \"miao\" (庙) defining any \"sacred precinct\" dedicated to a god. However, a different terminology exists and temples may be called \"xiāntáng\" (仙堂 \"hall of the immortals\") or \"tángzi\" (堂子), the latter name inherited from the temples of the \"bolongzi\" (Chinese: \"jiājì\" 家祭, \"ancestral ritual\") of Manchu shamanism. Shamans also hold \"immediate halls\" of worship (\"lìtáng\" 立堂) in their houses.\n\nSince Chinese Buddhism and professional Taoism were never well developed in northeast China, the religious life of the region has been heavily influenced by networks of folk salvationist sects and Confucian churches, characterised by a congregational structure and a scriptural core. During the Japanese occupation they weren't studied, but their role as a moral catalyser for the Han race was emphasised.\n\nThe Yiguandao (一貫道 \"Consistent Way\") had a strong presence in the area, but were especially the Guiyidao (皈依道 \"Way of the Return to the One\") and the Shanrendao (善人道 \"Way of the Virtuous Man\", which social body was known as the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue) to have millions of followers in Manchuria alone. Shanrendao remains widespread even after the Maoist period and the Cultural Revolution, and headquarters of the Church of the Way and its Virtue have been re-established in Beijing in the 2010s. In more recent decades northeast China has also seen the rise of the Falun Gong, which was founded in the 1990s in Jilin.\n\nDuring the period of \"Manchukuo\" also many Japanese new religions, or independent Shinto sects, proselytised in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the Omoto teaching, the Tenri teaching and the Konko teaching of Shinto. The Omoto teaching is the Japanese near equivalent of Guiyidao, as the two religions have common roots and history.\n\n\n"}

Even though they lead the ministry in their parishes, their legal status is little different from assistant curates. However, the term \"priest in charge\" has come to be used because the term \"curate\" often refers to an \"assistant curate\", who is usually a priest recently ordained who is not in charge of a parish — although it is quite possible for a priest previously beneficed to return to a curacy, sometimes as a matter of choice. The stipend of a priest in charge is often the equivalent to that of an incumbent, and so they are sometimes referred to as having \"incumbent status\".\n\nIncumbents include vicars and rectors.\n\nIn the Church of Ireland, priests in charge are referred to as \"bishop's curates\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11507903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11507903", "title": "Rasa lila", "text": "Rasa lila\n\nThe Rass lila (IAST ') () or Rass dance\"' is part of the traditional story of Krishna described in Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavata Purana and literature such as the Gita Govinda, where he dances with Radha and her sakhis. The Indian classical dance of Kathak evolved from the 'Raslila of Braj and Manipuri Classical Dance' (Vrindavana) also known as \"Natwari Nritya\", which was revived in 1960s by the Kathak dancer, Uma Sharma.\n\nThe term, \"rasa\" meaning \"aesthetics\" and \"lila\" meaning \"act,\" \"play\" or \"dance\" is a concept from Hinduism, which roughly translates to \"play (lila) of aesthetics (rasa),\" or more broadly as \"Dance of Divine Love\".\n\nThe rasa lila takes place one night when the Gopis of Vrindavana, upon hearing the sound of Krishna's flute, sneak away from their households and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night, which Krishna supernaturally stretches to the length of one Night of Brahma, a Hindu unit of time lasting approximately 4.32 billion years. In the Krishna Bhakti traditions, the rasa-lila is considered to be one of the highest and most esoteric of Krishna's pastimes. In these traditions, romantic love between human beings in the material world is seen as merely a diminished, illusionary reflection of the soul’s original, ecstatic spiritual love for Krishna, God, in the spiritual world.\n\nIn the Bhagavata Purana it is stated that whoever faithfully hears or describes the Rasa lila attains Krishna's \"pure loving devotion\" (Suddha-bhakti).\n\nJust as a child plays at its own will with its reflection in a mirror, even so with the help of His Yogamāyā Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa sported with the Gopīs, who were like many shadows of His own form.\n\nApart from the definition above, the term also comes from the Sanskrit words \"rasa\" and \"lila\", with \"rasa\" meaning “juice”, “nectar”, \"emotion\" or \"sweet taste\" and \"lila\" meaning \"act\".By taking this etymologic breakdown of the word literally, \"Rasa Lila\" means the “sweet act” (of Krishna). It is often freely rendered as \"the dance of love\".\n\nRasa lila has been a popular theme in Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Meitei, and Kuchipudi items. Rasa Lila is a popular form of folk theatre in the regions of Mathura, Vrindavana in Uttar Pradesh, especially during the festivals of\nKrishna Janmashtami and Holi, and amongst various followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in the region. Raas Leela (Raax Mahotsav) is also observed as one of the State Festivals of Assam which usually is celebrated during Late November or Early December. During Raas Mahotsava, several thousand devotees visit the holy temples and Xatras of Assam every year. The Raas Mahotsav of Majuli, Nalbari and Of Howly deserve a special mention in this regard.\nIn the tradition of Vaishnavism of Manipur \"Rasa Lila\" is depicted within Manipuri classical Indian dance, and revolves around the same story of the love between Krishna and the cowherd girls and tells the divine love story of Krishna, svayam bhagavan and Radha, his divine beloved. This form of dance was started by Bhagya Chandra in 1779 and in some parts of India is still performed every year on Krishna Janmashtami (the festival to celebrate Krishna's \"birthday\"). According to different traditions, the rasa-lila is performed either by boys and girls, or by girls only. The dance is performed holding \"dandi\" (sticks) and is often accompanied with folk songs and devotional music.\n\nThe Traditional Rasa Lila performances in Vrindavan are famous throughout the Vaisnava world as an experience of the spiritual world. Rasa Lila performance was started by Swami Sri Uddhavaghamanda Devacharya in the early 15th Century CE at Vamshivata in Vrindavan, Mathura. He was a prominent saint of the Nimbarka Sampradaya, and disciple of the world-renowned Swami Sri Harivyasa Devacarya. The Vani literature of Vraja is the transcription of the songs that were heard by Swami Harivyasa Devacarya and his Guru, Swami Shri Shribhatta as they meditated on the Nitya Lila of Shri Radha Krishna. These songs describe the eternal spiritual abode of Shri Radha Krishna, the Sakhis and Nitya Vrindavana Dham - or Nikunja Dham.\n\nAs many new devotees of that time could not understand the Vraja language, Swami Uddavaghamanda Devacarya trained his Brahmachari students to play the parts that appeared in the songs in order to get a visual representation of the Lila that was being described. Many were sceptical of this, and attempted to thwart the first enactment. However, at the conclusion of the first Rasa Lila, tradition has it, the Lord Himself appeared and gave the actors his own Crown, and decreed that whenever a qualified actor was to take the part of the Lord, from the moment he put on the crown on his head, it should be understood that he represents the Lila potency of God, and treated with due respect. Shri Radha and Krsna shall be known as Shri Radha Rasavihari.\n\nSince then, the traditional form has remained that actors who are young Brahmacharis will join a group led by the Swami of that group. The music remains the typical Dhrupada style of the Vraja Acharyas who penned the songs they heard to the accompaniment of Sitar and Pakhawaj and the songs are sung in Vraja Language, a parent to modern Hindi.\n\nRecently, many people have changed the traditional music to popular music. Yet there are a dedicated few who seek to preserve the traditional form of devotional art known as Rasa Lila.\n\n\n\n"}

A country of an estimated 2.26 million people in 2015, Christianity arrived in Botswana in mid 1870s, with the colonial rule. The conversion process was relatively quick than neighboring southern African countries, because regional hereditary tribal chiefs locally called \"Dikgosi\" converted to Christianity, which triggered the entire group they led to convert as well. The \"Dikgosi\" converted in the belief that the Christian missionaries would help them source guns to resist Afrikaner trekkers from south as well help resist imperialist white foreigners. Some scholars place the initial contacts between Christian missionaries and Bechuanaland (old name of Botswana) a few decades earlier.\n\nAfter the arrival of Christianity in Botswana, the missionaries established Bible schools and attempted to end old practices such as \"Bogwera\" (the tribe's traditional initiation ceremony into manhood) and \"Bojale\" (a girl's initiation ceremony into womanhood after she reached puberty), both of which were traditionally linked to the social acceptance of someone readiness to marry as well the right to inherit property. These practices continued to be in vogue in private, despite missionary efforts to end them. The Christian missionaries, particularly the London Missionary Society, was politically involved as interpreters between the tribal chiefs and the colonial administrators.\nAfter Botswana gained independence in 1966 from the colonial rule, senior Christian mission officials and Reverends served as the first Speaker of the National Assembly and as officials in the new government. In 1970s, its new leaders reviewed the Christian colonial curriculum in schools, revised it in order to restore traditional values based on pre-Christian religious ideas, such as \"Kagisanyo\" and \"Botho\", respectively harmony and humanism. Bogwera and Bojale were re-introduced. The new leaders also adopted a policy of religious tolerance and freedom, an approach towards religion in Botswana that continues in the 21st century. However, the school curriculum remains largely as before with Christian terminology and ideologies.\n\nAn estimated 70 percent of Botswana citizens in 2001 identified themselves as Christians. In 2006, a Botswana government published report listed 63 percent of its citizens were Christians of various denominations, about 27 percent said their religion as “God,” about 8 percent claimed to have no religion, 2 percent were adherents of the traditional indigenous religion Badimo, and all other religious groups (Buddhism, Hindu, Islam, Judaism, others) in total were less than 1 percent of Botswana population. Of the others category, Muslims were 0.4% and Hindus were 0.3% of the total population.\n\nThe constitution of Botswana protects the freedom of religion, allows missionaries and proselytizers to work freely after they register with the government, but forced conversion is against the law. There is no state religion in Botswana.\n\nBotswana recognizes only Christian holidays as public holidays. The nationwide religious observations include Good Friday, Easter Monday, Ascension Day, and Christmas.\n\n"}

{"id": "48559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48559", "title": "Synagogue", "text": "Synagogue\n\nA synagogue (pronounced ; from Greek , ', 'assembly', ', 'house of assembly' or ', \"house of prayer\", Yiddish: \"shul\", Ladino: ' or \"\"), is a Jewish or Samaritan house of worship.\n\nSynagogues have a large place for prayer (the main sanctuary) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices. Some have a separate room for Torah study, called the \"beth midrash\" \"house of study\".\n\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, Tanakh (the entire Hebrew Bible, including the Torah) reading, study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for worship. Halakha holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a minyan) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nIsraelis use the Hebrew term ' \"house of assembly\". Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally used the Yiddish term ' (cognate with the German , 'school') in everyday speech. Sephardi Jews and Romaniote Jews generally use the term \"kal\" (from the Hebrew \"Ḳahal\", meaning \"community\"). Spanish Jews call the synagogue a and Portuguese Jews call it an . Persian Jews and some Karaite Jews also use the term \"kenesa\", which is derived from Aramaic, and some Mizrahi Jews use \"kenis\". Some Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative Jews use the word \"temple\". The Greek word \"synagogue\" is used in English (German, French and most Romance languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.\n\nAlthough synagogues existed a long time before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood centered around the \"korbanot\" (\"sacrificial offerings\") brought by the \"kohanim\" (\"priests\") in the Temple in Jerusalem. The all-day Yom Kippur service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the \"kohen gadol\" (\"the high priest\") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.\n\nDuring the Babylonian captivity (586–537 BCE) the men of the Great Assembly formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.\n\nJohanan ben Zakai, one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.\n\nSynagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple. The earliest archaeological evidence for the existence of very early synagogues comes from Egypt, where stone synagogue dedication inscriptions dating from the 3rd century BCE prove that synagogues existed by that date. More than a dozen Jewish (and possibly Samaritan) Second Temple era synagogues have been identified by archaeologists in Israel and other countries belonging to the Hellenistic world.\n\nAny Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.\nIt has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the First Jewish–Roman War; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period. The popularization of prayer over sacrifice during the years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE had prepared the Jews for life in the diaspora, where prayer would serve as the focus of Jewish worship.\n\nDespite the possibility of synagogue-like spaces prior to the First Jewish–Roman War, the synagogue emerged as a stronghold for Jewish worship upon the destruction of the Temple. For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a \"portable system of worship\". Within the synagogue, Jews worshipped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as the main form of worship within the Second Temple.\n\nThe Samaritan house of worship is also called a synagogue. During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, during the Hellenistic period, the Greek word used in the Diaspora by Samaritans and Jews was the same: \"proseucheµ\" (literally, a place of prayer); a later, 3rd or 4th century CE inscription, uses a similar Greek term: \"eukteµrion\" (prayer house). The oldest Samaritan synagogue discovered so far is from Delos in the Aegean Islands, with an inscription dated between 250 and 175 BCE, while most Samaritan synagogues excavated in the wider Land of Israel and ancient Samaria in particular, were built during the 4th-7th centuries, at the very end of the Roman and throughout the Byzantine period.\n\nThe elements which distinguish Samaritan synagogues from contemporary Jewish ones are:\n\n\nAncient Samaritan synagogues are mentioned by literary sources or have been found by archaeologists in the Diaspora, in the wider Holy Land, and specifically in Samaria.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the first Christian centuries, Jewish-Christians used houses of worship known in academic literature as synagogue-churches. Scholars have claimed to have identified such houses of worship of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah in Jerusalem and Nazareth.\n\nThere is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\n\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in Kaifeng, China looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the Eastern Roman Empire. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with mudéjar plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in Budapest and Prague are typical Gothic structures.\n\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were Neoclassical, Neo-Byzantine, Romanesque Revival, Moorish Revival, Gothic Revival, and Greek Revival. There are Egyptian Revival synagogues and even one Mayan Revival synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\n\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.\nAll synagogues contain a \"Bimah\", a raised platform where the table of the rabbi is found.\n\nA large, raised, reader's platform called the () by Ashkenazim and (= reading dais) by Sephardim, where the Torah scroll is placed to be read is a feature of all synagogues. In Sephardi synagogues it is also used as the prayer leader's reading desk.\nIn Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table. Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.\n\nThe Torah Ark, called in Hebrew \"Aron Kodesh\" or 'holy chest', and alternatively called the \"heikhal\"— or 'temple' by Sephardic Jews, is a cabinet in which the Torah scrolls are kept.\n\nThe ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards Jerusalem. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face east, while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\n\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the Ark of the Covenant, which held the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the Holy of Holies. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the , which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.\n\nOther traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the (), the \"Eternal Light\", used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.\n\nA synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.\n\nOriginally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in Spain, the Maghreb (North Africa), Babylonia, the Land of Israel and Yemen having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches. Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.\n\nUntil the 19th century, in an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats most often faced the Torah Ark. In a Sephardic synagogue, seats were usually arranged around the perimeter of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark.\n\nMany current synagogues have an elaborate chair named for the prophet Elijah, which is only sat upon during the ceremony of Brit milah.\n\nIn ancient synagogues, a special chair placed on the wall facing Jerusalem and next to the Torah Shrine was reserved for the prominent members of the congregation and for important guests. This might be what Jesus referred to as the \"seat of Moses\" or \"chair of Moses\" (), or is mentioned as the \"chief seats in the synagogues\" elsewhere in the Gospels ( etc.). Such a stone-carved and inscribed seat was discovered at archaeological excavations in the synagogue at Chorazin in Galilee and dates from the 4th–6th century; another one was discovered at the Delos Synagogue, complete with a footstool, reminiscent of : \"... you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool.”\"\n\nIn Yemen, the Jewish custom was to take-off one's shoes immediately prior to entering the synagogue, a custom that had been observed by Jews in other places in earlier times. Today, the custom of removing one's shoes is no longer practised in Israel.\n\nOrthodox synagogues feature a partition () dividing the men's and women's seating areas, or a separate women's section located on a balcony.\n\nThe German-Jewish Reform movement, which arose in the early 19th century, made many changes to the traditional look of the synagogue, keeping with its desire to simultaneously stay Jewish yet be accepted by the host culture.\n\nThe first Reform synagogue, which opened in Hamburg in 1811, introduced changes that made the synagogue look more like a church. These included: the installation of an organ to accompany the prayers (even on Shabbat, when musical instruments are proscribed by halakha), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.\n\nIn following decades, the central reader's table, the Bimah, was moved to the front of the Reform sanctuary—previously unheard-of in Orthodox synagogues.\n\nGender separation was also removed.\n\nSynagogues often take on a broader role in modern Jewish communities and may include additional facilities such as a catering hall, kosher kitchen, religious school, library, day care center and a smaller chapel for daily services.\n\nSince many Orthodox and some non-Orthodox Jews prefer to collect a minyan (a quorum of ten) rather than pray alone, they commonly assemble at pre-arranged times in offices, living rooms, or other spaces when these are more convenient than formal synagogue buildings. A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called (, pl. or , Yiddish for \"little house\"), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.\n\nAnother type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the \"Chavurah\" (חבורה, pl. \"chavurot\", חבורות), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In antiquity, the Pharisees lived near each other in \"chavurot\" and dined together to ensure that none of the food was unfit for consumption.\n\nSome synagogues bear the title \"great synagogue\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24104169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24104169", "title": "Syncretistic controversy", "text": "Syncretistic controversy\n\nThe syncretistic controversy was the theological debate provoked by the efforts of Georg Calixt and his supporters to secure a basis on which the Lutherans could make overtures to the Roman Catholic and the Reformed Churches. It lasted from 1640 to 1686. \n\nCalixt, a professor at Helmstedt, had through his travels in England, the Netherlands, Italy, and France, through his acquaintance with the different Churches and their representatives, and through his extensive study, developed a more friendly attitude towards the different religious bodies than the majority of his contemporary Lutheran theologians.\n\nWhile the latter firmly adhered to the \"pure doctrine,\" Calixt tended not to regard doctrine as the one thing necessary for a Christian; while in doctrine itself he did not regard everything as equally certain and important. Consequently, he advocated unity between those who agreed on the fundamental minimum, with liberty as to all less fundamental points. In regard to Catholicism, he would have (as Melanchthon once would have) conceded to the pope a primacy human in origin, and he also admitted that one might call the Mass a sacrifice.\n\nOn the side of Calixt stood the theological faculties of Helmstedt, Rinteln, and Königsberg; opposed to him stood those of Leipzig, Jena, Strasburg, Giessen, Marburg, and Greifswald. Abraham Calov in especial opposed Calixt. \n\nThe Elector of Saxony, for political reasons, opposed the Reformed Church, because the other two secular electors (Palatine and Brandenburg) were \"reformed,\" and were getting more and more the advantage of him. In 1649 he sent to the three dukes of Brunswick, who maintained Helmstedt as their common university, a communication in which he voiced all the objections of his Lutheran professors, and complained that Calixt wished to extract the elements of truth from all religions, fuse all into an entirely new religion, and so provoke a violent schism. \n\nIn 1650, Calov became a professor at Wittenberg, and he signalized his entrance into office with a vehement attack on the Syncretists in Helmstedt. An outburst of polemical writings followed. In 1650 the dukes of Brunswick answered the Elector of Saxony that the discord should not be allowed to increase, and proposed a meeting of the political councillors. Saxony, however, did not favour this suggestion. An attempt to convene a meeting of theologians was not more successful. The theologians of Wittenberg and Leipzig now elaborated a new formula, condemning ninety-eight heresies of the Helmstedt theologians. This formula (consensus) was to be signed by everyone who wished to remain in the Lutheran Church. Outside Wittenberg and Leipzig, however, it was not accepted, and Calixt's death in 1656 ushered in five years of almost undisturbed peace.\n\nThe strife broke out afresh in Hesse-Kassel, where Landgrave William VI sought to effect a union between his Lutheran and Reformed subjects, or at least to lessen their mutual hatred. In 1661 he had a colloquy held in Kassel between the Lutheran theologians of the University of Rinteln and the Reformed theologians of the University of Marburg. Enraged at this revival of the syncretism of Calixt, the Wittenberg theologians in vehement terms called on the Rinteln professors to make their submission, whereupon the latter answered with a detailed defence. Another long series of polemical treatises followed. \n\nIn Brandenburg-Prussia the \"Great Elector\" (Frederick William I) forbade (1663) preachers to speak of the disputes between the Evangelical bodies. A long colloquy in Berlin (September 1662 to May 1663) led only to fresh discord. The Elector, however, grew impatient with a lack of success at his conferences. He put an end to them in 1664 and published another \"syncretistic\" edict. Since the edict disallowed the Formula of Concord, one of the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the \"Book of Concord\" of 1580, many Lutheran clergy could not bring themselves to comply with the edict.\n\nWhoever refused to sign the form declaring his intention to observe this regulation was deprived of his position, including Paul Gerhardt, a pastor and noted hymnwriter. The citizens of Berlin petitioned to have him restored, and owing to their repeated requests an exception to the edict was made for Gerhardt, although his conscience did not allow him to retain a post which, appeared to him, could only be held on condition of a tacit repudiation of the Formula of Concord. For over a year he lived in Berlin without fixed employment. During this time his wife also died, leaving him with only one surviving child. Ironically, the edict was withdrawn a few months later, although by this time his patroness, Electress Louisa Henrietta had died and so he was still without a position.\n\nThe attempts of the Wittenberg theologians to declare Calixt and his school un-Lutheran and heretical were now met by Calixt's son, Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, The latter defended the theology of his father, but also tried to show that his doctrine did not so very much differ from that of his opponents. Wittenberg found its new champion in Ægidius Strauch, who attacked Calixt with all the resources of learning, polemics, sophistry, wit, cynicism, and abuse. The Helmstedt side was defended by the celebrated scholar and statesman, Hermann Conring. The Saxon princes now recognized the danger that the attempt to carry through the \"Consensus\" as a formula of belief might lead to a fresh schism in the Lutheran Church, and might thus render its position difficult in the face of the Catholics. \n\nThe proposals of Calov and his party to continue the refutation and to compel the Brunswick theologians to bind themselves under obligation to the old Lutheran confession therefore remained unimplemented. On the contrary, the Saxon theologians were forbidden to continue the strife in writing. Negotiations for peace then resulted, with Duke Ernst the Pious of Saxe-Gotha especially active towards this end, and the project of establishing a permanent college of theologians to decide theological disputes was entertained. \n\nHowever, the negotiations with the courts of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Denmark, and Sweden remained as fruitless as those with the theological faculties, except that peace was maintained until 1675. Calov then renewed hostilities. He now attacked not only Calixt, but also and particularly the moderate John Musæus of Jena. Calov succeeded in having the whole University of Jena (and after a long resistance Musæus himself) compelled to renounce syncretism. But this was his last victory. The elector renewed his prohibition against polemical writings. \n\nCalov seemed to give way, since in 1683 he asked whether, in the view of the danger which France then constituted for Germany, a Calixtinic Syncretism with \"Papists\" and the Reformed were still condemnable, and whether in deference to the Elector of Brandenburg and the dukes of Brunswick, the strife should not be buried by an amnesty, or whether, on the contrary, the war against syncretism should be continued. He later returned to his attack on the syncretists, but died in 1686, and with his death the strife ended. \n\nThe Syncretist Strife had the result of lessening religious hatred and of promoting mutual forbearance. Catholicism thus benefited, as Protestants came to better understand and appreciate it. In Protestant theology it prepared the way for the sentimental theology of Pietism to become more popular than orthodoxy. \n"}

Founded in 1854 as The Israelite and assuming its present name in 1874, it is the second longest-running Jewish newspaper in the world, after the London based \"Jewish Chronicle\" (founded in 1841).\n\nThe paper's founder, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, and publisher, Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company, were both very influential figures in American Jewish life.\nDuring the 19th century, \"The American Israelite\" became the leading organ for Reform Judaism in America. During the early 20th century, it helped geographically dispersed American Jews, especially in the West and the South of the country, keep in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.\n\nThe first Jewish newspaper published in Cincinnati was the English-language \"The Israelite\", established on July 15, 1854. It was also among the first Jewish publications in the nation. It was founded by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who became known as the father of Reform Judaism in the United States. Its initial issues were published by Charles F. Schmidt. The paper lost $600 in its first year, and although Wise repaid the publisher out of his own funds, Schmidt terminated the relationship. Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company began to publish the paper with the issue of July 27, 1855. Bloch, who was Wise's brother-in-law, subsequently became known as the dean of American Jewish publishers.\n\nFrom the start, the newspaper's motto was יהי אור \"Let There Be Light,\" and still is. Its two goals were to propagate the principles of Reform Judaism and to keep American Jews, who often lived in small towns singly or in communities of two or three families, in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.\n\nThe publication, along with \"Die Deborah\", a German-language supplement that Wise started the following year, soon attracted a large circulation and was influential in helping the nascent Reform movement spread throughout North America.\nBoth Wise and the paper had a reach beyond Cincinnati, and especially to the growing Jewish communities in the American Midwest and South.\nIn 1858, for instance, the members of Congregation B'nai Israel in Memphis, Tennessee advertised for their first rabbi in \"The Israelite\", at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher.\n\nDespite its spread, the early years of \"The Israelite\" were a financial struggle. Most subscribers did not pay their bills, the Panic of 1857 adversely affected it, and the paper lost half its subscribers in the South during the Civil War. Bloch travelled east several times in the late 1850s in order to solicit subscriptions and advertising. Wise's admitted sloppiness in monetary matters did not help either. Nevertheless, the newspaper and Bloch stayed out of bankruptcy and relocated to larger offices twice during this period.\n\nWise, a prolific writer, published in the editorial columns of \"The Israelite\" numerous studies on various subjects of Jewish interest.\nBesides being the leading organ for American Reform Judaism, it also forcefully defended the civil and religious rights of all Jews.\nWise tirelessly expounded his call to the \"ministers and other Israelites\" of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. In 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati.\nAnother campaign he presented in the columns of \"The Israelite\" was the desire for an educational institution, and this eventually led to success in 1875 when the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students.\nWise also wrote a number of novels, which appeared first as serials in the \"Israelite\".\n\n\"The Israelite\" was renamed \"The American Israelite\" beginning with the issue of July 3, 1874. The goal was to make the name more in consonance with the ideas it represented. Despite the change, the paper continued to cover and advocate for not only American Jews but also Jews around the world. By 1879, a typical issue had eight pages 28-by-42-inches in size, and a subscription cost $4, or $5 if the \"Die Deborah\" four-page supplement was included.\n\nRabbi Wise's son Leo Wise, who had become business manager for the paper in 1875, took over as its publisher from 1883 to 1884, and then he did so again, permanently, in 1888 (due apparently to some kind of rupture between Leo Wise and Bloch). A sister publication, \"The Chicago Israelite\", was started in 1885. The papers stressed their reputation in trade publications, stating \"None but clean advertisements of reputable houses accepted.\"\n\nLeo Wise gradually took over the principle editorial functions from his father, but Rabbi Wise remained active on the paper until his death on March 26, 1900, writing an editorial for it just a few days before. Ownership then passed to Leo Wise.\n\nBy 1900, \"The American Israelite\", in combination with \"The Chicago Israelite\", claimed a circulation of other 35,000, about 12,000 in Ohio and Illinois and the balance spread across almost every other state as well as Canada and Mexico. The publication \"Printer's Ink\" said they had the largest guaranteed circulation of any Jewish newspaper in the U.S., and it continued to be especially strong in the West and the South. One 1902 book characterized \"The American Israelite\" as \"the leading Jewish newspaper in the United States and the National Journal of the Jews.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, the paper's short articles were sometimes picked up and run by \"The New York Times\" with a credit \"From The American Israelite\". In those years, \"The American Israelite\" became known for its very strong stance against the new Zionism movement, calling it in 1902 a \"pernicious agitation\" that would undermine the acceptance of Jews in the countries where they currently resided. Rabbi David Philipson was among the editorial contributors to the paper who used it to oppose Zionism, arguing that Judaism was a religion exclusively, and thus stateless. Other noted contributors to the paper in this era included Rabbi Moses Mielziner and Jewish history scholar Gotthard Deutsch, as well as other prominent rabbis and Jewish thinkers within the country. The paper gave extensive coverage to the goings-on of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College (and was sometimes viewed as a publication of them), as well as notices of various rabbinical conferences.\n\n\"Die Deborah\" was discontinued after Isaac Wise's death, then resumed for a while.\n\"The Chicago Israelite\" ceased publication in 1920.\nLeo Wise edited \"The American Israelite\" until his retirement at age 78 in 1928 (he died in 1933). Another son of Isaac, Isidor Wise, worked as a writer and associate editor for the paper until his death in 1929.\n\nLeo Wise was succeeded as editor and publisher of \"The American Israelite\" in 1928 by his half-brother, Rabbi Jonah Wise of New York, who remained in that city and who himself became a long-time leader of American Reform Judaism.\n\nThe Jonah Wise arrangement did not last long, and in 1930, journalist Henry C. Segal bought the paper and became its editor and publisher for more than five decades, until his death in 1985. Along with Isaac Wise, Segal is still named on the paper's masthead.\n\nContributors to the newspaper in the late 1980s and early 1990s included writer Don Canaan. His four-part series published in 1988, \"Jews in Ohio's Prisons: Does Anyone Care?\", won the award for best weekly journalism from the Ohio State Bar Association.\n\nBy the 1990s, the paper was focusing on local Jewish news.\nIn 1995, \"The American Israelite\" was sued for $2 million by an Ohio lawyer for calling him and his son anti-Semitic.\n\nBy 2010, Ted Deutsch was the editor and publisher. A typical issue ran 24 pages, with color front and back pages and black-and-white inside. Some stories were locally written, while many others were run from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. It published full facsimile copies of its issues on its website.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "173592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173592", "title": "The Urantia Book", "text": "The Urantia Book\n\nThe Urantia Book (sometimes called The Urantia Papers or The Fifth Epochal Revelation) is a spiritual and philosophical book that originated in Chicago some time between 1924 and 1955. The authorship remains a matter of speculation. It has received various degrees of interest ranging from praise to criticism for its religious and science content, its unusual length, and its lack of a known author.\n\nThe text introduces the word \"Urantia\" as the name of the planet Earth and states that its intent is to \"present enlarged concepts and advanced truth.\" The book aims to unite religion, science and philosophy, and its enormous amount of material about science is unique among literature claimed to be presented by celestial beings. Among other topics, the book discusses the origin and meaning of life, humankind's place in the universe, the relationship between God and people, and the life of Jesus.\n\nThe Urantia Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit group, first published \"The Urantia Book\" in 1955. In 2001, a jury found that the English-language book's copyright was no longer valid in the United States after 1983. The English text became a public domain work in the United States, and in 2006 the international copyright expired.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the origin of \"The Urantia Book\" are unknown. The book and its publishers do not name a human author. Instead, it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an \"epochal\" religious revelation.\n\nAs early as 1911, William S. Sadler and his wife Lena Sadler, physicians in Chicago and well known in the community, are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally. She reported that she was unable to wake him at these times. The Sadlers came to observe the episodes, and over time, the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from \"student visitor\" spiritual beings. This changed sometime in early 1925 with a \"voluminous handwritten document,\" which from then on became the regular method of purported communication. The individual was never identified publicly but has been described as \"a hard-boiled business man, member of the board of trade and stock exchange.\"\n\nThe Sadlers were both respected physicians, and William Sadler was a debunker of paranormal claims, who is portrayed as not believing in the supernatural. In 1929, he published a book called \"The Mind at Mischief\", in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims. He wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction:\n\nThe other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify. ... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance. ... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities. ... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.\n\nIn 1923, a group of Sadler's friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday philosophical and religious discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request. Shortly afterwards, a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the \"contact personality.\"\n\nSadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as \"The Urantia Book\" were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.\n\nThe Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935. The last Forum gathering was in 1942.\n\nAfter the last of Part IV was obtained in 1935, an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions. Sadler and his son William (Bill) Sadler, Jr. at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction. The Foreword was then \"received.\"\n\nThe communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the Forum studied the book in depth, and according to Sadler and others, permission to publish it was given to them in 1955. The Urantia Foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in Illinois, and through privately raised funds, the book was published on October 12, 1955.\n\nOnly the members of the Contact Commission witnessed the activities of the \"sleeping subject\", and only they knew his identity. The individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him. Martin Gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the Contact Commission, particularly William Sadler, was responsible. Gardner's conclusion is that a man named Wilfred Kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind, with William Sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts. Brad Gooch believes Sadler wrote the book, possibly with help from others on the Contact Commission. A statistical analysis using the Mosteller and Wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved, and by comparatively analyzing the book against \"The Mind at Mischief\", does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by Sadler, without ruling out the possibility of limited edits.\n\nIn 1991, after having compiled an index of \"The Urantia Book\" and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts, Kristen Maaherra was sued by the Urantia Foundation for violating their copyright on the book. In 1995, Maaherra won a Summary Judgment declaring the Urantia Foundation's copyright renewal invalid. Upon appeal, the judgment was reversed and awarded to the Urantia Foundation.\n\nFour years later, in 1999, Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation published a book, \"Jesus–A New Revelation\", which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in \"The Urantia Book\". McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundation's US copyright in \"The Urantia Book\" was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright had not been infringed upon. Urantia Foundation's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire. These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the Conduit had died prior to 1983, only the Conduit's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundation's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain. This decision was upheld on appeal.\n\n\"The Urantia Book\" is approximately 2,000 pages long, and consists of a body of 196 \"papers\" divided in four parts, and an introductory foreword:\n\nAccording to \"The Urantia Book\", God is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, infinite, and eternal spirit personality. The most fundamental teaching about God in the book is that he is a Father. \"The face which the Infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a Father, the Universal Father of love.\"\n\nGod, according to the book, is one Deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality, both personal and impersonal. God is taught to exist in a Trinity of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. These persons are referred to by additional titles in the book, primarily as the \"Universal Father,\" \"Eternal Son,\" and \"Infinite Spirit.\" While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea: \"...in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one.\"\n\nThe Father, Son, and Spirit are considered \"existential\" persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future. In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are \"experiential\", or incomplete and in the process of actualizing: God the Supreme; God the Ultimate; and God the Absolute. Of these three, God the Supreme, or \"the Supreme Being,\" is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis.\n\nMany types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book, and one of particular note is a joint \"offspring\" of the Universal Father and Eternal Son called a \"Creator Son\". A divine Creator Son is considered the highest personification of the Universal Father and Eternal Son that is possible for people to know and: \"...is, to all practical intents and purposes, God.\" Jesus of Nazareth is identified as a Creator Son who incarnated on Earth, and the central theme of the book's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world.\n\nThe final paper states:\n\nGod is described as the Father of each individual, and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit, called a Thought Adjuster, is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him. The Thought Adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a \"Mystery Monitor\" and \"indwelling presence,\" as well as a \"divine spark.\" The idea is compared within the book to the Hindu atman and the ancient Egyptian ka. In relation to biblical traditions, the Thought Adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases \"being made in God's image\" and the \"kingdom of God is within you\":\n\nEach person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision, on average around the age of five years and 10 months. The Adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life, and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find God, it leads the person toward more mature, spiritualized thinking. A person's Thought Adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience. In \"The Urantia Book\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s teachings, the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its Adjuster's guidance becomes the degree to which a person's soul \"grows\" and becomes a reality that can then survive death. The soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development, one parental factor being the divine Adjuster and the other being the human will.\n\nThe book says: \"But you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry. You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster.\" The book is strongly fideistic and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of God, arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of God's presence in human experience, the Thought Adjuster.\n\nPersistently embracing sin is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the will of God. Constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness, and since unrighteousness is unreal, it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual's identity. Personalities like this become \"as if they never were.\" The book says that: \"...in the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity.\" The concepts of Hell and reincarnation are not taught.\n\nThe book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith. Uniting with the Adjuster fragment is the \"reward of the ages,\" the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life, described as typically taking place in the afterlife, but also a possibility during earthly life. The result during human life is a \"fusion flash,\" with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul \"translated\" to the afterlife. The Hebrew prophet Elijah being taken to heaven without death in \"chariots of fire\" is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death.\n\nAfter a person fuses with his or her fragment of God, \"then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule.\" A person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to God and residence on Paradise. Mortals who reach this stage are called \"finaliters.\" The book goes on to discuss the potential destinies of these \"glorified mortals.\"\n\nThe book regards human life on earth as a \"short and intense test,\" and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life. The \"religion of Jesus\" is considered to be practiced by way of loving God the Father, thereby learning to love each person the way Jesus loves people; that is, recognizing the \"fatherhood of God and its correlated truth, the brotherhood of man,\" resulting in unselfish service to others.\n\nThe book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary Isle of Paradise—the dwelling place of God—with Paradise being surrounded by \"Havona,\" an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds, around which seven incomplete and evolutionary \"superuniverses\" circle.\n\nThe word \"universe\" in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization. A \"superuniverse\" is roughly the size of a galaxy or group of galaxies, and the seven superuniverses along with Paradise-Havona are together designated as the \"grand universe.\" A \"local universe\" is a portion of a superuniverse, with 100,000 local universes being in each superuniverse. Beyond the seven superuniverses, uninhabited \"outer space levels\" are described. The term \"master universe\" refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole.\n\nUrantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named \"Nebadon,\" which itself is part of superuniverse number seven, \"Orvonton.\" The physical size of a local universe is not directly stated, but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds.\n\nThe book's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago, the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop, and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans, later on land. The emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior primates originating from a lemur ancestor. The first humans are said to have been male and female twins called Andon and Fonta, born \"993,419 years prior to 1934.\"\n\n\"The Urantia Book\" teaches not only biological evolution, but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression, subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression. Progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers, which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of \"light and life\" in the far distant future.\n\nAlthough there is the ideal and divine plan of progression, it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect. Urantia is said to be a markedly \"confused and disordered\" planet that is \"greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment\" compared to more typical inhabited worlds, due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors.\n\nMore than one third of the content of \"The Urantia Book\" is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the Judeo-Christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other. The book's teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of Christian belief. However, numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted Christian doctrines.\n\nJesus is held in high regard by \"The Urantia Book,\" as he is in the New Testament of the Bible. The following are attributed to him in both texts:\n\nSome differences with Christianity include:\n\nGardner notes similarities between Seventh-day Adventism and the teachings of \"The Urantia Book\", and sees this as evidence that William Sadler and Wilfred Kellogg had a role in editing or writing the book, since they both were one-time believers in Adventism. For instance, two basic Adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline Christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism, both of which \"The Urantia Book\" also supports. Lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a \"revelation,\" it could be claimed the \"celestial beings\" simply found areas of Adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them. While the book supports aspects of Adventism, it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to Adventists.\n\nThe book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes \"A Course in Miracles\" and \"Conversations with God\". Gardner compares it with \"Oahspe\", noting that though \"Oahspe\" is \"vastly inferior to the UB both in ideas and style of writing,\" they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit, teaching that there is \"one ultimate God who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities\" while both outline an elaborate cosmology. The book's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the Book of Mormon, Science and Health, the Quran, and the Bible, with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason.\n\nComparisons with facets of various world religions are incorporated in the book, including Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and Confucianism. For example, Paper 131, \"The World's Religions\" discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the \"religion of Jesus.\" The stance of the book is that there \"is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith.\"\n\n\"The Urantia Book\" has been enjoyed by some as a form of science fiction, historical fiction or fantasy. \"The Urantia Book\" is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style. Skeptic Martin Gardner, in a book otherwise highly critical of \"The Urantia Book\", writes that it is \"highly imaginative\" and that the \"cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me.\" Gooch says that for nonbelievers, the book is a mixture of being \"fascinating, inspiring, compelling, haunting, entertaining, annoying, incomprehensible, and always wordy.\"\n\nParts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus' life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to retellings of Jesus' life, such as \"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\" by José Saramago and \"Behold the Man\" by Michael Moorcock. Martin Gardner considers Part IV to be an especially \"well-written, impressive work,\" and says, \"Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived.\" His assessment is that the narrative is consistent with human authorship.\n\nThe authors refer to the book as the fifth revelation of \"epochal significance\" to humankind, the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of Jesus. The claim of revelation in \"The Urantia Book\" has been criticized for various reasons. Skeptics such as Martin Gardner say it is a product of human efforts rather than a revelation because some of its science is flawed. Because the book does not support certain tenets of Christianity, such as the atonement doctrine, while at the same time presenting an account of parts of Jesus' life absent in the Bible, others with a Christian viewpoint have argued it cannot be genuine. Gooch notes that while its \"somewhat dated, elegant\" prose could be read as fiction, due to its claim of divine inspiration \"the book invites reactions far more scathing than [it] ... might otherwise merit.\"\n\nIn Paper 101, \"The Real Nature of Religion,\" the authors write:\nWe full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is \"not inspired\".\n\nSkeptics like Martin Gardner see the science in \"The Urantia Book\" as clear reflections of the views that prevailed at the time the book is said to have originated. The claim by the authors, that no unknown scientific discoveries could be imparted, is seen as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later. That presentation of post-1955 scientific knowledge is avoided is taken to be evidence it was written by humans and not by celestial beings with superior knowledge.\n\nExamples of criticisms regarding the science in \"The Urantia Book\" include:\n\nWhile some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in \"The Urantia Book\" including its science is literally true, others accept the book's caveats and do not believe that the science is fully accurate.\n\nMeredith Sprunger, a liberal believer in \"The Urantia Book\" and retired minister of the United Church of Christ, wrote that research \"has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the UB was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written, was held by some scientists of that time, or was about to be discovered or recognized.\" He further argued against its literal infallibility and said that fundamentalism over the book is \"just as untenable as Biblical fundamentalism.\"\n\nOther believers maintain that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — if not all of it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing. Some arise because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Discoveries from science during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics think such facts were added prior to publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, though Hans Bethe's announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938.\n\nThe only apparent anticipation of science the book has made, in Gardner's opinion, is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeons possess is \"not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind.\" In 1980, a British zoologist, Robin Baker, published evidence that humans have a limited magnetic sense.\n\nMark McMenamin, a professor of geology, quotes a section of the book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, \"This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later.\" McMenamin also states, \"Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in \"The Urantia Book\".\"\n\n\"The Urantia Book\" states in its Foreword that more than one thousand \"human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings\" were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to \"give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented\" and would \"resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind.\" One of the authors wrote in Part IV: \"I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds.\"\n\nIn recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true. None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book.\n\nIn 1992, a reader of \"The Urantia Book\", Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed \"The Urantia Book\" utilized material from 15 other books. All of the source authors identified in Block's paper were published in English between 1905 and 1943 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in \"The Urantia Book\". Block has since claimed to have discovered over 125 source texts that were incorporated into the papers.\n\nThe use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner and Gooch, and they concluded that the book did plagiarize many of the sources noted by Block.\n\nFor instance, Gardner and Block note that Paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of \"Origin and Evolution of Religion\" by Edward Washburn Hopkins, published by Yale University Press in 1923. Each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book, with several passages possibly used as direct material and further material used in Papers 86-90 and 92. (In addition to the book's \"heavy indebtedness to Hopkins,\" Gardner discovered that Hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by Sadler, adding to Gardner's view that it is more likely Sadler had a hand in writing or editing \"The Urantia Book\" than that celestial beings wrote it.) Likewise, much of \"The Urantia Book\" material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from Henry Fairfield Osborn, \"Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man\" published by Princeton University Press in 1928.\n\nIn one example cited by Block and confirmed by Gardner and Gooch, the original author discusses the periodicity of the chemical elements and concludes that the harmony in the construction of the atom suggests some unspecified plan of organization. The authors of \"The Urantia Book\" assert that this harmony is evidence of the intelligent design of the universe. W. F. G. Swann writes on page 64 of \"The Architecture of the Universe\" (italics indicate edits as compared to \"The Urantia Book\", bolding indicates deletions):\nContrast with \"The Urantia Book\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s version:\nBlock and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism, but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of \"The Urantia Book\". Gooch, a professor of English, assessed that the use of the sources \"does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary.\" Asked by Gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms, Sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals.\n\nIt is difficult to gauge how many adherents there may be as there are multiple organization to census. Informal study groups \"tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter\" and have not been counted reliably. Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while \"for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading.\" Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents. The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the book's teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths.\n\nThe movement inspired by \"The Urantia Book\" has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, or temples.\n\nSarah Lewis notes that, \"The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier.\" She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, \"lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups,\" and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views.\n\nUrantia Foundation advocated a \"slow growth\" policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book. Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997, and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000, an \"upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart,\" however in 2011 the Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites. Since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001, other organizations, such as The Urantia Book Fellowship under the publishing name Uversa Press, have also published the book. Copies of \"The Urantia Book\" are on the Internet in various formats and it has been adapted to more recent platforms such as the Kindle and the iOS App Store. Several audio books of the text are also on the Internet.\n\nThe International Urantia Association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002, and the Urantia Book Fellowship (formerly the Urantia Brotherhood, founded in 1955 with Urantia Foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members, with the highest concentrations in the West of the United States and the Sun Belt, especially California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas. It appears an increasing number of people are forming study groups, participating in Internet discussion groups, and hosting or visiting websites about it.\n\nThe Teaching Mission is a group of Urantia channellers. According to Richard Landes, \"The foundation considers them self-deluded, but they have created a schism that continues to disrupt the movement.\"\n\nVern Grimsley was a \"dynamic speaker\" who founded a Urantian outreach organization called Family of God in the 1970s, which was initially supported by others in the movement, including the Urantia Foundation. Beginning in the early 1980s, Grimsley claimed he began hearing voices that were from the same higher beings who wrote \"The Urantia Book\", and that the voices warned of an impending world war followed by a nuclear holocaust. While some in the movement believed him, others including the Urantia Foundation concluded Grimsley's messages were spurious, former friends eventually began to shun him, and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity.\n\n\nOne symbol described in \"The Urantia Book\" consists of three concentric azure circles on a white background. The circles are said to symbolize God's triune nature of Father, Son, and Spirit. When the Creator Son Michael, later incarnated on Earth as Jesus, went to war with Lucifer 200,000 years ago, he used the concentric circles on his banner. Lucifer's emblem was a solid black circle in the center of a red one.\n\nUrantia Foundation, the original publisher, placed the concentric circles on the cover of \"The Urantia Book\" and has a United States trademark. The circles are used to indicate other organizations affiliated with the foundation.\nThe Urantia Association International, one of the main readership organizations in the movement, has been licensed by Urantia Foundation to use the three azure concentric circles on a white background.\n\nThe symbol is also used in various altered forms. The Urantia Book Fellowship, an independent reader organization established in 1955, uses a similar symbol.\n\n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n\n"}

{"id": "83134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83134", "title": "Zalmoxis", "text": "Zalmoxis\n\nZalmoxis () \nis a supposed divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his \"Histories\" Book IV, 93–96, written before 425 BC.\n\nAccording to Jordanes's \"Getica\", he was a learned philosopher, before whom two other learned men existed, by the names of Zeuta and Deceneus.\n\nIn modern times, theories and debate on the Zalmoxis religion by such scholars as Mircea Eliade are influenced by considerations of Romanian nationalism as well by pure historical interest. \n\nHerodotus writes about Zalmoxis in book 4 of his \"Histories\":\n93. ...the Getae are the bravest of the Thracians and the most just. \n94. They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense: they think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis, a divine being; some call this same divine being Gebeleizis. Every four years, they send a messenger to Zalmoxis, who is chosen by chance. They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion. The mission is performed in the following way: men standing there for that purpose hold three spears; other people take the one who is sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears. If he dies pierced, they think that the divinity is going to help them; if he does not die, it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person. And, after he has been charged, they send another one. The messenger is told the requests while he is still alive. The same Thracians, on other occasions, when he thunders and lightens, shoot with arrows up in the air against the sky and menace the divinity because they think there is no god other than their own. \n\nHerodotus asserts that Zalmoxis was originally a human being, a slave who converted the Thracians to his beliefs. The Greeks of the Hellespont and the Black Sea tell that Zalmoxis was a slave of Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchos, on the island of Samos. After being liberated, he gathered huge wealth and, once rich, went back to his homeland. Thracians lived simple hard lives. Zalmoxis had lived among the wisest of Greeks, such as Pythagoras, and had been initiated into Ionian life and the Eleusinian Mysteries. He built a banquet hall, and received the chiefs and his fellow countrymen at a banquet. He taught that neither his guests nor their descendants would ever die, but instead would go to a place where they would live forever in a complete happiness. He then dug an underground residence. When it was finished, he disappeared from Thrace, living for three years in his underground residence. The Thracians missed him and wept fearing him dead. The fourth year, he came back among them and thus they believed what Zalmoxis had told them.\n\nZalmoxis may have lived much earlier than Pythagoras and was rumored either to be a divine being or from the country of the Getae.\n\nScholars have several different theories about this account by Herodotus the disappearance and return of Zalmoxis:\n\nThis last theory precisely parallels the legend of the universal king Frode given in both \"Ynglingsaga\" and \"Gesta Danorum\" of Saxo Grammaticus, particularly \"Ynglingsaga\" 12 and Saxo 5.16.3, in which Frode disappears into the earth for three years after his death.\n\nIt is difficult to define the time when a cult to Zalmoxis may have existed. It is only certain that it antecedes Herodotus. Some scholars have suggested that the archaic doctrine of Zalmoxis points to a heritage from before the times of Indo-Europeans, but this is difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate.\n\nPlato says in the dialogue \"Charmides\" (lines 156 D – 157 B) that Zalmoxis was also a great physician who took a holistic approach to healing body and soul (psyche), being thus used by Plato for his own philosophical conceptions.\n\nStrabo in his \"Geography\" mentions a certain Deceneus (Dékainéos) whom he calls a γόητα \"magician\". According to Strabo, king Burebista (82–44 BC) hired Deceneus, who had been in Egypt, to \"tame\" his people. As a sign of the people's obedience, they consented to destroy all their wines as ordered by Deceneus. The \"reform of Deceneus\" is the interpretation by the 6th-century bishop and historian Jordanes, who includes the Getae in his history of the Goths (as assumed ancestors of the Goths). Jordanes describes how Deceneus taught the Getae philosophy and physics. Even if it is more probable that Jordanes interjected his own philosophical knowledge into the text, many modern Romanian authors consider that Deceneus was a priest who reformed the religion of the Getae, changing the worship of Zalmoxis into a popular religion and imposing strict religious rules, such as the restriction of wine consumption. Jean Coman deems this prohibition as the origin of the dietary restrictions followed by the modern Orthodox Church during Lent.\n\nAccording to Iamblichus (280-333 AD), \"for instructing the Getae in these things, and for having written laws for them, Zalmoxis was by them considered as the greatest of the gods.\"\n\nAristotle is said, in the brief epitome of his \"Magicus\" given by Diogenes Laertes, to have compared Zalmoxis with the Phoenician Okhon and Libyan Atlas. Some authors assume Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius, the Thracian Dionysus, or Zeus. Sabazius appears in Jordanes as Gebelezis. Leaving aside the suffixes \"-zius/-zis\", the root \"Saba-\" = \"Gebele-\", suggesting a relationship of the name of the goddess Cybele, as \"Cybele's Zeus\". Mnaseas of Patrae identified Zalmoxis with Cronos, as does Hesychius, who has \"\".\n\nIn Plato's writings, Zalmoxis is mentioned as skilled in the arts of incantation. Zalmoxis gave his name to a particular type of singing and dancing (Hesych). His realm as a god is not very clear, as some considered him to be a sky-god, a god of the dead, or a god of the Mysteries.\n\nLactantius (an early Christian author, c. 240–320 AD), referring to the religion of the Getae, provides an approximate translation of Julian the Apostate's purported quotation of Trajan:\n\n\"We have conquered even these Getai (Dacians), the most warlike of all people that have ever existed, not only because of the strength in their bodies, but, also due to the teachings of Zalmoxis who is among their most hailed. He has told them that in their hearts they do not die, but change their location and, due to this, they go to their deaths happier than on any other journey.\"\n\nThe \"Zalmoxian religion\" is the subject of a scholarly debate that has continued since the beginning of the 20th century. According to some scholars, such as Vasile Pârvan, Jean Coman, R. Pettazzon, E. Rohde and Sorin Paliga, since ancient sources do not mention any god of the Getae other than Zalmoxis, the Getae were monotheistic. However, Herodotus is the only ancient author who explicitly states that the Getae had only one divinity. The sending of a messenger to Zalmoxis and the fact that Getae shot arrows towards the sky have prompted some authors to believe Zalmoxis was a sky god, but his journey into a cavern has led others to suggest that he was a chthonic divinity.\n\nA third group of scholars believe that the Getae, like other Indo-European peoples, were polytheistic. They draw on ancient authors such as Diodorus Siculus, who states that the Getae worshipped Hestia as well as Zalmoxis.\n\nA number of etymologies have been given for the name. In his \"Vita Pythagorae\", Porphyrius (3rd century) says that he was so named because he had been wrapped in a bearskin at birth, and \"zalmon\" is the Thracian word for \"hide\" (). Hesychius (ca. 5th century) has \"zemelen\" (ζέμελεν) as a Phrygian word for \"foreign slave\".\n\nThe correct spelling of the name is also uncertain. Manuscripts of Herodotus' \"Historiae\" have all four spellings, viz. \"Zalmoxis\", \"Salmoxis\", \"Zamolxis\", \"Samolxis\", with a majority of manuscripts favouring \"Salmoxis\". Later authors show a preference for \"Zamolxis\". Hesychius quotes Herodotus, using \"Zalmoxis\".\n\nThe \"-m-l-\" variant is favoured by those wishing to derive the name from a conjectured Thracian word for \"earth\", \"*zamol\". Comparisons have also been made with the name of Zemelo and Žemelė, the Phrygian and Lithuanian goddess of the earth, and with the Lithuanian chthonic god Žemeliūkštis. The Lithuanian word \"Žalmuo\" means \"corn shoot\" or \"fresh grass\". \"Žalmokšnis\" is another possible form of it.\n\nThe \"-l-m-\" variant is admitted to be the older form and the correct form by the majority of Thracologists, as this is the form found in the older Herodotus manuscripts and other ancient sources. The \"-l-m-\" form is further attested in Daco-Thracian in \"Zalmodegikos\", the name of a Getic King; and in Thracian \"zalmon\", 'hide', and \"zelmis\", 'hide' (PIE \"*kel-\", 'to cover'; cf. English \"helm\").\n\nThe other name for Zalmoxis, Gebeleizis, is also spelled Belaizis and Belaixis in Herodotus manuscripts.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade:\n\nThe Romanian rock band Sfinx worked from around 1975 through 1978 on \"Zalmoxe\", a progressive rock LP, with lyrics by poet Alexandru Basarab (actually a pen name for Adrian Hoajă), which retold the story of Zalmoxis.\n\nThe dinosaur \"Zalmoxes\" is named after the deity.\n\n\n\n\n"}
