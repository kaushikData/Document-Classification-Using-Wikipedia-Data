In present-day Zoroastrian usage, the \"airyama\" of these opening words are considered to be an invocation of the divinity \"Airyaman\", the \"yazata\" of healing. The opening words may however have originally been an appeal to \"the community\" (or \"tribe\"), which would reflect the etymologically derived meaning of \"airyaman.\"\n\nLike the other three formulas (\"Ahuna Vairya\", \"Ashem vohu\", \"Yenghe hatam\"), the \"airyaman ishya\" is in Gathic Avestan. While the first three formulas are located at \"Yasna\" 27.13-27.15, immediately preceding the Gathas, the \"airyaman ishya\" - at \"Yasna\" 54.1 - provides the closure. Also unlike the first three, the theological exegesis of the \"airyaman ishya\" is not embedded in the \"Yasna\" liturgy itself. Like the \"yenghe hatam\", the third of the four formulas, the \"airyaman ishya\" is a prayer. Both it and the \"yenghe hatam\" are without the enigmatic \"pronounced magical character\" of the first two formulas.\n\nIn \"Yasht\" 3.8, 11 and 15, the \"airyaman ishya\" is described as the weapon with which to put the demon (\"daeva\") Taromaiti \"heresy\" to flight. The \"airyaman ishya\" is the greatest, best, fairest, most fearful, most firm most victorious, and the most healing\" of all formulas (\"Yasht\" 3.5)\n\nSince its incantation was considered the most effective form of healing (\"Yasht\" 3.6), the \"airyaman ishya\" was accorded special status in the religion. \"Vendidad\" 20.12 notes its efficacy against \"all sickness and death, all sorcerers and witches, all whores belonging to the Lie.\" The \"Yasna\" verse immediately following the prayer considers the \"airyaman ishya\" \"the greatest uttering of \"asha\".\" (\"Yasna\" 54.2)\n\nLike the \"ahuna vairya\" invocation (the first of the four great formulas), the \"airyaman ishya\" is \"the most excellent, the most mighty, the most efficacious, the most smiting, the most victorious, the most healing, the greatest\" of the formulas. (\"Yasht\" 1.1-1.3, 3.5-3.6 and 11.3) Also like the \"ahuna vairya\", the \"airyaman ishya\" has the power to elicit good thoughts, words and deeds, and so further \"asha\" and weaken the \"druj\". (\"Visperad\" 24.0-2).\n\nIn the medieval texts of the 9th-12th century, the \"airyaman ishya\" is described to be the prayer that will be recited by the \"saoshyans\" to bring about the final renovation of the world. This eschatological role is already alluded to in Avestan texts, and the concepts of \"asha\" \"Truth\", \"ashi\" \"Recompense\" and \"airyaman\" (see translation below, the three words are also etymologically related) all have an eschatological aspect.\n\nBesides being recited (four times) during the \"Yasna\" ceremony, the prayer is also part of the \"Ashirvad\", the blessings invoked during a Zoroastrian marriage ceremony.\n\nHelmut Humbach's transliteration reads:\nTransliteration based on the edition of Karl F. Geldner, Avesta, the Sacred Books of the Parsis, Stuttgart, 1896:\n\nLike all Gathic Avestan verses, the prayer is altogether ambiguous and translations vary significantly.\n\nA translation by Dr. Irach J. S. Taraporewala below.May the much desired Brotherhood come hither for our rejoicing,For the men and for the maidens of Zarathushtra,for the fulfilment of Vohu Mano (good mind);Whosoever Inner-self earns the precious reward.I will pray to Asha (righteousness) for the blessing,Which greatly to be desired, Ahura Mazda hath meant for us.\n\n"}

{"id": "12806137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12806137", "title": "Barsom", "text": "Barsom\n\nA barsom is a ritual implement used by Zoroastrian priests to solemnize certain sacred ceremonies.\n\nThe word \"barsom\" derives from the Avestan language baresman (trisyllabic, \"\"), which is in turn a substantive of \"barez\" \"to grow high.\" The later form – \"barsom\" – first appears in the 9th–12th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, and remains in use to the present day.\n\nThe \"baresman\" is not related to the \"baresnum\", which is a purification ceremony. The \"baresman\" should also not be confused with the \"mace\", the \"varza\" (Avestan, MP \"gurz\"). The \"varza\" is a metal rod, about one centimer in thickness, often crowned with a bull's head.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \"baresman\" may have a Zagrosian origin.\n\nIn present-day use, the \"barsom\" is a bundle of short metal wires or rods, each about 20 cm in length and made of brass or silver.\n\nThe use of metal wires or rods is a relatively recent development: Until at least the 16th century, the \"barsom\" was made of twigs or stems, and there was an elaborate ritual surrounding their collection. There is no indication in scripture or older tradition as to which plant was to be used, and \"Yasna\" 25.3 eulogizes the plant without being specific.\n\nOne indication of which plant was used comes from the 16th century, where the authors of the \"Rivayat\" epistles reprimand their Indian co-religionists for not using twigs of the tamarisk (\"R.\" 329). The twigs of the pomegranate tree also figure in other late sources. Strabo (XV.3.14) speaks of \"a bundle of slender myrtle rods.\"\n\nBoth scripture and tradition are precise with respect to the dimensions of the twigs required. \"Yasna\" 57.5 mandates that each twig shall not exceed \"the height of the knee,\" and \"Vendidad\" 19.19 (supported by the \"Nirangistan\") requires each rod to be at most the length of an \"aesha\" and the thickness of the width of a \"yava\". Darmesteter translates \"aesha\" as \"ploughshare\" and \"yava\" as barley-corn. A twig/rod was thus at most about 7 mm thick. The \"Nirangstan\" further adds that the thickness may not be less than that of a human hair.\n\nThe \"barsom\" that appears in Achaemenid and Sassanid art \"was of impressive size, about long, made up apparently of stiff straight rods.\"\n\nThe number of twigs/rods depends on the ritual being performed, and the \"Shayast-na Shayast\" (14.2) unambiguously states that this number must be adhered to. A recitation of the \"Yasna\" liturgy is accompanied by a bundle of 21 twigs, with two others being placed by the side of another ritual implement. The \"Vendidad\" requires 33 twigs in the bundle with two other placed as for the \"Yasna\". A recitation of the \"Visperad\" requires 35 twigs, with none left over. The number similarly varies for other rituals, all of these however only requiring between 3 and 15 twigs.\n\nIn present-day use, and with only one exception, the rods remain unbound. The one exception is the \"baj\" ceremony for the dead, towards the end of which the baresman bundle is bound with a strip of a leaf of a Date Palm.\n\nIn ritual, the \"barsom\" bundle is either held in the left hand, or placed across a pair of metallic stands about 20 cm in height, with one stand at each end of the bundle. These stands have a crescent-shaped brace at the top, so (also) preventing the rods from rolling off. The crescent shape gives them their name, \"mah-rui\", literally \"moon-faced.\" \"Dadestan-i Denig\" 48.17 states the stands must be of metal.\n\nA \"barsom\" has no immediate practical purpose. At Zoroastrian ritual it represents plant creation, accompanying the other symbolic tokens that represent other facets of creation, and each of which then also represent the presence of an Amesha Spenta at the ritual. In the case of the \"barsom\", it is Ameretat \"immortality.\" The crescent-shaped brace of the \"barsom\" stand is likewise identified with vegetation: \"mah\", the moon, is in Zoroastrian scripture and tradition the cosmogonical protector of plants and encourages their growth. \"The object of holding the barsom and repeating prayers is to praise the Creator for the support accorded by nature and for the gift of the produce of the earth, which supplies the means of existence to the human and the animal world. The object of selecting the \"barsom\" from the twigs of a tree is to take it as a representative of the whole vegetable kingdom, for which benedictions and thanks to the Creator are offered, and there is further proof to show that the performance of the \"barsom\" ritual is intended to express gratitude to the Creator for His boundless gifts.\"\n\nThe \"barsom\" is also held by a priest during the abbreviated \"Yasna\" recitation before meals. An episode of the Shahnameh recalls that when Yazdegerd III (the last Sassanid emperor, but like his forefathers, also a priest) was in hiding, his request for a \"barsom\" gave him away to the enemy.\n\nIn Zoroastrian tradition, the second chapter of the \"Yasna\" liturgy is named the \"Barsom Yasht\". As a part of the liturgy, it is not however part of the \"Yasht\" collection. In the Avesta categorization of Kellens, \"Yasna\" 2 – the \"Barsom Yasht\" – complements the other 7 of the first 8 \"Yasna\" chapters, the purpose of the 8-chapter set being an invitation of the divinities to the ceremony. After \"Yasna\" 1's initial invitation of Ahura Mazda, the Amesha Spentas and the remaining \"yazata\"s, the \"baresman\" and libation are presented to them in \"Yasna\" 2.\n\n"}

His father was Mihail Vassilyevich de Zirkoff, a Russian general. His mother was Lydia Dmitriyevna von Hahn, who was a second cousin to Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.\n\nThe Russian Revolution forced his family to flee in 1917 to Stockholm across Finland. Boris studied in some European universities, where he specialized in languages and classics. \"At Baden-Baden in Germany, he met a Russian American, Nikolai Romanoff, and learned from him about the existence, at Point Loma, close San Diego in California, of the organization, named Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society.

In response, these Chala Jews outwardly practiced Islam, but secretly retained their Jewish traditions. These crypto-Jews married among themselves and lived in their own neighborhoods that bordered on existing Jewish neighborhoods. The Chala Jews carry a very similar story to the Marranos of Spain.\n\nChala Jews were unable to return to their true Jewish faith due to the fatal consequences associated with leaving the Islamic faith. The Islamic rulership during this period imposed a death penalty against those renouncing their Islamic faith. Therefore, it was not until the emergence of Imperial Russia, and Soviet rule that Chala Jews were able to revert to their original faith.\n\nBy the 19th century, there were Chala communities that emerged in the cities of: Samarkand, Khiva, Kokand, Margilan, and Shahrisabz. Often, it was not until two to three generations that Chala Jews would begin to intermarry with the local Muslim population and shed any remaining Jewish traditions.\n\nThe return of the Chala to Judaism began with the Russian conquest of Central Asia in 1867. While the Khiva and Kokand khanates were incorporated into the Turkestan governorate, the Bukhara Khanate remained autonomous and continued to enforce the death penalty against those who abandoned Islam. As a result, many Chala Jews illegally immigrated into Russian-controlled areas, to escape the certain threat of death. Although Russian law required that these newcomers be deported back to Bukhara and face an imminent death, the deportation orders were continuously delayed, and thus many had remained as permanent non-citizens of the Russian Turkestan region. Some Chala Jews also joined merchant guilds in order to prove their economic use to the empire. Because Muslim law was retained in Bukhara for a longer period than in surrounding cities, by the time communist Soviet rule arrived in Bukhara, many members of the local Chala no longer identified themselves as Jewish, and were fully assimilated into the Muslim population.\n\nFollowing the installation of Soviet rule in 1920, the religious distinction among the population was no longer officially recognized. Nevertheless, ethnic distinctions on passports enabled many Chala Jews to continue being counted as ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks, rather than Jews. \n\nIn 2000, author Mansur Surosh published a novel \"Chala (\"The Outcasts\")\", which describes the experiences of the chala.\n\n"}

It is frequently used in Psalms in the latter sense, where it is traditionally translated \"lovingkindness\" in English translations.\n\nIn Jewish theology it is likewise used of God's love for the Children of Israel, and in Jewish ethics it is used for love or charity between people. Chesed in this latter sense of \"charity\" is considered a virtue on its own, and also for its contribution to \"tikkun olam\" (repairing the world). It is also considered the foundation of many religious commandments practiced by traditional Jews, especially interpersonal commandments. \n\n\"Chesed\" is also one of the ten Sephirot on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is given the association of kindness and love, and is the first of the emotive attributes of the \"sephirot\".\n\nThe root \"chasad\" has a primary meaning of \"eager and ardent desire\", used both in the sense \"good, kind\" and \"shame, contempt\". The noun \"chesed\" inherits both senses, on one hand \"zeal, love, kindness towards someone\" and on the other \"zeal, ardour against someone; envy, reproach\". In its positive is used of mutual benevolence, mercy or pity between people, of piety of people towards God, as well as grace, favour or mercy of God towards people.\n\nIt occurs 248 times in the Hebrew Bible. In the majority of cases (149 times), the King James Bible translation is \"mercy\", following LXX \"eleos\". Less frequent translations are: \"kindness\" (40 times), \"lovingkindness\" (30 times), \"goodness\" (12 times), \"kindly\" (5 times), \"merciful\" (4 times), \"favour\" (3 times) and \"good\", \"goodliness\", \"pity\" (once each).\nOnly two instances of the noun in its negative sense are in the text, translated \"reproach\" in Psalm 57:3, and \"wicked thing\" in Leviticus 20:17.\n\nThe translation of \"louing kindnesse\" in KJV is derived from the Coverdale Bible of 1535. This particular translation is used exclusively of \"chesed\" used of the benign attitude of YHWH (\"the \") or Elohim (\"God\") towards his chosen, primarily invoked in Psalms (23 times), but also in the prophets, four times in Jeremiah, twice in Isaiah 63:7 and once in Hosea 2:19. While \"lovingkindness\" is now considered somewhat archaic, it is part of the traditional rendition of Psalms in English Bible translations. Some more recent translations use \"steadfast love\" where KJV has \"lovingkindness\".\n\nThe Septuagint has \"mega eleos\" \"great mercy\", rendered as Latin \"misericordia\".\nAs an example of the use of \"chesed\" in Psalms, consider its notable occurrence at the beginning of Psalm 51 (, lit. \"be favourable to me, Elohim, as your \"chesed\"\"):\n\nIn Judaism, \"love\" is often used as a shorter English translation. \nPolitical theorist Daniel Elazar has suggested that \"chesed\" cannot easily be translated into English, but that it means something like \"loving covenant obligation.\"\nOther suggestions include \"grace\" and \"compassion\".\n\nIn traditional musar literature (ethical literature), chesed is one of the primary virtues. The tannaic rabbi Simon the Just taught: \"The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and bestowing kindness\" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). Chesed is here the core ethical virtue.\n\nA statement by Rabbi Simlai in the Talmud claims that \"The Torah begins with chesed and ends with chesed.\" This may be understood to mean that \"the entire Torah is characterized by chesed, i.e. it sets forth a vision of the ideal life whose goals are behavior characterized by mercy and compassion.\" Alternatively, it may allude to the idea that the giving of the Torah itself is the quintessential act of chesed.\n\nIn Moses Cordovero's kabbalistic treatise \"Tomer Devorah\", the following are actions undertaken in imitation of the qualities of Chesed:\n\nA person who embodies \"chesed\" (חסד) is known as a \"chasid\" (hasid, חסיד), one who is faithful to the covenant and who goes \"above and beyond that which is normally required\" and a number of groups throughout Jewish history which focus on going \"above and beyond\" have called themselves \"chasidim\". These groups include the Hasideans of the Second Temple period, the Maimonidean Hasidim of medieval Egypt and Palestine, the Chassidei Ashkenaz in medieval Europe, and the Hasidic movement which emerged in eighteenth century Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, חסד can take the generic meaning of \"charity\", and a \"chesed institution\" in modern Judaism \nmay refer to any charitable organization run by religious Jewish groups or individuals.\nCharitable organizations described as \"chesed institutions\" include:\n\nThe first three of the ten \"sephirot\", are the attributes of the intellect, while Chesed is the first \"sephira\" of the attribute of action. In the kabbalistic Tree of life, its position is below Chokhmah, across from Gevurah and above Netzach. It is usually given four paths. To Chokhmah, Gevurah, Tiphereth, and Netzach (some Kabbalists place a path from Chesed to Binah as well.)\n\nThe \"Bahir\" states, \"What is the fourth (utterance): The fourth is the righteousness of God, His mercies and kindness with the entire world. This is the right hand of God.\" Chesed manifests God's absolute, unlimited benevolence and kindness.\n\nThe angelic order of this sphere is the Hashmallim, ruled by the Archangel Zadkiel. The opposing Qliphah is represented by the demonic order Gamchicoth, ruled by the Archdemon Astaroth.\n\n"}

{"id": "36946834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36946834", "title": "Exorcism in Islam", "text": "Exorcism in Islam\n\nExorcism in Islam is called \"ruqya\" ( ), and is thought to repair damage believed caused by jinn possession witchcraft (\"shir\") or the evil eye. Exorcisms today are part of a wider body of contemporary Islamic alternative medicine called \"al-Tibb al-Nabawi\" (Medicine of the Prophet).\n\nBelief in Jinns, and other supernatural beings, is widespread in the Islamic world. Jinn is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root jnn (Arabic: جَنّ / جُنّ, \"jann\"), whose primary meaning is \"to hide\". Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, \"beings that are concealed from the senses\". Such creatures are believed to inhabit desolate, dingy, dark places where they are feared. Jinn exist invisibly amongst humans, only detectable with the sixth sense. The jinn are subtile creatures created from \"smokeless fire\" (fire and air) thought to be able to possess animate and inanimate objects. Unlike demons, they are not necessarily evil, but own a capacity of free-will.\n\nPossession is not caused by Satan, who is said to be just a tempter, whispering evil suggestions into humans heart, but, even though not mentioned in canonical scriptures, according to folklore by jinn, who can enter a human body physically or haunting them mentally. A possession by a jinn can happen for various reasons. Ibn Taymiyyah explained a Jinn could sometimes haunt an individual, because the person could (even unintentionally) harm the jinn; urinating or throwing hot water on it, or even killing a related jinn without even realizing it. In this case the jinn will try to take revenge on the person. Another cause for jinn possession is when a jinn falls in love with a human and thereupon the jinn possesses the human. Some women have told of their experiences with jinn possession; where the jinn tried to have sexual interaction from inside their bodies. Thirdly, it occurs when a jinn is evil and simply wants to harm a human for no specific reason, it will possess that person, if it gets the opportunity, while the human is in a very emotional state or unconsciousness. Jinn may also haunt someone in service of a sorcerer.\n\nIn Islamic belief, there are different signs of possession for example:\n\n\nIn case of a \"complete control\" by the Jinn, the possessed surrender to the Jinn and the persons consciousness is subverted by it. Such a jinn is indeed absolutely evil and thereupon the acts of the person are going to be evil as well. The person will obey the commands of the jinn at anytime. In a \"constant possession\" the person will not act without a command by the jinn.\n\nAccording to reports of individuals who have claimed to be possessed, they've asserted that during the jinn possession their spiritual abilities, like the sixth sense, had increased. Possession can also cause physical damage, such as inexplicable bruising or marks appearing spontaneously.\n\nRecited formulas, referred to as \"Ruqyah\" are used to expel the Jinn from the body. Majority of Ruqyah are either charms or spells that are uttered or written. \"Nushrah\" refers to charms or amulets that are used.\n\nIn a typical Islamic exorcism the treated person lies down while a white-gloved therapist places a hand on their head while reciting verses from the Quran.\n\nSpecific verses from the Quran are recited, which glorify God (e.g. The Throne Verse (Arabic: آية الكرسي \"Ayatul Kursi\") and invoke his help. In some cases the \"adhan\" (call for daily prayers) is also read, believed to have the effect of repelling non-angelic unseen beings or the \"jinn\".\n\nThe Islamic prophet Muhammad taught his followers to read the last three \"suras\" from the Quran, Surat al-Ikhlas (The Fidelity), Surat al-Falaq (The Dawn) and Surat an-Nas (Mankind).\n\nA common healing practice in classical Islam used music to cure mental illnesses, related to jinn-possession.\n\nThose who are permitted to perform exorcisms typically have other careers but possess the ability to exorcise.\n\nProhibited techniques often utilize \"shirk\", which is found in practices that prepare amulets or talismans. This is prohibited because \"shirk\" is the sin of practicing idolatry or polytheism i.e. the deification or worship of anyone or anything besides the singular God. Many times Qur'anic verses are added throughout the recitation when using these objects in order to 'mask' their \"shirk\". However, God believes he has provided sufficient cures in executing an exorcism, therefore exorcists should not have to rely on methods involving \"shirk\". Additionally, individuals seeking exorcism should avoid magicians or soothsayers because these magical practices go against Islamic Law.\n\nA \"hadith\" recorded in states: \"Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord.\" Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, a scholar, commented on this \"hadith\", stating: “That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said \"and they put their trust in their Lord.\" Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17939404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17939404", "title": "Fetial", "text": "Fetial\n\nA fetial (Latin plural fetiales) was a type of priest in Ancient Rome. They formed a \"collegium\" devoted to Jupiter as the patron of good faith.\n\nThe duties of the fetials included advising the senate on foreign affairs and international treaties, making formal proclamations of peace and of war, and confirming treaties. They also carried out the functions of traveling heralds or ambassadors (\"Pater Patratus\").\n\nThe first mention of the fetials by Livy occurs in the context of the war between Alba Longa and Rome, during which the Roman king Tullus Hostilius appointed M. Valerius as a fetial and Sp. Fusius as \"pater patratus\", for the purpose of binding Rome and Alba Longa by a treaty.\n\nAccording to Livy, the ritual by which the fetials were to declare war, the ritual of \"rerum repetitio\", was introduced to Rome by Ancus Marcius, borrowing on the traditions of the Aequicolae. However, he had already described the ritual actions of the fetials when recording the wars of Tullus Hostilius. Thus some scholars think the mentions of the Aequi may be a misinterpretation due to a folk etymology connecting Aequi to \"aequus\", the Latin adjective for fair. On the other hand ancient sources support the tradition that the priesthood was created under the influence of Aequian king Ferter Resus.\n\nThe ritual of \"rerum repetitio\", a request of restitution or reparations, involved the \"pater patratus\". Wearing a woolen hair-band, he was to announce Roman demands using a series of prescribed phrases, first at the enemy's frontier, then when he passes over the borders, again to the first man he meets, again on entering the enemy's gate, and again on entering the forum at the presence of local magistrates. If the demands are not met, the \"pater patratus\" declares war within 33 days and returns to Rome to await the resolution of the Roman king and senate. Once they have resolved to go to war, a fetial returns to the enemy frontier carrying a javelin with a steel or burnt tip, and dipped in blood. He declares war on the enemy, and throws the javelin into their territory.\n\nThe fetial is connected to matters of law and not directly to war, hence in his formulae he never invokes Mars, but Jupiter, Juno (or perhaps Janus) and Quirinius.\n\nThe religious relevance of the collegium or \"sodalitas\" lay in ensuring that Rome enjoyed the protection of gods in its relationships with foreign states.\n\nThis \"collegium\" was probably common to other Latin cities as Livy makes reference to the \"fetials\" of Alba.\n\nAccording to some scholars, the name derives from the noun root *\"feti-\", which means 'foundation' and not 'stipulation'. It is allied to the basic religious concept of \"fas\", both being rooted in IE *\"dh(e)s\", originally meaning 'to set, setting'. This root has given the verb \"facere\", 'to do, make' by a semantic shift. Both \"fetial\" and \"fas\" preserve the original sense of 'foundation' here, as in Vedic \"dhaman\", \"dhatu\" in its religious sense.\n\nThe implications of this etymology would hint to the fact that outside their own \"ager\" Romans felt the need for a religious, founding justification of their actions as a people toward other ones. A need was felt to go beyond the sphere of human law or right. While juridical justification was acknowledged as necessary Romans wanted to ensure the approval of what founds right and makes it possible, the fas.\nThis attitude is testified by the ceremonies held by the \"fetials\" that confer religious value to political decisions and specifications in their dealing with foreign nations, aimed at placing the gods on the side of Rome and hence effectively entrusting to them the fate of Rome.\n\nThe \"sodalitas\" dispatched two of its members, of whom only one, called the \"pater patratus\", was active, while the other called \"verbenarius\" was limited in function to accompanying the \"pater patratus\" with sacred herbs (\"sagmina\" of vervain) gathered on the Capitolium.\n\nWe know the ceremonies and formulae of two circumstances:\n(1) conclusion of a treaty and (2) request of reparations and declaration of war.\n\nIn the first circumstance the \"pater patratus\" called standersby and the gods to witness, staked the word of Rome, and vowed Rome to divine wrath if it should not abide by its word, asking for \"execratio\". Oaths were made by Jupiter Lapis (\"per Iovem Lapidem\"). The flintstone was believed to be a seat of Jupiter's because if struck it emitted sparks, thus being analogous to lightning.\n\nThe ceremony has two known variants. In the first one the \"pater patratus\" hits a pig with flintstone taken from the temple of Jupiter Feretrius pronouncing the \"formula\" referred by Livy; in the second he throws the flintstone and vows Rome to fall as the stone itself if it should fail to abide by the oath.\n\nWhen Rome asked for reparations for an offense or damage, the fetials were sent as ambassadors to the foreign country concerned.\nIf the requests borne by the \"pater patratus\" were not met, he went back to Rome after invoking Jupiter, Juno (or Janus), and Quirinus, along with the heavenly gods, the terrestrial gods, and the gods of the netherworld as witnesses of the violation of the \"ius\" and after declaring war within 30 or 33 days. When this period of time had expired he went back to the border and opened the hostilities with a magic gesture: while affirming once again the good right of Rome he threw a spear with steel point or a javelin of \"corniolum\" hardened with fire into the enemy's territory.\n\nThe fetials were a common institution of the Latins and of other Italic people.\n\nAccording to G. Dumézil, the initial contract concluded with the gods and extended through the \"sacra\" and the \"signa\" is sufficient to justify the acts of official religious authorities (such as pontiffs and augurs) within the Roman \"ager\". Actions beyond this boundary require an additional religious foundation, based not only on \"ius\" but also, on a deeper level, the \"fas\" on which \"ius\" is based. This is the task of the fetials who achieve their aim through the *\"feti-\", word that as Vedic \"dhātu\" means \"founding\". They rely on a set of ceremonies that bestow a religious value on the political or military decisions of the magistrates, ensuring that under any circumstance Rome has the gods on her side. Besides offering their advice on international issues to the senate or the consuls, the \"sodalitas\" dispatches two envoys (the \"pater patratus\" and the \"verbenarius\", the last one having only the task of carrying the \"sagmina\" taken from the Capitol Hill) to ask for the reparations, to declare war in a form that is pious and just, and lastly to conclude the peace. The god under whose protection they act and whom the \"pater patratus\" invokes is \"Iupiter Lapis\" in the rite of the conclusion of a treaty and in general when there an agreement is reached. If a declaration of war ensues the fetial calls as witnesses Jupiter, Juno (or Janus, correction accepted by most editors), Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and nether gods of the violation of the \"ius\" and declares war within thirty-three days.\n\nThe author of Cicero's apocryphal speech of Furius Filus and the Christian apologists blamed the Romans for craftily using the \"ius fetiale\" in order to ensure divine support for Rome in international disputes. They allege that Romans were not moved by a desire for justice in their use of the \"ius fetiale\", but rather bent its rules and made a disproportionately excessive use of its technicalities to acquire an undue advantage over other peoples with the ultimate goal of stealing their lands and riches.\n\nThere are two conflicting footnotes -- #1 and #7 -- for the same term, pater patratus.\n\n"}
{"id": "5662023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5662023", "title": "Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution", "text": "Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution\n\nThe Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution initiated by Tang Emperor Wuzong reached its height in the year 845 AD. Among its purposes were to appropriate war funds and to cleanse China of foreign influences. As such, the persecution was directed not only towards Buddhism but also towards other religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manichaeism.\n\nEmperor Wuzong's reasons for persecuting the Buddhist organisations and temples throughout China were economic, social, and religious.\n\nAn imperial edict of 845 stated the case against Buddhism as follows:\n\nThe first phase of the persecution was one aimed at purifying or reforming the Buddhist church rather than exterminating it. Thus, the persecution began in 842 with an imperial edict providing that undesirables such as sorcerers or convicts were to be weeded out from the ranks of the Buddhist monks and nuns and were to be returned to lay life. In addition, monks and nuns were to turn their wealth over to the government; those who wished to keep their wealth would be returned to lay life and forced to pay taxes. During this first phase, Confucian arguments for the reform of Buddhist institutions and the protection of society from Buddhist influence and practices were predominant.\n\nGradually, however, the Emperor Wuzong became more and more impressed with the claims of Taoist fanatics, and came to develop a severe dislike for Buddhism. The Japanese monk Ennin, who lived in China during the persecution, even suggested that the emperor had been influenced by his illicit love of a beautiful Taoist priestess. In addition, as time went by the emperor became more irascible and less sane in his judgments. One of his edicts banned the use of single-wheeled wheelbarrows, since they break up \"the middle of the road,\" an important concept of Taoism. As a result, in 844 the persecution moved into a second phase the objective of which was the extermination rather than the reformation of Buddhism. According to the report prepared by the Board of Worship, there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages (places of retreat), 260,500 monks and nuns. The emperor issued edicts that Buddhist temples and shrines be destroyed, that all monks (desirables as well as undesirables) be defrocked, that the property of the monasteries be confiscated, and that Buddhist paraphernalia be destroyed. An edict providing that foreign monks be defrocked and returned to their homelands resulted in Ennin's expulsion from China. By the edict of AD 845 all the monasteries were abolished with very few exceptions. When the monasteries were broken up the images of bronze, silver or gold were to be handed over to the government.\n\nIn 846, the Emperor Wuzong died, perhaps on account of the elixirs of life he had been consuming. It is also possible that he was intentionally poisoned. Shortly thereafter, his successor proclaimed a general amnesty. The persecution was over.\n\nThe suppression of monasteries and persecution of foreign religions were part of a reformation undertaken. The persecution lasted for twenty months—not long, but long enough to have permanent effects. Buddhism, for all its strength, never completely recovered. For centuries afterwards, it was merely a tolerated religion. The days of its greatest building, sculpture, and painting, and its most vital creative thought, were past.\n\nIn some aspects while much of traditional Buddhist teachings were later arduously restored following Emperor Wuzong's reign, some traditional schools of thought were wiped out. This included the ancient Esoteric school, which barely survived through the Japanese monk Kūkai, later the founder of the Shingon sect.\n\nIn addition to Buddhism, Wuzong persecuted other foreign religions as well. He all but destroyed Zoroastrianism and Manichaeanism in China, and his persecution of the growing Nestorian Christian churches sent Nestorian Christianity into a decline, from which it did not recover until the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. The arrival of Catholic and Protestant missionaries gave new life to Christianity in China. \n\nIt most likely led to the disappearance of Zoroastrianism.\nChinese records state Zoroastrianism and Christianity were regarded as heretical forms of Buddhism, and were included within the scope of the edicts. Below is from an edict concerning the two religions:\n\nIslam was brought to China during the Tang dynasty by Arab traders, who were primarily concerned with trading and commerce. It is thought that this low profile was the reason that the 845 anti-Buddhist edict ignored Islam.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "86289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86289", "title": "Herma", "text": "Herma\n\nA herma (, pl. \"hermai\"), commonly in English herm, is a sculpture with a head, and perhaps a torso, above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. The form originated in Ancient Greece, and was adopted by the Romans, and revived at the Renaissance in the form of term figures and Atlantes.\n\nIn the earliest times Greek divinities were worshiped in the form of a heap of stones or a shapeless column of stone or wood. In many parts of Greece there were piles of stones by the sides of roads, especially at their crossings, and on the boundaries of lands. The religious respect paid to such heaps of stones, especially at the meeting of roads, is shown by the custom of each passer-by throwing a stone on to the heap or anointing it with oil. Later there was the addition of a head and phallus to the column, which became quadrangular (the number 4 was sacred to Hermes).\n\nIn ancient Greece the statues were thought to ward off harm or evil, an apotropaic function, and were placed at crossings, country borders and boundaries as protection, in front of temples, near to tombs, outside houses, in the gymnasia, palaestrae, libraries, porticoes, and public places, at the corners of streets, on high roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed upon them. Before his role as protector of merchants and travelers, Hermes was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name perhaps comes from the word herma referring to a square or rectangular pillar of stone, terracotta, or bronze; a bust of Hermes' head, usually with a beard, sat on the top of the pillar, and male genitals adorned the base. The surmounting heads were not, however, confined to those of Hermes; those of other gods and heroes, and even of distinguished mortals, were of frequent occurrence. In this case a compound was formed: \"Hermathena\" (a herm of Athena), \"Hermares\" (of Ares), \"Hermherakles\" (of Herakles), \"Hermaphroditus\" (of Aphrodite—not to be confused with the son of Hermes and Aphrodite with the same name, \"Hermaphroditus\", who had the genitals of both sexes), \"Hermanubis\", \"Hermalcibiades\", and so on. In Athens, where the \"hermai\" were most numerous and most venerated, they were placed outside houses as apotropes for good luck. They would be rubbed or anointed with olive oil and adorned with garlands or wreaths. This superstition persists, for example the Porcellino bronze boar of Florence (and numerous others like it around the world), where the nose is shiny from being continually touched for good luck or fertility.\n\nIn Roman and Renaissance versions (\"termini\"), the body was often shown from the waist up. The form was also used for portrait busts of famous public figures, especially writers like Socrates and Plato. Sappho appears on Ancient Greek herms, and anonymous female figures were often used from the Renaissance on, when herms were often attached to walls as decoration.\n\nIn 415 BC, on a night shortly before the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War (see Sicilian Expedition), all of the Athenian \"hermai\" were vandalized. This was a horribly impious act and many people believed it threatened the success of the expedition. Though it was never proven, the Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or Spartan sympathizers from Athens itself; one suspect was the writer Xenophon. Enemies of Alcibiades, using the anger of the Athenians as a pretext to investigate further desecrations, accused him of other acts of impiety, including mutilations of other sacred objects and mocking performances of religious mystery ceremonies. He denied the accusations and offered to stand trial, but the Athenians did not want to disrupt the expedition any further, and his opponents wanted to use his absence to incite the people against him at a time when he would not be able to defend himself. Once he had left on the expedition, his political enemies had him charged and sentenced to death \"in absentia\", both for the mutilation of the hermai, and the supposedly related crime of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries.\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has a large collection of Roman Herma boundary marker stones in its stored collection.\n\nAn Aesop's fable makes fun of statue of Hermes. When a pious dog offers to 'anoint' it, the god hastily assures his worshipper that this is not necessary.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9663900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9663900", "title": "Hinduism in Zimbabwe", "text": "Hinduism in Zimbabwe\n\nHinduism in Zimbabwe came with indentured servants brought by the colonial British administrators in late 19th and early 20th-century to what was then called British South Africa Company and later Rhodesia. This Hindu migration was different from those in East African countries such as Kenya and Uganda where Hindus arrived voluntarily for jobs but without restrictive contracts; it was quite similar to the arrival of Indian workers in South Africa, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago with slave-like contract restrictions for plantation work owned by Europeans, particularly the British. Most Hindus who arrived for these indentured plantation work were originally from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, people escaping from major repetitive famines in colonial British India from 1860s to 1910s. These laborers came for a fixed period irrevocable contract of exclusive servitude, with an option to either go back to India with plantation paid return fare, or stay in a local settlement after the contract ended. Most chose to stay and continue working for a salary.\nArchaeological studies in Zimbabwe and the Swahili coast have revealed evidence that suggests that Indian traders had a small presence and sporadic interaction with the African people during the Roman Empire period (early 1st millennium CE) and thereafter, long pre-dating the European colonial era. Similarly, genetic studies suggest a direct ancient African-Indian trade and cooperation because by the 1st millennium BCE African crops were adopted in India, and Indian crops as well as the domesticated \"zebu cow\" (Bos indicus) were adopted in Africa, but these were missing from north Africa, the northeastern horn of Africa and Arabia during that age. The development of gold mining and processing methods among the Shona people in Zimbabwe highlands increased its trading activity with India before the 12th century, particularly through the city of Sofala. However, these traders did not engage in religious missionary activity and Hinduism was limited to the traders.\n\nHinduism came with indentured laborers brought to Zimbabwe, and they were a part of a global movement of workers during the colonial era, to help with plantation and mining related projects when local skilled labor was unavailable, to build infrastructure projects, establish services, retail markets and for administrative support. The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of India, came to escape starvation and work in plantations owned by the Europeans.\n\nAccording to Ezra Chitando, the 19th- and early 20th-century encounters between European Christians with both Hinduism and African Traditional Religions in Zimbabwe were complex, generally demonizing and dehumanizing both Hinduism and African religions, but the Christian missionaries never totally condemn Hinduism or African religions. The Christian officials identified some positive elements in both, but states Chitando, then called upon the Hindu Indian workers and local Africans to \"abandon their traditions and embrace their [Christian] version of reality\". In contrast to Christian missionary approach, neither Hinduism nor African Traditional Religions were missionary in their approach or goals.\n\nHindus are a tiny minority in modern era Zimbabwe. The \"Hindu Religious and Cultural Institute\" of Harare discusses Sanatana Dharma with children born into Hindu families of Zimbabwe, and welcomes non-Hindus. The major centers of Hindu community of about 3,000 in Harare include various schools, the Goanese Association, the Hindu Society, the Tamil Sangam, the Brahma Kumaris yoga centers and the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society all of which are in Harare. The Krishna-oriented ISKCON has a centre at Marondera.\n\n\n"}

A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. Jesus only discusses marriage in a heterosexual context when he cites the Book of Genesis during a discussion of marriage (Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9).\n\nThe references to 'homosexuality' itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words: \"arsenokoitēs\" (ἀρσενοκοίτης), \"malakos\" (μαλακός), and \"porneia\" (πορνεία) and its cognates. While it is not disputed that the three Greek words apply to sexual relations between men (and possibly between women), some academics interpret the relevant passages as a prohibition against pederasty or prostitution rather than homosexuality \"per se\", while other scholars have presented counter arguments. The historical context of the passages has also been a subject of debate.\n\nEpistle to the Romans 1:26–27 (English Majority Text Version, EMTV):\nThe context is Paul's mission to the gentiles, the gospel being \"to the Jew first, and also to the Greek\" (1:16), followed by a description of pagan idolatry in verses 1:21–25. The phrase \"passions of dishonor\" (KJV: \"vile affections\") translates ,\nIn the expressions \"natural use\" and \"contrary to nature\", \"nature\" translates φύσις, i.e. \"Physis\". The term \"error\" translates \"planē\" (lit. \"straying, wandering\")\n\nThe authenticity of the passage is in doubt; several scholars since the mid-20th century have proposed their being part of a larger non-Pauline interpolation.\n\nThe passage has been described by Hilborn (2002) as \"the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate\". It is also the only known specific reference in the Bible to female homosexuality. Hilborn (2002) argues that in the wider passage (Romans 1:18-32) Paul writes that the \"global scope of salvation history has been made manifest not only in 'the gospel of God's Son' (cf. v.9), but also in the very 'creation of the world' (v.20).\" In common with many traditional commentators, Hilborn (\"op cit\") goes on to argue that condemnation of homosexual activity is derived from the \"broad contours\" of Paul's argument, in addition to the selective reading of individual words or phrases.\n\nModern English translations imply that Rom 1:26b condemns lesbian sex, while 1:27 condemns sex between men. However, several early church writers clearly state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. Brooten cites both Anastasios and Augustine as explicitly rejecting the 'lesbian hypothesis' (p. 337). Hanks asserts that \"not until John Chrysostom (ca 400 CE) does anyone (mis)interpret Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women\" (p. 90). Townsley notes that other early writers, possibly including Chrysostom, reject the 'lesbian' hypothesis, specifically, Ambrosiaster, Didymus the Blind and Clement of Alexandria. Townsley goes on to specify the context of Rom 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Rom 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of Cybele, practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19). The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians.\n\nBoswell (1980) speculated that the text does not condemn \"homosexual acts by homosexuals\", but rather \"homosexual acts committed by heterosexual persons\". Boswell argues that the conceptual modality (natural laws) which would provide the basis for the blanket condemnation of homosexuality did not exist prior to the Enlightenment era.\nSimilarly, McNeill (1993) invokes \"heterosexuals\" who \"abandoned heterosexuality\" or \"exchanged heterosexuality for homosexuality\".\nDallas (), opposing what he sees as the \"gay agenda\" behind such interpretations, contends that the apostle Paul is condemning changing \"the natural use into that which is against nature\" (Romans 1:26-27), and to suggest that Paul is referring to \"heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics\".\nWest () argues that Paul is condemning specific types of homosexual activity (such as temple prostitution or pederasty) rather than a broader interpretation. West argues that Paul is speaking to a Gentile audience in terms that they would understand to show that \"all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23).\n\nA more conservative biblical interpretation contends \"the most authentic reading of Rom 1:26-7 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity\". That \"nature\" in Rm 1:26 refers to acting contrary to design and man's normality is seen as evidenced by its use in . Hays argues that Romans 1:26,27 is part of a general condemnation of humans, in which males and females, have rejected their creational (as in Genesis) distinctions, with homoeroticism being intrinsically wrong.\n\nKing James Version (1611): \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind\"\n\nThe phrase \"abusers of themselves with mankind\" translates \"arsenokoitai\" also rendered \"sodomites\" (YLT), or \"men who have sex with men\" (NIV). Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8–11.\n\nThe term rendered as \"effeminate\" is \"malakoi\", with a literal meaning of \"soft\". Nowhere else in scripture is malakoi used to describe a person.\n\nKing James Version (1611): \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine\"\n\nThe term relevant to homosexuality, \"that defile themselves with mankind\", translates ἀρσενοκοίτης \"arsenokoitēs\", the same term for homosexuals used in 1 Corinthians.\nOther translations of the term include: \"them that do lechery with men\" (Wycliffe 1382), \"those practicing homosexuality\" (NIV), \"those who abuse themselves with men\" (Amplified Version, 1987).\n\nSince the nineteenth century many scholars have suggested that First Timothy, along with Second Timothy and Titus, are not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing some time in the late-first-to-mid-2nd century. Most scholars now affirm this view.\n\n\"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\" (KJV)\n\nThe expression of \"giving themselves over to fornication\" translates \"ekporneusasai\", rendered as \"sexual immorality\" in both NIV and ESV; the phrase \"going after strange flesh\" is a literal translation of , rendered as \"perversion\" in NIV and as \"pursued unnatural desire\" in ESV.\nSimon J. Kistemaker notes that the Greek phrase σαρκὸς ἑτέρας (\"sarkos heteras\", \"strange flesh\") is often interpreted as the specific desire on the part of the Sodomites to have sexual relations with angels.\nKistemaker, however, argues that it means they were \"interested in sexual relations with men.\"\n\nIn Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?\" His answer is as follows:He answered, \"Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning 'made them male and female' [Genesis 1:27], and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh' [Genesis 2:24]? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is \"obvious\" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.\n\nLeroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for \"many\" reasons, or for \"any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'\", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is \"likely\" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is \"more radical and less permissive\".\n\nThe Greek word arsenokoitēs appears in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10. In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (TNIV), Paul says:\nThe word translated as \"practicing homosexuals\" has been alternately rendered as \"abusers of themselves with mankind\" (King James Version, 21st Century King James Version), \"sodomites\" (Young's Literal Translation), or \"homosexuals\" (New American Standard Bible), or \"men who practice homosexuality\" (English Standard Version) or \"those who abuse themselves with men\" (Amplified Bible) or \"for those who have a twisted view of sex\" (New International Readers Version) or \"for sexual perverts\" (Good News Translation) or \"for abusers of themselves with men\" (American Standard Version). The original term is unknown before Paul. (\"arsenokoitēs\"), thought to mean \"one who has sexual intercourse with a male\" (Greek [\"arrhēn\" / \"arsēn\"] \"male\"; [\"koitēs\"] \"bed\"), rather than the normal terms from the Greek culture. Within the Bible, it only occurs in this passage and in a similar list in 1 Timothy 1:9-10.\n\nThe term is thought to be either a Jewish coinage from the Greek (Septuagint) translation of Leviticus 20:13, or even Paul's own coinage:\nIn contrast, Boswell (1980) argues that this is a term specifically created by Paul, and that given its unusual nature, the fact that Paul did not use one of the more common pagan Greek terms, and given its direct reference to the Levitical laws, it is a matter of debate whether Paul was referring generally to any person having homosexual sex, or whether (as discussed below) it referred only to anal sex of any form (cf. Elliott 2004). Other translations of the word, based on examinations of the context of its subsequent uses, include Martin's (1996), who argued it meant \"homosexual slave trader\" and Boswell's (1980) who argued it referred to \"homosexual rape\" or homosexual prostitutes. Scroggs perceives it as referring to exploitative pederasty.\n\nThe term \"arsenokoitai\" was rarely used in Church writings (Elliott 1994), with Townsley (2003) counting a total of 73 references. Most are ambiguous in nature, although St. John Chrysostom, in the 4th century, seems to use the term \"arsenokoitai\" to refer to pederasty common in the Greco-Roman culture of the time and Patriarch John IV of Constantinople in the 6th century used it to refer to anal sex: \"some men even commit the sin of \"arsenokoitai\" with their wives\" (Townsley 2003). Moreover, Hippolytus of Rome in his \"Refutation of all Heresies\" describes a Gnostic teaching, according to which an evil angel Naas committed adultery with Eve and \"arsenokoitēs\" with Adam. The context suggests the translation of \"arsenokoitēs\" as pederasty, although it might have a different meaning.\n\nSome scholars argue against the restriction of the word to pederasty. For example, Scobie states that \"there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations\". Similarly, Campbell writes, \"it must be pointed out, first, that \"arsenokoitēs\" is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse.\" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, \"in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.\"\n\nOthers have pointed out that the meaning of \"arsenokoitēs\" is identified by its derivation from the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where the component words \"with a man (\"arsenos\") do not copulate coitus (\"koites\") as with a woman\" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word \"arsenokoitēs\" appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for \"one who lies with a male [as with a woman]\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of \"Sybilline Oracles\" 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct. Malick (\"op cit\") writes, \"it is significant that of all the terms available in the Greek language, Paul chose a compound from the Septuagint that in the broadest sense described men lying with men as they would lie with women.\" According to Scobie, \"it clearly echoes the Greek of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the LXX (arsen = \"male,\" and koite = \"bed\"), so that arsenokoitēs literally means \"one who goes to bed with a male\".\n\nDavid Wright argues that the compound word refers to those who sleep with males, and denotes “‘male homosexual activity’ without qualification.” Haas, reviewing the various arguments on both sides, concluded that \"an examination of the biblical passages from linguistic, historical and ethical-theological perspectives fails to support the revisionist ethic and reinforces the traditional Christian teaching that homosexual practice is morally wrong.\" Via also agrees \"arsenokoitēs\" refers to homosexual activity. James B. De Young presents similar arguments.\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to homosexual behavior.\n\nThis word is translated as \"male prostitutes\" (TNIV), \"effeminate\" (NASB), or \"catamites\" (TJB; in the footnotes of the NKJV), in 1 Corinthians 6:9.\n\nThe Greek word ; \"malakos\" carries a root meaning of soft, luxurious or dainty, but here, G. Fee argues, it is used in a much darker way, possibly referring to the more passive partner in a homosexual relationship. According to Scroggs (\"op cit\"), the word \"malakos\" in Paul’s list refers specifically to this category of person, the effeminate call-boy. Others, for example Olson, based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets \"malakos\" to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the μαλακοί in Paul’s time, \"almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'.\"\n\nLexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (\"op cit\") writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter from Demophon, a wealthy Egyptian, to Ptolemaeus, a police official, concerning needed provisions for a coming festival. According to Ukleja, \"a strong possible translation of both \"malakos\" (and \"arsenokoitēs\") is the morally loose (effeminate) who allow themselves to be used homosexually and the person who is a practicing homosexual.\" Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.\n\nThe meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (\"op cit\"), when \"malakos\" is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. Most scholars think it means someone wilfully engaged in homosexual relations.\n\nSome theologians have argued that, when read in historical context, the Jewish Platonist philosopher Philo of Alexandria used the term in reference to temple prostitution.\n\nAccording to Roy Ward, \"malakos\" was used to describe an item soft to the touch, such as a soft pillow or cloth. When used negatively, the term meant faint-hearted, lacking in self-control, weak or morally weak with no link to same-gender sexual behaviour.\n\nIn Matthew 15: 19-20 (KJV) Jesus says:\nIn Mark 7: 20-23 (KJV) it says:\nWhether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of \"porneia\" (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate \"porneia\" as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see Leviticus). Some interpret the translation of \"porneia\" more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the Church Fathers.\n\nYale University professor John Boswell argues that \"arsenokoitēs\" in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 refers specifically to male prostitution; various conservative scholars have presented countering arguments.\n\nThe term \"porneia\" () still means prostitution in modern Greek.\n\nThis event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a centurion's servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: \"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.\" The term translated from the Greek as \"servant\" in this verse is \"doulos\". Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is \"pais\", a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including \"child\" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), \"son\" (John 4:51) or \"servant\" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether \"son\" or \"servant\" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).\n\nHorner and Daniel A. Helminiak both suggest a homosexual theme to this text. Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term \"valued highly\" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him. However, a contrasting viewpoint is that the term “highly valued” (Greek ἔντιμος, \"entimos\") simply suggests a genuine care for the person or, more archaically, that the centurion was fond of this slave, and that the term \"entimos\" has no hint of sexual content in any of its various appearances in the Bible. Jay Michaelson argues that the term \"pais\" is actually mistranslated as \"servant\" when its true meaning is \"lover\".\n\nOther biblical scholars dismiss any suggestions of a homosexual theme as deliberately distorted interpretations of the text. Marston argues that Jesus would not have condoned any homosexual relationship, in line with the weight of other scriptural evidence, while Chapman suggests that even if the relationship had been homosexual, his lack of condemnation does not necessarily equate to his approval of them.\n\nIn Matthew 19:12, Jesus discusses eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Clement of Alexandria wrote in his commentary on it that \"some men, from their birth, have a natural sense of repulsion from a woman; and those who are naturally so constituted do well not to marry\".\n\nThe First Council of Nicaea in 323 AD established 20 new laws called canons. The first of these was the prohibition of self castration.\nThe Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert encountered in Acts 8, has been described as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word \"eunuch\" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Romans 1:26-27 (ESV), Paul writes, \"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature\". Most interpreters assume that, due to the analogy with same-sex lust between males, Paul is referring to female same-sex behavior. This assumption is not conclusive, and it remains difficult to discern exactly what Paul meant by women exchanging natural intercourse for unnatural.\n\nMany commentators have argued that the references to homosexuality in the NT, or the Bible in general, have to be understood in their proper historical context. Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations. For example, William Walker says that the very notion of \"homosexuality\" (or even \"heterosexuality\", \"bisexuality\" and \"sexual orientation\") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers. The word \"homosexuality\" and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century. Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations. However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.\n\nA statement by the Bishops of the Church of England (Issues in Human Sexuality) in 1991 illustrates a categorization and understanding of homosexuality, claiming that in ancient times \"society recognized the existence of those, predominantly male, who appeared to be attracted entirely to members of their own sex.\" (Issues in Human Sexuality para 2.16, lines 8-9) which almost parallels that of modern ideation. The same study is careful to point out that \"the modern concept of orientation has been developed against a background of genetic and psychological theory which was not available to the ancient world.\"\n\nSarah Ruden, in her \"Paul Among the People\" (2010) argues that the only form of homosexual sex that was apparent to the public in Paul's time was exploitative pederasty, in which slave boys were raped by adult males, often very violently. Paul's condemnation of homosexuality, Ruden argues, can be interpreted most plausibly as a criticism of this kind of brutally exploitative behavior.\n\n"}

He was cremated and some of his ashes were placed in the Precious Stupa of the One Vehicle, a small stupa located on the grounds of the groups headquarters. He is remembered for his interfaith work and his calls for global peace and disarmament. While many people around the world regard him with the highest respect, some criticism occurred shortly after his death regarding the large fortune that he left behind, many claiming that this was un-Buddhist.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1971 a breakaway movement, the \"Nouvelle Action Française\" was established by Bertrand Renouvin. Soon, the name of this movement was changed to \"Nouvelle Action Royaliste\"; Renouvin, arguably “France's most prominent [...] and reasonable monarchist″ is the group's president. The NAR publish in particular a historical review entitled \"Le Lys rouge\" and a political semi-monthly \"Royaliste\".\n\nThe members of the NAR are sometimes described as \"royalists of the left\", due to close relations to certain ideas defended by the parties of the left. Its leader, Bertrand Renouvin, appealed to his supporters to vote for Socialist François Mitterrand in both the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections. In November 1989, the NAR joined the \"89 pour l'égalité\" movement, which campaigned to get voting rights for immigrants alongside SOS Racisme. At the time of the 2002 presidential elections, Renouvin chose to support the candidature of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the only souverainist able in Renouvin's view to gather the good will of both left and right for the purpose of regaining France her position in the world.\n\nThe ideas of NAR are characterized by souverainism, anti-liberalism and anti-Americanism.

She has been a columnist for \"The Guardian\" newspaper since 1998.\n\nShe is a social democrat and was a candidate for the Social Democratic Party in the 1983 general election. She now broadly supports the Labour Party, although she has been critical of its current left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \n\nToynbee previously worked as social affairs editor for the BBC and also for \"The Independent\" newspaper. She is vice-president of Humanists UK, having previously served as its president between 2007 and 2012. She was also named Columnist of the Year at the 2007 British Press Awards.\n\nPolly Toynbee was born at Yafford on the Isle of Wight, the second daughter of the literary critic Philip Toynbee (by his first wife Anne), granddaughter of the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, and great-great niece of philanthropist and economic historian Arnold Toynbee, after whom Toynbee Hall in the East End of London is named. Her parents divorced when Toynbee was aged four and she moved to London with her mother.\n\nAfter attending Badminton School, a girls' independent school in Bristol, followed by Holland Park School, a state comprehensive school in London, as she had failed the 11-plus examination. She passed one A-level, obtained a scholarship to read history at St Anne's College, Oxford, but dropped out of university after eighteen months. During her gap year, in 1966, she worked for Amnesty International in Rhodesia (which had just unilaterally declared independence) until she was expelled by the government. She published her first novel, \"Leftovers\", in 1966. Following her expulsion from Rhodesia, Toynbee revealed the existence of the \"Harry\" letters, which detailed the alleged funding of Amnesty International by the British government.\n\nAfter Oxford, she found work in a factory and a burger bar and hoping to write in her spare time. She later said \"I had a loopy idea that I could work with my hands during the day and in the evening come home and write novels and poetry, and be Tolstoy... But I very quickly discovered why people who work in factories don't usually have the energy to write when they get home.\" She went into journalism, working on the diary at \"The Observer\", and turned her eight months of experience in manual work (along with \"undercover\" stints as a nurse and an Army recruit) into the book \"A Working Life\" (1970).\n\nToynbee worked for many years at \"The Guardian\" before joining the BBC where she was social affairs editor (1988–1995). At \"The Independent\", which she joined after leaving the BBC, she was a columnist and associate editor, working with then editor Andrew Marr. She later rejoined \"The Guardian\". She has also written for \"The Observer\" and the \"Radio Times\"; at one time she edited the \"Washington Monthly USA\".\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Barbara Ehrenreich's \"Nickel and Dimed\" (2001), she published in 2003 \"\" about an experimental period voluntarily living on the minimum wage, which was £4.10 per hour at the time. She worked as a hospital porter in a National Health Service hospital, a dinnerlady in a primary school, a nursery assistant, a call-centre employee, a cake factory worker and a care home assistant, during which time she contracted salmonella. The book is critical of conditions in low pay jobs in Britain. She also contributed an introduction to the UK edition of Ehrenreich's \"\".\n\nCurrently Toynbee serves as President of the Social Policy Association. She is chair of the Brighton Festival and deputy treasurer of the Fabian Society.\n\nPolly Toynbee is a member of the Labour Party. Toynbee and her first husband Peter Jenkins (from 1970) were supporters of the Social Democratic Party breakaway from Labour in 1981, both signing the Limehouse Declaration. Toynbee stood for the party at the 1983 General Election in Lewisham East, garnering 9351 votes (22%), and finishing third. She was one of the very few SDP members who believed in unilateral nuclear disarmament, founding an unsuccessful group \"Unilateralists for Social Democracy\". She later refused to support the subsequent merger of the SDP with the Liberals (to form the Liberal Democrats), reacting instead by rejoining Labour when the rump SDP collapsed.\n\nIn 1995, Toynbee criticised Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon's comments that 80% of mugging cases were committed by black people, stating that it was \"an over-simplification that is seriously misleading\". She approvingly quoted academic researcher Michael Keith, who said: \"If you were to standardise for everything else – education, unemployment, housing estates, life chances – race on its own would have virtually no significance.\"\n\nIn a 2002 debate hosted by the Royal Society of Arts and \"Prospect\", Toynbee argued that the West should pursue liberal internationalism by intervening through the United Nations to promote democracy around the world: \"Spreading people's right to self-determination, and their right to think and vote for themselves, is a moral obligation… We should be intervening now in the Congo and Sudan\".\n\nToynbee strongly supports state education, though she had two of her three children partly educated in the private sector, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Although consistently critical of many of Tony Blair's New Labour reforms, she wrote in 2005 that his government \"remains the best government of my political lifetime\". During the 2005 General Election, with dissatisfaction high among traditional Labour voters, Toynbee wrote several times about the dangers of protest voting, \"Giving Blair a bloody nose\". She urged \"Guardian\" readers to vote with a clothes peg over their nose if they had to, to make sure Michael Howard would not win from a split vote. \"Voters think they can take a free hit at Blair while assuming Labour will win anyway. But Labour won't win if people won't vote for it\".\n\nIn December 2006, Greg Clark (a former SDP member, later to be a Conservative Minister) claimed Toynbee should be an influence on the modern Conservative Party, causing a press furore. Reacting to this, Conservative leader David Cameron said he was impressed by one metaphor in her writings – of society being a caravan crossing a desert, where the people at the back can fall so far behind they are no longer part of the tribe. He added, \"I will not be introducing Polly Toynbee's policies\". Toynbee expressed some discomfort with this embrace, adding, \"I don't suppose the icebergs had much choice about being hugged by Cameron either.\" In response to the episode, Boris Johnson, at the time a Conservative MP and journalist who had been severely criticised by Toynbee, rejected any association with Toynbee's views, writing that she \"incarnates all the nannying, high-taxing, high-spending schoolmarminess of Blair's Britain. Polly is the high priestess of our paranoid, mollycoddled, risk-averse, airbagged, booster-seated culture of political correctness and 'elf 'n' safety fascism\".\n\nHaving advocated Brown to succeed Blair as Prime Minister, she continued to endorse him in the early part of his premiership. By spring 2009 she had become sharply critical of Brown, arguing that he had failed to introduce the social-democratic policies he promised, and was very poor at presentation too. She subsequently called for his departure, voluntary or otherwise. In the European Elections of June 2009 she advocated a vote for the Liberal Democrats. During the 2010 general election she advocated a tactical vote for whichever candidate was best able to keep the Conservatives out of power.\n\nIn October 2010 Toynbee was criticised for an article in \"The Guardian\" in which she said the government's benefits changes would drive many poor people out of London and could be seen as a \"final solution\" for their situation. Some people interpreted this as a reference to the Nazis, which Toynbee said was not her intention. A Press Complaints Commission report in the matter ruled the comments were \"insensitive\", but did not breach any rules as the organisation's remit does not cover matters of taste and offence. She later apologised for using the term.\n\nToynbee has been described as \"the queen of leftist journalists\", and in 2008 topped a poll of 100 \"opinion makers\", carried out by Editorial Intelligence. She was also named the most influential columnist in the UK. With her current partner, former Social Affairs editor of \"The Guardian\" David Walker (Peter Jenkins died in 1992), Toynbee co-authored two books reviewing the successes and failures of New Labour in power. In \"Unjust Rewards\" (2008) they argued that \"excess at the top hurts others\".\n\nPolly Toynbee hopes Theresa May will work to reduce Poverty in the UK, and that Working Tax Credit will be increased to reduce child poverty.\n\nToynbee does not believe the public sector needs steadily less money every year. Toynbee argues that the government has plenty of money to finance tax cuts for better off people. Toynbee wrote in March 2017, \"They plan to cut the size of the state permanently to 36% of GDP, from 45% in 2010. New faces in No 10 and 11 Downing Street are only casting changes for the same old script, ideologically identical.\" In late June 2017, after the 2017 general election Toynbee wrote, \"There are a million fewer public servants than in 2010, a loss keenly felt in every field. (...) From depleted Whitehall’s frantic scramble to hire thousands more experts to cope with Brexit, to the critical shortage of nurses and carers, cuts in environmental health officers and 90% fewer health and safety at work inspections, voters now see a threadbare public sector.\n\nA week after the 2017 General Election Toynbee responded to the Grenfell Tower fire, she wrote, \"Political blame spreads right through the Conservative party, with no escape on offer. This goes far beyond the precise shockers – the Tory MPs who mockingly rejected housing regulation; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; the disregard of coroner’s instructions after the 2009 Lakanal House tragedy; and even the plan to opt out of EU safety regulations. Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council allegedly blocking its ears to tenants’ well-founded anxiety is just the immediate scandal. But this event reaches far deeper, to the very sinews of its party’s policy.\"\n\nToynbee believes the National Health Service is badly underfunded. In January 2017 she wrote, \"When the Royal College of Surgeons protests at cancer operations cancelled, is that a tipping point? When nearly half of all hospitals declare major alerts for lack of beds, that’s an emergency. There’s no winter flu, no Arctic weather, just pressure from underfunding, like an aneurysm about to burst. But the prime minister is not for turning, not yet.\" Toynbee also wrote, \"But May can’t defy the NHS laws of gravity that force every prime minister to U-turn on underfunding. Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair all buckled. This crisis looks set to outdo all those, says Chris Ham, NHS historian and head of the King’s Fund. History shows – and this was proved in the Blair years – that when the NHS reaches roughly EU funding levels, its results soar. When funding falls too far, trolleys pile up in corridors.\"\n\nAn atheist, Toynbee is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a distinguished supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland, and was appointed President of the British Humanist Association in July 2007. Since 2012 she has been the BHA's Vice President. She claimed that she is simply a consistent atheist, and is just as critical of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. She wrote: \"The pens sharpen – Islamophobia! No such thing. Primitive Middle Eastern religions (and most others) are much the same – Islam, Christianity and Judaism all define themselves through disgust for women's bodies.\" In 1997 she declared \"I am an Islamophobe and proud of it\". In 2005 she opposed the Bill to outlaw incitement to religious hatred: \"Race is something people cannot choose and it defines nothing about them. But beliefs are what people choose to identify with...The two cannot be blurred into one – which is why the word Islamophobia is a nonsense\".\n\nIn 2003 upon the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's papacy, she wrote that he \"is a hate-figure and with good reason… No one can compute how many people have died of Aids as a result of Wojtyla's power, how many woman have died in childbirth needlessly, how many children starved in families too large and poor to feed them. But it is reasonable to suppose these silent, unseen, uncounted deaths at his hand would match that of any self-respecting tyrant or dictator\".\n\nToynbee had agreed to debate with the philosopher William Lane Craig during his UK October visit, but subsequently pulled out, saying \"I hadn't realised the nature of Mr Lane Craig's debating style, and having now looked at his previous performances, this is not my kind of forum.\"\n\nToynbee has mixed feelings about the Church of England; she opposed both religious and secular dogmatic beliefs. In April 2014 she wrote:\nToynbee was awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of Essex in 1999 and by London South Bank University in 2002. In 2005, she was made an Honorary Doctor of The Open University for \"her notable contribution to the educational and cultural well-being of society\". The University of Kent awarded Toynbee the honorary title of Doctor of Civil Law in November 2007 in recognition of her concern with poverty and welfare. This was followed in 2008 when University of Leeds awarded her fourth Honorary Doctorate.\n\nShe won the Orwell Prize for journalism in 1998 (for journalism published by \"The Independent\"), and in 2007 was named 'Columnist of the Year' at the British Press Awards.\n\nToynbee lives in Lewes, East Sussex.\nShe is a member of the Arts Emergency Service.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18252888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18252888", "title": "Polygamy in Christianity", "text": "Polygamy in Christianity\n\nPolygamy is \"the practice or custom of having more than one wife or husband at the same time.\" Polygamy has been practiced by many cultures throughout history. There are numerous examples of polygamy among close followers, devotees, and the faithful to God in the Old Testament, but it is generally not accepted by contemporary Christians. Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy and there are several Christian views on the Old Covenant. This debate focuses almost exclusively on polygyny (one man having more than one wife) and not polyandry (one woman having more than one husband).\n\nPolygyny is explicitly not forbidden in the Old Testament. The Torah includes a few specific regulations on the practice of polygyny, such as \"If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights\". states that a man must award the inheritance due to a first-born son to the son who was actually born first, even if he hates that son's mother and likes another wife more; and states that the king shall not have many wives. The king's behavior is condemned by the prophet Samuel in . Over 40 important figures had more than one wife, such as Esau, Elkanah, and Solomon. Moses had three wives; Zipporah, the daughter of Hobab and the \"Cushite\" woman, \n\nMultiple marriage was considered a realistic alternative in the case of famine, widowhood, or female infertility. The practice of levirate marriage obligated a man whose brother has left a widow without heir to marry her.\n\nPolyandry was explicitly forbidden. If a man slept with a woman married to another man, both were to be put to death for adultery. Under this law, if two men were married to one woman, all three would be subject to the death penalty. It is for this reason that all examples of polygamy in scripture involve polygyny, not polyandry, and in most Christian discussion the words \"polygamy\" and \"polygyny\" can be considered synonymous.\n\nPolygamy was a rare exception in post-exilic Israel. The practice began to be criticized and declined during the intertestamental period but there is some extant evidence of polygamy being practiced in the New Testament period. The Dead Sea Scrolls show that several smaller Jewish sects forbade polygamy before and during the time of Jesus. The Temple Scroll (11QT LVII 17–18) seems to prohibit polygamy.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Naftali Silberberg, in Jewish thought polygamy is not and never was the ideal state and that the Talmud or Midrash never mentions a polygamous family is completely clear that polygamy was never the norm. He also states that almost all polygamous relationships in the Bible are for specific reasons such as the wife was barren (Sarah, Leah, etc), monarchs marrying to cement relationships between tribes, and Laban tricking Jacob into marrying Leah.\n\nThree passages in the pastoral epistles (, and ) state that church leaders should be the \"husband of one wife.\" This has been read by some Christian sects as a prohibition of polygamy. Others argue that polygamy is allowed, but not for church leaders. Still others argue that the passage refers only to church leaders not divorcing their first wives. Walter Lock in his 1990 book argues it may simply refer to marital unfaithfulness since \"no Christian, whether an overseer or not, would have been allowed to practice polygamy.\" In Paul the Apostle states that a man is to have one wife and a woman is to have one husband. \"Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\"\n\nAlthough the New Testament is largely silent on the issue, some point to Jesus' repetition of the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife \"shall become one flesh.\" However, some look to Paul's writings to the Corinthians: \"Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh. Supporters of polygamy claim this indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than spiritual, union.\n\nMost Christian theologians argue that in and referring to Jesus explicitly states a man should have only one wife:\n\nPolygamists do not dispute that in marriage \"two shall be one flesh\", they only disagree with the idea that a married man can only be \"one flesh\" with one woman. Assuming the man is married, the fact that a man can even be \"one flesh\" with a harlot apparently does not negate his being \"one flesh\" with his wife. Further, if a man is married, he and his wife are \"one flesh.\" To add another wife would mean that the new wife becomes \"one flesh\" with the man \"and\" his current wife.\n\nMany critics of polygamy also point to the Pauline epistles that state that church officials should be respectable, above reproach, and the husband of a single wife. Hermeneutically, the Greek phrase \"mias gunaikos andra\" is an unusual Greek construction, capable of being translated in multiple ways, including (but not limited to): 1) \"one wife man,\" (prohibiting plural marriage) or 2) \"a wife man\" (requiring elders to be married) or 3) \"first wife man\" (prohibiting divorcés from ordination). Other interpretations include: Being faithful in relationships or restrained from chasing many women, so as to be characterized as a one-woman man; having been married only once (even if morally and legally released from the marriage bond by the death of the spouse). Some argue that definition 1 above implies acceptance of polygamy in the larger Christian culture, explaining Paul's explicit rejection of polygamy for elders. However, the qualifications for elders almost exclusively mirror the expectations for all Christians, including restrictions on drunkenness and instructions to manage one's household well.\n\nIn the time around Jesus' birth, polygamy (also called bigamy or digamy in texts) was understood to have had several spouses consecutively, as evidenced for example by Tertullian's work \"De Exhortatione Castitatis\" Saint Paul answered this problem by allowing widows to remarry (1 Cor. vii. 39. and 1 Tim 5:11–16). Paul says that only \"one man women\" older than 60 years can make the list of Christian widows, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin. Some conclude that by requiring leaders of the Church be \"one woman men,\" Saint Paul excluded remarried widowers from having influence. This would have been a more strict understanding of monogamy than Roman law codified, and would have been a new and unusual demand on men.\n\nOn this subject William Luck writes:\n\nJewish polygamy clashed with Roman monogamy at the time of the early church:\nTertullian, who lived at the turn of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, wrote that marriage is lawful, but polygamy is not: \nThe 3rd century Eusebius of Caesarea wrote the lost work \"On the Numerous Progeny of the Ancients\". Eusebius references this twice, in the \"Præparatio Evangelica\", and in the \"Demonstratio Evangelica\". Although his work has been given as an example of plural marriage being reconciled with the ascetic life, the problem dealt with was the contrast presented by the desire of the Patriarchs for numerous offspring and the honour in which continence was held by Christians.\n\nBasil of Caesarea wrote in the 4th century of plural marriage that \"such a state is no longer called marriage but polygamy or, indeed, a moderate fornication.\" He ordered that those who are engaged in it should be excommunicated for up to five years, and \"only after they have shown some fruitful repentance\" were they to be allowed back into the church. Moreover, he stated that the teachings against plural marriage are \"accepted as our usual practice, not from the canons but in conformity with our predecessors.\"\nAugustine wrote in the second half of the 4th century that\n\nSocrates of Constantinople wrote in the 5th century that the Roman Emperor Valentinian I took two wives and authorized his subjects to take two wives, supporting that Christians were then practicing plural marriage. There is no trace of such an edict in any of the extant Roman Laws. Valentinian I divorced his first wife according to John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale and John of Nikiu, before marrying his mistress, which was viewed as bigamy by Socrates, since the Church did not accept divorce.\n\nJustin Martyr, Irenaeus and Tertullian all spoke against polygamy, condemning it. Tertullian explicitly tackled the objection that polygamy was allowed for the patriarchs. He wrote, \"each pronouncement and arrangement is (the act) of one and the same God; who did then indeed, in the beginning, send forth a sowing of the race by an indulgent laxity granted to the reins of connubial alliances, until the world should be replenished, until the material of the new discipline should attain to forwardness: now, however, at the extreme boundaries of the times, has checked (the command) which He had sent out, and recalled the indulgence which He had granted\". (\"De Monogamia\" chapt. VI.) According to chapter XVI of \"De Monogamia\", Hermogenes thought it was allowed for a man to take several wives. Tertullian also made a direct attack on the polygamous practice of some cults in his work \"Adversus Hermogenem\". This is the same Hermogenes mentioned above. Tertullian writes that he was a sect leader, who mixed Stoic, Gnostic and Christian views to create a new religion.\n\nThe Church held a synod in Hertford, England, in 673 that was supervised by Archbishop Theodore. Chapter 10 issued by the synod declared that marriage is allowed between one man and one woman, and separation (but not divorce) is only granted in the case of adultery, but even then remarriage is not allowed.\n\nIn the medieval period, multiple wives were often obtained through kidnapping. It is with this in view that we must interpret the following laws: The Frankish Laws of 818–9 strictly forbade kidnapping of women. The XXVII. law issued by King Stephen I of Hungary (1000–1030) declares that the kidnapper must return the woman to her parents even if he has had sexual intercourse with her, and must pay a penalty to the parents. According to the Hungarian law, the kidnapped girl was then free to marry whomever.\n\nThe Roman councils of 1052 and 1063 suspended from communion those laymen who had a wife and a concubine at the same time. Divorce was also forbidden, and remarriage after a divorce counted as polygamy. Nicholas the Great (858–67) forbade Lothair II of Lotharingia to divorce his barren wife Teutberga and marry his concubine Waldrada, with whom he had several children. After a council of the Lotharingian bishops, as well as the archbishop of Köln and Trier had annulled his marriage to Theutberga, the pope voided this decision, and made him take his wife back.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the word for an official concubine was \"frille\". Norwegian Bishop Øystein Erlendsson (ca. 1120–1188) declared that concubines were not allowed to accept the sacraments unless they married, and men were forced to promise marriage to women they had lain with outside of wedlock. In 1280, the Norwegian king Eirik Magnusson (1280–99) declared that men were exempted from having to promise marriage to the frille if they went to confession and did penance. The Church answered by making several declarations in the 14th century, urging men to marry their concubines. In 1305, King Håkon V (1299–1319) issued a law that declared marriage to be the only lawful way of cohabitation, and declared that only women in wedlock were allowed to dress as they pleased, while the dress of concubines was restricted.\n\nWhen asked for an opinion on polygamy in 1526, Luther wrote, \"It is my earnest warning and counsel that Christians especially shall have no more than one wife, not only because it is a scandal, which a Christian should avoid most diligently, but also because there is no word of God here to show that God approves it in Christians... I must oppose it, especially in Christians, unless there be need, as for instance if the wife be a leper, or be taken away from the husband in some other way.\"\n\nMonogamy was the norm among Christians, However, in the context of the sickness of a wife preventing matrimonial intercourse, the founder of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther wrote: \"I confess that I cannot forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict the Scripture. If a man wishes to marry more than one wife he should be asked whether he is satisfied in his conscience that he may do so in accordance with the word of God. In such a case the civil authority has nothing to do in the matter.\"\n\nArthur Cushman McGiffert also states,\nLutheran theologians approved of Philip of Hesse's polygamous marriages to Christine of Saxony and Margarethe von der Saale for this purpose, as well as initial disapproval of divorce and adultery. As well as Phillip, there was much experimentation with marital duration within early German Lutheranism amongst clergy and their erstwhile wives.\nThe theologian Philipp Melanchthon likewise counseled that Henry VIII need not risk schism by dissolving his union with the established churches to grant himself divorces in order to replace his barren wives, but reluctantly, and with remorse afterward, consented that polygamy was an allowable alternative.\n\nAnabaptist leader Bernhard Rothmann initially opposed the idea of plural marriage. However, he later wrote a theological defense of plural marriage, and took nine wives himself, saying \"God has restored the true practice of holy matrimony amongst us.\" Franz von Waldeck and the other enemies of Anabaptist leader John of Leiden accused him of keeping 16 wives, and publicly beheading one when she disobeyed him. This was used as the basis for their conquest of Münster in 1535.\n\nThe 16th-century Italian Capuchin monk, Bernardino Ochino, 77 years old and never married, wrote the \"Thirty Dialogues\", wherein Dialog XXI was considered a defense of plural marriage. Evidently, he borrowed some of his strongest arguments from a Lutheran dialogue written in 1541 in favor of plural marriage which was written under the fictitious name \"Huldericus Necobulus\" in the interest of justifying Philip of Hesse.\n\nA different position was taken by the Council of Trent in 1563, which was opposed to polygyny and concubinage, If anyone says that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that it is not forbidden by any divine law (Matt. 19:4f): let him be anathema\". The polemicist John Milton expressed support for polygamy in his \"De doctrina christiana\".\n\nThe Lutheran pastor Johann Lyser strongly defended plural marriage in a work entitled \"Polygamia Triumphatrix\". As a result, he was imprisoned, beaten and exiled from Italy to the Netherlands. His book was burned by the public executioner. He never married nor desired wedlock. Samuel Friedrich Willenberg, a doctor of law at the University of Cracow wrote the pro-plural marriage book \"De finibus polygamiae licitae\". In 1715, his book was ordered to be burned. Friedrich escaped with his life, but was fined one hundred thousand gold pieces.\n\nOne of the more notable published works regarding the modern concept of Christian Plural Marriage dates from the 18th century. The book \"Thelyphthora\" was written by Martin Madan, a significant writer of hymns and a contemporary of John Wesley and Charles Wesley. Although Madan was an adherent only of polygyny in a Christian context, this particular volume set the foundation of what is considered the modern Christian Plural Marriage movement.\n\n2387 The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he has shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However polygamy is not in accord with the moral law.\" [Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God which was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive.\" The Christian who has previously lived in polygamy has a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in regard to his former wives and his children.\n\n2400 Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave offenses against the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible. The Lutheran Church in Liberia, however, does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of Holy Baptism. Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians.\n\nPolygamy was first discussed during the Lambeth Conference of 1888:\n\nA resolution dated 1958 and numbered 120 states that:\nbut adds:\n\nThe Twelfth Lambeth Conference held in 1988, in Resolution 26 - Church and Polygamy stated:\n\nThis Conference upholds monogamy as God's plan, and as the ideal relationship of love between husband and wife; nevertheless recommends that a polygamist who responds to the Gospel and wishes to join the Anglican Church may be baptized and confirmed with his believing wives and children on the following conditions:\n\n\nIn 2008 the Lambeth Conference noted:\n\nPolygamy (called \"plural marriage\" by Mormons in the 19th century or \"the Principle\" by modern fundamentalist practitioners) was taught by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890. On September 24, 1890, Wilford Woodruff, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at that time, issued the 1890 Manifesto, which advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada,> thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Although neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early 1900s. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation, in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Mormon fundamentalists dispute that Woodruff received any such revelation.\n\nInterviewed by \"Time\" magazine about his book, Michael Coogan said that, from a strict literalist view, fundamentalist Mormons are right about polygamy.\n\nWilliam Luck states that polygyny is not prohibited by the Bible and that it would have been required of a married man who seduced (Ex. 22) or raped (Deut. 22) a virgin, where her father did not veto a marriage.\n\nHowever, in a book-length consideration of the problem, William Blum argues that monogamy was always God's ideal. He points out that in every Old Testament example where polygynous families were described in any detail, family strife involving the plural wives is also described. He argues that the concept of two becoming one flesh makes polygamy a violation of God's plan for marriage.\n\nOn August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \"Nashville Statement\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief. Among other things, it states, \"We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Its aim is to promote the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences and the study of related epistemological problems. The Academy has its origins in the Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (\"Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes\"), founded in 1847 as a more closely supervised successor to the Accademia dei Lincei (\"Academy of Lynxes\") established in Rome in 1603 by the learned Roman Prince, Federico Cesi (1585–1630), who was a young botanist and naturalist, and which claimed Galileo Galilei as its president. The Accademia dei Lincei survives as a wholly separate institution.\n\nThe Academy of Sciences, one of the Pontifical academies at the Vatican in Rome, is headquartered in the Casina Pio IV in the heart of the Vatican Gardens.\nThe academy holds a membership roster of the most respected names in 20th century science, including such Nobel laureates as Ernest Rutherford, Max Planck, Otto Hahn, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Charles Hard Townes.\n\nCesi wanted his academicians to adhere to a research methodology based upon observation, experimentation, and the inductive method. He thus called his academy \"dei lincei\" because its members had \"eyes as sharp as lynxes,\" scrutinizing nature at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The leader of the first academy was the famous scientist Galileo Galilei.\n\nAcademy of Lynxes was dissolved after the death of its founder, but was re-created by Pope Pius IX in 1847 and given the name Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (\"Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes\"). It was later re-founded in 1936 by Pope Pius XI and given its current name. Pope Paul VI in 1976 and Pope John Paul II in 1986 subsequently updated its statutes.\n\nSince 1936, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences has been concerned both with investigating specific scientific subjects belonging to individual disciplines and with the promotion of interdisciplinary co-operation. It has progressively increased the number of its academicians and the international character of its membership. The Academy is an independent body within the Holy See and enjoys freedom of research. The statutes of 1976 express its goal: \"The Pontifical Academy of Sciences has as its goal the promotion of the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences, and the study of related epistemological questions and issues.\"\n\nSince the Academy and its membership is not influenced by factors of a national, political, or religious character it represents a valuable source of objective scientific information which is made available to the Holy See and to the international scientific community. Today the work of the Academy covers six main areas:\n\n\nThe disciplines involved are sub-divided into eight fields: the disciplines of physics and related disciplines; astronomy; chemistry; the earth and environmental sciences; the life sciences (botany, agronomy, zoology, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, the neurosciences, surgery); mathematics; the applied sciences; and the philosophy and history of sciences.\n\nPrincipal among the many publications produced by the Academy are:\n\nWith the goal of promoting scientific research, the Pius XI Medal is awarded by the Academy every two years to a young scientist who is under the age of 45 and shows exceptional promise. A few of the winners have also become members of the Academy.\n\nThe goals and hopes of the Academy were expressed by Pope Pius XI in the \"motu proprio \"In multis solaciis\"\" which brought about its re-foundation in 1936:\n\nForty years later (10 November 1979), John Paul II once again emphasized the role and goals of the Academy, on the 100th anniversary (centenary) of the birth of Albert Einstein:\n\nOn 8 November 2012 Pope Benedict XVI told members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences:\n\nThe new members of the Academy are elected by the body of Academicians and chosen from men and women of every race and religion based on the high scientific value of their activities and their high moral profile. They are then officially appointed by the Roman Pontiff. The Academy is governed by a President, appointed from its members by the Pope, who is helped by a scientific Council and by the Chancellor. Initially made up of 80 Academicians, 70 who were appointed for life. In 1986 John Paul II raised the number of members for life to 80, side by side with a limited number of Honorary Academicians chosen because they are highly qualified figures, and others who are Academicians because of the posts they hold, including: the Chancellor of the Academy, the Director of the Vatican Observatory, the Prefect of the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Prefect of the Vatican Secret Archives.\n\nThe president of the Academy is appointed from its members by the Pope. The current president is Joachim Von Braun, as of June 21, 2017. who takes over from Nobel laureate Werner Arber, who is a Nobel Prize Laureate and was the first Protestant to hold the position.\n\n\nDuring its various decades of activity, the Academy has had a number of Nobel Prize winners amongst its members, many of whom were appointed Academicians before they received this prestigious international award.\n\nOther eminent Academicians include Padre Agostino Gemelli (1878–1959), founder of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart and President of the Academy after its re-foundation until 1959, Mons. Georges Lemaître (1894–1966), one of the fathers of contemporary cosmology who held the office of President from 1960 to 1966, and Brazilian neuroscientist Carlos Chagas Filho.\n\n\n\n"}

The rulers of the region were known by their titles of “Khuttalan Shah” (king of Khuttal), “Khuttalan Khudah” (lord of Khuttal), and “Shir-i Khutallan” (lion of Khuttal). The capital and residence of the rulers was in Hulbuk, close to the city of Kulob.\n\nKhuttal, along with other regions, was originally under Hephthalite rule, but as the Hephthalite kingdom began to weaken, local dynasties in Khuttal, Chaghaniyan, and other regions, began to assert their rule over them. In ca. 676, Sa'id ibn 'Uthman, the Umayyad Arab governor of Khurasan, managed to make the principality of Khuttal acknowledge Muslim authority. However, this did not effect actual Arab rule over Khuttal and the principality remained independent. In ca. 699, a Khuttalan pretender who was the paternal cousin of the Khuttalan king, known in Arabic sources as al-Sabal, fled to the Arab general al-Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah, and urged him to invade the principality. The latter agreed, provided the pretender with an army to invade the region, and sent another army under his son Yazid ibn al-Muhallab. However, al-Sabal managed to make a surprise attack on the Khuttalan pretender, and had him executed at his fortress. Yazid shortly after besieged the fortress, but made peace with al-Sabal in return for a ransom of money. In 727, another Arab general, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, invaded Khuttal, but al-Sabal called upon the Turkic Turgesh for aid, who, under their \"khagan\" Suluk, won a decisive victory over Asad in the so-called \"Day of Thirst\".\n\nAl-Sabal, shortly before his death, appointed a Khuttalan nobleman known in Arabic sources as Ibn al-Sa'iji as the regent of his principality until his son, known in Arabic sources as al-Hanash, and in Chinese sources as Lo-kin-tsie, who had fled to China, returned to Khuttal. Ibn al-Sa'iji is mentioned in supporting and having made an alliance with the Arab military leader al-Harith ibn Surayj during his rebellion in Khurasan, but the two soon quarrelled and Harith withdrew with his followers into Tokharistan. Because of this, in 737 Asad, once more governor of Khurasan, carried out another invasion of Khuttal, which made Ibn al-Sa'iji, like his predecessor, call upon the Turgesh for aid. The \"khagan\" Suluk, at the head of an army numbering 50,000 men, attacked Asad, and inflicted a heavy defeat on him (30 September 737). However, later in the same year, Asad managed to inflict a heavy defeat on Suluk, who barely escaped capture and was forced to retire north to his lands. There he was soon after murdered by his rivals, leading to the collapse of Turgesh power amid civil war. In the aftermath of the battle, a certain prince named Badr Tarkhan, who may have been the ruler of Bamiyan, conquered Khuttal. Thereupon Asad invaded Khuttal and forced the principality to acknowledge Umayyad authority.\n\nIn 750, the Umayyad Caliphate fell, and was replaced by the Abbasid Caliphate, who, under their general Abu Muslim Khorasani, sent Abu Dawud Khalid ibn Ibrahim, the governor of Balkh, to invade the region and bring it under direct Abbasid rule. When Abu Dawud invaded Khuttal, its ruler, known in Arabic sources as Hanash ibn al-Subul (also called Hubaysh ibn al-Shibl) did not resist the invasion, but the \"dehqans\" of Khuttal forcibly detained him and carried him to a fortress in order to fight Abu Dawud. Nevertheless, Abu Dawud managed to make Hanash and his \"dehqans\" leave the fortress. Hanash shortly fled to the court of the Turks, and then to the Chinese court, while Abu Dawud consolidated Abbasid rule in Khuttal, marking the end of the principality.\n\n\n"}

Its three rented houses and one apartment are home to 15 resident-organizers, who plan public programs such as Shabbat dinners and Jewish movie nights. In-house events are always free, though occasionally a donation jar is made available for those who wish to contribute. The Kibbutz's ideology isn't communistic; it's not a true commune but simply an example of cohousing. The Pacific Northwest contains many cohousing communities and a wide variety of Jewish organizations, but thus far the region has no other Jewish cohousing community.\n\nHouse Aleph, the original Kibbutz house, is supported in part by the Moishe House program, which offers financial and other resources to young Jews interested in hosting a certain number of public events per month. Houses Bet and Gimel are unaffiliated with Moishe House and play host to events like a monthly open-mic nights, film screenings, yoga classes, storytelling events, meditation sessions, and more.\n\nResident-organizers range from secular to Modern Orthodox in their religious views and vary also in their Jewish practices. Several keep kosher, while others do not, and only some are shomer Shabbat. Nonetheless, all Kibbutz households maintain kosher (dairy) dishes, silverware, and other kitchen implements in addition to \"treyf\" plates and utensils that may be used to prepare non-kosher food.\n\nThe Kibbutz was founded in the fall of 2007 by Joel Rothschild, Masha Shtern, and Tamar Libicki; Azura Newman and Lincoln Rose were also original members. The community's first official event was a potluck dinner in October of that year. In founding the Kibbutz, Rothschild hoped to recreate aspects of his positive experience as a member of Kosher Co-op, part of the Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA) at Oberlin College. Current resident-organizer Neal Schindler also attended Oberlin and was in OSCA.\n\nThe Kibbutz acquired its second house, nicknamed Bet, in January 2009; a third house, Gimel, was added in June 2009, expanding the number of resident-organizers to 16.

{"id": "26161649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26161649", "title": "Sanctuary of the Three Gauls", "text": "Sanctuary of the Three Gauls\n\nThe Sanctuary of the Three Gauls \"(Tres Galliae)\" was the focal structure within an administrative and religious complex established by Rome in the very late 1st century BC at Lugdunum (the site of modern Lyon in France). Its institution served to federalise and Romanise Gallia Comata as an Imperial province under Augustus, following the Gallic Wars of his predecessor Julius Caesar. The distinctively Gallo-Roman development of the Imperial sanctuary and its surrounding complex are well attested by literary, epigraphic, numismatic and archaeological evidence.\n\nThe Imperial cult sanctuary at Lugdunum was the earliest and most important institution of its kind in the Western Roman empire. Its establishment at the junction of three new Imperial provinces, later collectively known as Tres Galliae (the Three Gauls), embodied a policy of integrated military, civil and religious settlement among the unstable Western provinces of the newly established Principate. It was founded by Drusus in rapid response to a rebellion provoked by the census of Gallia Comata (\"long-haired\" Gaul) in 12 BC.\n\nLugdunum provided a centralised, permanent base for the Imperial governorships of Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Belgica and Gallia Lugdunensis, and an annual, Roman-style \"concilium\" (council) for their provincial elites, based on existing Gallic political and religious practices. The monumentally lavish and comprehensively Roman development of the Sanctuary and its associated buildings provided a context for the acculturation of a new Romano-Gallic polity under the \"pax Romana\", in which the Roman military maintained a relatively discreet local presence.\n\nAs stepson to Augustus, Drusus represented the Imperial family and as provincial governor, he was also augur. The inaugural day of the sanctuary – August 1 of either 10 BC or 12 BC – was important to both Romans and Gauls. August – formerly \"Sextilis\" in the Roman calendar – had been renamed in honour of Augustus, and its kalends (the first day of the month) was particularly auspicious as the anniversary of his victory at Alexandria. In the Gallo-celtic calendar, the same day was sacred to the sun-god Lugh, who may have been venerated on the Fourvière hill at Lugdunum, though no temple has been found. As a sun-god, Lugh could be identified with Roman Sol, Apollo and the Augustan-Stoic concept of the Imperial \"saviour\" as the \"second sun\". A foundation (or an inauguration) in 12 BC would have coincided with Augustus' assumption of office as \"pontifex maximus\". The \"ara\" (altar) was dedicated to \"Dea Roma\" and Augustus and its first high priest \"(sacerdos)\" was Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus, a Gaul of the Aeduan elite. His name indicates his Roman citizenship and Gallic origins - his election to Imperial priesthood may confirm a preference based on his personal standing and that of his \"civitas\" as \"fratres\" (\"brothers\", or allies) of Rome.\n\nDrusus invited 60 aristocratic delegates to the opening ceremony as representatives of the \"Three Gauls\". These are presumed to be the first members of the official \"concilium Galliarum\". The office of \"sacerdos\" required Roman citizenship but the early \"concilium\" combined citizen and non-citizens. The \"sacredos\" would have been a person of great consequence within the \"concilium Galliarum\" and his own provincial \"ordo\". His influence would have extended well beyond his term of office, which was - unlike the lifetime priesthoods of Rome itself - limited to a single year. In effect, the priesthood provided an important step in the provincial \"cursus honorum\".\n\nThe \"concilia\" at Lugdunum were also displays of loyalty and Romanisation, which involved the renewal of vows through priestly sacrifice at the \"ara\", feasting, games (\"ludi\"), contests of eloquence and poetry. This calendrical gathering was accommodated by the building of a small amphitheatre, which was later much expanded. Lugdunum was also the site of a major Imperial mint, whose coinage provides a principal source of evidence for the form and development of the altar. The security requirement of the mint has been presumed to account for the presence of Lugdunum's single military cohort.\n\nFollowing his defeat of Clodius Albinus and his allies at Lugdunum, Septimius Severus re-founded and reformed its Imperial cult centre as an instrument of suppression and autocracy. The image of dea Roma was removed from the ara and confined to the temple, along with the images of the living and deceased Augusti – a combination unique in the Western Empire. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites of Septimius as those offered a Roman paterfamilias by his slaves. This development took place shortly after 198/9 AD. Its duration and subsequent developments are unknown.\n\nThe sanctuary was located on the hillside of la Croix-Rousse. The first and main altar can be reconstructed from texts and currency depictions. The geographer Strabo described it in context: \"[Lugdunum] is the most populous of all the cities of Celtica except Narbo; for not only do people use it as an emporium, but the Roman governors coin their money there, both the silver and the gold. Again, the temple that was dedicated to Caesar Augustus by all the Galatae in common is situated in front of this city at the junction of the rivers. And in it is a noteworthy altar, bearing an inscription of the names of the tribes, sixty in number; and also images from these tribes, one from each tribe, and also another large altar.\"\n\nFishwick suggests that the images (bronze statues) and inscriptions of Strabo's account are stylistically Greek additions to the \"ara\" some time after its inauguration. The monumental altar and its 50-meter base were made in marble. It was flanked by two winged victories of gilt bronze, holding palms and gold crowns, standing on ionic capitals, set on columns assumed to be the later source for the four pillars of the transept crossing of the basilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, which support the dome. These were made from two longer pillars of Egyptian syenite, recovered in the 11th century and sawn in half. The open altar appears to have been rebuilt (or adapted) as a covered temple in 121 AD, in the reign of Hadrian. The larger altar was the focus of cult to the genius of the living emperor and dea Roma. The temple was dedicated to the cult of deceased Imperial \"divi\", and major Roman and local deities.\n\nThis sanctuary was also the find-spot for the Lyon Tablet, a bronze plaque of 2.5 by 1.93 m on which is engraved Claudius's 48 AD speech making Gallic chieftains eligible for Roman magistracies and membership of the Roman Senate – a version of the speech also survives in Tacitus. It was found by a draper in 1528, in his vineyard on the site of the sanctuary, and is now held in the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon.\n"}

Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy within an overall confessionalist framework; as a form of consociationalism, the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities.\n\nHowever, increasing numbers of Lebanese organize against this confessionalist system and for an installation of laïcité in the national government.\n\nIn April 2010, Laïque Pride, a secular group co-founded by feminist Yalda Younes, called for “an end to the country's deep-rooted sectarian system” and for a “secular Lebanon.” Laïque Pride supports the enacting of a unified Civil Code for the Personal Status Law.\n\nAt a march in May 2012 in which 600 participated, Laïque Pride issued demands, four concerning women’s rights and two concerning media freedom. Secular student clubs from Saint Joseph University (USJ), the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA), as the American University of Beirut (AUB) also participated in the march.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, in response to Hizb ut-Tahrir's growing appeal in Beirut and demands to re-establish an Islamic caliphate, a Laïque Pride march was held in Beirut. Three days later, 70,000 gathered Martyrs’ Square in Beirut in a march organized by Laïque Pride.\n\nIn 2011, hundreds of protesters rallied in Beirut on 27 February in a march referred to as \"The Laique pride\", calling for reform of the country's confessional political system. At the same time, a peaceful sit-in took place in Saida.\n\nStudent organizations have paid a key role in secular movements in Lebanon, particularly those at the American University of Beirut.\n\nOne such secular origination is the Secular Club, a progressive student organization established after the 2008 conflict. According to former club president Joumana Talhouk, the goal of the club is “to create a political space where people from different social and sectarian backgrounds can unite under common principles.”\n\nAnother organization is the far-left Red Oak Club. According to former president Theresa Sahyoun, the Red Oak Club and the Secular Club managed to find “common ground” and endorse the August 2016 Martyrs’ Square protest organized by Laïque Pride (“Secular Pride”).\n"}

There are 51 or 108 Shakti peethas by various accounts, of which between 4 and 18 are named as \"Maha\" (major) in medieval Hindu texts. Most of these historic places of goddess worship are in India, but some are in Nepal, Bangladesh, and one each in Tibet (Mansarovar), Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nVarious legends explain how the Shakti Peetha came into existence. The most popular is based on the story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati's body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 52 body parts, using his Sudarshana Chakra, which fell on Earth to become sacred sites where all the people can pay homage to the Goddess. To complete this massively long task, Lord Shiva took the form of Bhairava.\n\nLord Brahma performed a \"yajna\" (Vedic ritual of fire sacrifice) to please Shakti and Shiva. Goddess Shakti emerged, separating from Shiva and helped Brahma in the creation of the universe. Brahma decided to give Shakti back to Shiva. Therefore, his son Daksha performed several yagnas to obtain Shakti as his daughter in the form of Sati. It was then decided that Sati was brought into this world with the motive of getting married to Shiva.\n\nHowever, due to Lord Shiva's curse to Brahma that his fifth head was cut off due to his lie in front of Shiva, Daksha started hating Lord Shiva and decided not to let Lord Shiva and Sati get married. \n\nHowever, Sati got attracted to Shiva and finally one day Shiva and Sati got married. This marriage only increased Daksha's hatred towards Lord Shiva.\n\nDaksha performed a \"yagna\" with a desire to take revenge on Lord Shiva. Daksha invited all the deities to the \"yajna\" except Lord Shiva and Sati. The fact that she was not invited did not deter Sati from attending the \"yagna\". She expressed her desire to attend the \"yagna\" to Shiva, who tried his best to dissuade her from going. Shiva eventually relented and Sati went to the \"yagna\". Sati, being an uninvited guest, was not given any respect at the \"yagna\". Furthermore, Daksha insulted Shiva. Sati was unable to bear her father's insults toward her husband, so she immolated herself.\n\nEnraged at the insult and the injury, Shiva in his Virabhadra avatar destroyed Daksha's \"yagna\", cut off Daksha's head, and later replaced it with that of a male goat as he restored him to life.Virabhadra didn't stop fighting; he kept raging with anger. Gods prayed to lord Vishnu. He came there and started fighting him. Still immersed in grief, Shiva picked up the remains of Sati's body, and performed the Tandava, the celestial dance of destruction, across all creation. The other Gods requested Vishnu to intervene to stop this destruction, towards which Vishnu used the Sudarshana Chakra, which cut through Sati's corpse. The various parts of the body fell at several spots all through the Indian subcontinent and formed sites which are known as \"Shakti Peethas\" today.\n\nAt all the \"Shakti Peethas\", the Goddess Shakti is accompanied by her consort, Lord Bhairava (a manifestation of Lord Shiva).\nShakti is an aspect of the Supreme Being Adi parashakti, the mother of the trimurti, the holy trinity in Hindu religion & scriptures.\n\nThe history of Daksha yajna and Sati's self-immolation had immense significance in shaping the ancient Sanskrit literature and even influenced the culture of India. It led to the development of the concept of Shakti Peethas and thereby strengthened Shaktism. Enormous numbers of stories in the Puranas and other Hindu religious books took the Daksha yagna as the reason for their origin. It is an important incident in Shaivism, resulting in the emergence of Parvati in the place of Sati Devi and making Shiva a grihastashrami (house holder), leading to the origin of Ganesha and Kartikeya.\n\nShakti Peethas are shrines or divine places of the Mother Goddess. These are places that are believed to have been blessed with the presence of Shakti due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each temple has shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava, and most Shakti and Kalabhairava in different Shakti Peeth have different names.\n\nSome of the great religious texts like the Shiva Purana, the Devi Bhagavata, the Kalika Purana and the AstaShakti recognize four major Shakti Peethas (centers), like Bimala (Pada Khanda) (inside the Jagannath Temple of Puri, Odisha), Tara Tarini (Sthana Khanda, Purnagiri, Breasts) (Near Berhampur, Odisha), Kamakhya Temple (Yoni Khanda) (Near Guwahati, Assam) and Dakshina Kalika (Mukha Khanda) (Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the parts of the corpse of Mata Sati in the Satya Yuga.\n\nThe Ashtashakti and Kalika Purana says (in Sanskrit):\n\nFurther explaining the importance of these four Pithas, the \"Brihat Samhita\" also gives the location of these Pithas as (in Sanskrit)\n\nIn the listings below:\nApart from these 4 there are 51 other famous Peethas recognized by religious texts. According to the \"Pithanirnaya Tantra\" the 51 peethas are scattered all over present day countries of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Pakistan. The \"Shivacharita\" besides listing 51 maha-peethas, speaks about 26 more upa-peethas. The Bengali almanac, Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika too describes the 51 peethas including the present modified addresses. A few of the several accepted listings are given below. One of the few in South India, Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh became the site for a 2nd-century temple.\n\nIn the listings below:\n\nFirst relating to Brahmanda Purana, one of the major eighteen Puranas, it mentions 64 Shakthi Peetha of Goddess Parvati in the Bharat or Greater India including present day India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, some parts of Southern Tibet and parts of southern Pakistan. Another text which gives a listing of these shrines, is the \"Shakthi Peetha Stotram\", written by Adi Shankara, the 9th-century Hindu philosopher.\n\nAccording to the manuscript \"Mahapithapurana\" (c. 1690 – 1720 CE), there are 52 such places. Among them, 23 are located in the Bengal region, 14 of these are located in what is now West Bengal, India, 1 in Baster (Chhattisgarh), while 7 are in what is now Bangladesh.\n\nRishi Markandeya composed the 'Devi Saptashati' or the seven hundred hymns extolling the virtues of the Divine Goddess at the shaktipeetha in Nashik. The idol is also leaning a little to the left to listen to the sages composition. The Saptashati or the \"Durga Stuti\" forms an integral part in the vedic form of Shakti worship.\n\nThe third eye of Mata Sati fell below a tree in a mortuary in the Ishan corner of Vakreshwar. This is on the bank of the north flowing Dwarka river in the east of Baidyanath. Here Mata Sati is called Chandi Bhagwai Ugra Tara and Bhairav is called Chandrachur. This Shaktipeeth is called Tarapith in Birbhum district West bengal, India.\n\nThe modern cities or towns that correspond to these 64 locations can be a matter of dispute, but there are a few that are totally unambiguous, these are mentioned in the \"Ashta Dasa Shakthi Peetha Stotram\" by Adi Shankara. This list contains 18 such locations which are often referred to as \"Maha Shakthi Peeths\".\n\n[*]Sharada Peeth: This temple is currently non-existent*. Only ruins are found in these places. Its ruins are near the Line of Control (LOC) between the Indian and Pakistani-controlled portions of the former princely state of Kashmir and Jammu. Instead, Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Sringeri in Karnataka even though not a Shakthi Peetha, is this aspect of the goddess. Requests have been made by the Hindu community in Pakistan to the Pakistani government to renovate the temple, the issue being raised by former Indian Home minister L. K. Advani to the Pakistan authorities as a confidence-building measure, by increasing the people to people cross-border interaction.\n\nAmong these, the Shakthi Peethas at Kamakhya, Gaya and Ujjain are regarded as the most sacred as they symbolise the three most important aspects of the Mother Goddess viz. Creation (Kamarupa Devi), Nourishment (Sarvamangala Devi/Mangalagauri) and Annihilation (Mahakali Devi).\n\nWhen observed carefully one can see that they lie in a perfect straight line from Kamakhya to Ujjain via Gaya, symbolizing that every creation in this universe will annihilate one day without fail. With concepts like Hinduism and Ecology gaining importance, the geographical features of these temples are gaining importance.\n\nAs per Sankara Samhita of Sri Skanda Purana,\n\nDevanāgarī :\n\nलङ्कायाम् शांकरीदेवी कामाक्षी काञ्चिकापुरे। \nप्रद्युम्ने शृङ्खला देवी चामुण्दा क्रौञ्चपट्टणे॥\nअलम्पुरे जोगुलाम्ब श्रीशैले भ्रमराम्बिक।\nकोल्हापुरमहलक्ष्मी माहुर्यमेकवीरिका॥\nउज्जयिन्याम् महाकाळी पीठिकायाम् पुरुहुतिका। \nओड्ढ्यायाम् गिरिजादेवी माणिक्या दक्षवाटिके॥\nहरिक्षेत्रे कामरूपी प्रयागे माधवेश्वरी।\nज्वालायाम् वैष्णवीदेवी गयामाङ्गल्यगौरिके॥\nवारणास्याम् विशालाक्षी काश्मीरेतु सरस्वती।\nअष्ठादशैवपीठानि योनिनामप दुर्लभानिच॥\nसायंकालं पठेन्नित्यम् सर्वरोगनिवारणम्।\nसर्वपापहरम् दिव्यम् सर्वसम्पत्करम् शुभम्॥\n\nIAST:\n\nlaṅkāyām śāṃkarīdevī kāmākṣī kāñcikāpure।\npradyumne śṛṅkhalā devī cāmuṇdā krauñcapaṭṭaṇe॥\nalampure jogulāmba śrīśaile bhramarāmbika।\nkolhāpuramahalakṣmī māhuryamekavīrikā॥\nujjayinyām mahākāḻī pīṭhikāyām puruhutikā।\noḍḍhyāyām girijādevī māṇikyā dakṣavāṭike॥\nharikṣetre kāmarūpī prayāge mādhaveśvarī।\njvālāyām vaiṣṇavīdevī gayāmāṅgalyagaurike॥\nvāraṇāsyām viśālākṣī kāśmīretu sarasvatī।\naṣṭhādaśaivapīṭhāni yonināmapa durlabhānica॥\nsāyaṃkālaṃ paṭhennityam sarvaroganivāraṇam।\nsarvapāpaharam divyam sarvasampatkaram śubham॥\n\nGoddess Shankari in Sri Lanka, Kamakshi in Kanchipuram\nGoddess Shrinkhala in Pradymna and Chamunda in Mysore\n\nGoddess Jogulamba in Alampur, Goddess Brhamarambika in Sri Shailam\nGoddess Maha Lakshmi in Kolhapur and Goddess Eka Veera in Mahur\n\nGoddess Maha Kali in Ujjain, Purhuthika in Peethika\nGoddess Girija in Odhyana and Manikya in the house of Daksha\n\nGoddess Kama Rupi in the temple of Vishnu, Madhaveshwari in Allahabad\nGoddess giving flame in Jwala Mukhi and Mangala Gowri in Gaya\n\nGoddess Vishalakshi in Varanasi, Saraswati in Kashmir\nThese are the 18 houses of Shakthi, which are rare even to the Devas\n\nWhen chanted every evening, all the enemies would get destroyed\nall the diseases would vanish, and prosperity would be showered.\n\nThere is some wrong Information given about Shakti peeth.

{"id": "192516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192516", "title": "Shirk (Islam)", "text": "Shirk (Islam)\n\nIn Islam, shirk ( \"širk\") is the sin of practicing idolatry or polytheism, i.e. the deification or worship of anyone or anything besides the singular God, i.e. Allah. Literally, it means ascribing or the establishment of \"partners\" placed beside God. It is the vice that is opposed to the virtue of \"Tawhid\" (monotheism). Those who practice shirk are termed \"mushrikun\". \"Mushrikun\" (pl. of \"mushrik\") are those who practice \"shirk\", which literally means \"association\" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims - Allah (as God's \"associates\"). In Islamic law shirk as a crime, can just be attributed to Muslims, since only a Muslim is legally responsible not to associate any partner to Allah.\n\nWithin Islam, \"shirk\" is an unforgivable crime if it remains unpardoned before death: Allah may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing \"shirk\".\n\nThe word \"širk\" comes from the Arabic root Š-R-K (), with the general meaning of \"to share\".\nIn the context of the Quran, the particular sense of \"sharing as an equal partner\" is usually understood, so that polytheism means \"attributing a partner to Allah\". In the Qur'an, \"shirk\" and the related word \"mušrikūn\" (مشركون)—those who commit shirk and plot against Islam—often refer to the enemies of Islam (as in verse 9.1–15).\n\nIslamic commentators on the Quran have emphasized that pre-Islamic Arabic idolatry made a number of godlings (most memorably the three goddesses al-Manāt, al-lāt and ʻUzzā) equal associates of Allah (as the Qur'an discusses in the 53rd surat) and the word \"mushrikūn\" (singular: \"mushrik\") is often translated into English as \"polytheists\".\n\nThe Quran and what the people of Nuh's community would say in an effort by the idolaters to ignore and mock Nuh. \"They (idolaters) have said: \"You shall not leave your gods nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq nor Nasr.\" (Qur'an 71:23)\n\nOther forms of \"shirk\" include the worship of wealth and other material objects. This is pointed out in the Qur'an in one of the stories of the Children of Israel, when they took a calf made of gold for worship, and for which Moses ordered them to repent.\n\nAnother form of shirk mentioned in the Qur'an is to take scholars of religion, monks, divines, or religious lawyers as Lord(s) in practice by following their doctrines, and/or by following their rulings on what is lawful when it is at variance to the law or doctrines prescribed by Allah's revelation.\n\nMedieval Muslim (as well as Jewish) philosophers identified belief in the Trinity with the heresy of \"shirk\", in Arabic, (or \"shituf\" in Hebrew), meaning \"associationism\", in limiting the infinity of God by associating his divinity with physical existence.\n\nIn a theological context one commits \"shirk\" by associating some lesser being with Allah. This sin is committed if one imagines that there is a partner with \"Allah\" whom it is suitable to worship. It is stated in the Quran: \"Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases, to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin most heinous indeed\" (Qur'an 4:48). Many Islamic theologians extend the sense of worship to include praying to some other being to intercede with Allah on one's behalf, rather than taking one's case to God Himself. The limits of the concept of worship are quite elastic and theologians often describe excessive veneration of some artifact here on earth as \"shirk\".\n\nAtheism is described as \"shirk\" because it denies the position of \"Allah\" as the unique creator and sustainer of the universe (\"tawhid ar-rububiyya\", the Unity of Lordship) and muslims who declare that they are atheists are being punished in Muslim countries. In the same way, the act of \"shirk\" is extended to include such things as the notion that God possesses human-like anthropomorphic qualities as well as acts of worship or piety whose inward goal is pride, caprice, or a desire for public admiration, although public prayer is a core Islamic aspect of faith, encouraged and supported in the Quran.\n\nThe status of the People of the Book (\"ahl al-kitab\"), particularly Jews and Christians, with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is not clearcut. Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with \"kufr\" for rejecting Muhammad's message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God's unity. The Quranic verse 5:73 (\"Certainly they disbelieve [\"kafara\"] who say: God is the third of three\"), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine, though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations. Other Quranic verses strongly deny the deity of Jesus Christ, son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will be doomed to eternal punishment in Hell. Quran also does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel. Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church.\n\nCyril Glasse criticizes the use of \"kafirun\" [pl. of \"kafir\"] to describe Christians as \"loose usage\". According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, \"ahl al-kitab\" are \"usually regarded more leniently than other \"kuffar\" [pl. of \"kafir\"]...\" and \"in theory\" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian: \"Thou unbeliever\".\n\nHistorically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as \"dhimmi\", while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as \"musta'min\".\n\n\"Shirk\" is defined in various ways. Some argue that there is only one type of \"shirk\".\nMuhammad has classified \"shirk\" into two categories:\n\nGreater \"shirk\" or \"Shirke-al-Akbar\" means open polytheism. Muhammad describes major \"shirk\" in two forms:\n\nOther interpretations also derived from the Qur'an and the prophetic tradition (Sunnah) divide \"shirk\" into three main categories. \"Shirk\" can be committed by acting against the three different categories.\n\nThis category of \"shirk\" refers to either the belief that others share Allah's Lordship over creation as His equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no Lord over creation at all.\n\n\"Shirk\" in this category includes both the non-believer practices of giving Allah the attributes of his creation as well as the act of giving created beings Allah's names and attributes.\n\nIn this category of \"shirk\", acts of worship are directed to others besides Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the creation instead of the Creator. As in the case of the previous categories, \"shirk\" in \"al-'Ibadah\" has two main aspects.\n\nThis form of \"shirk\" occurs when any act of worship is directed to someone else besides Allah. It represents the most obvious form of idolatry, against which the prophets were specifically sent by Allah, calling the masses of mankind to give it up. Examples of this \"shirk\" are asking for forgiveness, admittance to paradise, etc. that only Allah can provide, from others besides Allah.\n\nLesser \"shirk\" or \"Shirke-e-Asghar\" means hidden polytheism. A person commits hidden polytheism when he professes \"tawhid\" (there is no god except Allah) but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief.\n\nMahmud ibn Lubayd reported, \"Allah's messenger said: 'The thing I fear for you the most is ash-Shirk al-Asghar.'\"\n\nMahmud ibn Lubayd also said, \"The Prophet came out and announced, 'O people, beware of secret Shirk!'\"\n\nUmar Ibn Al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: \"Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed an act of kufr or shirk.\" (graded \"hasan\" by Al-Tirmidhi and \"saheeh\" by Al-Hakim)\n\nIbn Mas’ood, one of Muhammad’s companions, said: \"That I should swear by Allah upon a lie is more preferable to me than that I should swear by another upon the truth.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "85718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85718", "title": "Thesan", "text": "Thesan\n\nIn Etruscan mythology, Thesan was the Etruscan Goddess of the dawn, divination and childbirth (as well as a love-goddess) and was associated with the generation of life. She was identified with the Roman Aurora and Greek Eos.\n\nThesan was depicted on several Etruscan mirror backs, bearing a great pair of wings on her back like many other Etruscan goddesses, especially appropriate to a sky-goddess. One meaning of Her name is simply “Dawn”, and related words are \"thesi\", meaning “illumination”, and \"thesviti\", “clear or famous”. The other meaning of her name connects her with the ability to see the future, for \"thesan\" also means \"divination\", as seen in the related Etruscan word \"thesanthei\", “divining”, “illuminating”, or “brilliant”. This relates to Her function as a dawn goddess – since divination throws light on the dark future and enables one to see what may happen, like the dawn, which illuminates what was previously dark. She was called by some as a childbirth goddess, as she was present at the beginning of the day, which finds its parallel in the beginning of a new baby's life. Similar to the Roman goddess Lucina, goddess of Light and Childbirth, who brought the infant into the light of day.\n\nThe Etruscans identified their Thesan with the Greek dawn goddess Eos. In the Greek legend, Aphrodite had found Eos in bed with her lover Ares; to punish Eos She “cursed” her with an insatiable taste for mortal youths, and Eos became infamous for her many young lovers. The Etruscans seemed to quite like these stories and easily transferred them to their dawn goddess Thesan; the stories depicted on the mirrors are generally straight out of Greek myth.\n\nOn one relief mirror back (kind of a rarity in Etruscan mirrors since the decoration on the back is almost always engraved rather than cast), Thesan is shown in the act of abducting Cephalus, a young man of Athens who was married to the King Erechtheus’ daughter, Procris. Thesan is winged here, wearing a chiton and diagonal himation that flows in the breeze; about her head is a halo, to emphasize her function as Light-Goddess. She runs off to the left carrying Cephalus in her arms, who is shown as nude and much smaller than she is. He does not look at all distressed at the situation and he rests in her arms with his right hand on her shoulder. Like many depictions of Etruscan women and their lovers, she is shown as larger and therefore more important or powerful than the man: This has been taken as an indication of the high status of Etruscan women.\n\nThe same scene is depicted on a mirror handle in high relief openwork; Cephalus is again quite a lot smaller (and younger) than Thesan, who is not winged this time, but whose cloak billows behind her in the breeze. She smiles down at young Kephalos as She lifts him up, and he is nude save for a short cloak and hunting boots.\n\nAnother favorite scene of Thesan/Eos depicts a far more somber affair. When her son Memnon (by Tithonus, another young man she abducted to be her lover, called \"Thinthun\" by the Etruscans) was killed in the Trojan War, Eos grieved so terribly that she threatened never to bring forth the dawn again. She was finally persuaded to return, but in Her grief she weeps tears of dew every morning for Her beloved son. One mirror-back shows Her before Tinia (Zeus) with \"Thethis\" (Thetis), the mother of Achilles. Both Goddesses plead with Tinia to spare their sons’ lives; but both were already doomed to die. The relief mirror mentioned above has been interpreted by some as showing Thesan carrying off the body of her dead son Memnon (who the Etruscans called \"Memrun\"). (Different interpretations possible for this mirror, since the figures are not labelled, whereas most Etruscan mirrors with figures do have names engraved beside them.)\n\nThe Liber Lintaeus connects this goddess Thesan with the Etruscan sun-deity Usil, equivalent of the Greek Helios, while a fourth century mirror now shows her in conversation with both Usil and Nethuns (the latter, the Etruscan Neptune / Poseidon).\n\nLike more than a few Etruscan Goddesses, she seems to have survived into Tuscan folklore at least until the 19th century as a spirit called “Tesana”. She was said to visit mortals as they dreamt, in the time when the sun is rising but before the sleeper had yet awakened. She was believed to bring words of encouragement and comfort, and Her presence in a dream gave good fortune and blessings for the day.\n\n"}
{"id": "938911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938911", "title": "Unclean animal", "text": "Unclean animal\n\nIn some religions, an unclean animal is an animal whose consumption or handling is taboo. According to these religions, persons who handle such animals may need to ritually purify themselves to get rid of their uncleanliness.\n\nIn Judaism, the concept of \"impure animals\", plays a prominent role in the Kashrut, the part of Jewish law that specifies which foods are allowed (\"kosher\") or forbidden to Jews. These laws are based upon the Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy of the Torah and in the extensive body of rabbinical commentaries (the Talmud). The concept of unclean animals is also mentioned in the Book of Genesis, when Noah is instructed to bring into the Ark all sorts \"of pure beasts, and of beasts that are impure, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth\".\n\nIn the Torah, some animals are explicitly named as pure or impure, while others are classified by anatomical characteristics or other criteria. In some cases, there is some doubt as to the precise meaning of the Biblical Hebrew animal name.\n\nAccording to Jewish dietary laws, to be \"pure\" an animal must also be free from certain defects, and must be slaughtered and cleaned according to specific regulations (\"Shechita\"). Any product of an impure or improperly slaughtered animal is also non-kosher. Animal gelatin, for example, has been avoided, although recently kosher gelatin (from cows or from fish prepared according to kosher regulations) has become available. (The status of shellac is controversial.) The prohibitions also extend to certain parts of pure animals, such as blood, certain fat tissues, and the sciatic nerves. Finally, it is forbidden to cook the meat of an animal in the milk or dairy product of that same animal, which has in turn led to the traditional practice of using separate complete sets of kitchen utensils for meat and dairy so as to totally ensure this rule is not broken.\n\nThe Torah does not classify animals under modern scientific categories of mammals, fish, reptiles and birds. Rather, the religious categories are land-dwelling animals (land mammals, flightless birds, and land reptiles, etc), flying animals (birds, insects, flying mammals such as bats), and water-bound animals (fish, mammals such as whales, reptiles such as sea snakes, crustaceans, mollouscs, etc).\n\nGiven that each of these religious categories of animals includes species of at least two or more of each scientific categories of animals, there is no general kashrut rules relating per se to mammals, birds, reptiles, or fish. However, rules for each of these class of animals can be extrapolated from the biblical requirements.\n\nAccording to the Torah, land-dwelling animals that \"both\" chew the cud (ruminate) and have cloven hooves, are kosher. By these requirements, any land-dwelling animal that is kosher can only possibly be a mammal, but even then, permitted are only those mammals that are placentals and strictly herbivorous (not omnivores nor carnivores) that both ruminate and also have cloven hooves, such as bovines (cattle/cows, bison, buffalos, yak, etc), sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and technically, also giraffes.\n\nAlthough the giraffe falls under the kosher category by its characteristics, it does not have a masorah (tradition) for its consumption by any Jewish community. Though it is commonly believed that it is not known where on a giraffes neck shechita (ritual slaughter) can be performed, this is incorrect as the shechita can be performed anywhere on the neck. \n\nAll other mammals, land-dwelling or otherwise, are forbidden by the Torah, including \"crawling creatures\" such as mammalian mice, and flying mammals such as the various species of bats. Water-bound mammals, such as whales, dolphins, dugongs, etc, are also not kosher as they do not have the characteristics required of kosher water-bound creatures which must have both fins and scales. \n\nThose land-dwelling mammals that have only one of the two characteristics of kosher land-dwellers (only ruminant or only cloven hooved) are impure and cannot be consumed. By default, therefore, not only are most land-dwelling mammals not kosher, but all land-dwelling non-mammals are also not kosher, including reptiles, amphibians, molluscs (including snails), etc.\n\nAmong mammals that Leviticus cites explicitly as an example of unclean is the camel, because it ruminates but does not have a cloven hoof; the hyrax and the hare are also explicitly given as an example of being excluded as kosher on the same grounds. Quintessentially, the Torah explicitly declares the pig unclean, because it has cloven hooves but does not ruminate. \n\nIt is of interest to note that Australia is the only continent that has no kosher native mammals, nor kosher native birds. Thus, prior to European settlement, there were no kosher land-dwelling or flying animals in Australia. Though the kangaroo chews its cud, for instance, it does not have hooves, and is therefore not kosher. No mammals that are marsupial or monotreme are kosher.\n\nAccording to , anything that comes from the water (\"in the seas, and in the rivers\") that has both fins and scales may be eaten. By those requirements, kosher water creatures can only possibly be fish, but even then, permitted are only those fish that have both fins and scales.\n\nAll other non-fish water creatures are, by default, also not kosher, including crustaceans, molluscs, water-bound mammals, water-bound reptiles, etc.\n\nWhile there is nothing specifically mentioned in Jewish halakha requiring kosher fish having an endoskeleton (\"inner skeleton\") and gills (as opposed to lungs), every true fish that has both scales and fins by default also possesses an endoskeleton and gills. Any sea creature that lacks gills and can only breathe oxygen from air through lungs, or has an exoskeleton instead of and endoskeleton, is by default not kosher because it cannot be a fish.\n\nIt is important to note that the definition of scales does not include the shells of prawns and shrimp, which are in fact the exoskeleton (\"outer skeleton\") of these animals, in the same manner as the shells of lobsters or crabs. Even if these shells were to be misidentified as scales, these creatures would still not be kosher as they lack fins.\n\nWhile not every fish that has fins will have scales, every true fish that has true fish scales by default also has fins.\n\nThe Torah names only a few birds that may not be eaten; those not in the list are presumed to be kosher. However, the precise identity of the unclean birds is a matter of contention in traditional Jewish texts. It is therefore common to eat only birds with a clear masorah (tradition) of being kosher in at least one Jewish community, such as domestic fowl. \n\nIn Leviticus 11 it states the eagle, vulture, black vulture, red kite, black kite, raven, horned owl, screech owl, gull, or any kind of hawk. The little owl, cormorant, the great owl, white owl, desert owl, osprey, stork, heron, hoopoe and bats. \n\nThe Torah allows eating certain kinds of \"winged swarming things\" (i.e. insects) while prohibiting others. However, due to uncertainty about the Hebrew insect names, rabbis today recommend that all insects be considered unclean. An exception is made for certain locusts (\"Schistocerca gregaria\"), which are traditionally considered kosher by some Yemenite Jewish communities. details which insects are not to be eaten, and due to the wording all insects are considered impure to avoid mistaken consumption.\n\nBees' honey is considered kosher because the honey is not a product made of bees.\n\nThe following animals are considered to be impure according to and , based on Rashi's identification:\nSome scholars have conjectured that the Jewish concept of \"unclean animals\" arose out of public health concerns by community leaders, since, in the conditions of the times, some of those animals are indeed more likely to cause food poisoning or transmit diseases to people who consume them.\n\nBritish anthropologist Mary Douglas proposed that the \"unclean\" label had philosophical grounds, namely it was cast on foods that did not seem to fall neatly into any symbolic category. The pig, for example, was seen as an \"ambiguous\" creature, because it had cloven hoof like cattle, but did not chew cud.\n\nIn the very early days of Christianity it was debated if converts ought to follow Jewish customs (including circumcision and dietary laws) or not. According to the account of the Council of Jerusalem in , a compromise was reached between those who wanted full compliance and those who favored a more liberal view. It was agreed that the converted Gentiles would have to bear \"no greater burden than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication\".\n\nJesus is quoted in as saying \"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him ... whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly\"; and in . \"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\" These statements are often cited for support of the view that practicing Christianity does not include dietary restrictions.\nSupporters of the liberal view also point to Peter's vision reported in and in which God invited him to \"kill and eat\" from the animals in the \"great sheet\" containing \"all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air\". They also draw support from the writings of apostles Timothy (, \"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer\") and Paul (, \"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days\").\n\nWhile the majority of Christians agree that the dietary restrictions of the Old Testament were lifted with Christ's New Covenant, a view known as Supersessionism, there are Torah-submissive Christians who believe that they should still be observed. Supporters of this view may argue, for example, that in the Old Testament, Daniel spoke of unclean food and drink as \"defiling one's body\" , and that in the New Testament one's body is said to be the \"temple of God\", and \"If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him\". Some read Jesus's reply to questioning by the Pharisees in and as implying that his statements about \"which goeth into the mouth\" ( and ) referred to the question of hand washing, rather than clean and unclean foods.\n\nOthers also argue that the dietary restrictions predate Leviticus, and that Paul in was referring to the ceremonial feast days such as the Feast of Unleavened Bread and not clean and unclean foods. Others argue that the liberal view would imply the acceptance even of alcohol, tobacco, rats and roaches as \"clean food\"; and that God never declares something an abomination and then changes His mind.\n\nSupporters of the stricter view have also disputed the interpretation of Peter's vision , claiming that God was merely instructing him not to refer to gentiles as \"unclean\" since salvation had been extended to them. This is expressly stated by Peter later in the chapter at Acts 10:28 (\"but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\") In Acts 10:14 Peter makes a distinction between \"common\" (Greek κοινόν) and \"unclean\" (Greek ακάθαρτον) to which God replies in the next verse \"What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common [κοίνου]\".\n\nOne modern example of a Torah-submissive group is the Seventh-day Adventist Church whose co-founder Ellen G. White was a proponent of vegetarianism. Many Seventh-day Adventists avoid meat for health reasons, though vegetarianism is not a requirement. Members of the United Church of God as well as other Sabbath-keeping Christian Churches also believe in abstaining from unclean meats.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, it was forbidden to eat meat (defined as the flesh of any warm-blooded animal) on Friday, but as a penance to commemorate Christ's death rather than for meats being regarded as \"unclean\". In the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the current code of canon law for the Roman Catholic Church, the Friday abstinence from meat is prescribed for \"those who have completed their fourteenth year of age\". Once a person has begun his or her sixtieth year, the abstinence is no longer obligatory. Canon 1253 allows each particular conference of bishops to \"determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety, in whole or in part, for abstinence and fast\". The current disciplinary norms from a document produced by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, titled \"Pastoral Statement On Penance And Abstinence\", remove the penalty of sin for Roman Catholics in the United States who choose not to abstain from meat, while the document \"give[s] first place to abstinence from flesh meat\". Roman Catholics in the United States are, therefore, free to substitute some form of penance on Fridays of the whole year, while the Lenten abstinence remain obligatory.\n\nSince the 1860s when the Seventh-day Adventist Church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church. Adventists are known for presenting a \"health message\" that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in . Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other foods proscribed as \"unclean\".\n\nIn Islam several animals are considered unclean and their consumption is sinful (\"harām\"), except in case of necessity; while others are permitted (\"halāl\"), as long as they are slaughtered in the proper manner and with blessings given to God.\n\nThe Qur'an expressly forbids consumption of \"the flesh of swine\" There are no other \"impure animals\" explicitly named in the Qur'an. If someone converts to Islam, Allah \"allows them as lawful what is good and prohibits them from what is bad; he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that were upon them\".\n\nFor other animals, great importance is given to the manner of its death: forbidden are blood and carrion (\"dead meat\"), and any animal that has been \"killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death\". Also forbidden is any animal that has been eaten by a wild animal, unless the person is able to slaughter it before it dies.\n\nFinally, the Qur'an forbids food on which has been invoked a name other than Allah, which has been sacrificed on stone altars, or has subjected to the pagan practice of raffling with arrows. Food slaughtered by an idolater is forbidden, but food that is acceptable to Jews and Christians is allowed to Muslims as well.\n\nAccording to the majority of Sunni scholars, dogs can be owned by farmers, hunters, and shepherds for the purpose of hunting and guarding and the Qur'an states that it is permissible to eat what trained dogs catch. Among the Bedouin, the saluki dogs are cherished as companions and allowed in the tents.\n\nNevertheless, many Islamic teachers state dogs should be considered unclean and that Muslims licked by them must perform ritual purification. According to a Sunni Islam Hadith, a plate that a dog has used for feeding must be washed seven times, including once with clean sand mixed with the water, before a person may eat from it.\n\nMany Rastafarians believe that pigs are unclean and hold to a diet known as Ital.\n\nHistorically, eating pork was taboo in much of Scotland, however, this is no longer the case.\n\n\n"}

This theology harkens back at least to the Shang dynasty. Described as the \"five changeable faces of Heaven\", they represent Heaven's cosmic activity which shapes worlds as \"tán\" 壇, \"altars\", imitating its order which is visible in the starry vault, the north celestial pole and its spinning constellations. The Five Deities themselves represent these constellations. In accordance with the Three Powers (三才 Sāncái) they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. The Han Chinese identify themselves as the descendants of the Red and Yellow Deities.\n\nThey are associated to the five colours, the five phases of the continuous creation, the five key planets of the Solar System and the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole, the five sacred mountains and five directions of space (their terrestrial form), and the five Dragon Gods (龙神 \"Lóngshén\") who represent their mounts, that is to say the material forces they preside over (their chthonic form). They have also been defined simply as five special forms of the worship of the God of Heaven, different \"accesses\" or perspectives, suitable for different situations, to serve Heaven.\n\nAccording to Zheng Xuan, the influence of their activity begets different categories of beings on earth. Explaining the ancient theology about the origins of kings from Heaven's impregnation of earthly women, he commented:\nOther names by which the Five Deities are collectively known are:\n\nIn some works they are conceptualised as a single deity, the \"Great Deity the Heavenly King\" (天皇大帝 \"Tiānhuáng Dàdì\") or \"Highest Deity of the Vast Heaven\" (昊天上帝 \"Hàotiān Shàngdì\"), which are therefore other epithets for the supreme God of Heaven.\n\n\"Huángdì\" (黄帝 \"Yellow Emperor\" or \"Yellow Deity\"), also called \"Huángshén\" (黄神 \"Yellow God\"), is another name of the supreme God in Chinese traditions, associated to the northern culmen of the sky and the Big Dipper (or Great Chariot, or Ursa Major) in particular, and with the power of the \"wu\" (巫 shamans). He is also known, as a human culture hero and progenitor, as \"Xuānyuán\" (轩辕 \"Chariot Shaft\"), \"Xuānyuánshì\" (轩辕氏 \"Master of the Chariot Shaft\"), or \"Xuānyuán Huángdì\" (轩辕黄帝 \"Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft\"), and as a cosmological symbol as \"Zhōngyuèdàdì\" (中岳大帝 \"Great Deity of the Central Peak\"). He represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon (黄龙 \"Huánglóng\"). The character 黄 \"huáng\", for \"yellow\", also means, by homophony and shared etymology with 皇 \"huáng\", \"august\", \"creator\" and \"radiant\", attributes of the supreme God.\n\nHe is the deity who shapes the material world (地 \"Dì\"), the creator of the \"Huaxia\" civility, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and primal ancestor of all the Chinese. In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi his astral body is Saturn, but he is also identified as the Sun God, and with the star Regulus (α Leonis) and constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon.\n\nHe corresponds to the \"Huángshén Běidǒu\" (黄神北斗 \"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\"), of whom in certain historical sources he is described as the human form making an ontological distinction between the two. For instance, according to a definition given by apocryphal texts related to the \"Hétú\" 河圖, the Yellow Emperor \"proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\", is born to \"a daughter of a chthonic deity\", and as such he is \"a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth\". The Yellow God is in turn described as the \"spirit father and astral double\" of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nAs a human being, the Yellow Emperor is said to have been the fruit of a virginal birth, as his mother Fubao was impregnated by a radiance (\"yuanqi\", \"primordial pneuma\"), a lightning, which she saw encircling the Northern Dipper (Great Chariot, or Ursa Major), or the celestial pole, while she was walking in the countryside. She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named. Through his human side, he was a descendant of 有熊氏 \"Yǒuxióng\", the lineage of the Bear—another reference to the Ursa Major. Scholar John C. Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in Siberia or in north Asia.\n\nIn older accounts, the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" to derive from \"guāng\" 光, \"light\") and thunder, and as one and the same with the \"Thunder God\" (雷神 \"Léishén\"), who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the \"Huangdi Neijing\".\n\nHuangdi represents the hub of creation, the \"axis mundi\" (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality. As the deity of the centre of the four directions, in the \"Shizi\" he is described as \"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\" (黄帝四面 \"Huángdì Sìmiàn\"). The \"Four-Faced God\" or \"Ubiquitous God\" (四面神 \"Sìmiànshén\") is also the Chinese name of Brahma. Huangdi is the model of those who merge their self with the self of the universal God, of the ascetics who reach enlightenment or immortality.\n\nIn Sima Qian's description of the Five Deities it is important to note that the Yellow Emperor was portrayed as the grandfather of the Black Emperor of the north who personifies as well the pole stars, and as the tamer of the Red Emperor, his half-brother, who is the spirit of the southern populations known collectively as Chu in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\"Cāngdì\" (蒼帝 \"Green Deity\" or \"Green Emperor\") or \"Cāngshén\" (蒼神 \"Green God\"), also known as \"Qīngdì\" (青帝 \"Blue Deity\" or \"Bluegreen Deity\") or \"Qīngshén\" (青神 \"Bluegreen God\"), and cosmologically as the \"Dōngdì\" (东帝 \"East Deity\") or \"Dōngyuèdàdì\" (东岳大帝 \"Great Deity of the Eastern Peak\", which is Mount Tai), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of wood and spring, for which he is worshipped as the god of fertility. The Bluegreen Dragon (青龙 \"Qīnglóng\") is both his animal form and constellation, and as a human he was \"Tàihào\" 太昊. His female consort is the goddess of fertility Bixia. His astral body is Jupiter.\n\n\"Hēidì\" (黑帝 \"Black Deity\" or \"Black Emperor\") or \"Hēishén\" (黑神 \"Black God\"), also known as the cosmological \"Běidì\" (北帝 \"North Deity\") or \"Běiyuèdàdì\" (北岳大帝 \"Great Deity of the Northern Peak\"), and identified as \"Zhuānxū\" (颛顼), today frequently worshipped as \"Xuánwǔ\" (玄武 \"Dark Warrior\") or \"Zhēnwǔ\" (真武), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of water and winter. His animal form is the Black Dragon (玄龙 \"Xuánlóng\", literally \"Dark Dragon\" or \"Mysterious Dragon\") and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake. His astral body is Mercury.\n\n\"Chìdì\" (赤帝 \"Red Deity\" or \"Red Emperor\") or \"Chìshén\" (赤神 \"Red God\"), also known as the \"Nándì\" (南帝 \"South Deity\") or \"Nányuèdàdì\" (南岳大帝 \"Great Deity of the Southern Peak\"), as a human was \"Shénnóng\" (神农 \"Farmer God\" or \"Plowing God\"), who is also the same as \"Yándì\" (炎帝 \"Flame Deity\" or \"Fiery Deity\"), a function occupied by different gods and god-kings in mytho-history. Shennong is also one of the Three Patrons, specifically the patron of humanity (人皇 \"Rénhuáng\"), and the point of intersection of the Three Patrons and Huangdi.\n\nHe is also associated with \"Chīyóu\" (蚩尤), the god of some southern peoples, in both iconography and myth, as both Shennong Yandi and Chiyou fought against the Yellow Emperor, although Chiyou is traditionally considered more violent and has the horns of a fighting bull, while Shennong Yandi is more peaceful and has the horns of a plowing buffalo.\n\nHe is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of fire; his animal form is the Red Dragon (朱龙 \"Zhūlóng\") and his stellar animal is the phoenix. He is the god of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal plants and market. In broader conceptualisation, he is the god of science and craft, and the patron of doctors and apothecaries. His astral body is Mars.\n\n\"Báidì\" (白帝 \"White Emperor\" or \"White Deity\") or \"Báishén\" (白神 \"White God\"), also known as the \"Xīdì\" (西帝 \"West Deity\") or \"Xīyuèdàdì\" (西岳大帝 \"Great Deity of the Western Peak\"), as a human was Shǎohào (少昊), and he is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of metal and autumn. His animal form is the White Dragon (白龙 \"Báilóng\") and his stellar animal is the tiger. His astral body is Venus.\n\nIn mythology, Huangdi and Yandi fought a battle against each other; and Huang finally defeated Yan with the help of the Dragon (the controller of water, who is Huangdi himself).\n\nThis myth symbolises the equipoise of yin and yang, here the fire of knowledge (reason and craft) and earthly stability. \"Yan\" 炎 is flame, scorching fire, or an excess of it (it is important to notice that graphically it is a double 火 \"huo\", \"fire\").\n\nAs an excess of fire brings destruction to the earth, it has to be controlled by a ruling principle. Nothing is good in itself, without limits; good outcomes depend on the proportion in the composition of things and their interactions, never on extremes in absolute terms. Huangdi and Yandi are complementary opposites, necessary for the existence of one another, and they are powers that exist together within the human being.\n\nThe worship of the Five Deities by both commoners and rulers of China is a very ancient practice, harkening back at least to the Neolithic. Already in the theology of the Shang dynasty, the supreme God of Heaven (\"Shangdi\" or \"Di\") was conceived as manifesting in a fourfold form and will, the four 方 \"fāng\" (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their 風 \"fēng\" (\"winds\").\n\nThe official religion and ritual of the state of Qin (9th century BCE–221 BCE) was largely based on that of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE). The emperors worshipped the supreme God at a location in the suburbs of their capital Xianyang. The cults of the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities had been celebrated separately in different parts of the state. In 677 BCE, Yong, an ancient sacred site where the Yellow Emperor himself was said to have sacrificed and the Zhou dynasty carried out \"jiào\" 醮 rituals, or \"suburban sacrifices\", became the capital of Qin.\n\nIt is attested that in 671 BCE, Duke Xuan (675–664) carried out the sacrifices for the Green Deity in Mi, south of the Wei River. Then, Duke Ling (?–384) instituted the sacred sites of Shàng (上 \"Above\") and Xià (下 \"Below\"), for the Yellow and Red Deities, in Wuyang, near Yong. Originally, the sacrifice for the White Deity had been carried out in 769 BCE by Duke Xiang (778–766) in Xi, near Lanzhou in Gansu. In 753 they were carried out by Duke Wen (765–716) in Fu, northeast Shaanxi.\n\nIn 253 BCE the great grandfather of Qin Shihuang unified the imperial cult of the four forms of God in Yong, constructing there altars for the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities. In 219, Qin Shihuang, founder of the Qin empire (221 BCE–206 BCE), personally sacrificed at Mount Tai, the sacred mountain at the centre of Shandong, a site for the worship of the supreme godhead in the erstwhile states of Qi and Lu. He modelled the sacrifice on that performed at Yong, in alignment with the Qin tradition, consisting of three types of victims—horses, rams and oxen.\n\nThe ritual system of the early emperors of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 AD) was not different from that of the Qin, with the only change consisting in the integration of the Black Deity by Gaozu or Liu Bang (206–195), the first emperor of the dynasty. However, Han state religion soon found itself divided between two factions. On one hand there were the Confucians who pushed for a new ritual system and a religio-political centralisation around the worship of the God of Heaven by the emperor, the God of Heaven's son, and the worship of lesser deities who had to be approved by the Confucians themselves, who considered themselves the only ones capable of interpreting the signs of Heaven in accordance with the classics. On the other hand there were the \"fangshi\" (方士 \"masters of directions\"), ritual masters who formulated what would have been called the \"Huang–Lao\" proto-Taoist religious movement, who presented themselves as the continuators of the traditions of the erstwhile kingdoms, and who emphasised the worship of local deities integrated into a theology in which the supreme God of Heaven was named \"Taiyi\" (\"Great One\"), and its human manifestation was the ancestral Yellow Emperor whom the emperors had to imitate.\n\nThe imperial temple at Yong which was established by the great grandfather of Qin Shihuang was rearranged placing the altars of the gods each in its respective direction, and that of the Yellow Deity at the centre. Outside Yong, two other temples dedicated to the Five Deities were built during the reign of Emperor Wen (180–157), one in Weiyang, northeast of Chang'an, and one in Chengji near the modern county of Tongwei in Gansu. The sacrifices at Yong held a central positions and were carried out every three years by the emperor. If the emperor was absent, the rituals were performed by masters of rites, at various times throughout the year based on the ritual calendar of the Qin.\n\nIn 113 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han innovated the Confucian state religion integrating the Huang–Lao conception of Taiyi with the Five Deities and the cult of \"Houtu\" (\"Queen of the Earth\"). In 135 BCE, the \"fangshi\" Miu Ji, from Bo in modern Shandong, insisted that Taiyi was the same supreme God, master of the Five Deities, worshipped since remote antiquity by the emperors through the three-victims sacrifice. The rite lasted seven days and took place at a temple with \"eight entrances for the numina\" in the southeastern suburb of the capital. In conformity with the instructions of Miu Ji, the emperor built a temple in the outskirts of Chang'an and appointed a great invocator (\"taizhu\") to conduct the sacrifices. Twenty years later—under the influence of another prominent court \"fangshi\", Gongsun Qing—the sacrifice was held by the emperor in person. A temple of Taiyi and the Five Deities was built in Ganquan, 70km northeast of Chang'an. Regarding the liturgy, sacrificial protocol and architectural layout, the sites of Ganquan and Mount Tai followed the model of Yong. Besides the highest gods of the pantheon, the emperor or the central administration celebrated the cults of other gods, including those devoted to mountains and rivers, the sun and moon, stars and constellations, and heroes.\n\nIn later times the expansion of the empire to different provinces and peoples was accompanied by a policy of identification or association of native gods and their cults to the imperial Han pantheon, so that the cults officially celebrated by the administration proliferated to the hundreds. In 31 BCE, Confucians at the court, especially Kuang Heng and Zhang Tan, disposed a reform of the state sacrifices, suppressing hundreds of local sacrifices and restricting those performed by the emperor in person only to the worship of Taiyi and Houtu, or Heaven and Earth.\n\n\n\n"}
