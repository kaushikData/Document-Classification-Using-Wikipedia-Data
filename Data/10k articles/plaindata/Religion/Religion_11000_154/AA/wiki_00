It is an umbrella term used to denote the religion of indigenous peoples of India. The term 'Adi Dharam' was made popular by the tribal scholar and philosopher Ram Dayal Munda when he sought to unite the ancestral beliefs of the all the indigenous people of India \n\nIn the pre-Independence British era, the Indian government had recognized the distinctiveness of the religious beliefs of the Adivasi or the tribal people of India and had categorized it under the term 'Animism'. The term Animism was re-purposed and made popular by the works of British anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor. Census records as early as 1871 and various ethnographic books by the Britishers show that a large chunk of the tribal population were followers of their traditional religion (recognized as Animism). The term 'Animism' was included in the census till 1931 after which, due to unknown reasons, its use was discontinued (some records show that Animism was there in the 1951 census). The post-Independence Indian Government abolished all the terms signifying the distinctiveness of the religious beliefs of the tribal people.\n\nHowever, tribal religious movements that intended to safeguard the belief system and identity of the tribals continued at a regional level like the Donyi-Polo movement, Gondi movement, Khasi religion, Sanamahi movement, Sari Dharam movement, Sarna movement etc., but a national level movement encompassing all the tribals was lacking. The early post-Independence literate tribals did feel a need for a national level movement in order to safeguard the religious beliefs of the tribals. The term 'Adi-Dharam' to denote nationally the belief system of the tribals was very much used among the literate tribals in the early post independence era as is evident from Shri Kartik Oraon's, (a tribal leader and the then State Minister of Aviation and Communication, Govt. of India) book \"Bees Varsh ki Kaali Raat\" (1970s) where he uses the word 'Adi Dharm' to denote the belief system of the tribals nationally.\n\nThe issue of the national religious identity of the tribals was powerfully reignited when in 2000, Ram Dayal Munda wrote a paper 'Adi-Dharam: Religious Beliefs of the Adivasis of India'. In the paper he argued for the distinctiveness of the belief system of the tribals and proposed that the term 'Adi Dharam' along with the regional term (Donyi-Polo, Gondi, Sanamahi, Sari, Sarna etc. in brackets) be included in the census survey which would include all the tribals who are still following their traditional belief system. This national identity, according to him, \"\"will strengthen their\" (the tribals') \"solidarity, which will be helpful for their security and progress\"\".\n\nRam Dayal Munda emphasized the following points which are common to all the tribal people of India as well as of the whole world, regarding their religious beliefs:-. According to him, in the Adivasi (Tribal) belief system\n\n"}

According to Purnimant calendar followed in North India, it falls during the month of Kartik and according to Amanta calendar followed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and other southern states, it falls during the month of Ashvin. However, it is just the name of the month which differs and the fasting of Ahoi Ashtami is done on the same day.\n\nThe fasting and puja on Ahoi Ashtami are dedicated to Mata Ahoi or Goddess Ahoi. She is worshipped by mothers for the well-being and long life of their children. This day is also known as Ahoi Aathe because fasting for Ahoi Ashtami is done during Ashtami Tithi which is the eighth day of the lunar month.\n\nOn the day of fasting, after taking morning bath women take a pledge, called Sankalp, to keep the fast for the wellbeing of their children. It is also recited during Sankalp that the fasting would be without any food or the water and the fast would be broken after sighting the stars or the moon according to their family tradition.\n\nPuja preparations are finished before sunset. Women either draw the image of Goddess Ahoi on the wall using \"geru\" or embroider it on a piece of cloth and hang it on a wall. Any image of Ahoi Mata used for the puja should have Ashtha Koshthak i.e. eight corners due to the festival being associated with Ashtami Tithi. The image includes along with Goddess Ahoi, the images of and young children and \"Syahu\" (i.e. a porcupine). \n\nThen, the place of worship is sanctified with holy water and Alpana is drawn. After spreading wheat on the floor or on the wooden stool, one water-filled \"kalash\" (pot) is kept at the place of worship. The mouth of the Kalash is covered with an earthen lid.\n\nA small earthen pot, preferably Karwa is kept on the top of the Kalash. Karwa is filled with the water and covered with its lid. The nozzle of the Karwa is blocked with the shoots of the grass. The commonly used shoot is known as Sarai Seenka which is a type of willow. The seven shoots of the grass are also offered to Ahoi Mata and \"syahu\". The shoot of Sarai is sold during the festival especially in the small towns of India. If grass shoots are not available then cotton buds can be used.\n\nThe food items which are used in Puja include 8 Puri, 8 Pua and Halwa. These food items are given to a Brahmin along with some money.\n\nThere are many tales related to this observance and one of them is told just after the puja is done as part of the ritual.\nOnce upon a time, there lived a moneylender who had seven sons. One day in the month of Kartik, just a few days before Diwali festivities, the moneylender's wife decided to repair and decorate her house for Diwali celebrations. To renovate her house, she decided to go to the forest to fetch some soil. While digging the soil in the forest, she accidentally kills the young one of a porcupine with the spade with which she was digging the soil. The animal then curses her to a similar fate and within a year all her 7 children die. \n\nThe couple unable to tolerate the grief decide to kill themselves en route to a final pilgrimage. They keep walking till they no longer able to and fall unconscious on the ground. God, on seeing this, feels pitiful for then and makes an Akashvani asking them to go back, serve the holy cow and worship Goddess Ahoi as she was believed to be the protector of the offspring of all living beings. The couple feeling much better, return home.\n\nThey follow the divine command. When the day of Ashtami came, the wife drew the face of the young porcupine and observed fast and performed Goddess Ahoi. She honestly repented for the sin which she had committed. Goddess Ahoi was pleased with her devotion and honesty and appeared before her and gave her the boon of fertility.\n"}

The myths were usually either written in Sumerian or Akkadian. Some Babylonian texts were even translations into Akkadian from the Sumerian language of earlier texts, although the names of some deities were changed in Babylonian texts.\n\nMany Babylonian deities, myths and religious writings are singular to that culture; for example, the uniquely Babylonian deity, Marduk, replaced Enlil as the head of the mythological pantheon. The \"Enûma Eliš\", a creation myth epic was an original Babylonian work.\n\nTablet fragments from the Neo-Babylonian period describe a series of festival days celebrating the New Year. The Festival began on the first day of the first Babylonian month, Nisannu, roughly corresponding to April/May in the Gregorian calendar. This festival celebrated the re-creation of the Earth, drawing from the Marduk-centered creation story described in the Enûma Eliš.\n\nIn Babylonian religion, the ritual care and worship of the statues of deities was considered sacred; the gods resided simultaneously in their statues in temples and in the natural forces they embodied. An elaborate ceremony of washing the mouths of the statues appeared sometime in the Old Babylonian period.\n\nThe pillaging or destruction of idols was considered to be loss of divine patronage; during the Neo-Babylonian period, the Chaldean prince Marduk-apla-iddina II fled into the southern marshes of Mesopotamia with the statues of Babylon's gods to save them from the armies of Sennacherib of Assyria.\n\n"}

In 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then Guardian of the religion, was the first Bahá'í to visit the area. In 1953 several Bahá'ís settled in what was then South Rhodesia as pioneers. Along with indigenous conversions in 1955 the Bahá'ís formed the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare. By the end of 1963 there were 9 assemblies and more smaller groups and isolated members of the religion. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bahá'ís nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970 while Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. By 2003, the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'ís in Zimbabwe, a year of events across the country culminated with a conference of Bahá'ís from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries. There were 43 local spiritual assemblies in 2003.\n\nIn a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu.\n\nIn 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then Guardian of the religion, was the first Bahá'í to visit the area and then came again with his wife, Rúhíyyih Khanum, in 1940-1. They visited the Victoria Falls, Matopos, and Bulawayo.\n\nEarly in 1953 Izzat'u'llah Zahrai from Iran attempted to settle in what was then South Rhodesia but his application for residency was rejected. Along with Zahrai, Claire Gung, Eyneddin and Tahirih Ala'i, (some from the United Kingdom), and Dr. Kenneth and Mrs. Roberta Christian, American Bahá'í pioneers, were each credited with being Knights of Bahá'u'lláh for Southern Rhodesia and were under strict instructions by the Guardian to attempt to spread the religion among the indigenous peoples, not the settlers. However the Christians knew Sylvia and \"Sue\" (Salvator) Benatar, who though Sephardic Jews, became Bahá'ís after the Christians left Zimbabwe when they came in contact with Larry and Carol Hautz who were succeeding pioneers. Later Mrs. Benatar performed with Norman Bailey. The Hautz' established a motel, service station, and a snake farm for venom on the Bulawayo road just outside Harare. The school was initially for the 20 indigenous children of the staff, but it eventually expanded to a total enrollment of 400.\n\nThe first indigenous person to accept the Faith was Morton Ndovi in January 1955 who soon pioneered to Malawi and then Nyasaland. Other local people accepted the Faith soon afterwards, and in April that same year the first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare (then called Salisbury). The region was gathered together under a regional National Spiritual Assembly of South West Africa in 1956. The first African woman to become a Baha'i in Zimbabwe was Mabel Chiposi, who accepted the religion in 1957. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and extend in the 1960s. By the end of 1963 there were several communities of Bahá'ís including nine Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies:\nHand of the Cause John Robarts lived in Bulawayo with his family from 1957 to 1967. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bahá'ís nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964, and Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga represented the Universal House of Justice at the first national convention. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970. In October 1979 some 60 members of the religion from nine communities in Matabeleland participated in the first regional conference at Bulawayo. In April 1980 more than 50 attended the four-day summer school at the national Center in Salisbury. Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. In 1983 the national convention had 67 delegates. In 1985 182 local assemblies were elected and some one hundred women attended a National Bahá'í Women's Conference. Bahá'ís estimated the Zimbabwean community at 20,000 in 1985, a 20 fold increase from 1971.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1984 a literacy project was begun and operated entirely by local members of the religion. In 1986 the Bahá'ís of Zimbabwe hosted a conference on the education of children with speakers from government ministries and UNICEF addressing the meetings and coverage by radio stations. By 1988 teacher training for tutorial schools, literacy and pre-school programs was held in Zimbabwe. In November 1988 a national women's conference gathered 71 Bahá'ís. In 1989 a Bahá'í expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Zimbabwe training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. Two major arts events took place in Zimbabwe in 1994 among the Bahá'ís. The first was a national music and drama congress, held in August in Mhondoro, with approximately 200 attending. The drama group from Murewa and the Epworth children's choir won in their respective categories. The second major event was in December with participants 30 different countries for the Zimbabwe Bahá'í International Summer School and Music and Drama Festival. In the music competition of that event, a group called Voice of the Youth, from Bulawayo, walked away with the first prize, the Murewa Choir came second, and the Epworth Choir came third.\n\nAfter smaller regional congresses held throughout the nation, Bahá'ís from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries attended the festivities of the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'í Faith in Zimbabwe that were held from 12 to 14 December 2003. The festivities included performances by groups \"Isitsha Sothando\" from Ndebele tribe, \"Letters of the Living,\" from Mashonaland Central Province, and others.

{"id": "250049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250049", "title": "Belial", "text": "Belial\n\nBelial () (also \"Belhor\", \"Baalial\", \"Beliar\", \"Beliall\", \"Beliel\", \"Beliya'al\") is a term occurring in the Hebrew Bible which later became personified as the devil in Jewish and Christian texts.\n\n\"Belial\" (בְלִיַּעַל \"bĕli-yaal\") is a Hebrew word term \"used to characterize the wicked or worthless.\" The etymology of the word is often understood as \"lacking worth\", from two common words: \"beli-\" (בְּלִי \"without-\") and \"ya'al\" ( יָעַל \"to be of value\").\n\nSome scholars translate it from Hebrew as \"worthless\" (\"Beli yo'il\"), while others translate it as \"yokeless\" (\"Beli ol\"), \"may have no rising\" (\"Belial\") or \"never to rise\" (\"Beli ya'al\"). Only a few etymologists have assumed it to be an invented name from the start.\n\nThe word occurs twenty-seven times in the Masoretic Text, in verses such as , where the King James Version (KJV) translates the Hebrew phrase \"adam beli-yaal\" as \"a naughty person\".\n\nIn the Hebrew text the phrase is either \"sons of Belial\" or simply \"sons of worthlessness\". Phrases beginning with \"sons of\" are a common semitic idiom such as \"sons of destruction\", \"sons of lawlessness\".\n\nOf these 27 occurrences, the idiom \"sons of Belial\" (בְּנֵֽי־בְלִיַּעַל \"beni beliyaal\") appears 15 times to indicate worthless people, including idolaters (Deuteronomy 13:13), the men of Gibeah (Judges 19:22, 20:13), the sons of Eli (1 Samuel 2:12), Nabal, and Shimei. The Geneva Bible (1560) uses \"wicked,\" and at Jg 19:22 has the marginal note \"\"Ebr\" [Hebrew] \"men of Belial: that is, giuen to all wickednes.\"\" In the KJV these occurrences are rendered with \"Belial\" capitalised:\nIn modern versions these are usually read as a phrase:\n\n\"Belial\" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel, to calamitous circumstances, and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods; those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah; the wicked sons of Eli; insolent Nabal; opposers of God’s anointed, David; Rehoboam's unsteady associates; Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth; and men in general who stir up contention. Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: \"No more will any worthless person pass again through you. In his entirety he will certainly be cut off.\"\n\nThe term \"belial\" appears frequently in Jewish texts of the Second Temple period (texts classified by Christians as the Old Testament pseudepigrapha and apocrypha). Also a large number of references to Belial are evidenced in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran from 1948.\n\nIn \"The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness\", one of the Dead Sea scrolls, Belial is the leader of the Sons of Darkness:\n\n\"You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits of his lot are angels of destruction, they walk in the laws of darkness; towards it goes their only desire.\"\n\nIn the \"Rules of the Community\", God is depicted as saying, \"I shall not comfort the oppressed until their path is perfect. I shall not retain Belial within my heart.\"\n\nThe \"War Scroll\" and \"the Thanksgiving hymns\" both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.\n\nIn the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\", Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.\n\nAlso in \"The Dead Sea Scrolls\" is a recounting of a dream of Amram, the father of Moses, who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the \"Fragments of a Zadokite Work\" (which is also known as The Damascus Document (CD)), which states that during the eschatological age, \"Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through Isaiah the prophet.\" The \"Fragments\" also speak of \"three nets of Belial\" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary. In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as Mastema is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The \"Fragments\" also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and wizard.\n\nIn the Book of Jubilees, uncircumcised Gentiles are called \"sons of Belial\".\n\nBelial is also mentioned in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. The author of the work seems to be a dualist because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when Israel leaves Egypt, they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits. \n\nIn the Ascension of Isaiah, Belial is the angel of lawlessness and \"the ruler of this world\", and identified as Samael and Satan.\n\nIn the New Testament the word occurs once, when Paul the Apostle asks:\n\nThe spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually \"Beliar\" (Βελιάρ) not \"Belial\" (Βελίαλ). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.\n\nThe Jewish Greek Septuagint, later the Old Testament of the early Christian church, generally renders the \"sons of Belial\" verses in the Hebrew Bible either as \"lawless men\", by idioms \"sons of the pestilence\", rather than a personal name \"sons of Belial.\":\nThe Septuagint also avoids Belial in the singular so Shimei (2 Samuel 16:7) when he cursed David, \"Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial\" is rendered \"you lawless man\" (\"paranomos\"), and Hannah to Eli \"Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial\" is rendered \"don't count your maidservant as a daughter of the pest\" The Latin Vulgate and Syriac Peshitta Old Testaments in some cases follow the Greek, in other literalize as Hebrew. The single New Testament use is preserved \"Belial\" in Latin and Syriac.\n\nIn the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew) of the New Testament apocrypha, Belial was visible along with 666 fallen angels when Michael was commanded by Jesus to show Hell to his disciples.\n\nThe Talmud and rabbinical interpretation generally follow a non-supernatural view, an allegorical personification of evil, as with rabbinical interpretations of evil. The phrase \"sons of Belial\" from the Torah continued to retain currency.\n\n\n<poem>\nBELIAL came last, than whom a Spirit more lewd\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\nOr Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\nTurns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\nAnd injury and outrage: And when Night\nDarkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\nOf BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.\nWitness the Streets of SODOM, and that night\nIn GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores\nYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\n... On th' other side up rose\nBELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;\nA fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd\nFor dignity compos'd and high exploit:\nBut all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\nDropt Manna, and could make the worse appear\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\nMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;\nTo vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\nTimorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare...\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nOr, my scrofulous French novel\nSimply glance at it, you grovel\nIf I double down its pages\nWhen he gathers his greengages,\n</poem>\n\nThe 17th-Century German grimoire \"The Lesser Key of Solomon\" mentions Belial, as does Aleister Crowley's \"Goetia\" (1904) and Anton LaVey's \"The Satanic Bible\" (1969). In \"The Satanic Bible\" (\"The Book of Belial\"), Belial means \"without a master\", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.\n\nIn 1937, Edgar Cayce used the term \"sons of belial\" and \"sons of the law of one\" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the \"sleeping prophet\" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state. While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of \"worthless\" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of Atlantis.\n\nPopular culture in the last century included many references to Belial; notably in the celebrated silent film \"Nosferatu\" (1922), Aldous Huxley's novel \"Ape and Essence\" (1948), Philip K. Dick's novel \"The Divine Invasion\" (1981), the cult horror film \"Basket Case\" (1982), Dean Koontz's novel \"Phantoms\" (1983), Graham Masterton's novel \"Master of Lies\" (1991), and the horror film \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" (2005).\n\nIn real time strategy game Dungeon Keeper deeper dungeons expansion the final level is titled Belial.

In 1893, the New Zealand \"Criminal Code Act 1893\", based on the work of James Fitzjames Stephen and developments by George Burbidge in the Canadian \"Criminal Code, 1892\", omitted the common law offence of blasphemy but retained the offence of blasphemous libel in section 133 with safeguards to prevent overuse and abuse of the law. Queensland followed seven years later with the \"Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld)\" which abolished common law offences and omitted both blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the code. Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who was responsible for the development of the Queensland code, stated that it did not include those provisions of English law which were “manifestly obsolete or inapplicable to Australia”.\n\nThe New Zealand \"Crimes Act 1908\" replaced the \"Criminal Code Act 1893\" and the 1908 Act was in turn replaced by the \"Crimes Act 1961\". Section 133 on blasphemous libel in the \"New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893\" became Section 150 of the \"Crimes Act 1908\" and then Section 123 of the \"Crimes Act 1961\" with minor updating of the language. Section 6 of the 1893 Act and Section 5 of the 1908 Act abolished common law offences. Section 9 of the \"Crimes Act 1961\" expanded Section 150 of the 1908 Act to abolished all common law offences including blasphemy and blasphemous libel and any possibility of convictions under any Act of the Parliament of England, Great Brittan, or the United Kingdom; removing any ambiguity regarding the continual existence of common law offences in New Zealand. Section 123 of the 1961 Act does not define blasphemous libel or indicate the religion to which the law applies, leaving this to the common law.\n\nIn England, where the offences originated, the question was considered settled in 1838 by Gathercole's Case. Baron Charles Alderson, speaking for the court, declared that \"A person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is therefore a part of the constitution of the country\". \n\nAs New Zealand, and other states and territories within the Realm of New Zealand, have never had an established religion it is doubtful that the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were received into New Zealand or that Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 can be applied in New Zealand.\n\nThe English blasphemy laws were also received into Australian law and the question of the religion to which the laws relate has been considered by Australian law commissions. Their findings are of direct relevance to New Zealand. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission stated that \"The law of blasphemy is an ancient common law offence constituted by the publication of material which provokes outrage in Christians by insulting, ridiculing or vilifying God, Christ or the Christian religion as practised in the Church of England\".\n\nIn 1994, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission added that \"The common law offence of blasphemy applies only to scurrilous criticism of the fundamental tenets of the Church of England and other Christian denominations of coincident conviction. Such discrimination by the law in favour of a particular religion is itself an indicator of the need for review and possible reform.\"\n\nIn 1998, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a report titled \"Article 18 – Freedom of religion and belief\" made use of the following definition: \"Blasphemy is an ancient English common law offence defined as a publication containing contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ, the Bible or the formularies of the Church of England which are calculated to provoke outrage in the feelings of any sympathiser or believer in Christianity. A person who publishes any blasphemous document is guilty of publishing a blasphemous libel.\"\n\nThe New Zealand law of blasphemous libel originated with the English common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel that were intended to protect the tenets of the Church of England, but the Church of England no longer supports the retention of these laws. At a meeting in the chapel of the Houses of Parliament in early 2015, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said that Christians must stand up for religious freedom of atheists and Muslims as much as themselves and that he was opposed to all restrictions on freedom of speech concerning religion which did not constitute hate speech. He thanked the former MP Evan Harris, a humanist, for his efforts to abolish the blasphemy laws in the UK.\n\nInterviewed by The Dominion Post on 8 May 2017, Anglican Archbishop Philip Richardson said the law against blasphemous libel was pointless, saying \"My view is, God's bigger than needing to be defended by the Crimes Act\". \n. Richardson, known as Bishop of Taranaki and Tikanga Pakeha Archbishop and Primate of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, said that he found it surprising New Zealand still had a blasphemy law in place. In a different interview he added: \"It is an archaic and unhelpful law and it should be repealed. Freedom of speech is a fundamental of democracy, and indeed as any parent knows, freedom is a consequence of love.\"\n\nThe New Zealand Law Commission has not given close consideration to the abolition of New Zealand's blasphemy laws. Law Commissions in England, where the laws originated, and Australia have however considered the question and recommended the abolition of all blasphemy laws.\nIn England, the continued existence of the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel was controversial. In 1985 the Law Commission published a report on \"Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship\", that recommended the abolition of all blasphemy offences. The report noted that \"there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute\". The authors added that \"it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit.\" The Commission concluded, \"that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement\". These two offences were subsequently abolished in July 2008.\n\nAs Australian blasphemy law shares a common origin with New Zealand blasphemy law, Australian law commission reports are relevant to New Zealand.\n\nIn 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission produced Report 57 on \"Multiculturalism and the Law\" which \"considers the role of the common law offence of blasphemy in federal law\". The Commission noted that as blasphemy is not specifically defined in any Australian legislation it must be assumed that the English common law definition of blasphemy applies.\n\nThe Commission considered Australia's international obligations under covenants and conventions to which Australia is a party: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, the enjoyment of one’s culture, the profession and practice of one’s religion and the use of one’s own language in community with other members of one’s ethnic and religious community; and parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\n\nThe commission noted that blasphemy law provides only limited protection as religious affiliations are many and diverse. Although most Australians describe themselves as Christian, a growing minority (more than 300,000 in 1986) are members of non-Christian religious faiths, particularly Islam, Buddhism and Judaism, and that nearly two million Australians do not subscribe to any religion. The offence of blasphemy, however, protects only the Christian religion, with specific reference to the rituals and doctrines of the Anglican Church. Offences that involve the common law of blasphemy apply only to material that vilifies Christianity. This is not consistent with Australia’s human rights obligations.\n\nThe commission proposed that all references to ‘blasphemous’ material in federal law should be removed. The commission reported that \"it is argued that extending blasphemy law to cover all religions would raise serious difficulties in defining ‘religions’ and ‘gods’, would have grave consequences for freedom of speech and might contribute to religious conflict. On the other hand, removing all references to blasphemy in federal law would have the effect of removing an apparently preferential position of one religion and moving towards a situation of parity between religions in federal law. For this reason it should be done. In so far as blasphemy causes hurt to a person’s sensibilities, the existing provisions on offensive behaviour and other public order offences are sufficient.\" The report concluded with the recommendation that the criminal law be amended so that \"all references to blasphemy in federal legislation should be removed\".\n\nIn 1994 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission released a report on blasphemy after considering the law in New South Wales, other Australian states and territories, other jurisdictions in the region, the history of the law, international developments, freedom of speech, and public submissions. After considering possible options, the Commission recommended that all blasphemy law be abolished without replacement. The Commission pointed out that every other law reform agency in Australia and in other common law countries which had considered the question had likewise recommended the abolition of the offence of blasphemy. The report with its conclusions and recommendation is equally applicable to other Australian states and territories.\n\nTo date the only prosecution for blasphemous libel in New Zealand has been the case of John Glover, publisher of the newspaper \"The Maoriland Worker\" in 1922, although the poem was widely available at the time. The Crown laid a charge of blasphemous libel over the 12 October 1921 issue of \"The Maoriland Worker\" which included two poems by British poet Siegfried Sassoon. The alleged blasphemy was the closing lines of Sassoon's poem 'Stand-to: Good Friday Morning':\n\nThe case was tried in the Supreme Court in 1922. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty with a rider: \"That similar publications of such literature be discouraged\". The former Supreme Court was renamed the High Court in 1980. \n\nIn 1998, the Crown decided not to prosecute Te Papa museum for displaying Tania Kovats' \"Virgin in a Condom\" and Sam Taylor Woods \"Wrecked\", a contemporary version of Leonardo da Vinci's, \"The Last Supper\", which featured a topless woman at the centre of the table in place of Christ. Section 123(4) of the Crimes Act 1961 requires the leave of the Attorney-General before charges of blasphemous libel can proceed. The Attorney-General usually refuses to pursue prosecutions on the basis of free speech objections as the right to free speech is protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.\n\nApart from the use of Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961, attempts have been made to censor films and television programmes considered blasphemous using broadcasting standards and film censorship legislation such as the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 and the Broadcasting Act 1989. \n\nThe British comedy film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (1979) about a fictional Jewish man living at the same time and neighbourhood as Jesus Christ, generated significant international controversy and was banned in several countries including Ireland and Norway. Hundreds of letters were sent to the New Zealand Film Censor's Office to have the film banned in New Zealand as well on the grounds of it being 'blasphemous' against the Christian faith, but the Chief Censor of Films responded by stating that they had found no evidence of blasphemy or sacrilegiousness in the film.\n\nIn February 2006, the broadcaster CanWest screened the “Bloody Mary” episode of the South Park cartoon series featuring a menstruating Virgin Mary statue.. The following June, the Broadcasting Standards Authority responded to complaints by upholding CanWest’s right to broadcast the episode finding no breach of the Television Code of Broadcasting Practice. The High Court, considering an appeal by Bishop Denis Browne, in his capacity as the President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, affirmed the Broadcasting Standards Authority's decision in July 2007.\n\nDismissing the appeal in the High Court, Justice Wild said that he was “not prepared to second-guess the weight that the Authority accorded to the right to freedom of expression, relative to the right to respect for religious beliefs” and was not prepared to accept that the Authority was wrong to hold that the episode did not breach the standard of good taste and decency. Justice Wild noted that the four members of the Authority were unanimous and that the Conference’s sense of outrage was not shared by the wider community.\n\nNew Zealand signed the \"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\" (ICCPR) on 12 November 1968, ratified it on 28 December 1978 and it came into force on 28 March 1979. This covenant is binding on signatory countries. The UN Human Rights Committee adopted \"General Comment 34\" in July 2011 that stated in paragraph 48 that \"Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant … \". \n\nNew Zealand also signed the \"International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\" (ICERD) on the 25 October 1966 and ratified it on 22 November 1972. This Convention includes an individual complaints mechanism, effectively making it enforceable against its parties, and is monitored by the \"Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\" (CERD). Parties to ICERD undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression. \n\nNew Zealand laws that prohibit \"blasphemous libel\" and \"denigration of religion\" contravene international law, are discriminatory, and contravene New Zealand's obligations under both the ICCPR and ICERD.\n\nIn May 2017 an amendment to the omnibus Statutes Repeal Bill 2016 was tabled to repeal Section 123 of the Crimes Act, however it was voted down by one vote on the basis that the matter should be considered separately from that bill in order to allow public submissions. In 2018 a Crimes Amendment Bill was introduced that would repeal the law against blasphemous libel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "434170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=434170", "title": "Christian Rosenkreuz", "text": "Christian Rosenkreuz\n\nChristian Rosenkreuz (also spelled Rosenkreutz and Christian Rose Cross) is the legendary, possibly allegorical, founder of the Rosicrucian Order (Order of the Rose Cross). He is presented in three manifestos that were published early in the 17th century. These were:\n\n\nAccording to legend, Christian Rosenkreuz was a doctor who discovered and learned esoteric wisdom on a pilgrimage to the Middle East among Turkish, Arab and Persian sages, possibly Sufi or Zoroastrian masters, supposedly in the early 15th century (see § Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos); returned and founded the \"Fraternity of the Rose Cross\" with himself (Frater C.R.C.) as Head of the Order. Under his direction a Temple, called Sanctus Spiritus, or \"The House of the Holy Spirit\", was built.\n\nIt is described that his body, as discovered by a Brother of the Order, was in a perfect state of preservation 120 years after his death (which occurred in absolute secrecy) – as Rosenkreuz had predicted — in a heptagonal chamber erected by himself as a storehouse of knowledge. It is described that on the Sarcophagus in the centre of the Crypt of Christian Rosenkreutz were written, among other inscriptions the words, \"Jesus mihi omnia, nequaquam vacuum, libertas evangelii, dei intacta gloria, legis jugum\" (\"Jesus is everything to me, by no means empty, the freedom of the gospel, the untouched glory of God, the yoke of the law\"), testifying to the builder's Christian character.\n\nRosenkreuz's crypt, according to the description presented in the legend, is located in the interior of the Earth, recalling the alchemical motto V.I.T.R.I.O.L.:  Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (\"Visit the interior of the Earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone\").\n\nAccording to some researchers, Christian Rosenkreuz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family which flourished in the 13th century. Their castle stood in the Thuringian Forest on the Border of Hesse and they had embraced Albigensian (i.e., Cathar) doctrines, combining Gnostic and Christian beliefs. The whole family was put to death by Konrad von Marburg except for the youngest son, who was only five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk who was an Albigensian adept from Languedoc. The child was placed in a monastery which had already come under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and made the acquaintance of the four other brothers who were later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. His account derives from oral tradition.\n\nSome occultists including Rudolf Steiner, Max Heindel and (much later) Guy Ballard, have stated that Rosenkreuz later reappeared as the Count of St. Germain, a courtier, adventurer and alchemist who reportedly died on 27 February 1784. Steiner once identified Rembrandt's painting \"A Man in Armour\" as a portrait of Christian Rosenkreuz, apparently in a 17th-century manifestation. Others believe Rosenkreuz to be a pseudonym for a more famous historical figure, usually Francis Bacon. Steiner gave lectures on Rosenkreutz and Rosicrucianism.\n\nThe legend presented in the Manifestos has been interpreted symbolically (as were all hermetic and alchemical texts of those times). They do not directly state Christian Rosenkreuz's years of birth and death, but in two sentences in the second Manifesto the year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of \"our Christian Father\", and it is stated that he lived for 106 years, which would mean he died in 1484. The foundation of the Order can be supposed in similar terms to have occurred in the year 1407. However, these numbers (and deduced years) are not taken literally by many students of occultism, who consider them to be allegorical and symbolic statements for the understanding of the Initiated. The justification for this relies on the Manifestos themselves: on the one hand, the Rosicrucians clearly adopted through the Manifestos the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects, and, on the other hand, they directly state, \"We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.\"\n\nThe metaphorical nature of these legends lends a nebulous quality to the origins of Rosicrucianism. The opening of Rosenkreuz's tomb is thought to be a way of referring to the cycles in nature and to cosmic events; and as well, to the opening of new possibilities for mankind consequent on the advances of the 16th and early 17th centuries. Similarly, Rosenkreuz's pilgrimage seems to refer to the transmutation steps of the Great Work.\n\nSimilar legends may be found in Wolfram von Eschenbach's description of the Holy Grail as the \"Lapis Exillis\", guarded by the Knights Templar, or in the Philosophers' stone of the alchemists, the \"Lapis Elixir\".\n\n\n\nManifestos\n\nStudies\n"}

As Buddhism expanded from the Indian subcontinent it adopted artistic and cultural elements of host countries in other parts of Asia.\n\nEconomics or the way in which work life is organized and the demands of production are met form an integral part of any culture. Buddhist economics forms an integral part of the Buddhist culture. Buddhist Economics does not work to maximise consumption but human well-being, which lies in a simple, purposeful and dutiful life, in which rightful livelihood is earned. Human beings must remain true to their heritage and avoid materialistic pursuit. Mechanical and redundant work that deprives the soul of meaningful pursuit is looked down upon, while too much leisure also is not approved of. Women becoming part of the active workforce is considered failure of the economic system, as women have to leave looking after the children to indulge in economic way-fare, while the children are untended for.\n\nFor Buddhism, mental health is of supreme importance and individuals must strive towards improving this by practicing non-violence and refraining from sexual misconduct and lying. However, Buddhist traditions do acknowledge physical ill-being. Pain and suffering are inevitable like death, for which taking any form of medication are not prohibited. The medicines taken should not be intoxicating or affect the clarity of mind any way. Any physical ill-being must be endured with patience and steadfastness, as any form of physical suffering allows time for self-reflection and spiritual progress. The best way to cure a disease is to improve one’s diet by practicing vegetarianism, reflective of the non-violent way of living. Buddhism also lays great stress on fasting on special days which helps revitalize the physical and spiritual being. Any form of organ transplant has been viewed as a supreme form of generosity as well.\n\n\"Buddhist art\" originated in the Indian subcontinent in the centuries following the life of the historical Gautama Buddha in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world.\nA first, essentially Indian, \"aniconic phase\" (avoiding direct representations of the Buddha), was followed from around the 1st century CE by an \"iconic phase\" (with direct representations of the Buddha). From that time, Buddhist art diversified and evolved as it adapted to the new countries where the faith was expanding. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam.\n\nIn the earliest form of Buddhist art, the Buddha was not represented in human form but instead was represented using signs and symbols such as footprints or an empty throne. From the fifth century B.C. to the first century B.C., Indian artists would make scriptures which revolved around the themes of the historical life of the Buddha and the previous lives of the Buddha. The reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), is believed to be connected 70 Buddha’s sayings that disfavoured representations of himself after the extinction of his body. This phase is defined as the aniconic phase of Buddhist art. The iconic phase starts from the 1st century CE whereby the Buddha was given realistic human features and proportions.\n\n\"Buddhist religious architecture\" most notably developed in South Asia in the third century BCE.\n\nTwo types of structures are associated with early Buddhism: stupas and viharas. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the Buddha. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of Ajanta and Ellora (Maharashtra). Viharas were developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalised Buddhist monasticism. An existing example is at Nālandā, (Bihar).\n\nThe beginnings of the Buddhist school of architecture can be traced back to B.C. 255 when the Mauryan emperor Asoka established Buddhism as the state religion of his large empire and encouraged the use of architectural monuments to spread Buddhism in different places.\n\nBuddhism, which is also the first Indian religion to require large communal and monastic spaces, inspired three types of architecture; the first is the stupa, a significant object in Buddhist art and architecture. The Stupas hold the most important place among all the earliest Buddhist sculptures. On a very basic level, the Stupa is a burial mound for the Buddha. The original stupas contained the Buddha's ashes. Stupas are dome-shaped monuments, used to house Buddhists' relics or to commemorate significant facts of Buddhism.\n\nThe second type of architecture unique to Buddhism is the \"Vihara\", a Buddhist monastery that also contains a residence hall for the monks. The third type is the \"chaitya\", an assembly hall that contains a stupa (without relics). The central hall of the \"chaitya\" is arranged to allow for circumambulation of the stupa within it.\n\n\"Buddhist music\" prominently includes Honkyoku, Buddhist chant, and Shomyo. Honkyoku are the pieces of shakuhachiyoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century.\n\nBuddhist chant is the chant used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures. It includes:\n\nMusical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables.\n\nShomyo (声明) is a style of Japanese Buddhist chant; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.\n\nMany ritual musical instruments are used in association with Buddhist practice including singing bowls, bells, tingsha, drums, cymbals, wind instruments and others.\n\nThe relationship between Buddhism and music is thought to be complicated since the association of music with earthly desires led early Buddhists to condemn the musical practice, and even observation of musical performance, for monks and nuns. However, in Pure Land Buddhism Buddhist paradises are represented as musical places in which Buddhist law takes the form of melodies. Most Buddhist practices also involve chant in some form, and some also make use of instrumental music and even dance. Music can act as an offering to the Buddha, as a means of memorizing Buddhist texts, and as a form of personal cultivation or meditation.\n\nIn order to purify the hearts of listeners, Buddhist melodies are strong yet soft and pure. Buddhist music plays a central role in everyday cultural practices of Buddhists since it is also played in many ceremonies such as weddings and funerals\n\nBuddhist music developed when Buddhism spread to Tibet. The Tibetan traditions of Buddhism encouraged the use of song and dance in certain ceremonies. A wide variety of instruments such as specialized types of drums, windpipes, spiral conches, and trumpets were used in larger ceremonies.\n\nHymns are commonly used in the Buddhist culture in ceremonies for making offerings or inviting the presence of Buddha and Bodhisattvas. Buddhist hymns express the five virtuous qualities that are sincerity, elegance, clarity, depth, and equanimity and it is believed that regularly listening to Buddhist hymns or fanbei can give the following five graces: a reduction in physical fatigue, less confusion and forgetfulness, a reduction in mental fatigue, greater eloquence, and greater ease in expression and communication. Therefore, in the practice of Buddhism, hymns or fanbei have an important role in daily living, for example in repentance ceremonies. They are not designed to try to elevate or excite the emotions of participants or practitioners, but in fact aim to help conserve emotional energy, calm the thinking, lessen desire, and allow practitioners to see their true nature with clarity.\n\nBuddhist cuisine is a kind of cuisine mainly for the believers of Buddhism. It is known as zhāi cài (\"zhāi\" means \"purification\" or \"discipline\", \"cai\" means \"cuisine\" or \"vegetable\") in China, and shōjin ryōri (\"shōjin\" means \"devotion\", \"ryōri\" means \"cuisine\") in Japan, and by many other names in other countries. Due to the understanding of animals as conscious and suffering beings, many Buddhists do not kill animals and many also do not eat meat (other than that from those who died naturally, and from species where the consumption of brethren is not troubling to the still living). Certain major Mahayana sutras show the Buddha forcefully denouncing meat-consumption and advocating vegetarianism (vegetarianism in Buddhism). Some Mahāyāna Buddhists in China and Vietnam also avoid eating strong-smelling plants such as onion, garlic, chives, shallot, and leek, and refer to these as \"wu hun\" (五葷, 'Five Spices'). Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as \"seitan\" or \"wheat meat\", soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world.\n\nBuddhism forbids alcohol and other intoxicants because they may result in violations of others of the \"Five Moral Precepts\": no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying or partaking of intoxicants. In addition, intoxicants cloud the mind and interfere with the concentration needed to achieve enlightenment.\n\nSome Buddhist sects in China and Vietnam are forbidden onions, garlic, scallions, chives and leeks, which are known as \"the five pungent spices\". The spices are said to lead to anger (raw) and passion (cooked), and their odour is also said to repel Gods and attract hungry ghosts and demons.\n\nStrict adherence to vegetarianism is the rule for priests, monks, nuns and those who feel they are on the Bodhisattva path - except in some schools and sects.\n\nJapanese festivals and Barua festivals often involve Buddhist culture, as do pagoda festivals held as fairs held at Buddhist temples in Myanmar. Features of Buddhist Tibetan festivals may include the traditional cham dance, which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in India and Bhutan. Many festivals of Nepal are religious festivals involving Buddhism, as are many Burmese traditional festivals. Lunar New Year festivals of Buddhist countries in East, South and Southeast Asia include some aspects of Buddhist culture, however they are considered cultural festivals as opposed to religious ones. \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45022033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45022033", "title": "Development of Karma in Buddhism", "text": "Development of Karma in Buddhism\n\nKarma is an important topic in Buddhist thought. The concept may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism, and various interpretations have evolved throughout time. A main problem in Buddhist philosophy is how karma and rebirth are possible, when there is no self to be reborn, and how the traces or \"seeds\" of \"karma\" are stored throughout time in consciousness.\n\nThe concept of \"karma\" originated in the Vedic religion, where it was related to the performance of rituals or the investment in good deeds to ensure the entrance to heaven after death, while other persons go to the underworld.\n\nThe concept of karma may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism. Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism, noting that \"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\" Langer notes that originally karman may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth. Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance. Buswell too notes that \"Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, \"trsna\"), as the cause of karmic consequences.\" Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.\n\nAccording to Vetter, the \"Buddha at first sought, and realized, \"the deathless\" (\"amata/amrta\"), which is concerned with the here and now. Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth.\" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha \"introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time.\" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.\n\nThe doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right.\n\nThe understanding of rebirth, and the reappearance in accordance with one's deeds, are the first two knowledges that the Buddha is said to have acquired at his enlightenment. According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha gained full and complete insight into the workings of karma at the time of his enlightenment. According to Bronkhorst, these knowledges are later additions to the story, just like the notion of \"liberating insight\" itself. According to Tilmann Vetter, originally only the practice of dhyana, and the resulting calming of the mind may have constituted the liberating practice of the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Vetter, probably in the first centuries after the Buddha's death the following\nideas were introduced or became important:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7259439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7259439", "title": "Dönmeh", "text": "Dönmeh\n\nThe Dönmeh () were a group of crypto-Sabbateans (commonly referred to as crypto-Jews) in the Ottoman Empire who converted publicly to Islam, but were said to have retained their beliefs. The movement was centered in Salonica. The group originated during and soon after the era of Sabbatai Zevi, a 17th-century Jewish kabbalist who claimed to be the Messiah and eventually converted to Islam in order to escape punishment by the Sultan Mehmed IV. After Zevi's conversion, a number of Jews followed him into Islam and became the Dönmeh. Since the 20th century, assimilated Dönmeh might have intermarried with other groups and most have assimilated into Turkish society.\n\nThe Turkish word \"dönme\" is from the verbal root \"dön-\" that means 'to turn', i.e., \"to convert\", but in a pejorative sense. They are also called \"Selânikli\" \"person from Thessaloniki\" or \"avdetî\" \"religious convert\" ( \"‘awdah\" 'return'). Members of the group refer to themselves simply as \"the Believers\" in Hebrew ( \"ha-Ma'aminim\"), or \"sazanikos,\" Turkish for \"carp\" in honor of the changing outward nature of the fish. An alternate explanation of this self-nomenclature is the prophecy that Sabbatai Zevi would deliver the Jews under the sign of the fish.\n\nDespite their conversion to Islam, the Sabbateans secretly remained close to Judaism and continued to practice Jewish rituals covertly. They recognized Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) as the Jewish Messiah, observed certain commandments with similarities to those in Judaism, and prayed in Hebrew and later in Ladino. They also observed rituals celebrating important events in Zevi's life and interpreted Zevi's conversion in a Kabbalistic way.\n\nThere are several branches of the Dönmeh group. The first is the İzmirli, formed in İzmir, Turkey (\"Smyrna\"). This was the original sect, from which two others eventually split. The first schism created the sect of the Jakubi, founded by Jacob Querido (ca. 1650–1690), the brother of Zevi's last wife. Querido claimed to be Zevi's reincarnation and a messiah in his own right. The second split from the İzmirli was the result of claims that Berechiah Russo, known in Turkish as Osman Baba, was truly the next reincarnation of Zevi's soul. These allegations gained following and gave rise to the Karakashi (Turkish), or Konioso (Ladino), branch, the most numerous and strictest branch of the Dönmeh. Missionaries from the Karakashi were active in Poland in the first part of the 18th century and taught Jacob Frank (1726–1791), the alleged heir of Russo's soul. Frank went on to create the Frankist sect, another non-Dönmeh Sabbatean group in Eastern Europe. Yet another group, the Lechli, of Polish descent, lived in exile in Salonika (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) and Constantinople.\n\nAccording to anti-Semite —Islamist and neo-Nazi— conspiracy theorists, several leading members of the Young Turk movement, a group of modernist revolutionaries who brought down the Ottoman Empire, were Dönmeh. At the time of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, some among the Salonika Dönmeh tried to be recognized as non-Muslims to avoid being forced to leave the city. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1922–1923, the Dönmeh strongly supported the Republican, pro-Western reforms of Atatürk that tried to restrict the power of the religious establishment and to modernize society. In particular, the Dönmeh were instrumental in establishing trade, industry, and culture in the emerging Republic of Turkey, which is partially due to the prominence of Rumeli immigrants in general, and of Salonika in particular, in the early Republic years.\n\nAn interesting case is the one of Ilgaz Zorlu, a Dönmeh publisher who founded \"Zvi Publishers\" in 2000 and sought recognition as a Jew, but a Beth Din refused to recognize his Jewishness without a full conversion. He claimed to have converted in Israel and then filed a lawsuit for changing his religion from Islam to Judaism in his registry records and identification. The court voted in his favor.\n\nIşık University, which is the part of the Feyziye Schools Foundation (, FMV), and Terakkî schools were founded by the Dönmeh community in Thessaloniki in the last quarter of the 19th century and continued their activities in Istanbul after Greeks captured the city on 9 November 1912.\n\nThere is a community of Dönmehs living in Yeniköy district of İstanbul.\n\nThe independent scholar Rifat Bali defines the term \"dönme\" as follows:\n\n\"The term Donme is a Turkish gerund meaning ‘to turn, revolve or return' and, by extension, “to betray” (i.e., ‘go back on’) and ‘to convert’ to another religion. It has come in popular parlance to refer to religious converts in general, and, more specifically, to the seventeenth century followers of the Jewish false messiah Sabbatai Sevi and their descendants, who outwardly converted to Islam but retained their secretive religious practices over the next several centuries, maintaining close communal and blood ties and practicing strict endogamy. While the great majority of the community’s members abandoned their practices during the first quarter century, their past identity has continued to haunt them within Turkish society, and the term Dönme itself remains one of opprobrium.\"\n\nThe Dönmeh ideology of the 17th century revolved primarily around the Eighteen Precepts, an abridged version of the Ten Commandments in which the admonition against adultery is explained as more of a precautionary measure than a ban, likely included to explain the antinomian sexual activities of the Sabbateans. The additional commandments are concerned with defining the kinds of interactions that may occur between the Dönmeh and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The most basic of these laws of interaction was to avoid marriage with either Jews or Muslims and to prefer relations within the sect to those outside of it. In spite of this, they maintained ties with Sabbateans who had not converted and even with Jewish rabbis, who secretly settled disputes within the Dönmeh concerning Jewish law.\n\nAs far as ritual was concerned, the Dönmeh followed both Jewish and Muslim traditions, shifting between one and the other as necessary for integration into Ottoman society. Outwardly Muslims and secretly Jewish Sabbateans, the Dönmeh observed traditional Muslim holidays like Ramadan but also kept the Jewish Sabbath, Brit milah and major holidays. Much of Dönmeh ritual is a combination of various elements of Kabbalah, Sabbateanism, Jewish traditional law, and Sufism.\n\nDönmeh liturgy evolved as the sect grew and spread. At first, much of the Dönmeh literature was written in Hebrew. Later, as the group developed, Ladino replaced Hebrew as the prominent language and became not only the vernacular language, but also the liturgical language. Though the Dönmeh had branched into several sects, all of them held the view that Zevi was the divine messiah and that he had revealed the true \"spiritual Torah\" which was superior to the practical earthly Torah. The Dönmeh created and celebrated holidays pertaining to various points in Zevi's life and their own history of conversion. Based at least partially in the Kabbalistic understanding of divinity, the Dönmeh believed that there was a three-way connection of the emanations of the divine, which engendered much conflict with Muslim and Jewish communities alike. The most notable source of opposition from other contemporary religions was the common practice of exchanging wives between members of the Dönmeh.\n\nThe hierarchy of the Dönmeh was based in branch divisions. The Ismirli lay at the top of the hierarchy, composed of merchant classes and intelligentsia. Artisans tended to be mostly Karakashi while lower classes were mostly Jakubi. Each branch had its own prayer community, organized into a \"Kahal,\" or congregation (Hebrew). An extensive internal economic network provided support for lower class Dönmeh in spite of ideological differences between branches.\n\nTurkish anti-Semitism and the conspiracy theories upon which it relies are centred on the mysterious figure of the Dönmeh. According to historian Marc David Baer, the phenomenon has deep roots in late-Ottoman history, and its legacy of conspiratorial accusations persisted throughout the history of the Turkish Republic and is kept alive there today. Modern anti-Semitism racially essentializes the Jew as a ubiquitous, homogenous unit acting undercover in the guise of diverse global groups, inexorably in pursuit of global political and economic control via secretive channels. As a crypto-Sabbatean sect, the Dönmeh were always an easy target of canards about secret, “crypto-Jewish” political control and social influence, whether charged with setting in motion political upheaval against the status quo, or accused of shaping an oppressive regime’s grip on the status quo.\n\nThe Dönmeh’s history of Sabbatean theological and ritual secrecy grounded in Jewish tradition, coupled with public observance of Islam, make accusations of secret Jewish control convenient, according to Baer. “Secret Jew,” then, takes on a double meaning of being both secretly Jewish and Jews who act secretively to exert control; their secret religious identity in the first place is compatible, for conspiracy theorists, with their secretive influence, especially when they cannot be distinguished from ordinary Turkish Muslims who reside everywhere, and, as Baer argues, when the modern antisemite sees the Jew as necessarily “everywhere.” The Dönmeh’s maneuverings were said to have been at the core of Young Turk Revolution and their overthrow of the Sultan Abdülhamid II, the dissolution of the Ottoman religious establishment, and the founding of a secular republic. Pro-Sultan, religious Muslim political opponents painted these events as a global Jewish and Freemason plot carried out by Turkey’s secret Jews, the Dönmeh, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the chief revolutionary and former member of the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP), a leading Dönmeh himself.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto-Jewish conspiracy claim has been used throughout modern Turkish history by rightists and Islamists to undermine the legitimacy of incumbent political leadership, and, today, by leftists and secularists seeking to undermine the political legitimacy of Erdogan and the origins of Islamism more broadly. These, like other claims of Jewish aspirations to world-domination, embodied in part by the successes of Zionism, join the ranks as examples of both the enduring nature of such canards in contemporary Turkey, and of their deep-seated relationship with pervasive, worldwide theories of political conspiracy propagated by radically different political elements often simultaneously.\n\nIn 1924, Mehmet Karakaşzade Rüştü, a Karakash Dönmeh, made allegations about Dönmehs, branches and wife-swapping rituals to \"Vakit\" newspaper. He also accused Donmehs of lacking patriotism and not having been assimilated. Discussions spread into other newspapers including the ones owned by Dönmeh groups. Ahmet Emin Yalman, in the newspaper (\"Vatan\") he owned, accepted the existence of such groups, but claimed that those groups were no longer following their traditions. Then Karakaşzade Rüştü petitioned the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to request the abolition of some Dönmehs' ongoing immigration from Macedonia by population exchange.\n\n\n"}

Jeffreys was an evangelist with a Welsh Congregational church background. He was converted at age 15 during the Welsh Revival of 1904. Alexander A. Boddy, Vicar of All Saints, Monkwearmouth, Sunderland invited him to preach at his International Pentecostal Convention in Sunderland in May 1913. Between 1915 and 1934, Jeffreys was extremely active as a revivalist, and preached to large crowds throughout the United Kingdom. The church was brought together, first as the Elim Evangelistic Band, but this was changed to Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance when the Deed Poll was registered in April 1934. The name 'Elim' was taken from the account in the Book of Exodus, chapter 15, verse 27, where the Israelites, leaving the bondage of Egypt under the leadership of Moses, found an oasis called Elim: \"Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters.\" This represented a place of refreshing and it was thought appropriate for a revival movement at that time.\n\nDifferences of opinion over Jeffreys' open espousal of British Israelism and disputes on church governance led Jeffreys to withdraw from the Elim Pentecostal Church in 1939 and to form the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship in Nottingham, which founded other churches throughout England until the 1960s, but that now only continues as a small fellowship. The presidency of Elim then passed to George Kingston, a wealthy businessman who had founded many of the Elim congregations in Essex.\n\nOn the night of 23 June 1978, eight British missionaries and four young children (including a three-week-old baby) connected with the Elim Mission in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) were bayoneted to death by guerrilla fighters. Most of the women were raped. This brutal massacre in the Vumba and the ministry of Elim in Zimbabwe was commemorated in the 2017 book \"The Axe and the Tree\" by Stephen Griffiths.\n\nElim Pentecostal beliefs include: the Bible as divinely inspired; the three in one as the Godhead; the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and his complete humanity and sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, heavenly intercession, the second coming of Jesus; the universal sinfulness of mankind; the work of the Holy Spirit in conviction, repentance, regeneration and sanctification according to Acts 2:38; the baptism of the Holy Spirit \"with signs following\"; that salvation is received by faith alone and evidenced by the fruit of the Spirit. The baptism of believers by immersion and Communion are held to be ordinances.\n\nThe Elim Pentecostal Church has experienced steady growth and now numbers 600 churches in the United Kingdom and 4367 worldwide, with a weekly attendance of about 55,000 in the U.K and almost 320,000 overseas. Kensington Temple of London is the largest church in the denomination. Elim Missions exist in 35 countries with hospitals, orphanages, and schools, although the denomination has churches in 50 countries. The church operates Regents Theological College in Malvern, Worcestershire, where the movement's headquarters are also based.\n\nThe authority of governance of the church is rested in the annual Conference. Guidance of the denomination is placed in the National Leadership Team and the General Superintendent between sessions. Chris Cartwright has served as General Superintendent since 2016, superseding John Glass. Elim headquarters is in Malvern, alongside its Bible College. Elim became a founding member of the Pentecostal Churches of the United Kingdom in 1998. It has been a member of the Evangelical Alliance for many years.\n\nThough the local congregations are commonly and popularly known as \"Elim Pentecostal Churches\", the legal name of the denomination is still \"Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance\", which is based on the church's stand for four fundamental claims – \"\"Jesus Christ as the Saviour, Healer, Baptiser in the Holy Spirit, and Coming King\".\"\n\nThe standard hymnal of the Elim Church has been the Redemption Hymnal in the past. Today however, the music and worship is mainly modern and contemporary worship songs with some traditional hymns alongside. Now Elim has its own Worship Department writing songs and training worship teams called 'Elim Sound'.\n\n"}

This led to the foundation of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919.\n\nThe party was established when two groups, simultaneously but independently of each other, decided to organize themselves into independent political formations in the Third International. The original groups based in Tashkent and Temjassovo, Bashkiria, were supplemented by activists from Bukhara and Kirghizia following a chance meeting in Moscow in November 1919. They decided to draw up a 12-point programme. Despite obvious signs that their organizing as a separate party would be unacceptable to the Comintern, they nevertheless met in June 1920, and decided to proceed, taking no account of the programme and regulations of the Third International.\n\nDuring the Congress of the Peoples of the East, their organizational committee met, including Validov and Dzhanuzakov. A new programme of 27 points was hammered out, and Abdulhamid Arifov - at that time the military commissar of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic - replaced Dzhanuzakov on the committee.\n\nThe committee met again 7 - 10 January 1921, this time in Bukhara, when they changed the name to \"Turkestan Sosialistlar Tüdesi\" (Circle of Turkestan Socialists) abbreviated to \"Tüde\". In April that same year, with representatives from Khorezm, the programme was reduced to 9 points. In 1926 the name was changed to \"Sosialist ERK Firkasi\" (Socialist Party of Turkestan ERK).\n"}

It represents the fourth [higher] subplane of the physical plane (a hyperplane), the lower three being the states of solid, liquid, and gaseous matter. The idea was later used by authors such as Alice Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, Walter John Kilner and others.\n\nThe term aether (also written as \"ether\") was adopted from ancient Greek philosophy and science into Victorian physics (see Luminiferous aether) and utilised by Madame Blavatsky to correspond to akasha, the fifth element (quintessence) of Hindu metaphysics. \n\nThe Greek word \"aither\" derives from an Indo-European root \"aith\"- (\"burn, shine\"). Blavatsky also related the idea to the Hindu \"Prana\" principle, the vital, life-sustaining force of living beings, present in all natural processes of the universe. Prana was first expounded in the Upanishads, where it is part of the worldly, physical realm, sustaining the body and the mind. Blavatsky also tended to use the word \"astral\" indiscriminately for these supposed subtle physical phenomena. The esoteric concepts of Adi, the Buddhic plane, the causal plane, and the monadic plane are also related to that of the etheric plane.\n\nLeadbeater and Besant (both belonging to the Adyar School of Theosophy) conceived that the etheric plane constituted four higher subplanes of the physical plane. According to the Theosophist Geoffrey A. Farthing, Leadbeater used the term, because of its resonance in the physical sciences, to describe his clairvoyant investigations of sub-atomic physics. \n\nSimilarly according to the Rosicrucian writings of American occultist and mystic Max Heindel there is - in addition to the solids, liquids, and gases which compose the \"Chemical Region\" of the Physical World - a finer grade of matter called ether that permeates the atomic structure of the earth and its atmosphere. It is disposed in four grades of density and is considered to be a kind of physical matter (the blue haze seen in mountain canyons is said to be in fact ether of the kind known to occult investigators as \"chemical ether\"). Associated there is also a type of spiritual sight, that man will eventually develop, called \"etheric vision\". Ether is reported to be of four kinds, or grades of density in our planet Earth; their names (from the lowest or most dense to the highest or most subtle one) and their relation to the human being, from the point of view of these Esoteric Christian teachings, is as following:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "347423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347423", "title": "Flamen", "text": "Flamen\n\nA flamen was a priest of the ancient Roman religion who was assigned to one of fifteen deities with official cults during the Roman Republic. The most important three were the \"flamines maiores\" (or \"major priests\"), who served the three chief Roman gods of the Archaic Triad. The remaining twelve were the \"flamines minores\" (\"lesser priests\"). Two of the \"minores\" cultivated deities whose names are now unknown; among the others are deities about whom little is known other than the name. During the Imperial era, the cult of a deified emperor (\"divus\") also had a flamen.\n\nThe fifteen Republican flamens were part of the Pontifical College which administered state-sponsored religion. When the office of flamen was vacant, a pontifex could serve as a temporary replacement, although only the Pontifex Maximus is known to have substituted for the Flamen Dialis, one of the \"flamines maiores\".\n\nBy the time of the religious reformation of Augustus, the origins and functions of many of the long-neglected gods resident in Rome was confusing even to the Romans themselves. The obscurity of some of the deities assigned a flamen (for example Falacer, Palatua, Quirinus and Volturnus) suggests that the office dated back to Archaic Rome. Many scholars assume that the \"flamines\" existed at least from the time of the early Roman kings, before the establishment of the Republic. The Romans themselves credited the foundation of the priesthood to Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome. According to Livy, Numa created the offices of the three \"flamines maiores\" and assigned them each a fine robe of office and a curule chair. The \"flamines\" were circumscribed by many taboos.\n\nThe origin of the word \"flamen\" is as obscure as are some of the assigned gods. Sophus Bugge suggested in 1879 that \"flamen\" is from an older *\"flădmen\" and related to the Germanic \"blót\". Both would be derived from a Proto-Indo-European word *\"bhlād(s)men\". Indo-Europeanist Georges Dumézil attempted to link it to the Sanskrit word \"brahman\". This etymology is still controversial.\n\nThe official costume of a flamen, allegedly of great antiquity, was a hat called an \"apex\" and a heavy cloak called a \"laena\". The laena was a double-thick wool cloak with a fringed edge, and was worn over the flamen's toga with a clasp to hold it around his throat. The \"apex\" was a leather skull-cap with a chin-strap and a point of olive wood on its top, like a spindle, with a little fluff of wool at the base of the spindle.\n\nThe three flamines maiores were required to be patricians:\n\nA fourth \"flamen maior\" was dedicated to Julius Caesar as a divinity (\"divus\") of the Roman state. Thereafter, any deceased emperor could be made \"divus\" by vote of the senate and consent of his successor, and as a \"divus\" he would be served by a flamen. The flamen's role in relation to living emperors is uncertain; no living emperor is known to have received official divine worship; see Imperial cult.\n\nA flamen could also be represented by a \"proflamen\", or by a member without that title who could act as a substitute for the flamen (\"qui vice flaminis fungebatur\").\n\nThe twelve flamines minores could be plebeians. Some of the deities whose cult they tended were rather obscure, and only ten are known by name:\n\n\nThere were two other \"flamines minores\" during the Republican period, but the names of the deities they cultivated are unknown. The \"flamines minores\" seem mostly connected to agriculture or local cults. The change to an urban way of life may explain why these deities lost their importance or fell into oblivion.\n\nThe \"Floralis\" and \"Pomonalis\" are not recorded in calendars as their festivals were moveable. Some information exists for the ritual roles of the \"Portunalis\" in connection with the cult of the god Quirinus and \"Volcanalis\" in connexion with the cult of the goddess Maia on the Kalends of May. Also preserved is the list of deities invoked by the \"flamen Cerialis\" when he officiated at sacrifices to the goddesses Ceres and Tellus.\n\nScholars disagree about some differences among \"flamines maiores\" and \"minores\". Some maintain the difference was not substantial. Others, among them Dumézil, believe that inherent differences lay in the right of the \"auspicia maiora\" and the ritual of inauguration that concerned only the \"maiores\" by birth as \"farreati\", that is, as children of parents married through the ritual of confarreatio, which was the form of marriage in turn required for \"maiores\". The \"maiores\" also had the privilege of having \"calatores\", assistants who carried out day-to-day business. The difference would thus be akin to that between magistracies with \"imperium\" and those with \"potestas\" only.\n\n"}

Religious organizations that do not engage in such activity may still choose to register to obtain a legal identity, which is desirable when entering into contracts. Any religious organization wishing to register with the Government must possess a charter, have nonprofit status, include all names used by the group (to ensure that names of previously registered groups are not used without their permission), and provide signatures of at least 15 members. In addition, groups must file a petition with the Ministry of Government, using a licensed attorney, and pay a $100 registration fee. During the period covered by this report, the Government continued to streamline the registration process for religious groups.\n\nThe Government permits missionary activity and public religious expression by all religious groups.\n\nThe Government does not generally permit religious instruction in public schools. Private schools have complete liberty to provide religious instruction, as do parents in the home.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contribute to the generally free practice of religion. Catholics reportedly complained that the Government restricted access for ecological reasons to the Galápagos Islands to the extent that foreign missionaries had difficulty ministering to the 14,500 resident Catholics. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nOn August 27, 2006, two military officers (Ivan Santi Mucushigua and Cervantes Santamaria Cuji) and a civilian (Lucio Cirilo Dahua) allegedly killed Balti Cadena, a traditional healer (yachak), and injured one of his sons, near the Amazonas Military Fort in Puyo, Pastaza Province. The Public Prosecutor, in a civilian court, charged the two military officers with murder. At the end of the reporting period, the officers were held at the Amazonas Military Fort and had appealed to the Superior Court of Puyo. Press reports added that at least four traditional healers have been killed in the past 10 years in the same area.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\n\nThere were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Many religious groups increased their outreach efforts to their counterparts during the period covered by this report.\n"}

On 7 March 1918, the same day he took \"sannyasa,\" he established the Sri Chaitanya Math in Mayapura in West Bengal, later recognised as the parent body of all the Gaudiya Math branches. Its purpose was to spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the philosophy of the medieval Vaisnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, through preaching and publishing.\n\nFrom the beginning of Chaitanya's \"bhakti\" movement in Bengal, devotees, including Haridasa Thakur and others, whether Muslim or Hindu by birth, have been participants. This openness and disregard for the traditional caste system received a boost from the \"broad-minded vision\" of Bhaktivinoda Thakura, a nineteenth-century magistrate and prolific writer on \"bhakti\" topics, and was institutionalised by his son and successor Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura in the twentieth-century Gaudiya Math.\n\nThe Gaudiya Math had established 64 branches. Most were in India, but preaching centres were maintained for a time in Burma, England and Germany. The first European preaching center was established in London in 1933 (London Glouster House, Cornwall Garden, W7 South Kensington) under the name Gaudiya Mission Society of London'. Lord Zetland, the English Secretary of State, was the president of this society.\nThe second European preaching center was opened by Swami B.H. Bon Maharaj in Berlin (W30 Eisenacherstr. 29).\n\nSoon after the Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's death (1 January 1937), a dispute began and the original Gaudiya Math mission divided into two administrative bodies which continued preaching on their own, up to the present day. In a settlement they divided the 64 Gaudiya Math centers into two groups. Sri Chaitanya Math Branch were headed by Srila Bhakti Vilasa Tirtha Maharaj. Gaudiya Mission were headed by Ananta Vasudev Prabhu, who became known as Srila Bhakti Prasad Puri Maharaj after accepting sannyasa for short duration.\n\nMany of the disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati did not agree with the spirit of these newly created two fractions, or were simply inspired to expand the mission of their guru on their own enthusiasm, started their own missions. Many of these autonomous missions are still known as Gaudiya Math. Some of the other new missions are:\n\n\nSome are very large missions, and some are smaller branches started by individual Vaisnavas. What they hold in common is that they are autonomous branches of the tree of the Gaudiya Math. Almost all of them have published books and periodicals and opened one or more temples.\n"}

According to \"Bhagavata Purana\" one of Hinduism's major religious works, the Gomti is one of India's transcendental rivers. The rare Gomti Chakra is found there.\n\nThe Gomti, a monsoon- and groundwater-fed river, originates from Gomat Taal (formally known as Fulhaar jheel) near Madho Tanda, Pilibhit, India. It extends through Uttar Pradesh and meets the Ganges near Saidpur, Kaithi, from Varanasi district.\n\nIt meets a small river, the Gaihaaee, from its origin. The Gomti is a narrow stream until it reaches Mohammadi Kheri, a tehsil of Lakhimpur Kheri district (about 100 km from its origin), where it is joined by tributaries such as the Sukheta, Choha and Andhra Choha. The river is then well-defined, with the Kathina tributary joining it at Mailani and Sarayan joining it at a village in Sitapur district. A major tributary is the Sai River, which joins the Gomti near Jaunpur. The Markandey Mahadeo temple is at the confluence of the Gomti and the Ganges.\n\nAfter the Gomti enters Lucknow, meandering through the city for about and supplying its water. In the Lucknow area, 25 city drains pour untreated sewage into the river. At the downstream end, the Gomti barrage converts the river into a lake.\n\nIn addition to Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur Kerakat and Jaunpur are the most prominent of the 15 towns in the river's catchment basin. The river cuts the Sultanpur district and Jaunpur in half, becoming wider in the city.\n\nThe Gomti River is polluted at several points of its course through the stretch of alluvial plains in Uttar Pradesh. The major sources of pollution are industrial waste and effluent from sugar factories and distilleries and residential wastewater and sewage.\n\nThe river and its tributaries, such as Kukrail Drainage, collect large amounts of human and industrial pollutants as they flow through an area of about 18 million people. High pollution levels threaten the Gomti's aquatic life. On 25 July 2008, the foundation stone of a -capacity sewage treatment plant was laid.\n\nThe plant, promoted as Asia's largest, failed; in 2014 it was reportedly running at 10 percent of capacity, and beyond the plant (near Bharwara) untreated sewage and solid waste entered the river. The plant was intended to intercept the 23 major natural drains entering the Gomti.\n\nThe Gomti has been stressed, particularly in and around Lucknow, for decades. There are three major issues: \n\nAlthough government agencies planned major projects, such as the Bharwara sewage treatment plant and mechanical dredging, most were unsuccessful. The Gomti rises by 10–12 meters during the monsoon, and in 2008 a major flood was reported.\n\nAround 2012, the newly-elected government and the Lucknow Development Authority began a feasibility study with the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee to build a river-front similar to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. The LDA submitted the report, warning about the negative consequences of reducing the Gomti to less than 250 meters wide. At 250 meters wide (with walls on both sides), the river's velocity would increase by 20 percent and its bed-shear stress by 30 percent. Current embankments would have to be raised by 1.5 meters, and the high flood level (HFL) would increase by 1.25 meters. Two bridges would be threatened with collapse under flood conditions.\nThe plan was given to the irrigation department, which signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Roorkee in December 2015 to conduct a similar study on the project.\n\nThe riverfront-development project is seen as a political showdown between the state government and the ruling party, whose similar construction in Ahmedabad over the Sabarmati River has been projected as a showcase of development in the state of Gujarat. Many noted environmentalists and river-system experts vehemently opposed that project as well.\nBoth projects are seen as a template for similar interference with river systems across India, including the Yamuna, the Hindon and the Varuna.\n\nMonsoon flooding leads to several problems when the water recedes, including the danger posed by drying potholes and pits (which host disease causing mosquitoes such as malaria and dengue).\n\n\n"}

Hyperreligiosity generally includes abnormal beliefs and a focus on religious content, which interferes with work and social functioning. Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including epilepsy, psychotic disorders and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Hyperreligiosity is a symptom of Geschwind syndrome, which is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nHyperreligiosity is characterized by an increased tendency to report spiritual, religious or mystical experiences, religious delusions, rigid legalistic thoughts, and extravagant expression of religiosity. Hyperreligiosity may also include religious hallucinations.\n\nHyperreligiosity may be associated with epilepsy — in particular temporal lobe epilepsy involving complex partial seizures — mania, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, hallucinogen related psychosis and psychotic disorder. In persons with epilepsy episodic hyperreligosity may occur ictally or postictally, but is usually a chronic personality feature that occurs interictally. Hyperrelgiosity was associated in one small study with decreased right hippocampal volume. The medial prefrontal cortex may play a role in controlling religiousness, and dysfunction may lead to hyperreligiosity. Increased activity in the left temporal regions has been associated with hyperreligiosity in psychotic disorders.

{"id": "555881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555881", "title": "Innocence", "text": "Innocence\n\nInnocence is a lack of guilt, with respect to any kind of crime, or wrongdoing. In a legal context, innocence is to the lack of legal guilt of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.\n\nInnocence can imply lesser experience in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale. In contrast to \"ignorance\", it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology explaining \"innocent\" as meaning \"not knowing\" (Latin \"noscere\" (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix \"in-\" and the Latin \"nocere\", \"to harm\".\n\nPeople who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior. From this meaning comes the usage of \"innocent\" as a noun to refer to a child under the age of reason, or a person, of any age, who is severely mentally disabled. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.\n\nIn some cases, the term \"innocence\" has a pejorative meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience. Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's point of view, innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.\n\nThe lamb is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In Christianity, for example, Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\", thus emphasizing his sinless nature. Other symbols of innocence include children, virgins, acacia branches (especially in Freemasonry), non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color white (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).\n\nA \"loss of innocence\" is a common theme in fiction, pop culture, and realism. It is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like \"American Pie\", poetry like William Blake's collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience and novels like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"A Farewell to Arms\", and \"Lord of the Flies\".\n\nBy contrast, the \"I Ching\" urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and \"encourages you to \"actively practice innocence\"\".\n\nInnocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the \"loss\" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with \"innocence\", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to \"white childhood\" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from \"innocence\" but from childhood as well.\n\nThe psychoanalytic tradition is broadly divided between those (like Fairbairn and Winnicott) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or psychological trauma; and those (like Freud and Klein) who see the child as \"developing\" innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the Oedipus complex and/or the depressive position.\n\nMore eclectically, Eric Berne saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and \"the sweet phrases of charming innocence\". In a rather different formulation, Christopher Bollas used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint - something akin to what he calls \"the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24997796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24997796", "title": "Islamic influences on Western art", "text": "Islamic influences on Western art\n\nIslamic influences on Western art refers to the influence of Islamic art, the artistic production in the Islamic world from the 8th to the 19th century, on Christian art. During this period, the frontier between Christendom and the Islamic world varied a lot resulting in some cases in exchanges of populations and of corresponding art practices and techniques. Furthermore, the two civilizations had regular relationships through diplomacy and trade that facilitated cultural exchanges. Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen. Glass production, for example, remained a Jewish speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in Coptic Egypt continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.\n\nIslamic decorative arts were highly valued imports to Europe throughout the Middle Ages; largely because of unsuspected accidents of survival the majority of surviving examples are those that were in the possession of the church. In the early period textiles were especially important, used for church vestments, shrouds, hangings and clothing for the elite. Islamic pottery of everyday quality was still preferred to European wares. Because decoration was mostly ornamental, or small hunting scenes and the like, and inscriptions were not understood, Islamic objects did not offend Christian sensibilities.\n\nIn the early centuries of Islam the most important points of contact between the Latin West and the Islamic world from an artistic point of view were Southern Italy and Sicily and the Iberian peninsula, which both held significant Muslim populations. Later the Italian maritime republics were important in trading artworks. In the Crusades Islamic art seems to have had relatively little influence even on the Crusader art of the Crusader kingdoms, though it may have stimulated the desire for Islamic imports among Crusaders returning to Europe.\n\nNumerous techniques from Islamic art formed the basis of art in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture of Norman Sicily, much of which used Muslim artists and craftsmen working in the style of their own tradition. Techniques included inlays in mosaics or metals, ivory carving or porphyry, sculpture of hard stones, and bronze foundries. In Iberia the Mozarabic art and architecture of the Christian population living under Muslim rule remained very Christian in most ways, but showed Islamic influences in other respects; much what was described as this is now called Repoblación art and architecture. After the Reconquista Mudéjar styles produced by Muslim or Morisco artists now under Christian rule showed clear Islamic influence in many ways.\n\nIslamic art was widely imported and admired by European elites during the Middle Ages. There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards. Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions. Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted tiles, from as early as 862-3 (at the Great Mosque of Kairouan in modern Tunisia), which also spread to Europe. According to John Ruskin, the Doge's Palace in Venice contains \"three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world. ... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence\".\n\nIslamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the Balkans, all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian Crusaders equally ruled Islamic populations. Crusader art is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the Mozarabic art of Christians in Al Andaluz seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at Moissac in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the lintel above, and also in having \"Christ in Majesty\" surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their diwan. Calligraphy, ornament and the decorative arts generally were more important than in the West.\n\nThe Hispano-Moresque pottery wares of Spain were first produced in Al-Andaluz, but Muslim potters then seem to have emigrated to the area of Christian Valencia, where they produced work that was exported to Christian elites across Europe; other types of Islamic luxury goods, notably silk textiles and carpets, came from the generally wealthier eastern Islamic world itself (the Islamic conduits to Europe west of the Nile were, however, not wealthier), with many passing through Venice. However, for the most part luxury products of the court culture such as silks, ivory, precious stones and jewels were imported to Europe only in an unfinished form and manufactured into the end product labelled as \"eastern\" by local medieval artisans. They were free from depictions of religious scenes and normally decorated with ornament, which made them easy to accept in the West, indeed by the late Middle Ages there was a fashion for pseudo-Kufic imitations of Arabic script used decoratively in Western art.\n\nA wide variety of portable objects from various decorative arts were imported from the Islamic world into Europe during the Middle Ages, mostly through Italy, and above all Venice. In many areas European-made goods could not match the quality of Islamic or Byzantine work until near the end of the Middle Ages. Luxury textiles were widely used for clothing and hangings and also, fortunately for art history, also often as shrouds for the burials of important figures, which is how most surviving examples were preserved. In this area Byzantine silk was influenced by Sassanian textiles, and Islamic silk by both, so that is hard to say which culture's textiles had the greatest influence on the Cloth of St Gereon, a large tapestry which is the earliest and most important European imitation of Eastern work. European, especially Italian, cloth gradually caught up with the quality of Eastern imports, and adopted many elements of their designs.\n\nByzantine pottery was not produced in high-quality types, as the Byzantine elite used silver instead. Islam has many hadithic injunctions against eating off precious metal, and so developed many varieties of fine pottery, often influenced by the Chinese porcelain wares which had the highest status among the Islamic elites themselves — the Islamic only produced porcelain in the modern period. Much Islamic pottery was imported into Europe, dishes (\"bacini\") even in Islamic Al-Andaluz in the 13th century, in Granada and Málaga, where much of the production was already exported to Christian countries. Many of the potters migrated to the area of Valencia, long reconquered by the Christians, and production here outstripped that of Al-Andaluz. Styles of decoration gradually became more influenced by Europe, and by the 15th century the Italians were also producing lustrewares, sometimes using Islamic shapes like the albarello. Metalwork forms like the zoomorphic jugs called aquamanile and the bronze mortar were also introduced from the Islamic world.\n\nMudéjar art is a style influenced by Islamic art that developed from the 12th century until the 16th century in the Iberia's Christian kingdoms. It is the consequence of the \"\" between the Muslim, Christian and Jewish populations in medieval Spain. The elaborate decoration typical of Mudéjar style fed into the development of the later Plateresque style in Spanish architecture, combining with late Gothic and Early Renaissance elements.\n\nThe Arabic Kufic script was often imitated in the West during the Middle-Ages and the Renaissance, to produce what is known as pseudo-Kufic: \"Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration\". Numerous cases of pseudo-Kufic are known in European religious art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic would be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious halos or frames. Many are visible in the paintings of Giotto.\n\nExamples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script such as a 13th French Master Alpais' ciborium at the Louvre Museum. The chalice of Santo Domingo de Silos is another Christian liturgical object with imitation of Kufic characters; its decoration also includes Islamic-inspired horseshoe arches.\n\nChristian buildings such as the Cappella Palatina in Palermo, Sicily, incorporated Islamic elements, probably usually created by local Muslim craftsmen working in their own traditions. The ceiling at the Cappella, with its wooden vault arches and gilded figurines, has close parallels with Islamic buildings in Fez and Fustat, and reflect the \"Muqarnas\" (stalactite) technique of emphasizing three-dimensional elements\n\nThe diaphragm arch, Late Antique in origin, was widely used in Islamic architecture, and may have spread from Spain to France.\n\nScholars of the 18–19th century, who generally preferred Classical art, disliked what they saw as the \"disorder\" of Gothic art and perceived similarities between Gothic and Islamic architecture. They often overstated the case that Gothic art fully originated in the Islamic art of the Mosque, to the point of calling it \"Saracenical\". William John Hamilton commented on the Seljuks monuments in Konya: \"The more I saw of this peculiar style, the more I became convinced that the Gothic was derived from it, with a certain mixture of Byzantine (...) the origin of this Gotho-Saracenic style may be traced to the manners and habits of the Saracens\" The 18th-century English historian Thomas Warton summarized:\n\nThe pointed arch originated in the Byzantine and Sassanian empires, where it mostly appears in early Christian church buildings, although engineering works such as the Byzantine Karamagara Bridge also showed it fully developed at an early stage. The priority of the Byzantines in its use is also evidenced by slightly pointed examples in Sant'Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna, and the Hagia Irene, Constantinople. The pointed arch was subsequently adopted and widely used by Muslim architects, becoming the characteristic arch of Islamic architecture. According to Bony, it has spread from Islamic lands, possibly through Sicily, then under Islamic rule, and from there to Amalfi in Italy, before the end of the 11th century. The pointed arch reduced architectural thrust by about 20% and therefore had practical advantages over the semi-circular Romanesque arch for the building of large structures.\n\nOleg Grabar refers to unspecified speculation that the Rose window may have Islamic origins as unlikely. \"While not excluded on purely chronological grounds since its earliest known instance is in the Ummayad palace at Khirbat al-Mafjar, this conclusion seems highly suspect to me... that both cultures were frequently operating on practically the same kind of 'track' is further suggested by the visual and aesthetic similarities between the ornamental values of flamboyant vaults and Islamic architectural decoration. It is not very likely that a direct impact of one on the other can be demonstrated, and we are certainly dealing with parallel growth.\"\n\nBesides Islamic architecture, the Gothic style was influenced by Roman architecture.\n\nIn 1119, the Knights Templar received as headquarters part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, considered by the crusaders the Temple of Solomon, from which the order took its common name.\nThe typical round churches built by the Knights across Western Europe, such as the London Temple Church, are probably inspired in the shape of Al-Aqsa or its neighbor Dome of the Rock.\n\nPseudo-Kufic is a decorative motif which resembles Kufic script and occurs in many Italian Renaissance paintings. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic in early Renaissance works is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13th–14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during Jesus's time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them: \"In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of Old Testament heroes like David\". Mack states another hypothesis: \n\nCarpets of Middle-Eastern origin, either from the Ottoman Empire, the Levant or the Mamluk state of Egypt or Northern Africa, were used as important decorative features in paintings from the 13th century onwards, and especially in religious painting, starting from the Medieval period and continuing into the Renaissance period.\n\nSuch carpets were often integrated into Christian imagery as symbols of luxury and status of Middle-Eastern origin, and together with Pseudo-Kufic script offer an interesting example of the integration of Eastern elements into European painting.\n\nAnatolian rugs were used in Transylvania as decoration in Evangelical churches.\n\nIslamic individuals and costumes often provided the contextual backdrop to describe an evangelical scene. This was particularly visible in a set of Venetian paintings in which contemporary Syrian, Palestinian, Egyptian and especially Mamluk personages are employed anachronistically in paintings describing Biblical situations. An example in point is the 15th century \"\" by Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti which accurately describes contemporary (15th century) Alexandrian Mamluks arresting Saint Mark in an historic scene of the 1st century CE. Another case is Gentile Bellini's \"\".\n\nA Western style of ornament based on the Islamic arabesque developed, beginning in late 15th century Venice; it has been called either moresque or western arabesque (a term with a complicated history). It has been used in a great variety of the decorative arts but has been especially long-lived in book design and bookbinding, where small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day. It is seen in gold tooling on covers, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.\n\nLike other Renaissance ornament styles it was disseminated by ornament prints which were bought as patterns by craftsmen in a variety of trades. Peter Furhring, a leading specialist in the history of ornament, says that: The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns. These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.\n\nElaborate book bindings with Islamic designs can be seen in religious paintings. In Andrea Mantegna's \"\", Saint John and Zeno hold exquisite books with covers displaying Mamluk-style center-pieces, of a type also used in contemporary Italian book-binding.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26224584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26224584", "title": "Jacawitz", "text": "Jacawitz\n\nJacawitz () (also spelt Jakawitz, Jakawits, Q'aq'awits and Hacavitz) was a mountain god of the Postclassic K'iche' Maya of highland Guatemala. He was the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage and was a companion of the sun god Tohil. It is likely that he received human sacrifice. The word \"jacawitz\" means \"mountain\" in the lowland Maya language, and the word \"q'aq'awitz\" of the highland Maya means \"fire mountain\", which suggests that Jacawitz was mainly a fire deity, much like Tohil. In the Mam language, the similar word \"xq'aqwitz\" means \"yellow wasp\" and the wasp was an important symbol of the deity and its associated lineage. In the Cholan languages, \"jacawitz\" means \"first mountain\", linking the god with the first mountain of creation.\n\nIn the K'iche' epic Popul Vuh, the first people gathered at the mythical place Tollan to receive their gods, and Mahucutah, one of the gathered K'iche' lords, received Jacawitz. The mid-9th century Stela 8 at the Terminal Classic lowland Maya site of Seibal describes a visitor to the city named Hakawitzil. This is an early spelling of Jacawitz and Mayanists Linda Schele and Peter Mathews have proposed that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche'. As well as being mentioned frequently in the Popul Vuh, Jacawitz is also mentioned in the K'iche' document \"Título de los Señores de Totonicapán\".\n\nJacawitz was one of a triad of K'iche' deities, the other two being Tohil and the goddess Awilix, all three were sometimes collectively referred to as Tohil, the principal member of the triad. The concept of a trinity of deities was an ancient one in Maya culture, dating back to the Preclassic period.\n\nThe Ahaw K'iche' were the founding lineage of the K'iche' Maya, although they later lost power to the Kaweq lineage; as they lost status within the kingdom, so did their patron god. The temple of Jacawitz at the K'iche' capital of Q'umarkaj was one of the three tallest buildings in the city, although it faced away from the main plaza. The temple is a large mound south of the plaza, its stonework has been stripped away making its original form uncertain, although a 19th-century plan of the city recorded it as a pyramid. This pyramid temple was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace on the south side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz temple complex has not yet been investigated archaeologically. The 19th century drawings by Miguel Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.\n"}

This practice is usually only performed for infants, though older children may also receive the blessing; adult or teenaged converts to the church do not receive a comparable ordinance.\n\nTo offer the blessing, Melchizedek priesthood holders—often including priesthood leaders, family members and close friends—gather in a circle and hold the child in their arms or place their hands on the child's head if the child is older. One of them performs the blessing. Typically, this consists of the following:\n\n\nThe blessing is closed in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter the blessing has been performed, a certificate is provided that details the date of the blessing and who officiated; it is signed by the presiding officer of the ward or branch. A membership record is created for children who receive this blessing: they are counted as members of the church and described as \"children of record\". They remain on the church rolls unless they reach adulthood without being baptized or a request for name removal is received from their legal guardians. Children who were blessed in the church become confirmed members of the church when they receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, normally soon after their eighth birthday.\n\nNaming and blessing of a child usually occurs in the monthly fast and testimony meeting, but may be performed in any sacrament meeting or at a private event attended by the bishop or one of his counselors.\n\nBabies who are born out of wedlock may receive a name and a blessing. When one of the child's parents is a non-member, the bishop must receive verbal permission from both parents before the child can be blessed. If a newborn infant is critically ill, a Melchizedek priesthood holder may bless the child without previous authorization of the bishop. As of 2015, a natural or adopted child of a parent living in a same-sex relationship, whether the couple is married or cohabiting, may not receive a name and a blessing.\n\nIt is common for this blessing to be an occasion for family members to gather. In some families, it is also traditional for the baby or older child to be dressed in white clothing similar to a christening gown, but this is not required.\n\n\n"}

Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man.\n\nThe lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, \"God is on top of it, that's all,\" delivered as though from an African-American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrowful melody. The piece develops into a techno dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlaid atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with Lester Bowie on trumpet. A lyric, \"We are, we are, we are, we are praying,\" is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song restates Bowie's interest in how man relates with God.\n\nBowie used to play a drum'n'bass version of the song during his 1997 \"Earthling\" tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland 10 June 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12\" vinyl. Bowie played as Tao Jones Index during his performance in a dance tent at Phoenix Festival in 1997. It is a pun based on his birth name, David Jones, and his then recent bond offering to the Dow Jones Index. Tao, a Chinese character pronounced \"dao,\" not only stands for the Chinese equivalent to Bowie's first initial, \"D\", but also has heavy religious implications through its correlation to Taoism, therefore contributing to the religious overtones of \"Pallas Athena.\" The Chinese character 道 means \"the way\" (the path, the route). \nIt was announced in March 2010 that a digital download EP would be made available in June 2010.\n\nAll tracks are written by David Bowie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to rue (which is not related). The plant's seeds are especially noteworthy because they have seen continual use for thousands of years in the rites of many cultures. The plant has remained a popular tool in both folk medicine and spiritual practices for so long that some historians believe the plant may be the ancient \"soma\" (a medicinal aid that is mentioned in a variety of ancient Indo Iranian texts but whose exact identity has been lost to history).\n\nIt is a perennial plant which can grow to about 0.8 m tall, but normally it is about 0.3 m tall. The roots of the plant can reach a depth of up to 6.1 m, if the soil where it is growing is very dry. It blossoms between June and August in the Northern Hemisphere. The flowers are white and are about 2.5–3.8 cm in diameter. The round seed capsules measure about 1–1.5 cm in diameter, have three chambers and carry more than 50 seeds.\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" is of Asian Origin and grows in the Middle East and in part of South Asia mainly in India and Pakistan. It was first planted in the United States in 1928 in New Mexico by a farmer wanting to manufacture the dye \"Persian red\" from its seeds. Since then, it has spread invasively to Arizona, California, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. \"Because it is so drought tolerant, African rue can displace the native saltbushes and grasses growing in the salt-desert shrub lands of the Western U.S.\"\n\nIn Turkey, dried capsules from this plant are strung and hung in homes or vehicles to protect against \"the evil eye\". It is widely used for protection against Djinn in Morocco (see Légey \"Essai de Folklore marocain\", 1926).\n\nIn Iran and Afghanistan, as well as some countries in the Middle East, including Azerbaijan, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, dried capsules mixed with other ingredients are placed onto red hot charcoal, where they explode with little popping noises in a way similar to American popcorn. When they burst a fragrant smoke is released. This smoke is wafted around the head of those afflicted by or exposed to the gaze of strangers while a specific prayer is recited. This tradition is still followed by members of many religions, including Christians, Muslims, and some Jews. The burning is often accompanied by a prayer which mentions the Naqshbandi Sufi prayer \"Bi Haq Shah Naqshband\" (By the right of Shah Naqshband). Shah Naqshband was the eponymous founder of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. The prayer is often mistaken to be from a Zoroastrian king, however this is erroneous as there is no historic figure named Shah Naqshband other than the Naqshbandi founder and the prayer Bi Haq Shah Naqshband is commonly used by Naqshbandis. Burning esfand seeds is also commonly found in Persian weddings.\n\nIt is known in Persian as \"Esphand\" and in Pashto as \"Spilani\".\n\nIn Yemen, the Jewish custom of old was to bleach wheaten flour on Passover, in order to produce a clean and white unleavened bread. This was done by spreading whole wheat kernels upon a floor, and then spreading stratified layers of African rue (\"Peganum harmala\") leaves upon the wheat kernels; a layer of wheat followed by a layer of Wild rue, which process was repeated until all wheat had been covered over with the astringent leaves of this plant. The wheat was left in this state for a few days, until the outer kernels of the wheat were bleached by the astringent vapors emitted by the Wild rue. Afterwards, the wheat was taken up and sifted, to rid them of the residue of leaves. They were then ground into flour, which left a clean and white batch of flour.\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" has been used to treat pain and to treat skin inflammations, including skin cancers.\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" has been used as an emmenagogue and abortifacient agent.\n\nThe \"root is applied to kill lice\" and when burned, the seeds kill insects and inhibit the reproduction of the \"Tribolium castaneum\" beetle.\n\nIt is also used as an anthelmintic (to expel parasitic worms). Reportedly, the ancient Greeks used the powdered seeds to get rid of tapeworms and to treat recurring fevers (possibly malaria).\n\nA red dye, \"Turkey red\", from the seeds (but usually obtained from madder) is often used in western Asia to dye carpets. It is also used to dye wool. When the seeds are extracted with water, a yellow fluorescent dye is obtained. If they are extracted with alcohol, a red dye is obtained. The stems, roots and seeds can be used to make inks, stains and tattoos.\n\nSome scholars identify harmal with the entheogenic \"haoma\" of pre-Zoroastrian Persian religions.\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" seeds have been used as an ayahuasca analog, as they contain some of the same alkaloids as \"Banisteriopsis caapi.\n\nSeveral scientific laboratories have studied possible uses for \"Peganum harmala\" through studies in laboratory animals (in vivo) and in cells (in vitro).\n\nIn very large quantities (dosages exceeding those commonly used for medicinal, therapeutic, or spiritual purposes), it can reduce spermatogenesis and male fertility in rats.\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" has been shown to have antibacterial and anti-protozoal activity, including antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nOne of the compounds found in \"P. harmala\", vasicine (peganine), has been found to kill \"Leishmania donovani\", a protozoan parasite that can cause potentially fatal visceral leishmaniasis.\n\nAnother alkaloid, harmine, found in \"P. harmala\", has appreciable efficacy in destroying intracellular parasites in the vesicular forms.\n\nA small study in sheep infected with the protozoal Theileria hirci found \"Peganum harmala\" extract to be an effective treatment.\n\n\"The beta-carboline alkaloids present in medicinal plants, such as \"Peganum harmala\" and \"Eurycoma longifolia\", have recently drawn attention due to their antitumor activities. Further mechanistic studies indicate that beta-carboline derivatives inhibit DNA topoisomerases and interfere with DNA synthesis.\"\n\n\"Peganum harmala\" has antioxidant and antimutagenic properties. Both the plant and the extract harmine exhibit cytotoxicity with regards to HL60 and K562 leukemia cell lines.\n\nSome alkaloids of harmal seeds are monoamine oxidase A inhibitors (MAOIs):\n\n"}

{"id": "3462154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3462154", "title": "Ruhi Institute", "text": "Ruhi Institute\n\nThe Ruhi Institute is an educational institution, initially operating under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'í Faith in Colombia. \n\nThe format of group adult learning such as that in a Bahá'í study circle, the normal setting of a Ruhi Institute meeting, has occurred in previous contexts, such as in the United States Chautauqua developments in the 1870s, \"using ideals of democracy, participation, and equality.\" \n\nMoreover, the Bahá'í community has used the term \"institute\" in various ways over time. A 1927 report in \"Bahá'í News\" refers to an \"institute\", the \"Institute of World Unity\" held at Green Acre. A 1935 letter of Leroy Loas noted a reason to promote small group meetings, \"firesides\", as a central method to promote the religion was to overcome the community's relative introversion that he believed came from thinking that only special Bahá’ís could \"teach\". A 1950 reference to \"Conference Institutes\" was reported at the US Bahá'í national convention. There was also a 1958 reference to institutes being held on college campuses. In 1961 a conference in American Samoa was called a \"training institute\" and another in Korea in 1963. The term was adopted with the beginning of the \"Nine Year Plan\" (starting in 1964) designated by the Universal House of Justice, the international governing institution of the Faith. The \"institute\" or \"training institute\" served the needs of the thousands who began entering the religion in areas where large-scale expansion was taking place. Such places needed a physical facility to which group after group of newly enrolled believers would be invited to attend courses that helped them deepen their knowledge of the principles of the Faith. Over the years, both in conjunction with and independent of these institutes, various courses —e.g., weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and nine-day institutes — were developed for the purpose of promulgating the \"fundamental verities\" of the religion. Growth of the religion into viable communities has presented challenges to Bahá’í institutions.\n\nBahá'í leadership envisioned a holistic process of education reflecting on \"civilization and progress – that is to say, government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate institutions, which are the activities essential to man” and \"the education of all members of society.\" Arbab, Correa, and de Valcarcel first established FUNDAEC in Colombia to express such goals in a new curriculum in the 1970s. A key component of their work was founded on the basic tenet that the essence of humankind is spiritual and that helping individuals acquire spiritual attributes would lead to the advancement of civilization.\n\nFrom these roots the Ruhi Foundation (named after Farzam Arbab’s father and Dr. David Ruhe,) evolved as part of a wider process of community building among the Bahá’ís in Colombia centered first in the town of Puerto Tejada, near Cali in the department of Cauca. The Ruhi Institute eventually fell under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'í Faith in Colombia. Since 1992 it has been registered as the “Ruhí Foundation,” a legally independent non-profit organisation. Ruhi courses appeared in a wide range of study circles in various other countries. Early participants provided feedback to the authors and then over several years the first official release of books took place. As a result, materials include examples from several cultures which helps diverse participants relate to some of the cultural content of the materials. Since the late 1990s the Ruhi institute process has developed as an additional way to advance communities.\n\nThe current head of the religion, the Universal House of Justice, has noted the progress of the work since the early 2000s. They mentioned that “the great majority of National Spiritual Assemblies have chosen to adopt the course materials devised by the Ruhi Institute.” Especially in recent years, its training programs have been adopted by an increasing number of localities worldwide, promoting a \"culture of learning\" among its participants. By 2012 the Ruhiresources.org web site—operated by volunteers who are Ruhi tutors—allowed Ruhi tutor-created materials to be freely shared.\n\nThe goal of the Ruhi Institute courses is to \"evoke a transformative learning experience through a learner-centered, experiential, and collaborative approach facilitated by a tutor rather than an instructor, a teacher, or an expert.\" Academics have identified the practice as an instance of praxeology. The tutor roles \"refer to functions we perform at a given time and not to positions we (sic) hold in the community.'\" Indeed Ruhi restructures societal norms, roles, and goals of education \"…to re-vision societal images and systems of education as part of the design of new systems of learning and human development that are consonant with the emerging global world-view.\" The courses are designed to be run with organically developed groups of learners, using \"critical reflection, interactive thinking, activities designed to transform theory into practical action\". Tutors who facilitate courses are to reflect on their motives and encouraged to perform their role as virtuous service. Tutoring is not a position of authority but a service to the community - an explicit factor in training of tutors, seeking to foster “beautiful behaviors” to function as \"friends teaching friends\". The course \"applies the concept of 'being and doing' and incorporates 'action and reflection' as a key learning strategy.\" Priorities folded into the process of the courses and their refinement include \"Projecting a systemic, global world-view\"; \"ensuring the right to learn and the right to know\"; \"nurturing the development of diversity\"; \"providing the competencies to make interdependence a social reality\"; (and) \"providing for social and cultural evolution.\"\n\nAny group that goes through a course would be encouraged to pursue a service project as a means of putting their learning into action Such projects typtically comprise organizing devotional meetings, developing skills in raising the quality of discourses on social concerns, and becoming a teacher of children. Community service is framed by the contexts the individuals bring to the group and their sense of purpose about it - and through several courses the suggested projects grow in complexity. Some have grown into their own local NGOs. The transcending goal is spiritual and moral empowerment to serve the society and the Faith by cultivating attributes such as a \"humble posture of learning, dedication to the application of the teachings, a responsibility for one’s own personal growth, and growth of the Bahá’í community.\" The progress of individuals in learning virtues like humility, patience and tact advanced amidst a feeling of empowerment. A kind of citizenship.\n\nThe materials prepared by the Ruhi Institute focus on the Bahá'í writings by assisting participants to understand the texts on three different levels. The first level is that of basic comprehension — understanding the meanings of the words and sentences. The second level relates to the application of the texts to various real-world situations. Finally, the third level deals with the implications of the various quotations on other aspects of Bahá'í belief and action.\n\nThe goal of a universal sense of active and observable citizenship in the Faith has remained elusive. Although membership in the religion has been growing, not everyone has actively participated in social activities. Researchers have reviewed the limitations of traditional pedagogies in the West, but some contend similar problems exist world-wide. Since 2008, various academics have reviewed the Ruhi program. In the words of one researcher it is \"…becoming the core of Bahá’í community life worldwide as the outcome of a process that has sought to nurture the spiritual life of individuals and families and to establish social foundations for the vision and practice of religious world citizenship.\"\n\nAcademic studies have measured different aspects of Ruhi. One doctoral thesis examined the Ruhi courses using a combination of academic approaches to reflective and critical learning, experiential learning, and moral/ethical contexts. Mortensen interviewed participants before and after a series of courses. Over a 6-month period, the study started with participants in the Midwestern United States and in a later phase was expanded to areas in Canada, Iran, Ethiopia, South Korea, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Mortensen included recommendations in his thesis. and hoped his results would be considered in adjusting the courses. He found a significant minority of participants took the course based on the mandate of the Universal House of Justice and small number were not Bahá’ís and came as a result of being personally invited by friends or family. A majority liked that the curriculum was built around social or group learning, having a chance to learn from other people as well as bring their own experience to the study circle, and appreciated the natural laughter that arose. All the non-Bahá'ís interviewed went on to take additional Ruhi classes, none of the participants voiced disappointment or dissatisfaction with the Ruhi method of education itself; the majority underscored what was to them the unusual component that much of the work and learning of a study course was done in a community setting.\n\nIn another review, workers in adult education \"found harmony between the concepts developed in the Ruhi Institute and adult education principles.\" Another set of researchers found positive results using the Ruhi model including some of the content mixed in a more poly-religious set of quotes in studies with all non-Bahá'ís. A review in China and neighboring communities investigated practices of \"religious citizenship\" as a result of the Ruhi Institute. The Ruhi formula resulted in \"nonhierarchical, self-initiated, self-organized small groups engaged in study, teaching, and action\", which is transforming the broader Bahá'í culture to one of small group community building among natural networks of family and friends, a format that is politically viable in China and adaptable to space limits in Hong Kong.\n\nA published case study compared developments in three instances of Bahá'ís fostering development among indigenous cultures - a Guaymí cultural center in Panama, a regional socio-economic development committee of Kivu, Zaire, and the specific original development of the Bahá'í Ruhi Institute in Colombia: \"They demonstrate the importance of evolutionary guiding images, of the conceptual support of actions, evolutionary competence, the contribution of second-order actions and the purposeful design of the system of interactive dimensions that operate on individual and societal levels to the design of human systems.… (by those) who are so often considered marginal, irrelevant, and ignorant of the challenges of an interdependent world society.\" The reviewers saw two implications - \"The motivating force which empowered participants, provided a vision, and nurtured evolutionary competence was in every case a powerfully felt commitment to Bahá'í religious beliefs\" and each of the three was \"designed and carried forward by the efforts of a small group of highly motivated individuals whose leadership style is characterized by such evolutionary values as cooperation, service, interdependence, humility, and the like.\"\n\nThe Ruhí Institute's sequence of courses “has been conceived in terms of three cycles, each one concerned with the spiritual and moral empowerment of the believers from a particular perspective”\n\n\nMinding this is an area of active effort, as of 2016 there are currently eight books in the Institute's main sequence of courses, with more courses in development. Each book is broken up into three units each with many sections. Tutors are encouraged to apply the arts, using music, games, crafts, and such during the training. Each book has one or more practices that can be done outside of the meeting. Also encouraged throughout the books is the practice of memorizing passages and prayers.\n\nIt is suggested to take the books in their numbered order.\n\nThis first and shortest book of the sequence is divided into three units with different themes:\n\nThis book can be used as an introduction to people investigating the Faith, or as a study of fundamental principles by people already familiar with the teachings.\n\nOne practice for this book is to visit two people, and study a prayer with them.\n\nThe second book in the sequence involves community life and teaching. Units include:\n\nThis book aims at developing specific acts of service. Providing tools to raise up human resources capable of fostering the growth of the Bahá'í Community with efficiency and love.\n\nOne practice for this book is to visit a few people and practice one of the deepening themes learned in the second unit.\n\nThe third book in the sequence is designed to develop the capabilities needed to conduct children's classes.

The practice for this book is to offer a children's class.\n\nThe fourth book in the sequence is taken to acquire a thorough understanding of the lives of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nThis book reviews the importance of the Bahá'í revelation, and retells many of the famous stories of the two founding prophets of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nOne practice is to visit at least one friend, and share a simple illustrated presentation about the life of the Báb and then do the same later for the life of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nThe fifth book in the sequence trains individuals to facilitate Junior Youth groups, which are for ages 11–15. Individuals who complete the book and as the praxis go on to facilitate a Junior Youth group are called animators, thus named because they animate the endeavors of the junior youth. After completing book five, the animators use a separate strand of books to work with the junior youth. Ruhi Book 5's main units are:\n\nThe sixth book in the sequence is a continuation of the theme of the second book, which is teaching.\n\nThis book is intended to enhance the participants' understanding of the spiritual significance of teaching, and the attributes that a teacher of the Cause should strive to acquire.\n\nOne practice is to participate in a teaching campaign.\n\nThe seventh book of the sequence is designed to give its participants the ability to tutor their own study circles for the first six books.\n\nThis book teaches of the spiritual dynamics of service. It gives tools and practice to those people interested in becoming tutors.\n\nThe practice of this book is to tutor a study circle.\n\nThe eighth book of the sequence is designed to further study the covenant of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nThis book is in development in 2015-16. It deals with the Bahá'í view of God's covenant with mankind. It also examines the mission of the Faith in light of this historical moment, and finally focuses on the unfoldment of the Divine Plan and the activities associated with it.\n\nThis book is currently in development as of summer 2016, and has units entitled:\n\nBranching out from some of the main sequences of courses are some branch courses. By 2016 only books 3 and 5 have branch courses.\n\n\nIn the program for spiritual empowerment of junior youth, various topics are discussed in the youth groups. The materials focus on forming a strong moral identity and developing the capacities of youth, such as language skills, the power of expression, and rational thinking. Also included are subjects with which adolescents often struggle, preparing them to make difficult choices and adapting to social change. The courses are being developed around the world \n\nThough the moral concepts in these books find their source in the Bahá'í teachings, they are not of a religious nature and they don’t discuss topics that are specifically Bahá’í (exception: \"Spirit of Faith\" and \"The Power of the Holy Spirit\", which mainly refer to subjects discussed in 'Abdu'l-Bahá's \"Some Answered Questions\").\n\n\n\n"}

The practice of mortification of the flesh for religious purposes was utilized by some Christians throughout most of Christian history, especially in Catholic monasteries and convents. In addition, Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran Church, regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh. Likewise, the Congregationalist writer Sarah Osborn also practiced self-flagellation in order \"to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God\". It became \"quite common\" for members of the Tractarian movement within the Anglican Communion to practice self-flagellation using a discipline.\n\nIn the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the Flagellants, took this practice to its extreme ends. The Flagellants were later condemned by the Roman Catholic Church as a cult in the 14th century because the established church had no other control over the practice than excommunication.\n\nAlthough Tatbir is forbidden by many Shia marājiʿ, many Shia communities worldwide march in massive parades every year on the Day of Ashura to commemorate the Battle of Karbala and the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, while hitting themselves on the chest or slashing themselves with chains called zanjerzani.\n\nThough it is uncommon, some Shia communities hit themselves on the back with chains and sharp objects such as knives. This happens in many countries including India, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, United States, and Australia. However, use of knives and sharp blades for flagellation is strictly forbidden in Shia Islam by their mujtahideen (persons accepted as original authority in Islamic law).\n"}
{"id": "4234963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4234963", "title": "Sikhism in Pakistan", "text": "Sikhism in Pakistan\n\nSikhism in the area of present-day Pakistan has an extensive heritage and history, although Sikhs form a small community in Pakistan today. Most Sikhs live in the province of Punjab, a part of the larger Punjab region where the religion originated in the Middle Ages, and Peshawar in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, is located in the Punjab province.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the Sikh community became a powerful political force, with Sikh leader Ranjit Singh founding the first Sikh empire, which had its capital in Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan today. Significant populations of Sikhs inhabited the largest cities in the Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad. After the Partition of India in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while many Muslim refugees from India settled in Pakistan.\n\nIn the decades following Pakistan's independence in 1947, the Sikh community began to re-organise, forming the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (PGPC) to represent the community and protect the holy sites and heritage of the Sikh religion in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has begun to allow Sikhs from India to make pilgrimages to Sikh places of worship in Pakistan and for Pakistani Sikhs to travel to India.\n\nAccording to the Government of Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), there were 6,146 Sikhs registered in Pakistan in 2012. Other sources, including the US Department of State, claim the Sikh population in Pakistan to be as high as 20,000.\n\nMany Pakistani Sikhs have emigrated and continue to emigrate to countries like the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. According to the UK's 2001 census, there were 346 Pakistani Sikhs in the UK. There is also a growing Pakistani Sikh expatriate community in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPrior to independence in 1947, Sikhs were spread all across Northern Pakistan, specifically the Punjab region and played an important role in its economy as farmers, businessmen, and traders. Lahore, the capital of Punjab, was then and still is today the location of many important Sikh religious and historical sites, including the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh. The nearby town of Nankana Sahib has nine gurdwaras, and is the birthplace of Sikhism's founder, Guru Nanak Dev. Each of Nankana Sahib's gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Dev's life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide.\n\nThe largest Sikh population in Pakistan is found in Peshawar, in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where the Pashtun law of \"nanawati\" (protection) spared the scale of violence which had raged across the Indus River in Punjab. Despite the longstanding tensions between the Sikh and Muslim communities in South Asia, the Pashtuns were tolerant towards the religious minority of Sikhs.\n\nThere has been an influx of Sikhs refugees from Afghanistan in Pakistan due to the turbulent civil war and conflicts that have ravaged neighboring Afghanistan.\n\nUntil today, Sikh have mainly kept a low profile within the monolithic Muslim population of Pakistan. Though, Pakistan maintains the title of Islamic state, the articles twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two in chapter two of its constitution guarantees religious freedom to the non-Muslim residents. Since independence in 1947, relations between Pakistan's minorities and the Muslim majority have remained fairly and politically stable. From 1984 to 2002, Pakistan held a system of separate electorates for all its national legislative assemblies, with only a handful of parliamentary seats reserved for minority members. Minorities were legally only permitted to vote for designated minority candidates in general elections. The regime of former President General Pervez Musharraf had professed an agenda of equality for minorities and promotion and protection of minority rights, however, the implementation of corrective measures has been slow. Considerable amount of Sikhs are found in neighbourhood called \"Narayanpura\" of Karachi's Ranchore Lines.\n\nThe historical and holy sites of Sikhs are maintained by a Pakistani governmental body, the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which is responsible for their upkeep and preservation.\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan and the migration of nearly all Sikhs to India the Sikh community's rights were diminished as their population decreased. The Pakistani Constitution states that Sikhism is a monotheistic religion. Recently the Sikh community within Pakistan has been making every effort possible to progress in Pakistan. For example, Hercharn Singh became the first Sikh to join the Pakistan Army. For the first time in the 58-year history of Pakistan there has a Sikh been selected into Pakistan's army. CR Dutta was one of the few Hindu officers in 1947 who opted for Pakistan and fought for Pakistan in 1965 war. Prior to Harcharan Singh's selection in the Pakistani army no individual person who was a member of the Hindu or the Sikh community were ever enrolled in the army, however; the Pakistani Christian community has prominently served in the Pakistan Armed Forces and some had even reached into to the ranks of Major Generals in the army, Air Vice Marshals in the Pakistan Air force and rear Admiral in the Pakistan Navy. It has received various awards for gallantry and valor. Moreover, members of the tiny Parsi community have some representation in the Armed Forces. First time in the history of Pakistan as well as in the history of Lahore a Sikh person has been appointed as a traffic Sub Inspector. Dr. Gulab Singh who is just 25 years old, is a practising homeopathic doctor and he is from the same place as Harcharan Singh (Nankana Sahib). Gulab Singh is fluent in Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Saraiki, Sindhi, and little bit of English. Other prominent Sikhs are Inspector Amarjeet Singh of Pakistan Rangers and Lance-naik Behram Singh of Pakistan Coast Guard.\nIn yet another contribution to the Pakistani Sikh community, Pakistan Government enacted the Sikh marriage act, Anand Marriage act, in November 2007. This Sikh marriage act allows not only the Sikhs in Pakistan, but also Sikhs living in anywhere in the world to register in Pakistan with the Sikh marriage act. Many pilgrim Sikhs couples from abroad have reaffirmed their marriage vows in Pakistan under the Sikh marriage act.\n\nRamesh Singh Arora became the first Sikh member of Provincial Assembly of the Punjab of Pakistan after he was nominated by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)). Another Sikh, Dr. Suran Singh has been nominated to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf following the 2013 elections.\n\nThe first Pakistani Sikh musician also emerged on the music industry in 2009, Jassi Lailpuria, launched his first song on independence day entitled, Sohna Pakistan. A Sikh named Taranjeet Singh is an VJ, anchor and host on PTV channel.\n\nRupinder Singh Magon (Rup Magon) from the band Josh is also a superstar in Pakistan and is very popular among the youth of the country although he lives in Canada but travels to Pakistan a lot for Concerts and TV engagements. He, along with his bandmate Qurram Hussain, was part of Coke Studio as well, which is a big achievement.\n\n"}

{"id": "29957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29957", "title": "Troll", "text": "Troll\n\nA troll is a class of being in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.\n\nLater, in Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.\n\nTrolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks, which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight. Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\nThe Old Norse nouns \"troll\" and \"tröll\" (variously meaning \"fiend, demon, werewolf, jötunn\") and Middle High German \"troll, trolle\" \"fiend\" (according to philologist Vladimir Orel likely borrowed from Old Norse) developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *\"trullan\". The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown. Additionally, the Old Norse verb \"trylla\" 'to enchant, to turn into a troll' and the Middle High German verb \"trüllen\" \"to flutter\" both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *\"trulljanan\", a derivative of *\"trullan\".\n\nIn Norse mythology, \"troll\", like \"thurs\", is a term applied to \"jötnar\" and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and-daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly. The \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\" describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason. According to the section, Bragi was driving through \"a certain forest\" late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself:\n\nBragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful skald, before the scenario ends.\n\nThere is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms \"jötunn\", \"troll\", \"þurs\", and \"risi\", which describe various beings. Lotte Motz theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (\"jötunn\"), mythical magicians (\"troll\"), hostile monsters (\"þurs\"), and heroic and courtly beings (\"risi\"), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, Ármann Jakobson is critical of Motz's interpretation and calls this theory \"unsupported by any convincing evidence\". Ármann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a jötunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a \"blámaðr\", a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a brunnmigi, or a berserker.\n\nLater in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being. Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight. However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having \"some form of social organization\" — unlike the \"rå\" and \"näck\", who are attested as \"solitary beings\". According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of \"bergtagning\" ('kidnapping'; literally \"mountain-taking\") and overrunning a farm or estate.\n\nLindow states that the etymology of the word \"troll\" remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as \"nature beings\" and as \"all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to fairies in Anglo-Celtic traditions\". They \"therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for\". Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and \"little people\" in the folklore record.\n\nA Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\". Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia are described in folklore as being a \"consequence of the constant din of the church-bells\". This ring caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll's toss. Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.\n\nLindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to Grendel, the supernatural mead hall invader in the Old English poem \"Beowulf\", and notes that \"just as the poem \"Beowulf\" emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off.\"\n\nSmaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition. In Denmark, these creatures are recorded as \"troldfolk\" (\"troll-folk\"), \"bjergtrolde\" (\"mountain-trolls\"), or \"bjergfolk\" (\"mountain-folk\") and in Norway also as \"troldfolk\" (\"troll-folk\") and \"tusser\". Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.\n\nIn Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk (\"hidden-folk\") yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word \"trow\" in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word \"troll\" may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshiped. \"Troll\" could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas \"Huldrefolk\" may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.\n\nJohn Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse vættir and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.\n\n"}

Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, described them as crystal-like \"two smooth three-cornered diamonds.\" Oliver Cowdery said the stones were \"transparent\". Smith and his early Mormon contemporaries seem to have used the terms \"seer stone\" and \"Urim and Thummim\" interchangeably. Although Smith always referred to the Book of Mormon \"interpreters\" as the Urim and Thummim, he may or may not have intended to make a distinction between that device and the seer stones that he used in receiving revelations. The LDS Church has suggested that Smith and his contemporaries \"seem to have understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument\".\nIn 1827, Smith said that he had been visited again by the angel who had previously revealed the location of the golden plates, along with other items such as the Urim and Thummim, and that these objects were buried in a nearby hillside. Smith said that after translating the Book of Mormon, he returned the plates and the Urim and Thummim to the angel, whom he identified as the resurrected Moroni. Smith reportedly told Orson Pratt that the Lord gave him the Urim and Thummim when he was an inexperienced translator but that as he grew in experience, he no longer needed such assistance.\n\nThe LDS Bible Dictionary defines the \"Urim and Thummim\" as \"an instrument prepared of God to assist man in obtaining revelation from the Lord and in translating languages.\" In the Book of Mormon, the prophets the Brother of Jared and Mosiah both used devices called \"interpreters\" to receive revelation for their people, and the Doctrine and Covenants declares that these \"interpreters\" were the Urim and Thummim.\n\nLatter Day Saints believe that the Urim and Thummim of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon were the functional equivalent of the Urim and Thummim mentioned in the Old Testament. It could be speculated that there were three different sets of Urim and Thummim: the one of the Old Testament (Exodus 28:30) and two mentioned in the Book of Mormon (one used by the Jaredites and the other by King Mosiah). Another speculation that has been made is that the one used by Smith is the one originally possessed by the Jaredites.\n\n"}
