The Iraqi government, under Yasin al-Hashimi, crushed a revolt by the Yazidi people of Jabal Sinjar against the imposition of conscription. The Iraqi army, led by Bakr Sidqi, reportedly killed over 200 Yazidi and imposed martial law throughout the region. Parallel revolts opposing conscription also broke out that year in the northern (Kurdish populated) and mid-Euphrates (majorly Shia populated) regions of Iraq.\n\nThe Yazidis of Jabal Sinjar constituted the majority of Iraqi Yazidi population - the third largest non-Muslim minority within the kingdom, and the largest ethno-religious group in the province of Mosul. In 1939, the region of Jabal Sinjar was once again put under military control, together with the Shekhan District.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214225", "title": "Adoration", "text": "Adoration\n\nAdoration (Latin) is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing. The term comes from the Latin \"adōrātiō\", meaning \"to give homage or worship to someone or something\".\n\nIn classical Rome, adoration was primarily an act of homage or worship, which, among the Romans, was performed by raising the hand to the mouth, kissing it and then waving it in the direction of the adored object. The devotee had his head covered, and after the act turned himself round from left to right. Sometimes he kissed the feet or knees of the images of the gods themselves, and Saturn and Hercules were adored with the head bare. By a natural transition the homage, at first paid to divine beings alone, came to be paid to monarchs. Thus the Greek and Roman emperors were adored by bowing or kneeling, laying hold of the imperial robe, and presently withdrawing the hand and pressing it to the lips, or by putting the royal robe itself to the lips.\n\nIn Eastern countries, adoration has been performed in an attitude still more lowly. The Persian method, introduced by Cyrus the Great, was to kiss the knee and fall on the face at the prince's feet, striking the earth with the forehead and kissing the ground. This striking of the earth with the forehead, usually a fixed number of times, was a form of adoration sometimes paid to Eastern potentates.\n\nThe Jews kissed in homage, as did other groups mentioned in the Old Testament. Thus in 1 Kings 19:18, God is made to say, \"Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.\" And in Psalms 2:12, \"Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way\". (See also Hosea 13:2.)\n\nIn Western Europe, the ceremony of kissing the sovereign's hand, and some other acts which are performed while kneeling, may be described as forms of adoration.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"Adoration is the acknowledgement of God as God, creator and savior, the Lord and master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful love.\" \"Adoration is homage of the spirit to the King of glory, respectful silence in the presence of the ever greater God.\" Adoration is prompted by the Holy Spirit.\nIn the strict sense, adoration is an act of religion offered to God in acknowledgment of His supreme perfection and dominion, and of the creature's dependence upon Him. \"The rational creature, looking up to God, whom reason and revelation show to be infinitely perfect, cannot in right and justice maintain an attitude of indifference. That perfection which is infinite in itself and the source and fulfilment of all the good that we possess or shall possess, we must worship, acknowledging its immensity, and submitting to its supremacy.\"\n\nIn Luke 4:7-8, Jesus tells the tempter, \"Scripture has it, 'You shall do homage to the Lord your God, Him alone shall you adore.'\" The worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name \"latreia\" (Latinized, \"latria\"), which is usually translated \"Adoration\". Adoration differs from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence. The primary and fundamental element in adoration is an interior act of mind and will; the mind perceiving that God's perfection is infinite, the will bidding one to extol and worship this perfection.\n\nAdoration is a willing submission of self to God expressed interiorly as well as exteriorly by one's actions. It is an interior act of mind and will where the mind humbly admits that God's perfection is infinite, and the will moves one us to worship this perfection. An acknowledge of God's right as God to be Lord of one's life and in control of it involves a voluntarily offer of submission. Thomas Aquinas says: \"Adoration is primarily an interior reverence for God expressing itself secondarily in bodily signs of humility: bending our knee (to express our weakness compared to God) and prostrating ourselves (to show that of ourselves we are nothing).\" Genuflecting is an outward gesture of an inward attitude of adoration towards God, as is the praying of the Pater Noster. \"The first phrase of the Our Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should recognize Him as \"Father\", the true God\".\n\nAdoration is reflected in the prayer of praise which acknowledges God for who he is in comparison to the prayer of thanksgiving which acknowledges God for what he has done. Rev. Raniero Cantalamesa observed that \"the greatest danger with God is for us to become accustomed to him, to fall from awe into routine.\"\n\nAdoration also takes the form of Eucharistic adoration. The Catholic belief in transubstantiation is that the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, through which Catholics adore Jesus Christ. The host is usually placed in a monstrance, and reverently viewed at Benedictions and during adoration. Some churches contain \"adoration chapels\" in which the Eucharist is continuously on display that the faithful may observe their faith through it. \"The Cure of Ars would spend hours in front of the Blessed Sacrament. When people would ask him what he would do or say during those hours, he would say: 'He looks at me, and I look at him.'\"\n\n"}

Previously referred to as \"Playboy\", and \"Lavyss\".\n\nIn January 2010, Bizzle released \"You Got Some Explaining to Do\" directed towards Jay-Z, calling the rap icon out on his negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. The video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even Bizzle couldn't anticipate. He released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.\n\nHe released his first mixtape, \"The Messenger\", in March 2010. Shortly after the release, he founded God Over Money Records in Houston, Texas. Since its creation, the label has released eight mixtapes, a collaborative album with artist Willie 'P-Dub' Moore Jr., three full-length studio albums, and signed two artists.\n\nBizzle released his debut album, \"Tough Love & Parables\", on June 21, 2011 which debuted at No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums chart. It appeared on the iTunes Store swoosh= banner. \"The Good Fight\" was released on May 7, 2013 and debuted at No. 2 on \"Billboard\"'s Gospel Albums chart, No. 7 on Christian Albums, No. 11 on Top Rap Albums, and sold a total of 3,962 copies in its first week.\n\nBizzle received nominations for \"Rap/Hip Hop Gospel CD of The Year\" at both the 2012 & 2014 Stellar Awards, sharing the category with artists Derek Minor, Lecrae, and Thi'sl. He also received three nominations at the 2012 & 2013 \"Kingdom Choice Awards\" and although he didn't win any in 2012, he won all three categories in 2013 for \"Rap Single of The Year\", \"Hip Hop Album of The Year\", and \"Music Video of The Year\".\n\nBizzle caused a commotion in the media when he released \"Same Love: A Response\", the artist's reaction to a controversial wedding ceremony broadcast during the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. As expected, the response track received a lot of media attention. Due to the extremely angry response Felder received, he created a website to draw attention to the apparent lack of tolerance toward Christians and their differing views on the definition of marriage.\n\nMark Felder was raised mostly by his mother in Los Angeles, California. His father stayed in Compton, California. As a child growing up, his family was quite poor living in Section 8 housing.\n\nMark was around thirteen the first time he stepped in a music studio. Listening to Tupac, he began to establish a talent for writing rhymes but noticed that his content usually mimicked those he listened to, whether it was his uncle or other rappers. Topics like shooting or packing pistols.\n\nAfter graduating, Mark put out five mixtapes and began circulating them in malls, clubs, radio stations and anywhere else he could. He eventually got an opportunity to open up for Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana during their \"I Can't Feel My Face\" tour. He also opened up for Lil Boosie.\n\nWhile trying to move his music, his financial situation got worse. As he stated in an interview, his \"financial situation got so bad he was sleeping on a friend's floor and his car was a closet for his clothes.\" Mark began selling drugs and even became a pimp to fund his music career and to maintain a certain image around those he aspired to become like in the industry.\n\nBetween the years 2004-2008 Bizzle released 'L.A.V. Mixtapes' Volume's 1-5 in Southern California. He then released 'Dirty West Mixtapes' 1 and 2 with 360 Records in Houston, Texas, and returned to California to release his biggest yet, 'Certified Mixtape'.\n\nIn 2005 he was offered a deal by 360 Records out of Houston and declined. Two years later, Bizzle had been offered a deal by Barry Hankerson to sign with Blackground/Universal, but he also declined that offer.\n\nBizzle spent three years preparing his debut album \"Grind Pays\". Multiple singles where spread causing his Myspace plays to rapidly increase over 500,000.\n\nNot long after, Mark established the God Over Money Records recording label and began making music with a different purpose.\n\nThe influence of his Christianity and Mark's exposure to the dark side of hip hop ultimately prompted his questioning of the dark imagery that appears to be promoted through the music of rappers like Kanye West,Rick Ross, and Jay-Z. On January 17, 2010 he released the track \"You Got Some Explaining to Do\", a song directed towards Jay-Z, exposing him for his negative references towards Jesus in his lyrics. The result of the diss song led Bizzle to being called the \"Christian Rapper that dissed Jay Z\". Overwhelmed by the positive response and media attention he received, Mark decided to set out making music that both proclaimed the Gospel of the Bible as truth and exposes the evil working within the music industry.\n\nHe released his first Christian mixtape, \"The Messenger\", on March 30, 2010 on DatPiff. The mixtape received much success and has been downloaded over 1 million times since its release. \"The Messenger 2: Delivered\" & \"The Messenger 3: Truth Music\" followed in 2010 & 2011 respectively.\n\nOn June 21, 2011, Felder released his first full-length studio album titled \"Tough Love & Parables\".\n\nOn February 7, 2012 Felder and Willie Moore, Jr. released \"Best of Both Worlds: The Album\". They hit No. 5 spot on the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap Chart on their debut.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, Bizzle released his second studio album \"The Good Fight\". The album features production-works from Grammy-winning producer Boi-1da. Originally set for an April 26, 2013 release, it was pushed-back to a later date. Its first single, \"Soldier\" was released January 26, 2013 and features No Malice and included a music video. Later singles were \"Dear Hip-Hop\" and \"My Confession\" (featuring Sevin). The album debuted on the \"Billboard\" Top Rap Albums at No. 11. His previous works with Boi-1da include \"Forgive Me\" released on March 16, 2011 which features rapper MC Jin and \"Lost and Found\" on his collaborative mixtape \"Martyrs In the Making\" with Bumps INF.\n\nBizzle stated that Boi-1da reached out to him on YouTube stating his personal beliefs in Christianity and respect for Bizzle's work and worked free of charge. The collaborative work between the two was highlighted in the 2012 September edition of \"XXL\".\n\nOn January 28, 2014, Bizzle released a single entitled \"Same Love (A Response)\" that takes its cue from the pro-gay rights single \"Same Love\" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. It opens with the rapper reciting a quotation from the Book of Timothy then leads into the same instrumental track as Macklemore's original.\n\nThree days after its release, the song garnered over 30,000 views on YouTube. \"The Huffington Post\" called the track \"very disturbing\". \"The Advocate\", a newspaper that represents the homosexual community, said Bizzle's single \"uses the instrumental hook from Macklemore's 'Same Love' to say that LGBT people are sinful, violent, and just like pedophiles.\" Bizzle has reported that he has received death threats because of the song, created a website that chronicles the backlash against him, and maintains that he is not homophobic but simply stating an opposing argument to that in popular media.\n\nOn February 11, 2014, US Magazine reported that Justin Bieber had changed his Instagram handle to 'bizzle' citing that \"the moniker ‘Bizzle’ actually belongs to a Christian rapper based in L.A.\"\n\nFelder was born and raised in Los Angeles. After 18 years of recording in Los Angeles, Bizzle relocated to Houston, Texas, where he currently lives with his wife and two children.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22771151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22771151", "title": "Christian views on sin", "text": "Christian views on sin\n\nThe doctrine of sin is central to Christianity, since its basic message is about redemption in Christ. Christian hamartiology describes sin as an act of offence against God by despising his persons and Christian biblical law, and by injuring others. In Christian views it is an evil human act, which violates the rational nature of man as well as God's nature and his eternal law. According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo sin is \"a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God.\"\n\nAmong some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of Christian ethics, and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms.\n\nOther Christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational—a loss of love for the Christian God and an elevation of self-love (\"concupiscence\", in this sense), as was later propounded by Augustine in his debate with the Pelagians. As with the legal definition of sin, this definition also affects the understanding of Christian grace and salvation, which are thus viewed in relational terms.\n\nThe first reference to \"sin\" as a noun is of \"\"sin\" is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it” waiting to be mastered by Cain, a form of literary theriomorphism. \nThe first use of the verb is God appears to Abimelech \"in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from \"sinning\" against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”\" in Genesis 20:3. Isaiah announced the consequences: \"But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things\" — a separation between God and man, and unrequited worshipping.\n\nOriginal sin, also called ancestral sin, is the Christian doctrine of humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man, stemming from Adam's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a \"sin nature\", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.\n\nThe concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in his controversy with certain dualist Gnostics. Other church fathers such as Augustine also developed the doctrine, seeing it as based on the New Testament teaching of Paul the Apostle ( and ) and the Old Testament verse of . Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose and Ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in Adam's sin, transmitted by human generation. Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, who equated original sin with concupiscence, affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom. The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared to be heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will.\n\nThe way Thomas Aquinas viewed sin and vices was radically different from later approaches, especially that of 17th-century moral theology. He presented sin and vices as contraries of virtues. He discusses the subject in his Summa Theologica part Ia–IIae (\"Prima secundae\") qq. 71–89.\n\nIn one of his definitions of sin Thomas quotes Augustine of Hippo's description of sin as \"a thought, words and deed against the Eternal Law.\"' \nTo recognise the possibilities of sin in man is equal to acknowledge his human nature, his control and mastery of his own actions. Sin is a motion to the goal, it is judged by the object to which it is directed. The field of sin is the same as the field of virtue. There are three major fields: relationship with God, with oneself and with the neighbour. Thomas distinguished between mortal and venial sins. Mortal sin is when a person has irreparably destroyed the very principle of his/her order to the goal of life. Venial sin is when he/she has acted in a certain disordered way without destructing that principle:\nAccording to Aquinas the gravity of sin depends also on \"some disposition of the agent\" (cf. STh I–II q. 18, aa. 4, 6). Sin, venial by reason of its object, may become mortal. It happens when person fixes his/her ultimate happiness, the last end of his/her life (Lat. \"finis ultimus\") in the object of that venial sin. When venial sin is used as a way to provoke mortal sin it becomes mortal as well, e.g. when someone uses empty conversation or a chat to seduce someone to commit adultery. Also sin, mortal by reason of its object, may become venial because of the agent's disposition when his/her evil act does not have full moral capacity, i.e. is not deliberated by reason. That may happen for instance when sudden movements of unbelief arise in the mind. (Cf. STh I–II q.72 a.5).\n\nThe difference and gravity of sins may be discerned on the grounds of spirit and flesh, even mortal sins may differ in gravity. Carnal sins like lust, adultery or fornication, gluttony and avarice, because the person who commits them is inordinately directed towards material goods that are a serious matter, are mortal sins. They may cause much shame and infamy. But spiritual sins like blaspheming of God or apostasy are, according to Thomas, still greater evil, as they have more of the aversion from God. They are directed against a greater object. The formal, essential element of sin is more at the centre in them. (cf. STh I–II q.72 a.2)\n\nAccording to another formulation of the concept of sin in the \"Summa\", at the heart of sin is \"the turning away from the immutable good\", i.e. God, and \"inordinate turning to mutable good\", i.e. creatures. (STh I–IIae q.87 a.4) This cannot be understood as if in the concrete sinful deed the sinner commits two separate and independent acts. Both \"aversio\" and \"conversio\" constitute one single guilty action. At the root of the inordinate turning to the creatures is self-love which expresses itself in disordered desire (\"cupiditas\") and rebellion towards God (\"superbia\").\n\nSpeaking about sloth (Lat. \"acedia\") Thomas points out that every deed which \"by its very nature is contrary to charity is a mortal sin\". An effect of such deed is the destruction of \"spiritual life which is the effect of charity, whereby God dwells in us.\" Sin of a mortal character is always committed with the consent of reason: \"Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason\"'. (cf. STh II–IIae q.35 a.3) Venial and mortal sins can be compared to sickness and death. While venial sin impairs full healthy activity of a person, mortal sin destroys the principle of spiritual life in him/her.\n\nRoman Catholic doctrine distinguishes between personal sin (also sometimes called \"actual sin\") and original sin. Personal sins are either mortal or venial.\n\nMortal sins are sins of grave (serious) matter, where the sinner performs the act with full knowledge and deliberate consent. (cf. CCC 1857)\n\nThe act of committing a mortal sin destroys charity, i. e. the grace in the heart of a Christian; it is in itself a rejection of God (CCC1855). If left un-reconciled, mortal sins may lead to eternal separation from God, traditionally called damnation.\n\nVenial sins are sins which do not meet the conditions for mortal sins. The act of committing a venial sin does not cut off the sinner from God's grace, as the sinner has not rejected God. However, venial sins do injure the relationship between the sinner and God, and as such, must be reconciled to God, either through the Sacrament of Reconciliation or receiving the Eucharist (after proper contrition fulfilled).\n\nBoth mortal and venial sins have a dual nature of punishment. They incur both guilt for the sin, yielding eternal punishment, and temporal punishment for the sin. Reconciliation is an act of God's mercy, and addresses the guilt and eternal punishment for sin. Purgatory and indulgences address the temporal punishment for sin, and exercise of God's justice.\n\nRoman Catholic doctrine also sees sin as being twofold: Sin is, at once, any evil or immoral \"action\" which infracts God's law and the inevitable consequences, the \"state of being\" that comes about by committing the sinful action. Sin can and does alienate a person both from God and the community. Hence, the Catholic Church's insistence on reconciliation with both God and the Church itself.\n\nThe Roman Catholic view of sin has recently expanded. Monsignor Gianfranco Girotti, Regent of the Catholic Apostolic Penitentiary, has said that \"known sins increasingly manifest themselves as behavior that damages society as a whole,\" including, for example:\n\nMortal sins, which are any severe and intentional actions that directly disobey God, are often confused with the seven deadly sins, which are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. They are not, however, the same. The seven deadly sins are called \"deadly\" because they might lead another to commit other sins. Some forms of the seven deadly sins (i.e. debilitating one's health because of their love of food) can constitute as grave matter, while others may just be venal (i.e. over-eating).\n\nAnother group of four or five sins distinguished by the Church are the sins that cry to heaven: murder, sodomy, (oppression of a people,) oppression of the weak and defrauding the laborer.\n\nMany Protestants of a Calvinist orientation teach that, due to original sin, humanity has lost any and all capacity to move towards reconciliation with God (Romans 3:23;6:23; Ephesians 2:1–3); in fact, this inborn sin turns humans away from God and towards themselves and their own desires (Isaiah 53:6a). Thus, humans may be brought back into a relationship with God only by way of God's rescuing the sinner from his/her hopeless condition (Galatians 5:17–21; Ephesians 2:4–10) through Jesus' substitutionary atonement (Romans 5:6–8; Colossians 2:13–15; 1 Timothy 2:5–6). According to traditional Reformed theology and classical Lutheranism, Salvation is \"sola fide\" (by faith alone); \"sola gratia\" (by grace alone); and is begun and completed by God alone through Jesus (Ephesians 2:8,9). This understanding of original sin (Romans 5:12–19), is most closely associated with Calvinist doctrine (see total depravity) and Lutheranism. Calvinism allows for the relative or nominal \"goodness\" of humanity through God's common grace upon both those predestined to salvation and those predestined to damnation, upon the regenerate and the unregenerate. Methodist Arminian theology adapts the concept by stating that humans, entirely sinful and totally depraved, can only \"do good\" through God's \"prevenient grace\".\n\nThis is in contrast to the Roman Catholic teaching that while sin has tarnished the original goodness of humanity prior to the Fall, it has not entirely extinguished that goodness, or at least the \"potential\" for goodness, allowing humans to reach towards God to share in the Redemption which Jesus Christ won for them. Some Protestants and Orthodox Christians hold similar views.\n\nThere is dispute about where sin originated. Some who interpret the king of Tyre in Ezekiel 28 as a symbol for Satan believe sin originated when Satan coveted the position that rightfully belongs to God. The origin of individual sins is discussed in James 1:14–15 – \"but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.\" (NIV)\n\nWithin some branches of Protestantism, there are several defined types of sin (as in Roman Catholicism):\n\n\nThe (Chalcedonian) Eastern Orthodox as well as the (non-Chalcedonian) Oriental Orthodox use \"sin\" both to refer to humanity's fallen condition and to refer to individual sinful acts. In many ways the Orthodox Christian view of sin is similar to the Jewish, although neither form of Orthodoxy makes formal distinctions among \"grades\" of sins.\n\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches, which derive their theology and spirituality from same sources as the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox, tend not to adhere to the Roman Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin taught by the Latin Church. Like the Orthodox Churches, however, the Eastern Catholic Churches do make a distinction between sins that are serious enough to bar one from Holy Communion (and must be confessed before receiving once again) and those which are not sufficiently serious to do so. In this respect, the Eastern Tradition is similar to the Western, but the Eastern Churches do not consider death in such a state to automatically mean damnation to \"hell.\"\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that sin is inherited, like a disease, and has been passed on from generation to generation of humans, beginning with Adam and Eve, whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters. They believe that it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was \"Good and Bad.\" They believe that at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to \"be\" souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, they believe that his soul dies as well. They believe that Jesus is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.\n\nIn Christianity, it is generally understood that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice that relieves believers of the burden of their sins. However, the actual meaning of this precept is very widely debated. The traditional teaching of some churches traces this idea of atonement to blood sacrifices in the ancient Hebraic faith.\n\nChristian theologians have presented different interpretations of atonement:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3227866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3227866", "title": "Gang Il-sun", "text": "Gang Il-sun\n\nGang Il-sun, (강일순, Chinese 姜甑山) (September 19, 1871 – June 24, 1909), also known as Kang Il-sun and known to his followers as Kang Jeungsan, is the founder of Jeungsanism, a Korean religious movement that generated after his death around one hundred different new religions, including Daesoon Jinrihoe and Jeung San Do. Jeungsanism, as his movement was called, and various Korean new religions (\"sinheung jonggyo\", literally, \"newly emerged religions\") derived from it, have been seen by scholars as a syncretism of Buddhism (\"Bul-gyo\"), Confucianism (\"Yu-gyo\"), Taoism (\"Do-gyo\") with unique religious insights of Kang and certain elements borrowed from Christianity (\"Gidok-gyo\"), as well as an underlying Korean shamanism (\"Musok-Sinang\").\n\nGang Il-sun was born in Gobu County, Jeolla Province (present-day Deokcheon Township of Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, Korea) on September 19, 1871, according to the Lunar calendar mostly used by his followers. There is a hagiographic literature written by his followers, which describes miraculous phenomena surrounding his early years. For instance, hagiographical accounts record that \"at the time of his birth (...) two female fairies descended from heaven into the delivery room,\" filling it with a \"sweet-smelling aroma.\" Later, it is claimed that he \"learned Chinese classics at a village school and mastered them to the point of memorizing and reciting all of them by heart,\" through a complete understanding of their meaning.\nIn 1891, Gang married Jeong Chi-sun (1874-1928), a lady from Gimje County. In 1894, he opened a school in the home of his brother-in-law Jeong Nam-Gi. He acquired a reputation for his knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism Taoism, and Korean folk religions, and gathered a few disciples Reputedly, he also visited Kim Il Bu (1826-1898), the well known scholar who introduced the \"Jeong-yeok\", i.e. a new interpretation of the Chinese I Ching(Book of Changes). Kim is said to have offered a new arrangement of the I Ching Chinese trigrams, together with other diagrams and an explanatory text, including insights he had received in a mysterious vision. His re-balancing of the trigrams had a profound influence on many Korean new religions, including those derived from Gang.\n\nIn 1860 Choe Je-u, concerned about the growing influence of the West, the increasing Japanese presence in Joseon Korea, widespread corruption in government and established religion, and abuse of power by the \"yangban\" (aristocratic social class), alleged he had a revelation from the Supreme God \"Sangje\" (\"Shang-ti\" in Chinese) and attained enlightenment. Choe Je-u became the founder of the Donghak (Eastern Learning) movement, the prototype of many subsequent Korean syncretistic new religions. Donghak culminated in the unsuccessful Donghak Rebellion of 1894, which was fueled by a combination of religious fervor centering on the millennial visions of a coming messiah and anger regarding Seoul's high taxes. Central to Choe Je-u’s teachings was a belief in Hu-Cheon Gaebyeok, the Great Opening (Gaebyeok) of the Later World (Hu-Cheon), the new age paradise of Donghak, which also later characterized Gang Il-sun’s millenarian vision.\nGang Il-sun, in fact, insisted that he was Sangje himself who, prior to incarnating on earth, had bestowed that revelation upon Choe Je-u. Gang \"had considerable connections with the Donghak movement, not only ideologically but also geographically,\" as the village where Gang lived was only four kilometers away from the location where the first uprising of the Donghak revolution began. Later, Gang gathered a number of followers in the North Jeolla province, where he lived, and among them where some members of Donghak. Although he was interested in the religious ideas of Donghak, Gang Il-sun predicted, quite correctly, the defeat of Donghak's peasant militia, and advised his followers not to join it. He believed that the problems of Korea, and human society in general, would be solved through spiritual awakening rather than armed rebellion.\n\nAfter the bloody defeat of Donghak, Gang Il-sun wandered around Korea for three years, surveying public sentiment. In 1900, he returned home and, starting in the years that followed, gathered a sizable number of followers. According to these followers, during the Summer of 1901 he achieved enlightenment on the Moaksan mountain, after forty-nine days of ascetic practices and fasting. In fact, the followers claimed for their spiritual leader much more than enlightenment, as they accepted his claim that he was Sangje, the Supreme Lord, who had bestowed a revelation upon Choe Je-u and had than incarnated in this world to initiate a New Age. According to Daesoon Jinrihoe, the largest movement recognizing Gang as Sangje, his ascetic practices in the Moaksan mountain were performed to open the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth and to exercise judgement on the divine beings and were, thus, more than ascetic practices. The followers also claimed that he judged all deities in charge of the Former World, opened the way to the Later World and, through the rituals he performed between 1901 and 1909, achieved a complete “Reordering of the Universe” (\"Cheonji Gongsa\"). Daesun Jinrihoe believes that there was a residual work of reordering, to be completed by his successors in the religious orthodoxy, Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958) and Park Wudang (1918-1996). Another branch of Jeungsanism, Jeung San Do, believes that, as Gang was God the Father, his female disciple Goh Pan-Lye (1880-1935), revered by Jeung San Do with the title of Tae-mo-nim, was God the mother and between 1926 and 1935 performed her own reordering of the universe.\n\nAfter the Donghak rebellion, Japan had a growing presence in Korea, and this culminated in the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 and the formal annexation of Korea by Japan. Gang Il-sun maintained an attitude similar to the one he had exhibited when confronted with the Donghak movement. Although critical of those Koreans who sided unconditionally with the Japanese, Gang Il-sun again advised against \"any form of violence\" and \"stressed reconciliation and peace,\" insisting also that this period of Japanese rule in Korea would bring resolution to the grievances that Japan had in history His peaceful attitude, however, did not protect him from the suspicions of the Japanese authorities. On December 25, 1907, he and a number of his followers were arrested, based on the suspect that they intended to raise an army against the Japanese. Reportedly, \"even in prison, he made peaceful gestures\" and \"did not protest against the authorities in any way.\" He was finally released on February 4, 1908, continued his rituals and preaching, and passed away on June 24, 1909 at the Donggok Clinic he had established in 1908.\n\nGang Il-sun did not designate a successor, and after his passing his movement split into many different factions. In 1911, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” although there were two \"Subus\" in Gang's circle), a female disciple, emerged as the leader of one of the largest factions, which eventually came under the control of Goh's male cousin, Cha Gyeong-Seok (1880-1936). Cha's branch, known as Bocheonism (Bocheob-gyo), according to some scholars \"had more followers during the Japanese colonial period than any other religion, more than an estimated 6 million adherents.\" However, it declined quite rapidly. Goh had separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own organization, which in turn divided into several rival factions after her death. Kim Hyeong-Ryeol (1862-1932), another leading disciple of Gang Il-sun, originally supported Cha but left him in 1914 and established yet another branch with the help of Gang Il-sun's widow, Jeong. Again, this branch split into several independent groups. Ultimately, around one hundred different groups claiming the legacy of Gang Il-sun came into existence, although few of them survive to this day.\n\nThe largest one is Daesun Jinrihoe, which originates from Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958), who was not a direct disciple of Gang Il-sun but claimed to have received a revelation from him in 1917, eight years after Gang Il-sun's death. Jo Jeongsan's followers claim, however, that in 1909 Gang Il-sun saw a train passing, which had Jo Jeongsan, then a teenager, aboard with his family, heading to Bongcheon, Manchuria, to live in exile there, and stated: “A man can do anything at the age of 15 if he is able to take his identification tag (\"hopae\") with him.” Jo Jeongsan's disciples later claimed that these words amounted to an endorsement by Gang Il-sun of Jo Jeongsan as his successor. Gang's only daughter, Sun-Im (1904-1959), originally accepted Jo but later established her own branch, known as Jeung San Beob Jong Gyo, which is headquartered in Korea's North Jeolla province, and after protracted litigation with other branches obtained the mortal remains of Kang, which are currently at its headquarters.\n\nBe it as it may be, and although statistics are in turn a matter of contention, there is little doubt that a large number of Koreans, perhaps as much as several millions, are today connected with one or another branch of the religious movement started by Gang Il-sun and recognize him as a divine incarnation, the majority of them belonging to Daesun Jinrihoe. Both Daesun Jinrihoe and Jeung San Do have also started a missionary activity abroad, particularly in the United States. Certainly, Gang Il-Sun did not believe that his message of salvation was restricted to Korea and indeed he explicitly taught that it was intended for the whole world.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4320585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4320585", "title": "Haidakhan Babaji", "text": "Haidakhan Babaji\n\nHaidakhan Babaji, simply called \"Babaji\" or Bhole Baba by his students and devotees, was a teacher who appeared near the village of Haidakhan in northern India (Uttarakhand) and taught publicly from 1970 to 1984.\n\nAccording to \"The Teachings of Babaji,\" Haidakhan Babaji \"appeared\" in June 1970 in a cave at the foot of the Kumaon Mount Kailash, across the river Gautama Ganga, near a remote village called Hairakhan, in the Nainital District of Uttrakhand, India. His followers maintain that Haidakhan Babaji is a Mahavatar – \"a human manifestation of God, not born from woman.\"\n\nIt is reported that starting in late September 1970 Haidakhan Babaji spent forty-five days meditating in a small temple on the top of the Kumaon Mount Kailash \"without leaving his seat.\" In September 1971, Haidakhan Babaji, in a sworn testimony, convinced the judge of the court in Haldwani that he was the \"Old Hariakhan Baba,” thought to be active in that region in the years 1860–1922, and that he had the right to use the ashrams in Kathgaria and Haidakhan. In 1971 Haidakhan Babaji started travelling across India, proclaiming his Message, performing sacred ceremonies, such as yagna, and attracting more devotees. This included celebrities, such as Shammi Kapoor, and gradually more Westerners.\n\nThough some of his followers believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji died on 14 February 1984, of what appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram. This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:\n\nHaidakhan Babaji maintained that: “All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love.” In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore Sanatana Dharma rather than Hindu Dharma (Hinduism). Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation. He explained further: \"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. \"\n\nHe stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: \"In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\" He said: \"We are all one with each other and with God.\" Haidakhan Babaji said: \"You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love.\" Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: \"One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane.\" He said: \"The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain – physical, mental, spiritual – and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (…) He also made the following statement: \"The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (…) this is the only way to success in life.\"\n\nBabaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one’s duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings. Babaji used to say that: \"Work is worship\" and that hard work is the best spiritual practice. On another occasion he said: \"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma – activity – is the only thing which can drive out all evils.” Babaji also taught that \"perfection in work\" was the real meaning of Kriya Yoga.\n\nNama Japa, the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings:\n\nHaidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the mantra \"ॐ namaḥ śivāy\" (Sanskrit: ॐ नमः शिवाय् ) - while \"ॐ\" is mostly transliterated as \"oṃ\" or \"auṃ\") - because of its protective qualities, but also stated that one can use any God's name \"his religion teaches.\" The mantra is always written internationally simplified as \"Om Namah Shivay\" in books about Babaji written in English or other languages.\n\nHaidakhan Babaji warned his followers about the forthcoming Great Revolution or Maha Kranti. He described Maha Kranti as involving \"earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars (...).\" In the context of these upcoming calamities, he called for courage: “Walk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (…) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day.” Haidakhan Babaji urged his followers to be \"inspired.\" He stated: \"Everything in this world is 'PHURO' – transient. It has no reality. True reality is to proceed on the path of truth, to keep the company of saintly people, and to render service to men.\"\n\nBabaji advocated on behalf of the less-fortunate. He stated: \"you should look to the areas of your countries where people are poverty-stricken and helpless and then do all you can to raise their standard of living, teaching them cleanliness and high morals. To serve the needy truly and from the heart is true service to God. (...)\"\n\nBabaji would typically start his day around 3:00 am, with a bath, often in cold Gautama Ganga, which was followed by meditation or a fire ceremony. Around 5:00 am he would see his devotees for ceremonial chandan (placing a mark on forehead), followed by morning Aarti (devotional singing) around 6:00 am Then until noon everybody would be engaged in some form of karma yoga. At noon the only meal of the day was being served, followed by more karma yoga in the afternoon. Sometimes a more elaborate ceremony such as havan would be performed around the noon time. Havan is a fire ceremony. In the afternoon, Babaji would sometimes see the devotees for individual audiences, known as darshan. Then there would be another bath, followed by the evening Aarti. After the evening Aarti, Babaji was giving short speeches that were recorded in \"The Teachings of Babaji.\"\n\nHaidakhan Babaji was often asked who he was. He made the following assertions about himself:\n\nOld Hairakhan Baba – as mentioned above Haidakhan Babaji maintained that he was identical with Hairakhan Baba (also spelled as Hariakhan or Heriakhan) who lived around Hairakhan in the years 1860–1922.\n\nMahavatar Babaji – it appears that Haidakhan Babaji pointed out or implied a few times that he was identical with Mahavatar Babaji described in Yogandanda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi.\" This claim is apparently disputed by the Self-Realization Fellowship, the society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda. The practices of these latter differ. Those by Baba Haidakhan were much simpler and did not involve any secret ceremony.\n\nMessenger – Haidakhan Babaji would sometimes refer to himself as \"messenger of revolution” He often urged the followers to \"spread his Message.\"\nMahaprabhuji – on one occasion Babaji stated: \"I am Bhole Baba (Simple Father). I am nobody and nothing. I am only like a mirror in which you can see yourself. I am like a fire. Don’t keep too far away or you will not get warmth. But don’t get too near or you may burn yourself. Learn the right distance. My name is Maha Prabhuji (The Great God).\" Vishnu Dutt Shastriji said the following about Mahaprabhuji: \"Sitting here at Haidakhan, Mahaprabhuji has control over every particle of the Creation by the power of His mere wish, by His very thought. (...) Mahaprabhuji has control over the elements, the spiritual world – to say nothing of the world of men. He is the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the world. Not a single blade of grass can grow but that He wills it. He has incarnated in a human body for the welfare of mankind. His sole desire – is to make it possible for the whole world to be liberated. He shall do His utmost to achieve liberation of the world.\"\nThe Guru of all Gurus – Gaura Devi recorded Babaji saying: \"I am no one’s Guru, but I am the Guru of gurus.\"\nI am everywhere – Haidakhan Babaji was recorded saying: \"I am everywhere – in your every breath. I have come to help you realize unity beyond division. I will show you a freedom you have not imagined. You must seek that unity from whence there is awareness that we are all one. Seek harmony in all that you do. I am harmony. If you are in peace, I am in peace. If you are troubled, I am troubled. If you are happy, I am happy. Be happy. Have faith – everything depends on faith.\"\n\n\n"}

The album received positive reviews.\n\nHis stand-up comedy has been featured on Comedy Central programs such as \"Live at Gotham\" and \"John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show\". He has also performed on several late night talkshows such as \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", \"Lopez Tonight\", \"Russell Howard's Good News\", \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Late Show with David Letterman\",\" Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell\", and \"Conan\". Additionally, he performed a set at the 2012 \"Secret Policeman's Ball\" at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\n\nAn hourlong Comedy Central show, \"Hannibal Buress Live from Chicago\", aired on March 29, 2014.\n\nHe used to host a weekly stand-up comedy show at The Knitting Factory on Sunday evenings in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nBuress played Coach Wilson in the 2017 Marvel movie \"\". He paid a lookalike to attend the film's premiere in his place.\n\nOn October 16, 2014, at the Philadelphia club The Trocadero, Buress was recorded doing an extended routine about existing rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby. Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of \"talk[ing] down\" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, \"Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches.\" The audience appeared to respond to Buress's accusation with incredulity; he encouraged everyone to search for \"Bill Cosby rape\" when they got home.\n\nBuress had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on \"Philadelphia\" magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his set, a \"Teflon image\" despite more than a decade of public sex-abuse accusations.\n\nComedian Eddie Murphy later referenced Buress's role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Buress' life.\n\nBuress is an atheist.\n\nAfter living in New York City, Buress moved back to Chicago in 2017 and settled in its Wicker Park neighborhood.\n\nIn December 2017, Buress was arrested in Miami for disorderly intoxication. Bystander footage of the arrest showed Buress mocking the police officers and demanding to know why he was being arrested. The arrest report revealed that Buress was detained because he approached the police officers and would not stop asking them to call an Uber for him. Buress later stated, \"I asked the [officer] to call me an Uber, and he said, 'No.' He told me to leave the street. I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber. He follows me into the bar, and told me I'm too drunk to go inside. [...] 'If I can't be on the street, where do you want me to be?' I ask him. I was in a state of trying to get home. [...] I don't really believe I was at fault.\" The case was later dismissed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1187088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1187088", "title": "Islam in Egypt", "text": "Islam in Egypt\n\nIslam in Egypt is the dominant religion with around an estimated 90% of the population. Almost the entirety of Egypt's Muslims are Sunnis,<ref name=\"The world factbook/Egypt/\"></ref> with a small minority of Shia and Ahmadi Muslims. The latter, however, are not recognized by Egypt. Islam has been recognized as the state religion since 1980. Since there has been no religious census the actual percentage of Muslims is not known: the Christians are estimated to be number between 8% to 12% according to sources cited in articles Religion in Egypt and Christianity in Egypt.\n\nPrior to Napoleon's invasion in 1798, almost all of Egypt's educational, legal, public health, and social welfare issues were in the hands of religious functionaries. Ottoman rule reinforced the public and political roles of the ulama (religious scholars), as Mamluk rule had done before the Ottomans, because Islam was the state religion and because political divisions in the country were based on religious divisions. During the 19th and 20th centuries, successive governments made extensive efforts to limit the role of the ulama in public life and to bring religious institutions under closer state control.\n\nAfter the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the government assumed responsibility for appointing officials to mosques and religious schools. The government mandated reform of Al-Azhar University beginning in 1961. These reforms permitted department heads to be drawn from outside the ranks of the traditionally trained orthodox ulama.\n\nIn the late 10th century, the Shia Ismaili caliphate of the Fatimids made Egypt their center and Cairo their capital. Egypt flourished and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages. Many traces of Fatimid architecture exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the Al Azhar University and the Al Hakim mosque. The Fatimid palace in Cairo had two parts. It stood in the Khan el-Khalili area at Bin El-Qasryn street.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Egyptian Islam was a complex and diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar University generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.\n\nMuhammad Ali, who assumed power in Egypt in the early 1800s, nationalized all land, including hundreds of thousands of hectares of land belonging to Al Azhar Mosque, putting the funding of that institution under state control. This put an end to the political independence of the Ulama. Awqaf, traditionally independent endowments for mosques and Islamic schools, became a ministry of the government. In 1961, Gamal Abdel Nasser made Al Azhar part of the Ministry of Awqaf or Religious Endowments. He also made the appointment of the grand sheikh the prerogative of the Egyptian president, just as the appointment of any other state official. In time the school became responsible for assigning imams to all major mosques, and all these imams were required to be graduates of the school.\n\nOrthodox ulama or \"the religious establishment\" found themselves in a difficult position during the wave of Islamic activism that swept through Egypt in the 1970s and 1980s. Most Ulama, including those of Al-Azhar University, are employees of the Egyptian state who \"recognize the regime’s primacy, support its stability, and legitimize its policies\". Radical Islamists viewed them as puppets of the status quo. To maintain their influence in the country, the ulama espoused more conservative stances. After 1974, for example, many al-Azhar ulama, who had acquiesced to family planning initiatives in the 1960s, openly criticized government efforts at population control. The ulama also supported moves to reform the country's legal code to conform to Islamic teaching. They remained, nonetheless, comparatively moderate; they were largely loyal to the government and condemned the violence of radical Islamist groups. Outside of the state-mosques are more than 40,000 independent mosques throughout Egypt.\n\nEgyptian Muslims believe that Islam defines one's relationship to God, to other Muslims, and to non-Muslims. Some devout Muslims believe that there can be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Many Muslims say that Egypt's governments have been secularist and even anti-religious since the early 1920s. Politically organized Muslims who seek to purge the country of its secular policies are referred to as \"Islamists.\"\n\nEgypt's largely uneducated urban and rural lower classes are intensely devoted to Islam, but they usually lack a thorough knowledge of the religion. Even village religious leaders usually have only a rudimentary knowledge of Islam. The typical village imam or prayer leader has at most a few years of schooling; his scholarly work was limited to reading prayers and sermons prepared by others and to learning passages from the Qur'an. Popular religion include a variety of unorthodox practices, such as veneration of saints, recourse to charms and amulets, and belief in the influence of evil spirits.\nPopular Islam is based mostly on oral tradition. Imams with virtually no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination plays an important role in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur'an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, and jinns (spirits).\n\nPopular Islam ranges from informal prayer sessions or Qur'an study to organized cults or orders. Because of the pervasive sexual segregation of Egypt's Islamic society, men and women often practice their religion in different ways. A specifically female religious custom is the Zār, a ceremony for helping women placate spirits who are believed to have possessed them. Women specially trained by their mothers or other women in zar lore organize the ceremonies. A zar organizer holds weekly meetings and employs music and dance to induce ecstatic trances in possessed women. Wealthy women sometimes pay to have private zars conducted in their homes; these zars are more elaborate than public ones, last for several days, and sometimes involve efforts to exorcise spirits. However, while once common, the zar is rarely practiced today, under fire for its perception as a religious heresy.\n\nThere are more than 45 million citizens 35 years old or younger. The Influence of digital/youth culture is found in preachers such as the very popular Amr Khaled who \"maintains a disciplined focus on the lives, issues and problems of the upper middle classes\"; espouses `living a comfortable life`; talks to youth about `getting closer to God` without changing one's lifestyle; promotes hijab while \"joking about dating and flirting\". The young `sheikhs` deliver their sermons over the Internet, on private satellite channels and in sports clubs, away from the control of Al-Azhar and the state.\n\nA primarily male spiritual manifestation of Islam is Sufism, an Islamic mystical tradition. It has been called the \"default setting\" of Muslim religious life in Egypt although many Sufis are thought to have voted for the Muslim Brotherhood Freedom and Justice Party.\n\nSufism exists in a number of forms, most of which represent an original \"tarika\" (\"path\") developed by an inspired founder, or sheikh. These sheikhs gradually gathered about themselves murids, or disciples, whom they initiated into the tarika. Gradually the murids formed orders, also known as turuq, which were loyal to the Sheikh or his successors (also called sheikhs). In Egypt there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas), each headed by its own sheikh. Overseeing them is the Supreme Council for Sufi Orders and the president of Egypt is directly in charge of Sufi affairs.\n\nThe devotions of many Sufi orders center on various forms of the dhikr, a ceremony at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples. Since the early 1970s, there has been a revival of interest in Sufism. Egypt's contemporary Sufis tend to be young, college-educated men in professional careers.\n\nEstimates of the number of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim population in Egypt, (six million men) being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country’s roughly 80 million citizens \"claim\" Sufism \"as a practice\", still another says while 15 million are registered as Sufis, \"the true figure is likely to be higher\". Participation at the festivals (moulids) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children). The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women. (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men). Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet Muhammad and his descendants (such as Hussein, the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in Tanta, the largest city in the Nile Delta, and draws an even larger number of pilgrims than hajj in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid Ahmad al-Badawi, a thirteenth-century Sufi leader. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \nEgypt’s Islamic religious establishment is strongly Sufi in character. Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the al-Azhar mosque and university system. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. \nThe current Shaykh al-Azhar (rector of the school), Ahmed el-Tayeb, is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.\n\nAn estimated 5-6 million Egyptians are Salafis. Scholar Tarek Osman describes Salafis before the 2011 revolution as the \"most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country\" with an influence \"many times more than that of organized political Islam.\" With \"no history of violence, no organizational structure, no manifestos and no obvious political ambitions\", they were tolerated by the Mubarak regime and ignored by the news media. The Salafi movement benefited from government support the 1990s when the government hoped to \"combat and undermine\" the violence of the Jihadi Salafi al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya with the preaching of the apolitical Salafis. It has also benefited from some of the $70 billion spent by Saudi Arabia to promote \"Wahhabi\" ideology worldwide through mosques, schools and books, that is similar or \"virtually identical to Salafi beliefs and with which Sufis have had difficulty competing.\"\n\nDuring the Mubarak era most Salafis considered participation in politics to be \"religiously forbidden\", however since then Salafis have shown themselves to be not only tolerant of political participation but very adept. In the 2011–12 Egypt parliamentary elections, the Islamist Bloc led by salafi Al-Nour Party received 27.8% of votes cast or 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested, second-place after the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. Al‑Nour party itself won 111 of the 127 seats.\n\nSufi Islam is a sore point with Salafi Muslims. Salafi and other Islamists believe Sufi tombs are unIslamic and have sometimes sabotaged or vandalized tombs and moulids.\n\nNon-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in Egypt. During the early 20th century, the ideas of Egyptian Quranists like Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi (1881–1920) are thought to have grown out of Salafism – specifically a rejection of taqlid. Notable Egyptian Quranists include Sidqi, Rashad Khalifa, Ahmed Subhy Mansour, and Tawfik Hamid.\n\nWhile almost all of Egypt's Muslims are Sunni, there are a small number of Shia. (Estimates of their number range from 800,000 to \"at most\" three million.) \nThe Syrian civil war has brought on an increase in anti-Shia rhetoric by Sunnis, harassment and arrest, and in at least one case bloodshed. In June 2013 a mob of several hundred, including Muslim brotherhood members, attacked a house in the village of Abu Musallim near Cairo, dragging four Shia worshipers through the street before lynching them. Eight other Shia were injured.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya movement in Egypt, which numbers up to 50,000 adherents in the country, was established in 1922 but has seen an increase in hostility and government repression as of the 21st century. The Al-Azhar University has denounced the Ahmadis and Ahmadis have been hounded by police along with other Muslim groups deemed to be deviant under Egypt's defamation laws. On 15 March 2010, nine Ahmadis were detained due to their adherence to the movement.\n\nThere are a significant amount of Nondenominational Muslims in Egypt. Roughly twelve percent of Egyptians, when asked about their religious affiliation, answered that they were \"just a Muslim\" or \"just Muslim\". Their lack of identifying with a particular sect was noteworthy.\n\nThe Ministry of Awqaf or Religious Endowments, oversees mosques in Egypt. There are more than 110,000 mosques registered with the state in Egypt. The ministry assigns ulama to registered mosques, which critics complain inevitably involves favoritism and political connections.\n\nIn the wake of the 2013 coup the state imposed tighter controls on mosques. \nThe Awqaf Ministry command the mosques be locked between prayer times and took control of donation boxes. In September 2013 it declared that only imams who had graduated from Al Azhar University (estimated at 58,000) would be allowed to hold Friday sermons. This effectively banned an estimated 53,000 imams from preaching in mosques, although it is not clear if this edict can be enforced. In 2015, the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments initiated a campaign to remove any books authored by Salafi scholars from all mosques in Egypt.\n\nCritics have complained that the actions of Awqaf reflect the government that controls them. Mahmoud Zakzouk, minister of Awqaf from 1995 to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, was appointed by Mubarak and dismissed at his overthrow. Under the Mohamed Morsi government, critics alleged the Muslim Brotherhood put \"its allies in high positions\". And under the post-coup government the new Awqaf minister is reportedly \"quietly purging all Brotherhood appointees\".\n\nIslamic political activism has a lengthy history in Egypt. Several Islamic political groups started soon after World War I ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the Muslim Brotherhood (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, also known as the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. After World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with Gamal Abdel Nasser. The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group's leaders. In the 1970s, Anwar Sadat amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, parallel society based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation with the regime.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a political force coincided with the proliferation of Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 Six-Day War was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism. Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted jihad and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, Islamists perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of Anwar Sadat in October 1981.\n\nDisruptive social changes and Sadat's relative tolerance toward political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamic groups in the 1970s. On university campuses, for example, Sadat initially viewed the rise of Islamic associations (Gama'at Islamiya) as a counterbalance to leftist influence among students. The Gama'at Islamiya spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the segregation of classes by gender. Secular university administrators opposed these goals. In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At Asyut University, which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and Copts), the president and other top administrators—who were Islamists—supported Gama'at Islamiya demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment. Public opinion in Egypt supported political Islam to some extent, one poll in the mid-1980s found 96% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the application of the Sharia.\n\n, the Islamists sought to make Egypt a community of the faithful based on their vision of an Islamic social order. They rejected conventional, secularist social analyses of Egypt's socioeconomic problems. They maintained, for example, that the causes of poverty were not overpopulation or high defense expenditures but the populace's spiritual failures—laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life. The Islamists created their own alternative network of social and economic institutions through which members could work, study, and receive medical treatment in an Islamic environment.\n\nIslamists rejected Marxism and Western capitalism. Indeed, they viewed atheistic communism, Jewish Zionism, and Western \"Crusader-minded\" Christianity as their main enemies, which were responsible for the decadence that led to foreign domination and defeat by Zionists. They were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Islamists tended to be hostile toward the orthodox ulama, especially the scholars at Al Azhar who frequently criticized the Islamists' extreme religious interpretations. Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as \"pulpit parrots\" committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.\n\nThe social origins of Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed primarily to urban civil servants and white and blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from a broad spectrum of social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study—medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy—were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.\n\nVarious Islamist groups espoused different means for achieving their political agenda. All Islamists, however, were concerned with Islam's role in the complex and changing society of Egypt in the late twentieth century. A common focus of their political efforts has been to incorporate the Shari'a into the country's legal code. In deference to their increasing influence, the Ministry of Justice in 1977 published a draft law making apostasy by a Muslim a capital offense and proposing traditional Islamic punishments for crimes, such as stoning for adultery and amputation of a hand for theft. In 1980 Egypt supported a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment to make the Shari'a \"the sole source of law.\" The influence of the Islamists temporarily waned in the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in 1981, but the election of nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood to the People's Assembly in 1984 revived Islamists' prospects. In 1985 the People's Assembly voted to initiate a procedure for the gradual application of the Shari'a, beginning with an indefinite education period to prepare the population for the legal changes; the next step would be to amend all existing laws to exclude any provisions that conflict with the Shari'a. Moves to reform the legal code received support from many Muslims who wanted to purify society and reject Western legal codes forced on Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries. As of 2009, the Grand Mufti also has another title, Dar al-Iftaa, a part of the Ministry of Justice. While his rulings are nonbinding, they are \"influential.\" His office issues 5,000 fatwas a week.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, only the Gama'at Islamiya leaders who were in prison after the assassination of Sadat were released after several books they wrote and interviews showed that they revised their points of view and changed the radical tone of their speeches.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the practice of religion; however, the Government places restrictions on this right. According to the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion, and Shari'a is the primary source of legislation; religious practices that conflict with the official interpretation of Shari'a are prohibited. However, since the Government does not consider the practice of Christianity or Judaism to conflict with Shari'a, for the most part members of the non-Muslim minority worship without legal harassment and may maintain links with coreligionists in other countries. Members of other religions that are not recognized by the Government, such as the Bahá'í Faith, may experience personal and collective hardship.\n\nAn 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition Interior Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman decree also requires the President to approve permits for the repair of church facilities.\n\nIn December 1999, in response to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, President Mubarak issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.\n\nAccording to a 1995 law, the application of family law, including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial, is based on an individual's religion. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three \"heavenly religions\": Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on Shari'a (Islamic law). Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.\n\nUnder Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it easier for a woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected.\n\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\n"}

In 2016, there were an estimated 20,000 Muslims in the Czech Republic representing 0.2% of the country's population.\n\nFirst documented visit of a person with knowledge of Islam was made (964-965) by Íbrahím ibn Jaqúb, a Jewish merchant from then-Muslim Spain. His memoirs were later published to become one of the first accounts about Central Europe in Islamic world.\n\nDuring both sieges of Vienna, reconnaissance groups of Ottoman armies reached Moravia. Strong trade links between Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire emerged during the 19th century.\n\nTraditionally, influence of Islam on culture of Czech lands has been small.\n\nA law 1912 by the Austro-Hungarian monarchy recognised Islam as a \"state religion\" and officially allowed its presence in what is now the Czech Republic. The first community (\"Muslimské náboženské obce pro Československo\") was established in 1934 and disbanded in 1949. An attempt to set up a new community in 1968 failed. In 1991, the \"Center of Muslim communities\" () was established. In 1998 the first mosque was opened, in Brno and a year later another, in the capital, Prague . Attempts to open mosques in other cities have been stopped by local citizens. In 2004 Islam was officially registered in the Czech Republic: the community is thus eligible to obtain funds from the state.\n\nMost of the Muslims are from Bosnia-Herzegovina (early 1990s) and former countries of Soviet Union (mostly from Caucasus region, from the late 1990s until the present). A significant and influential part are the middle-class people of Egyptian, Syrian and other Middle Eastern ancestries (typically those who studied in Czechoslovakia and decided to stay). A few hundred Muslims are Czech converts.\n\nPresident Miloš Zeman is among those who have expressed fear that Islamic terrorism could threaten the Republic. In August 2016, for the first time, a Czech citizen was charged on suspicion of trying to join the ISIS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6852012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6852012", "title": "Jesus Camp", "text": "Jesus Camp\n\nJesus Camp is a 2006 American documentary film directed by Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing about a Charismatic Christian summer camp, where children spend their summers being taught that they have \"prophetic gifts\" and can \"take back America for Christ\". According to the distributor, it \"doesn't come with any prepackaged point of view\" and attempts to be \"an honest and impartial depiction of one faction of the evangelical Christian community\".\n\n\"Jesus Camp\" debuted at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, and was sold by A&E Indie Films to Magnolia Pictures. Nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 79th Academy Awards, the film was met with controversy that led to the closure of the camp.\n\n\"Jesus Camp\" is about the Kids on Fire School of Ministry, a charismatic Christian summer camp located just outside Devils Lake, North Dakota and run by Becky Fischer and her ministry, \"Kids in Ministry International.\" The film focuses on three children who attended the camp in the summer of 2005—Levi, Rachael, and Tory (Victoria). The film cuts between footage of the camp and a children's prayer conference held just before the camp at Christ Triumphant Church, a large charismatic church in Lee's Summit, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City.\n\nAll three children are already very devout Christians. Levi has preached several sermons at his father's church, Rock of Ages Church in St. Robert, Missouri. He is homeschooled, his mother explaining that God did not give her a child just so he could be raised by someone else eight hours a day. He learns science from a book that attempts to reconcile young-earth creationism with scientific principles. He is also taught that global warming is a political speculation, that the speculation stems from temperatures being higher in the summer months, that America's temperature has \"only\" risen by 0.6 °F, and therefore, the rise is not important. Levi preaches a sermon at the camp in which he declares that his generation is key to bringing Jesus back. Rachael, who also attends Levi's church (her father was assistant pastor at the time), is seen praying over a bowling ball during a game early in the film, and frequently passes Christian tracts (including some by Jack Chick) to strangers, telling them that Jesus loves them. She does not think highly of non-charismatic churches (or \"dead churches\" as she calls them), feeling they are not \"churches that God likes to go to.\" Tory is a member of the Children's Praise Dance Team at Christ Triumphant Church. She frequently dances to Christian heavy metal music, and says she has to check herself to make sure she isn't \"dancing for the flesh.\"\n\nAt the camp, Fischer stresses the need for children to purify themselves in order to be part of the \"army of God.\" She strongly believes that children need to be in the forefront of turning America toward conservative Christian values. She also feels that Christians need to focus on training kids since \"the enemy\" (radical Islam) is focused on training theirs. She compares the preparation she is giving children with the training of terrorists in the Middle East. \"I want to see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam,\" she tells the camera. \"I want to see them radically laying down their lives for the gospel, as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine.\"\n\nIn one scene shot at Christ Triumphant Church, a woman brings a life-sized cutout of George W. Bush to the front of the church and has the children stretch their hands toward him in prayer for him. This is a derivative of laying on of hands, a common practice in charismatic Christian circles. In another scene, Lou Engle preaches a message urging children to join the fight to end abortion in America. Children are shown a series of plastic models of developing fetuses, and have their mouths covered with red tape with \"Life\" written across it. Engle is a founder of the Justice House of Prayer and a leader of Harvest International Ministries, a network of charismatic-oriented ministries with which both the church and Fischer's ministry are affiliated. He prays for Bush to have the strength to appoint \"righteous judges\" who will overturn \"Roe v. Wade\". By the end of the sermon, the children are chanting, \"Righteous judges! Righteous judges!\"\n\nThere is also a scene at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado where Ted Haggard preaches a sermon against homosexuality. Before the service, Levi mentioned how he admired Ted Haggard and was looking forward to meeting him. After the sermon, Levi informs Haggard that he has already preached sermons and wants to be a preacher when he grows up. Haggard advises him: \"I say, use your cute kid thing until you're thirty, and by then you'll have good content.\" Afterward, Levi, Rachael, Tory, their families and several other children take part in a Justice House of Prayer rally held by Engle in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThroughout the movie, there are cut scenes to a debate between Fischer and Mike Papantonio, an attorney and a radio talk-show host for Air America Radio's \"Ring of Fire\". Papantonio questions Fischer's motives for focusing her ministry efforts on children. Fischer explains that she does not believe that people are able to choose their belief system once they pass childhood, and that it is important that they be \"indoctrinated\" in evangelical Christian values from a young age. Fischer also explains that democracy is flawed and designed to destroy itself \"because we have to give everyone equal freedom\".\n\n\"Jesus Camp\" was screened at Michael Moore's Traverse City Film Festival against the wishes of the distribution company, Magnolia Pictures. Magnolia had pulled \"Jesus Camp\" from the festival earlier in the summer after it purchased rights to the film, in a decision apparently inspired by Moore's association with the film festival, with Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles saying \"I don't want the perception out in the public that this is an agenda-laden film\".\n\nThe DVD, released in January 2007, includes 15 deleted scenes. In one of them, Levi's father and mother suggest that a future president may well have been at Kids on Fire. In another, a woman takes several of the kids on a \"prayer walk\" through Lee's Summit, and later takes them to a pro-life women's clinic. A Planned Parenthood clinic is located next door, and the woman has the kids pray over it. In an interview, the pro-life clinic's director says that she was very pleased to see children so passionate about ending abortion.\n\nThe DVD also includes commentary by Grady and Ewing. They reveal that when they arrived in Kansas City, there was a great deal of excitement over the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. However, according to Grady and Ewing, Fischer and the others did not see their activism for socially conservative causes as political, but as a matter of faith. They also reveal that Fischer and the others did not understand why some of the scenes of them speaking in tongues and praying over objects were included in the film, since such occurrences were second nature to them. Furthermore, on the DVD commentary, Heidi and Grady refer to the central character, Becky Fisher, as \"a great documentary subject\" because of her charisma.\n\nAccording to Ron Reno of Focus on the Family, \n\nThe directors' claims that they were simply trying to create an 'objective' film about children and faith ring hollow. I don't question the motives of the Christians shown in the film. Indeed, the earnestness and zeal with which the young people pictured attempt to live out their faith are admirable. Unfortunately, however, it appears that they were unknowingly being manipulated by the directors in their effort to cast evangelical Christianity in an unflattering light.\nIn November 2006, Fischer announced that she would be shutting down the camp due to negative reaction towards her in the film. According to Fischer's website, the owners of the property used for the camp shown in the film were concerned about vandalism to the premises following the film's release and thus will not allow it to be used for any future camps. Fischer has said that the camp will be indefinitely postponed until other suitable premises can be found, but that it will be back.\n\n\"Jesus Camp\" received an 87% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus states, \"Evangelical indoctrination is given an unflinching, even-handed look in this utterly worthwhile documentary.\" The documentary has a 62/100 score on Metacritic based on 28 mainstream reviews.\n\nMichael Smith of the \"Tulsa World\" gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"impressive in its even-handed presentation\", \"straightforward\" and \"a revealing, unabashed look at the formation of tomorrow's army of God.\"\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" reviewer Jessica Reaves also gave the film three stars out of four and writes that Jesus Camp is \"an enlightening and frank look at what the force known as Evangelical America believes, preaches and teaches their children\" and concludes that what the filmmakers \"have accomplished here is remarkable—capturing the visceral humanity, desire and unflagging political will of a religious movement.\"\n\nDavid Edelstein of \"CBS Sunday Morning\", \"New York\", and NPR finds \"Jesus Camp\" \"a frightening, infuriating, yet profoundly compassionate documentary about the indoctrination of children by the Evangelical right.\"\n\nSome reviewers responded negatively to the film; Rob Nelson of the \"Village Voice\" called the movie \"[an] absurdly hypocritical critique of the far right's role in the escalating culture war\", and J. R. Jones of the \"Chicago Reader\" criticized the film for \"failing to distinguish the more fundamentalist Pentecostals\" and for inserting \"unnecessary editorializing\" by using clips from Mike Papantonio's radio show.\n\n\"Jesus Camp\" was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 79th Academy Awards; it lost to Davis Guggenheim and Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth\".\n\n\n\n"}

This Maha Pushkaram(occurs once every 144 years) is observed for a period of 12 days from the time of entry of Jupiter into \"Tula\" rasi (Libra).\n\nMayiladuthurai (formerly known by its Sanskrit name Mayuram) is a town in Nagapattinam district in Tamil Nadu.The town is located at a distance of 281 km (175 mi) from the state capital Chennai. Mayiladuthurai is known for the Mayuranathaswami Temple, a prominent Shaivite shrine and Parimala Ranganathar Temple, one of the 108 Divya Desams.\n\nMaha Pushkaram was celebrated with grandeur in Mayiladuthurai from September 12 to September 24, 2017. As the configuration and alignment of stars happen once in 144 years, the devotees throng the Thula ghat to have a holy dip. Veda Parayanam, Homam, Maha Yagnam, cultural activities such as music, traditional dances, spiritual discourses, Annadhanam, and pithru tharpanam are organized during festival days. A permanent tank with concrete flooring and one foot of sand amidst the river to hold water was set up.

{"id": "12612595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12612595", "title": "Khvarenah", "text": "Khvarenah\n\nKhvarenah or khwarenah ( \"\") is an Avestan word for a Zoroastrian concept literally denoting \"glory\" or \"splendour\" but understood as a divine mystical force or power projected upon and aiding the appointed. The neuter noun thus also connotes \"(divine) royal glory,\" reflecting the perceived divine empowerment of kings. The term also carries a secondary meaning of \"(good) fortune\"; those who possess it are able to complete their mission or function.\n\nIn 3rd-7th century Sassanid-era inscriptions as well as in the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the word appears as Zoroastrian Middle Persian \"khwarrah\", rendered with the Pahlavi ideogram \"\", reflecting Aramaic \"gada\" \"fortune.\" Middle Persian \"khwarrah\" continues as New Persian \"k(h)orra\". These variants, which are assumed to be learned borrowings from the Avestan, are the only Iranian language forms with an initial 'xᵛ-'. In all other dialects, the word has an initial \"f-\" (see details under related terms, below).\n\nAvestan \"khvarenah\" is probably derived from Proto-Avestan \"*hvar\" \"to shine,\" nominalized with the \"-nah\" suffix. Proto-Avestan \"*hvar\" is in turn related to Old Indic \"svar\" with the same meaning, and together descending from Proto-Indo-Iranian *\"súHr̥\" \"to shine\", ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*sóhr\" \"to shine\". Other proposals suggest a linguistic relationship with Avestan \"xᵛar-\" \"to eat\".\n\nOf the numerous Iranian languages in which the word is attested, the initial \"xᵛ-\" is evident only as Avestan \"khvar(e)nah\" and as Zoroastrian Middle Persian \"khwarrah\", from which New Persian \"khorra\" then derives. In other Iranian dialects the word has an \"f-\" form, for instance as Median and Old Persian \"farnah-\", from which Middle- and New Persian \"farr(ah)\" and adjectival \"farrokh\" derive. For many decades, the \"f-\" form was believed to represent a specific Median sound-law change of proto-Iranian \"xᵛ-\" to \"f-\". The hypothesis has since been shown to be untenable, and the proto-Iranian form is today reconstructed as \"*hu̯\", preserved in Avestan as \"xᵛ-\" and dissimilated as \"f-\" in other Iranian dialects.\n\nIn the Iranian languages of the Middle Period, the word is also attested as Bactrian \"far(r)o\", Khotanese \"pharra\", Parthian \"farh\", Sogdian \"f(a)rn\", and Ossetic \"farnae\" and \"farn\", though in these languages the word does not necessarily signify \"glory\" or \"fortune\": \nIn Buddhism, Sogdian \"farn\" and Khotanese \"pharra\" signified a \"position of a Buddha,\" that is, with \"dignity\" or \"high position.\" This meaning subsequently passed into Tocharian. In Manicheanism, Sogdian \"frn\" signified \"luck\" and was a designator of the \"first luminary\". Manichean Parthian \"farh\" again signifies \"glory.\" In Scytho-Sarmatian and Alan culture, Digoron Ossetic \"farnae\" and Iron Ossetic \"farn\" signified \"peace, happiness, abundance, fortune.\"\n\nThe term also appears as a borrowing in Armenian \"pʿarkʿ\", but with a greater range of meaning than in Iranian languages.\n\nBisyllabic \"khvarenah\" is only attested once in the Gathas, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by the prophet himself. The one instance of Gathic \"khvarenah\" occurs in \"Yasna\" 51.18, where the word appears to mean royal glory. The primary source of information on \"khvarenah\" comes from the \"Yasht\"s, the younger Avesta's collection of 21 hymns dedicated to individual divinities.\n\nTwo distinct forms of \"khvarenah\" are discernible in \"Yasht\" 19:\nSimilarly \"Yasht\" 18, although nominally dedicated to Arshtat, is a short 9-verse ode to a third variant of \"khvarenah\"; the Iranian \"khvarenah\" (\"airiianəm xᵛarənah\") that is created by Ahura Mazda and that is \"full of milk and pastures,\" vanquishes the \"daeva\"s and the Un-Iranians.\n\n\"Yasht\" 19, which is nominally dedicated to Zam \"Earth\", further typifies \"khvarenah\" as a \"yazata\", that is, itself \"worthy of worship.\" The same hymn includes a list of divinities and mortals who perform their duties due to the power of \"khvarenah\". Among these are the \nmythological Kayanian kings – the \"kavi\"s (\"kauui\"s) – who are rulers through the grace of, and empowered by, \"khvarenah\".\n\n\"Khvarenah\" is however also glory held by divinities: Ahura Mazda has it (19.9-13), the Amesha Spentas have it (19.14-20), the other yazatas as well (19.21-24). Yima loses it thrice, in turn to Mithra, Thraetaona and Keresaspa. \"Khvarenah\" assumes the shape of a bird when leaving Yima. (19.35-36, 19.82)\n\nAccording to \"Yasht\" 13.14, the waters flow, the plants spring forth, and the winds blow through the \"khvarenah\" of the Fravashis. In \"Yasna\" 68.11, the waters of Aredvi Sura are invoked to bestow radiance and glory. \"Khvarenah\" is also associated with the waters in other texts; with the world-sea Vourukasha in \"Yasht\" 19.51 and 19.56-57; with the Helmand river in \"Yasht\" 19.66ff. It is also identified with Haoma, together with which it plays a seminal role in the legend of the birth of Zoroaster. In these passages, \"khvarenah\" has a seminal and germinal implication, being both fiery fluid and living seed.\n\nIn \"Yasna\" 60.2, the family priest is seen to request joy and blessings for the righteous, good nature, truth, prosperity, power, and glory for the house in which he offers prayers. The hymn to Mithra speaks of the divinity as the \"dispenser of \"khvarenah\"\" (\"Yasht\" 10.16, 10.128, 10.141). Other texts describe Mithra as \"most endowed with glory\" (\"Yasht\" 19.35, \"Vendidad\" 19.15).\n\nIn \"Yasht\" 19.46, Akem Manah, the demon of \"evil purpose\" attempts (but fails) to seize \"khvarenah\". The Iranian \"khvarenah\" and Dahman, the hypostasis of prayer, render Bushyasta - the demoness of \"sloth\" – powerless (\"Yasht\" l0.97, 13.4).\n\nAt the final renovation of the world, the royal glory will follow the \"Saoshyant\"s (\"Yasht\" 19.89).\n\nIn the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition \"khvarenah\" (→ Middle Persian \"khwarrah\") is a spiritual force that exists before the creation of the \"tan-gohr\", the mortal body (\"Bundahishn\" II.7ff, \"Zadspram\" 3.75). In these later texts, the glory appears to be acquirable through learning and knowledge (\"Bundahishn\" II.9ff).\n\n\"Khwarrah\" continues to be identified with astral bodies (\"Dadistan-i Denig\" I.25, I.35-36), but its primary function is in its role as the divine glory of kings, the continuation of the Avestan notion of the \"kavam khvarenah\". New in tradition is an identification of \"khwarrah\" with religion, as in \"the great \"khwarrah\"-bestowing force of the pure religion\" (\"Dadistan-i Denig\" I.36)\n\nThe \"Kar-namag i Ardashir\", a collection of hagiographic legends related to Ardashir, the founder of the Sassanid empire, includes (4.11.16 and 4.11.22-23) a tale in which Ardashir – who at that point in the story is still a vassal of the Arsacid Parthians – escapes from the court of the last Arsacid king, Ardavan. In the story, Ardashir makes off with much Ardavan's treasure, as well as Ardavan's favourite concubine, and is being chased by Ardavan and his troops. On the road, Ardavan and his contingent are overtaken by an enormous ram, which is also following Ardashir. Ardavan's religious advisors explain that the ram is the manifestation of the \"khwarrah\" of the ancient Iranian kings, which is leaving Ardavan and the Parthians in favor of a new emperor.\n\nThe representation of \"khwarrah\" as a ram reappears on Sassanid seals and as an ornament in Sassanid architecture. \"Khwarrah\" also appears in Sassanian crowns as a bird with a pearl in its beak. Depictions of \"khwarrah\" as a bird are allusions to the Avestan myth of \"Yasht\" 19.35-36, 19.82 in which \"khvarenah\" takes the shape of a bird as it leaves Yima (MP: Jamshid), a metamorphosis similar to that of the yazata of victory, Verethragna. The crown as a repository of \"khwarrah\" is also attested in the Paikuli inscription of Narseh, which describes the punishment meted out to an individual who has been \"driven by Ahriman and the \"dev\"s\" to steal \"khwarrah\" by placing the crown on the head of a false ruler. Another ubiquitous motif in Sassanian art is the symbol of a boar, which is a representation of the protection of the \"yazata\" Verethragna (MP: Wahram) given to rulers that hold \"khwarrah\".\n\nThe ring of kingship that appears in Sassanian investiture reliefs is often identified as representing \"khwarrah\". This is also the case for the ring held by the bearded figure in the Achaemenid winged sun-disk symbol that is traditionally considered to represent a \"fravashi\" (MP: \"fravahr\"). The Achaemenid winged sun-disk has in its entirety also been occasionally been interpreted as a representation of \"khvarenah\".\n\nThat \"khwarrah\" – in addition to its significance as \"royal fortune\" – also signified \"fortune\" in a general sense is demonstrated by the use of an Aramaic ideogram \"GDE\" in the Middle Persian texts of the Sassanid and post-Sassanid periods. The custom of using this Aramic ideogram to represent \"khvarenah\" is probably inherited from Achaemenid times.\n\n\"The fundamental motif of Iranian kingship, a hereditary dynastic charisma [...], which, could however be lost, was at the root of ideas that were widespread in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\" For example, as the \"tyche basileos, fortuna regia,\" the saving grace (luck) of fortune of a king; and probably also the royal \"farrah\" in the \"tyche\" of the various Hellenistic rulers of the Seleucid and Arsacid periods as well as of the Kushan kings.\n\nBecause the concepts of \"khvarenah\"/\"khwarrah\" and Aramaic \"gd(y)\" circulated in the same areas and have many characteristics in common, it is possible that the Mesopotamian concept influenced the Zoroastrian one. On the other hand, \"khvarenah\" may also be a facet of Zoroastrianism's Indo-Iranian cultural inheritance since \"khvarenah\" appears to have a parallel in Indic \"tejas\". in which kingship is likewise associated with the bright splendor and power of light and fire.\n\nThe concept of the royal \"khwarrah\" survived the 7th century downfall of the Sassanid empire, and remained a central motif (for instance as the \"farr-e elahi\") in the culture, philosophy and epics of Islamic Iran.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92667", "title": "Kinich Ahau", "text": "Kinich Ahau\n\nKinich Ahau (K'inich Ajaw) is the 16th-century Yucatec name of the Maya sun god, designated as God G when referring to the codices. In the Classic period, God G is depicted as a middle-aged man with an aquiline nose, large square eyes, cross-eyed, and a filed incisor in the upper row of teeth. Usually, there is a \"k'in\" 'sun'-infix, sometimes in the very eyes. Among the southern Lacandons, Kinich Ahau continued to play a role in narrative well into the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nKinich Ahau is the Yucatec and Lacandon name of the sun god. The element \"k'inich\", usually assumed to mean 'sun-eyed', appears to have been in general use as a royal title during the Classic Period. Kinich Ahau should not be confused with Ah K'in or Ah K'in Chob. \"Ah K'in\" is Yucatec for 'someone who deals with the day(s)', the word for 'day' and 'sun' being the same. The term refers to Yucatec calendar priests and to priests in general. As to \"Ah K'in\" Chob, J.E.S. Thompson suggested that this Lacandon deity name (alternating with Can Chob and Chi Chac Chob) could refer to the sun deity, but the mythology of Ah K'in Chob does not bear this out. Although the element \"chob\" has been translated as 'squint-eyed', which is an iconographic feature of the Classic sun deity, the only source for this translation is a single statement by Tozzer.\n\nKinich Ahau was the patron of one of the four years of the 52-year cycle (Landa). In the rituals introducing this year, war dances were executed. Kinich Ahau was apparently considered an aspect of the upper god, Itzamna. He may conceivably be related to the patron deity of Izamal, Kinich Kakmo 'Fire Parrot', who was reported to descend to earth while the sun was standing in the zenith in order to consume offerings (Cogolludo).\n\nGod G's appearances in Classic Maya art are, perhaps, best known from large stucco masks adorning pyramids. Compared to the deities connected to agricultural fertility, however, God G occurs rather infrequently in other media than stucco, and is rarely part of narrative events. It may be noted that the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, although stated to have changed into Sun and Moon, are never shown assimilated to God G.\n\nThe Sun God is associated with an aquatic eastern paradise, where he can assume the shape of a chimerical water bird, or be shown as a young man, paddling a canoe. Such imagery could suggest lyric religious poetry comparable to the Aztec evocations of a 'flower paradise' (Taube).\n\nThe sun deity can be shown as a king (\"ajaw\") seated high on a throne cushion (as on the famous, narrative 'Rabbit Vase' from Naranjo), or as a ruler carrying the bicephalic 'ceremonial bar'. Inversely, the Maya king is repeatedly assimilated to the sun deity. The emblematic double-bird of the early Copan king, Yax K'uk' Mo' 'Great Quetzal-Parrot', shows the head of the sun deity within its beaks. Ancestral Maya kings assimilated to the sun deity were sometimes depicted while vertically descending from the zenith (as on Takalik Abaj stela 2 and Tikal stela 31). Particularly in Yaxchilan, the ancestral king is seated within a solar cartouche, his wife in a lunar crescent. The solar aspect of a king often seems to imply apotheosis and life after death.\n\nHieroglyphically, the sun god is the patron of the day-unit (\"k'in\" 'day, sun'), the month of Yaxk'in 'Dry season', and the number Four (in parallel with the day Ahau).\n\nSeveral other deities evince a large eye, such as God D (Itzamna), Chaak, and various jaguar gods. Attribute sharing (including the \"k'in\" infix) occurs chiefly with the so-called Jaguar God of the Underworld and a human-faced ocean deity with shell ears, fins beside the mouth, and a sacrificial awl set in the mouth. The 'Jaguar God of the Underworld' is traditionally referred to by scholars as the 'Night Sun', i.e., the form supposedly taken by the sun during his subterranean journey from West to East. It has been suggested that the three just-mentioned deities involved in the sharing of attributes could, perhaps, represent various stages of the sun's daily cycle.\n\nRecent Maya mythology is mainly concerned with Sun's childhood and the conflicts leading up to his actual solar transformation. Although specific imagery is used for the path of the sun (for example, the sun being carried through the underworld on the shoulders of its lord), there are hardly any histories concerning the mature sun deity, save for the southern Lacandons. According to them, Kinich Ahau, the elder brother of the upper god, will put an end to this world by descending from the sky and have his jaguars devour mankind. Little is also known about specific solar rituals, although it is noteworthy that Kinich Ahau regularly occurs in the Dresden Codex, which is largely concerned with ritual matters.\n\n"}

It is arguably one of the highest lakes in the United States, after the evaporation of Ka Wai o Pele in 2018 the only lake on Hawaiʻi Island, and one of very few lakes at all in the state of Hawaiʻi. It is relatively small, only about 100 m across, and varies in size as the water level rises and falls. At high water levels a small outlet stream appears at the northwest end, but it is absorbed into the ground after a short distance. The name means \"swirling water\" in Hawaiian, though it is usually rather placid. It usually freezes in winter, but aquatic insects such as midges and beetles can be found breeding in the water.\n\nLake Waiau is located inside the \"Pu'u Waiau\" cinder cone at an altitude of 3970 m. It is approximately heart shaped and its diameter reaches about 100 m. The average surface area of the lake is around 6000 m. The size of its surface area fluctuates significantly over the year. It reaches its peak during spring with a maximal depth between 2 m and 2.5 m and by the end of the summer it often has shrunk to one third of its original size with a maximal depth below 1 m. A spillover into the \"Pohakuloa Gulch\" occurs, when the lake depth is more than 2.3 m. The lake is only fed precipitation which occurs primarily during the winter, its catchment area is about 135,000 m mostly located within \"Pu'u Waiau\" cinder cone.\n\nThe lake is an anomaly in the peak region of Mauna Kea as everywhere else the ground is unable to retain water. The exact nature of the impermeable ground layer of the lake is still unknown. It is assumed, that fine-grained densely compressed ash, basalt rock or small permafrost layer may play a role. No permafrost layer has been established so far for the lake area itself, but it was found at another location in peak area. Established however is 7.5 m thick sediment layer at the bottom of the lake.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013 the lake shrank significantly, and by September 2013 the lake was reduced to a mere puddle with less than 2% of its original surface size. The exact causes for the water loss are unknown. The suspects are drought conditions and the thawing of an assumed permafrost layer under the lake leading to increased seepage. However, after the particularly wet winter of 2013/2014, the lake was back to around 75% of its original size by May 2014, and subsequently returned to its normal size. Therefore, it is currently assumed that primary reason for the water loss were the drought conditions on Mauna Kea from 2010 to 2013.\n\nThe lake is of some importance in Hawaiian mythology. Aside from \"Poliʻahu,\" there are two additional snow deities, \"Lilinoe\" and \"Waiau\", who are associated with Mauna Kea, and according to Westervelt, the lake was probably named after the goddess of the same, who used to bathe in it. Originally, Hawaiians considered the whole peak region of Mauna Kea, including Lake Waiau, a sacred site, and only priests and chieftains were allowed to access it. Later, after the formation of the Hawaiian kingdom, the peak region was occasionally visited by members of the royal family. The last one to do so was queen Emma in 1881, who also took a bath in the lake during her visit.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17563781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17563781", "title": "Mediatrix of all graces", "text": "Mediatrix of all graces\n\nMediatrix of all graces is a title that Roman Catholics give to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Mother of God; it includes the understanding that she mediates the Divine Grace. In a papal encyclical of Sept. 8, 1894 Pope Leo XIII states the following:\n\nThe Second Vatican Council referred in its document \"Lumen gentium\" to Mary as \"Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix and Mediatrix\".\n\nThe formal definition of \"Mediatrix of all graces\" as a dogma was not considered opportune during discussions held to prepare for the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn 1896, French Jesuit priest René-Marie de la Broise interpreted Pope Leo XIII's papal encyclical \"Octobri mense\" as teaching that \"all\" graces from Jesus Christ are imparted through Mary. Broise proposed that the pontiff should make a dogmatic definition about the role of Mary in the distribution of all graces, but did not require that it be in the form of declaring her to be the mediatrix of all graces.\n\nIn Belgium, 8 years later, Redemptorist priest François Xavier Godts wrote a book, \"De definibilitate mediationis universalis Deiparae\" (On the definability of the universal mediation of the Mother of God), proposing precisely that it be defined that Mary is the Mediatrix of all graces. Désiré-Joseph Mercier, Cardinal Archbishop of Mechelen, Belgium championed this cause.\n\nIn response to petitions from Belgium, including one signed by all its bishops, the Holy See approved in 1921 an annual celebration in that country of a feast day of \"Mary Mediatrix of All Graces\". In printings of the Roman Missal from that date until 1961, the Mass of Mary Mediatrix of All Graces was found in the appendix \"Missae pro aliquibus locis\" (Masses for Some Places), but not in the general calendar for use wherever the Roman Rite is celebrated. Other Masses authorized for celebration in different places on the same day 31 May were those of the Blessed Virgin Mary Queen of All Saints and Mother of Fair Love and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Belgian celebration has now been replaced by an optional memorial on 31 August of the Virgin Mary Mediatrix.\n\nDespite requests for a new Marian dogma, the Fathers of Vatican II and the Popes who presided at the Council, John XXIII and Paul VI decided not to proceed with new dogmatic definitions. The decree \"Lumen gentium\" of Vatican II would caution of the title of \"Mediatrix\" that: \"This, however, is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator\". \"Lumen gentium\" had 2,151 bishops voting for it and only five against.\n\nIn August 1996, a Mariological Congress was held in Czestochowa, Poland, where a commission was established in response to a request of the Holy See. The congress sought the opinion of scholars present there regarding the possibility of proposing a fifth Marian dogma on Mary as Coredemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate. The commission unanimously declared that it was not opportune to define a fifth Marian dogma on those titles. The Declaration of Czestochowa observed that while these titles can be given a content in conformity with the deposit of the faith, nevertheless such \"titles, as proposed, are ambiguous, as they can be understood in very different ways\".\n\nAmong Filipino Catholics, the term \"Mediatrix\" is associated with an alleged 1948 apparition of the Virgin Mary to Teresita Castillo, with title \"Our Lady Mediatrix of All Grace\" in the Carmelite monastery of Lipa, Batangas, Philippines. Ramón Argüelles, the current Archbishop of Lipa, declared his personal belief in the veracity of the 1948 apparitions, encouraging veneration of Mary under that title.\n\nThe apparition is well known in the Philippines and among the Filipino diaspora, most notably the preserved rose petals which fell from the sky and are claimed to be miraculous. Philippine Ambassador to the Holy See Mercedes Arrastia Tuason is a known devotee of the apparitions, and displays a large statue in her consulate office in Rome.\n\nStigmatist Emma de Guzman, foundress of the La Pieta association, which has received ecclesiastical approval, said that Mary had declared herself to be \"the Mediatrix standing in front of the Mediator\".\n\nThe term \"Our Lady\" with which the Celestial Queen and Virgin Mother shows herself in so many apparitions relies on her \"setting role\" near Jesus Christ God (and thus Lord and King) which is the guiding Shepherd, the delivering Saviour, the Last Judge. In respect of the chronological order of this triplex role and function of Jesus, Mary may be titled and specified as the Mediatrix of grace, the Co-Redemptrix of salvation, the Advocate of justice.\n\nGroups of laity and clergy, what has been called \"a small but growing movement\", continue to operate for proclaiming the dogma of the universal mediation of Mary. One such group calls itself \"Vox Populi Mariae Mediatrici\". On 8 February 2008, five cardinals published a petition asking Pope Benedict XVI to declare the Blessed Virgin Mary both Co-Redemptrix and Mediatrix, and over 500 bishops later added their signatures. The magazine \"Inside the Vatican\" and Saint Thomas More College organized a one-day panel discussion on the question in Rome on 25 March 2010.\n\nThat mariological mediation of any and the whole divine grace concerns the Divine Mercy as the early fruit of the Glory and Graces springing from the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ God, in the kingdom of the Divine Will.\n\nItalian mystic Luisa Piccarreta (Corato, 1865-1947), also known as the \"Daughter of the Divine Will, wrote an opus collected in a 36-volume entitled \"The Book of Heaven\". Luisa's writing on the Divine Will described hundreds of dated entries of the Blessed Virgin Mary. One of these epiphanic experiences revealed some personal details about the nativity of Jesus Christ God.\n\n\"While in the Divine Will, Luisa saw\" Jesus \"after He come forth from the Maternal womb, \"fling himself into\" the arms of His Celestial Mother. Feeling the need to make His first outpouring of love, He surrounded the neck of His mother with his tiny arms, kissing her. His Virgin Mother also felt the need to pour out her love toward the Divine Infant\".\nWhile \"contemplating the first outpouring of love between Mother and Son\", Jesus \"told her about the great need He had to make this display of love with His Mother\" ( p. 156: [V27; 09/28/1929]). \"In the Virgin was centralized all the outpouring of love which the Divinity has\" made widespread \"in the Creation\". \"Since the Divine Will was in her, she was capable of receiving, \"with the kisses of the Baby Jesus\", this great outpouring, and of returning it to Him\". \"One who lives in the Divine Will centralizes within herself the continous act of all Creation, and the attitude to puring it back to God\" ( p. 157: [V27; 09/28/1929]).\n\nIn other words, the Celestial Queen and Virgin Mother of God shows a central role of her mediation in making pure the love returned to God from humans, which are living in common and in perfect accord to the life of His Divine Will, and together with His earthly and heavenly Holy Family.\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary \"took care of everything\" and \"did everything to make Him happy, and redouble\" on the earth \"the heavenly Paradise he had left\". Mary \"made Him enjoy her beauty and the beauty of her acts\", \"shining\" of the \"Divine Will which she possessed\": \"the beauty of her acts\" and \"the paradise of her love\", \"braided the whole of Creation\", so that \"He could find her\" everywhere, \"forming a Paradise for Him on earth\" ( p. 165: [V36; 12/25/1938]).\n"}
{"id": "52331614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52331614", "title": "Medical missions", "text": "Medical missions\n\nMedical missions is the term used for (typically) Christian missionary endeavors that involve the administration of medical treatment. As has been common among missionary efforts from the 18th to 20th centuries, medical missions often involves residents of the \"Western world\" traveling to locales within Asia, Africa, or Latin America.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus Christ repeatedly calls for his disciples to heal the sick and serve the poor, but also for them to \"make disciples of all nations\". In striving to obey such commands, Western Christians have debated the nature of proper evangelism, often emphasizing either eschatological, or material realities within missionary efforts. Much of Euro-American Protestantism has emphasized Jesus' eschatological and soteriological statements in developing theologies that emphasize personal salvation over the provision of material needs. The origins of medical missions are found in a sort of fusion of these two perspectives.\n\nIn the 1830s an American missionary to China named E. C. Bridgman noticed that Western medicine was more effective at removing eye cataracts than Chinese medicine. At his request, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent Peter Parker to China in 1834 as the first Protestant medical missionary. Western medicine provided a means by which Parker could gain access to parts of Chinese society that were otherwise closed off to missionaries. More American doctors followed suit and, in 1838, founded the world's first society for medical missions: the Medical Missionary Society of China. In 1841 Parker visited Edinburgh, Scotland, and appealed to a number of the city's leading doctors. His presentation resulted in the establishment of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society which was the first medical mission society in Europe.\n\nAnother example of early medical missionary efforts is found in the work of David Livingstone, the prominent explorer and missionary. Livingstone worked as a medical doctor at the mission station in Kuruman, South Africa, beginning in 1841. Livingstone became known for his abilities as a healer, but eventually tired of medical work and doubted its effectiveness as a form of Christian ministry. He ceased to practice medicine and began his exploration of Africa's interior and fight against the slave trade, for which he is most commonly remembered. Despite Livingstone's limited practice as a medical missionary, he, like Parker, influenced medical doctors to pursue careers as missionaries. The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society had a relationship with Livingstone from 1858 until his death in 1873.\n\nThe Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society bore its name from 1843 until 2002 when it split into two separate charities: EMMS International and the Nazareth Trust.\n\nMedical missions continue in many parts of the world today. EMMS International is a missions organization that traces its origins back to the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society and credits David Livingstone as an inspiration to their ongoing efforts. According to the EMMS website: \"Dr Livingstone continues to be an inspiration to EMMS International. We continue in the footsteps of Livingstone, and those like him, who sought to bring improvements in healthcare along with Christian compassion to some of the world's poorest communities.\" EMMS maintains missionary efforts in India, Malawi, Nepal, and parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Nazareth Trust is the organization that runs EMMS Nazareth Hospital in Nazareth, Israel. In 1866 the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society began supporting the work of Kaloost Vartan, who had founded a medical dispensary in 1861.\n\nThe historian David Hardiman identifies the lasting Orientalist impact of medical missionaries. \"The image of the social and cultural malignancy of the 'Other' that was propagated and popularised by the missionaries continues to resonate in the West to this day.\" The perceived superiority of Western medicine by missionaries perpetuated stereotypes that Western societies were the \"gold standard\" of civilization. Rationalized understandings of illness and healing were considered more sophisticated and informed than those of non-Enlightenment oriented cultures. Therefore, it was the duty of \"informed\", \"rational\", \"civilized\" Westerners, to bring such values to the rest of the world.\n\nFor Western missionaries, the \"Christianization\" of a place often meant more than the conversion of its residents. Western, Modern ideologies were commonly imposed upon non-Western societies and the Christian message was conflated with Modern values. Among these values was a rationalized understanding of the cosmos, that seemingly necessitated skepticism about supernatural realities. Efforts to \"modernize\" or \"civilize\" went hand in hand with efforts to debunk what missionaries perceived as superstitious and mythological (i.e. irrational) understandings of health and healing.\n\nWalima Kalusa writes about medical missions in colonial Mwinilunga, Zambia, and illustrates the difficulties that western missionaries had in achieving their goals of transforming the moral understanding of Africans. Kalusa highlights missionaries’ dependence on the linguistic knowledge of Zambian medical auxiliaries as preventing such transformation.\n\nAccording to Kalusa, \"European practitioners of medicine envisaged that vernacular translations [of medical terms] would be drained of 'pagan' connotations and loaded with Western notions of medicine and disease.\" In the case of Mwinilunga, we see the western assumption that \"universal truths\" of sickness and disease would reveal themselves through the implementation of western means of healing. Such perspectives, however, dismiss the possibility of different understandings of illness and health. In Mwinilunga, local people attributed supernatural properties to Western medicine, much to the chagrin of missionaries to the area.\n\nWithin Christian communities there has been some debate regarding the role of evangelism within medical missions. As seen in the example of David Livingstone, who questioned efficacy of medical practice as a means of evangelism, it was not uncommon to separate healthcare and proclamation of the gospel as distinct means of obeying the commands of Christ. Hardiman identifies that, \"... missionaries in the field became more and more involved in social work, and they often saw this as their authentic life mission. In the process, preaching became secondary.\" As a result, missionaries commonly received criticism for proclaiming a social gospel or a sort of secular humanitarian agenda that undervalued religious proclamation. Debates around these issues continue today.\n\n"}

{"id": "951854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=951854", "title": "Our Lady of Ipswich", "text": "Our Lady of Ipswich\n\nOur Lady of Ipswich (also known as Our Lady of Grace) was a popular English Marian shrine before the English Reformation. Only the shrine at Walsingham attracted more visitors.\n\nThere was a time when England was known as 'Our Lady's Dowry'. Anglo-Saxon England sheltered many shrines to the Virgin Mary: shrines were dedicated to her at Glastonbury in 540, Evesham in 702, Tewkesbury in 715, Canterbury in 866, Willesden in 939, Abingdon before 955, Ely in 1020, Coventry in 1043, York in 1050, and Walsingham in 1061. By the High Middle Ages there were sixteen shrines to Mary in Suffolk alone.\n\nAbout half of the medieval churches in Suffolk were dedicated to St Mary under a particular title or devotion. Churches not dedicated to Mary, would have contained a Marian shrine, generally at the east end of the south aisle.\nSome shrines became so popular that they were translated to buildings of their own. This may be how the shrine of Our Lady of Grace came to be. During the High Middle Ages, the shrine of Our Lady of Grace was second only to that of Our Lady of Walsingham.\n\nThe medieval town of Ipswich was a busy maritime centre of trade and shipbuilding. The inns and taverns of the town were full of pilgrims who flocked to the shrine of Our Lady of Grace in Lady Lane, near St Mary the Elm Church.\n\nThe shrine to Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich is first recorded in 1152. \n\nThe shrine was just outside the walls of Ipswich, Suffolk, England. The site of the original shrine was just outside the west gate of the medieval town wall of Ipswich, and is marked by a plaque and a statue of Our Lady on Lady Lane. \n\nIn 1297 the daughter of Edward I, Princess Elizabeth, married the Count of Holland in the shrine.\n\nAmong surviving mentions, it is recorded that Sir John Howard paid a visit in August 1463, when his main residence was at Stoke-by-Nayland. On that occasion he apparently left an offering of 2d. At a visit on 5 May, the now Lord Howard spent a total of 10s on a pilgrimage to the shrine. At a visit on 22 January 1472 he left 10d. John Howard was of royal descendant and at least by 1470 an extremely wealthy man, a grandson of Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk from 1397, whose line had failed in 1476, and though the title had been held briefly by Prince Richard, one of the ill-fated little princes in the Tower, it was created again on 28 June 1483 for John Howard, who had shown himself a close friend and loyal supporter of the usurping King Richard III. It was, therefore, now as the new Duke of Norfolk that Howard visited the shrine again, on 16 August 1483, leaving an offering of 20d, then 4d \"to bow on Owr Ladys fote\" (presumably a particularl offering on kissing the foot of the statue) and also 11d \"in almes at Owr Lady of Grace\". Howard was to die with his royal patron at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485.\n\nAfter the Tudor dynasty had consolidated its hold on the English throne, Henry VII's Queen, Elizabeth of York, made a donation in 1502 of half a golden angel (3s 4d) to the shrine.\n\nBetween 1517 and 1522, Henry VIII and Queen Catherine of Aragon paid separate visits to the shrine, as did Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was born in Ipswich.\n\nThe image of the Virgin at Ipswich became celebrated on account of a miraculous power of healing attributed to Our Lady of Grace.\n\nA miracle at the shrine of Our Lady of Ipswich is recorded by none other than Sir Thomas More in his book \"The Supplication of Souls\", and he had news of it on first-hand knowledge. The miracle was bestowed on Anne Wentworth, the 12-year-old daughter of Sir Roger Wentworth, a friend of More's. Anne suffered from seizures in which she spasmed, blasphemed and was said to be able to utter prophesy \"vexed and tourmented by our gostly enemye the devyll\". After a vision in which she beheld the image of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich, she was taken to the shrine and \"\"layde before the ymage of our Blessyd Lady...grevously tourmented and in face, eyen, loke and countenance so grysely chaunged...that it was a terrible syght to beholde\". \" There in the presence of the whole company, she was restored \"perfytely and sodeynly\". Anne, in grateful recognition of the miracle, took the veil and became a nun.\n\nThe shrine was suppressed during the English Reformation, and its famous statue was taken to Chelsea to be burnt, along with the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham on 20 September 1538. There are no eyewitness accounts of the statue actually being burnt, although it is documented that the statue arrived at Chelsea. Regarding the image, Thomas Cromwell's steward wrote to him that he had received it, with 'nothing about her but two half shoes of silver'.\n\nAlthough the shrine itself was destroyed, mention of it survived in legal deeds as a boundary description until the eighteenth century.\n\nA wooden statue of the Madonna and Child displayed in the local church of the Italian seaside town of Nettuno closely matches various descriptions of the Ipswich statue. The statue is known locally as \"Our Lady of the Graces\" or \"The English Lady\". Radio carbon dating places the era when the tree was felled to provide the wood of which the statue is carved at circa 1280 to 1420 with 94% certainty.\n\nThere is also evidence in the Nettuno archives that a statue arrived there from Ipswich in 1550. It was classified as being in the English iconic style in 1938 by Martin Gillett, an historian of 13th century iconography. Although the statue had been altered (a throne had been replaced and the posture of the Christ child had changed), details such as the folds in the material and Christ's position on the right rather than the left knee suggest that the statue came from England.\n\nAt the time of the bombardment of Anzio during the Second World War, Nettuno's statue was temporarily moved to Rome for safe keeping.\n\nDuring restoration work on the statue in 1959 an inscription was found on its back with the words \"IU? ARET GRATIOSUS\", a rendition of the Marian phrase, \"Thou art gracious\". Ipswich was the only Marian shrine in England dedicated to Our Lady of Grace. Even more striking, when Martin Gillett first examined the statue in 1938, it was wearing two half shoes made of English silver, just like those described by Thomas Cromwell's steward 400 years before.\n\nThere are two theories as to how the statue may have reached Italy. One theory is that it was sold by an English official (perhaps Thomas Cromwell) instead of being burnt, although it is not clear why it would have got as far as southern Italy.\n\nA second version of the story, popular in Nettuno, is that the statue was rescued by English sailors before it could be burnt, and smuggled on board a ship. In the Mediterranean they met a storm and took refuge in Nettuno and they donated the statue. Moreover, a scientific analysis of a sliver of wood from the base of the statue has been found to have a high salt content - proving that it had at some point been in contact with seawater or sea spray.\n\nAs part of the Nettuno celebrations, thousands watch as the statue is taken down from high above the altar in the Basilica and, dressed in her finery, is taken in a grand procession through the streets for a week-long stay at the church of St. Giovanni. A replica of the statue was presented to Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on 5 May 2010, during the week of the Shrine's feast, beginning the first Sunday of May.\n\nA modern shrine is now in the Anglican parish church of Saint Mary Elms, a short distance away from the medieval location.\n\nIn 1987, the Guild of Our Lady of Ipswich was founded by people from the Catholic church of St Pancras and the Anglican church of St Mary at the Elms. Their two aims have been: to pray for Christian unity and to plan and achieve the re-establishment of the shrine of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich.\n\nOn 10 September 2002 a modern wooden replica of the Italian statue, carved by sculptor Robert Mellamphy, was blessed and installed by the Anglican Bishop of Richborough in the church of Saint Mary at the Elms. The ceremony was attended by the Anglican Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, the Roman Catholic Dean of Ipswich and representatives of the Orthodox and the Methodist churches.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51273", "title": "Rabbi", "text": "Rabbi\n\nIn Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. The basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic and Talmudic era, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. The first sage for whom the Mishnah uses the title of rabbi was Yohanan ben Zakkai, active in the early-to-mid first century CE. In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister, hence the title \"pulpit rabbis\", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance.\n\nWithin the various Jewish denominations there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is to be recognized as a rabbi. For example, Orthodox Judaism does not ordain women as rabbis. Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons (Conservative Judaism) as well as ethical reasons (Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism).\n\nThe Hebrew word \"master\" ' , (irregular plural ' ), which literally means \"great one\", . The form of the title in English and many other languages derives from the possessive form in Hebrew of ': ' , meaning \"My Master\", which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. \nThe word 'Rav' in turn derives from the Semitic root ר-ב-ב (R-B-B), which in biblical Aramaic means \"great\" in many senses, including \"revered\", but appears primarily as a prefix in construct forms. Although the usage \"rabbim\" \"many\" (as 1 Kings 18:25, הָרַבִּים) \"the majority, the multitude\" occurs for the assembly of the community in the Dead Sea scrolls there is no evidence to support an association with the later title \"Rabbi.\"\nThe root is cognate to Arabic ربّ \"rabb\", meaning \"lord\" (generally used when talking about God, but also about temporal lords). As a sign of great respect, some great rabbis are simply called \"The Rav\".\n\nRabbi is not an occupation found in the Hebrew Bible, and ancient generations did not employ related titles such as \"Rabban\", \"Ribbi\", or \"Rab\" to describe either the Babylonian sages or the sages in Israel. The titles \"Rabban\" and \"Rabbi\" are first mentioned in the Mishnah (c. 200 CE). The term was first used for Rabban Gamaliel the elder, Rabban Simeon his son, and Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai, all of whom were patriarchs or presidents of the Sanhedrin in the first century. The title \"Rabbi\" occurs (in Greek transliteration ῥαββί \"rhabbi\") in the books of Matthew, Mark, and John in the New Testament, where it is used in reference to \"Scribes and Pharisees\" as well as to Jesus.\n\nSephardic and Yemenite Jews pronounce this word \"ribbī\" ; the modern Israeli pronunciation \"rabi\" is derived from an 18th-century innovation in Ashkenazic prayer books, although this vocalization is also found in some ancient sources. Other variants are \"rəvī\" and, in Yiddish, \"rebbə\". The word could be compared to the Syriac word \"rabi\".\n\nIn ancient Hebrew, \"rabbi\" was a proper term of address while speaking to a superior, in the second person, similar to a vocative case. While speaking about a superior, in the third person one could say \"ha-rav\" (\"the Master\") or \"rabbo\" (\"his Master\"). Later, the term evolved into a formal title for members of the Patriarchate. Thus, the title gained an irregular plural form: \"rabbanim\" (\"rabbis\"), and not \"rabbay\" (\"my Masters\").\n\nThe governments of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were based on a system that included the Jewish kings, the Jewish prophets, the legal authority of the high court of Jerusalem, the Great Sanhedrin, and the ritual authority of the priesthood. Members of the Sanhedrin had to receive their ordination (\"semicha\") in an uninterrupted line of transmission from Moses, yet rather than being referred to as rabbis they were called priests or scribes, like Ezra, who is called in the Bible \"Ezra, the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of God's commandments and of His statutes unto Israel.\" \"Rabbi\" as a religious title does not appear in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAll of the above personalities would have been expected to be steeped in the wisdom of the Torah and the commandments, which would have made them \"rabbis\" in the modern sense of the word. This is illustrated by a two-thousand-year-old teaching in the Mishnah, \"Ethics of the Fathers\" (\"Pirkei Avot\"), which observed about King David,\n\nWith the destruction of the two Temples in Jerusalem, the end of the Jewish monarchy, and the decline of the dual institutions of prophets and the priesthood, the focus of scholarly and spiritual leadership within the Jewish people shifted to the sages of the Men of the Great Assembly (\"Anshe Knesset HaGedolah\"). This assembly was composed of the earliest group of \"rabbis\" in the more modern sense of the word, in large part because they began the formulation and explication of what became known as Judaism's \"Oral Law\" (\"Torah SheBe'al Peh\"). This was eventually encoded and codified within the Mishnah and Talmud and subsequent rabbinical scholarship, leading to what is known as Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nThe title \"Rabbi\" was borne by the sages of ancient Israel, who were ordained by the Sanhedrin in accordance with the custom handed down by the elders. They were titled \"Ribbi\" and received authority to judge penal cases. \"Rab\" was the title of the Babylonian sages who taught in the Babylonian academies.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Patriarchate and Sanhedrin by Theodosius II in 425, there was no more formal ordination in the strict sense. A recognised scholar could be called \"Rab\" or \"Hacham\", like the Babylonian sages. The transmission of learning from master to disciple remained of tremendous importance, but there was no formal rabbinic qualification as such.\n\nMaimonides ruled that every congregation is obliged to appoint a preacher and scholar to admonish the community and teach Torah, and the social institution he describes is the germ of the modern congregational rabbinate. In the fifteenth century in Central Europe, the custom grew up of licensing scholars with a diploma entitling them to be called \"Mori\" (my teacher). At the time this was objected to as \"hukkat ha-goy\" (imitating the ways of the Gentiles), as it was felt to resemble the conferring of doctorates in Christian universities. However, the system spread, and it is this diploma that is referred to as \"semicha\" (ordination) at the present day.\n\nIn 19th-century Germany and the United States, the duties of the rabbi in some respects became increasingly similar to the duties of other clergy, like the Protestant Christian minister, and the title \"pulpit rabbis\" appeared to describe this phenomenon. Sermons, pastoral counseling, representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. Non-Orthodox rabbis, on a day-to-day business basis, now spend more time on these functions than they do teaching or answering questions on Jewish law and philosophy. Within the Modern Orthodox community, many rabbis still mainly deal with teaching and questions of Jewish law, but many are increasingly dealing with these same pastoral functions. Orthodox Judaism's National Council of Young Israel and Modern Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America have set up supplemental pastoral training programs for their rabbis.\n\nTraditionally, rabbis have never been an intermediary between God and humans. This idea was traditionally considered outside the bounds of Jewish theology. Unlike spiritual leaders in many other faiths, they are not considered to be imbued with special powers or abilities.\nRabbis serve the Jewish community. Hence their functions vary as the needs of the Jewish community vary over time and from place to place.\n\nA dramatic change in rabbinic functions occurred with Jewish emancipation (18th-19th cents.). Tasks that were once the primary focus for rabbis, such as settling disputes by presiding over a Jewish court, became less prominent, while other tasks that were secondary, like delivering sermons, increased in importance.\n\n1. Study and teaching. Rabbis have always been the main links in the chain of transmission (\"masorah\") whereby knowledge of the Torah has been passed down through the generations. Learning from their teachers, adding new insights of their own (\"hidushim\"), and teaching the public have always been the primary functions of the rabbinate. Studying the Torah is a rabbi's lifelong undertaking that does not end with receiving ordination. A rabbi is expected to set aside time daily for study. A rabbi that does not constantly replenish his or her store of Torah learning will lack the knowledge, inspiration and mastery of Jewish law and traditions required to perform all other rabbinic functions.\n\nOnce acquired, Torah knowledge must be passed on, because it is the heritage of all Israel. Teaching by rabbis occurs in many venues—the schoolroom of course, elementary (\"heder\"), intermediate (\"yeshivah\") and advanced (\"kollel\"), but also, especially in antiquity, in the vineyard, the marketplace and the disciple circle. In many synagogues, the rabbi will give a short daily class to those who attend morning or evening services. The sermon is another form of public education, often integrating Biblical passages with a contemporary ethical message, and no Jewish meal or celebration is complete without the rabbi's \"d'var Torah\"—a short explanation of Biblical verses related to the event.\n\nApart from face to face instruction, rabbis who are inclined to authorship have composed an extensive rabbinic literature, dealing with all aspects of the Jewish tradition—Bible commentaries, codes of law, responsa, mystical and ethical tracts, and collections of sermons are examples of common genres of rabbinic literature.\n\n2. Judging. Prior to emancipation, rulers delegated discipline and dispute settlement within the Jewish community (\"kahal\") to the Jewish community itself. If a dispute, domestic or commercial, a tort or a petty crime, involved only Jewish residents, then it could be settled in the town's Jewish court according to Jewish law. The town rabbi, with his extensive knowledge of Torah law (\"halakhah\"), was expected to preside as Head of the Court (\"av beth din\"), although lay assessors might join him in judgment. The judgments were enforced with fines and various degrees of communal excommunication when necessary.\n\nAfter emancipation, Jews, as citizens of their countries, turned to civil courts for dispute resolution. Today rabbinical courts remain active under the auspices of each Jewish denomination for religious matters, such as conversion and divorce, and even, on a voluntary basis, for civil matters when the parties voluntarily elect to have the rabbinical judges serve as their arbitrators. In Israel there are rabbinical courts for matters of personal status.\n\n3. Legislating. During the centuries of Jewish self-government, some problems were considered regional or universal and could not be solved by a single rabbi acting alone. At these times rabbinical synods were convened for concerted action, calling together the prominent rabbis of the region to debate solutions and enact binding regulations (\"takkanot\") for their communities. The regulations involved matters as diverse as dowries and matrimonial law, relations with gentiles, utilizing civil courts, education of orphans, anti-counterfeiting measures, and the hiring of schoolteachers. The most famous of these ordinances is ascribed to Rabbenu Gershom of Mainz (c. 960-1040), but was probably enacted in a rabbinic synod he convened c. 1000 C.E. The ordinance, still in effect today, prohibits polygamy among Jews in the West.\n\nIn the modern era rabbis have enacted \"takkanot\" in the State of Israel, and the major Jewish movements, such as Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist, enact \"takkanot\" for their members. Today most congregational rabbis are members of a national rabbinic organization related to their movement and also an association of local rabbis in their city. When these bodies debate local and national questions, they function in a manner that is similar to the rabbinic synods of the past.\n\n4. Religious supervision. The Jewish community requires a number of religious institutions for daily life, and it falls to rabbis, with their knowledge of Jewish law, to supervise them to ensure they operate in accordance with Jewish law. Examples would be Jewish slaughter (\"shekhita\"), Jewish dietary laws in shops and institutions (\"kashrut\"), the ritual bath (\"mikveh\"), the elementary school (\"heder\"), the Sabbath boundaries (\"eruvin\"), and the burial society (\"hevra kadisha\"). Traditionally this function fell to the town's rabbi. In the modern era, rabbis who specialize in this type of supervision will find full-time employment as a Mashgiach (supervisor of ritual law), and some of these functions are now performed by national organizations, such as the Orthodox Union which offers kosher certification.\n\n5. Pastoral counseling. All rabbis will answer questions about Jewish law and Jewish rituals from their congregants. In addition, members of the Jewish community have always turned to rabbis for advice on personal matters. This is conducted in private on a one-to-one basis. In the pre-modern era, rabbis had no special training in counseling. Instead they relied on their personal qualities of empathy and caring as well as their knowledge of \"halakhic\" requirements. These factors continue to inform rabbinic advising in the modern era. However modern rabbinical seminaries have instituted courses in psychology and pastoral counseling as part of the required rabbinic curriculum and they offer internships in counseling and social services for their rabbinical students. Among Hasidic Jews, turning to the \"rebbe\" for advice on personal matters is common.\n\n6. Leading prayer services. Traditionally rabbis did not lead prayer services in the modern sense. There is no requirement that a rabbi be present for public prayer. The Jewish liturgy is fixed and printed in prayer books (\"siddurim\"), the vocal portions are chanted by a cantor (\"hazan\") and the Torah portion is read by a trained reader (\"ba'al kriah\"). If the rabbi was present, he would be seated in front near the Ark and as a matter of respect, the pace at which the rabbi recited his prayers might set the pace of the service. If halakhic questions arose about the prayer service, the rabbi would answer them.\n\nIn modern synagogues, the rabbi takes a more active role in leading prayer services. In some synagogues, it is permitted for the rabbi to select passages from the prayer book for public reading, to omit some passages for brevity and to add special prayers to the service. The rabbi may lead the congregation in responsive reading, announce page numbers and comment on the liturgy from time to time. At Sabbath and holiday services, the congregational rabbi will deliver a sermon either right before or right after the Torah is read.\n\n7. Celebrating life's events. Jewish law does not require the presence of a rabbi at a marriage, bar or bat mitzvah, circumcision, funeral, house of mourning, or unveiling of a monument at a cemetery. At the same time, Jewish law has prescribed requirements for each of these events and rituals. It therefore became customary for rabbis to be present and to lead the community in celebration and in mourning. In the modern era, it is virtually obligatory to have the rabbi's participation at these events, and ministering to the congregation in these settings has become a major aspect of the modern rabbinate.\n\nJewish divorce, which requires a rabbinical court (\"beth din\"), will always have rabbis in attendance.\n\n8. Charitable works. The synagogue has been a place where charity is collected every weekday after services and then distributed to the needy before Sabbaths and holidays. It was not the rabbi who collected these sums; that task was assigned to the sexton, wardens of charity and charitable associations. But it was the rabbi's task to teach that charity (\"tzedakah\") is a core Jewish value. The rabbi did this by preaching, teaching and by example—hosting poor out of town yeshiva students at the home table and offering Jewish travelers a kosher meal. Moses Maimonides formulated a ladder consisting of eight degrees of charity, starting with reluctant giving and ending with teaching someone a trade. Rabbi Israel Salanter (1809-1883) was once asked, \"How do you provide for your spiritual needs?\" He answered, \"By providing for someone else's physical needs.\"\n\nToday Jewish federations and foundations collect and distribute most charity within the Jewish community. However the rabbi retains the task of teaching the value of charity and often participates personally in appeals for the synagogue and for national and international causes.\n\n9. Role-modeling. The rabbi serves as a role model for the congregation by his or her conduct and deportment. Congregation members are keen observers of their rabbi's personality traits, family life, professional conduct, leisure activities and in general the way he or she treats others. Rabbis are aware of this and in the best case deliberately model their conduct so that it represents Jewish values to the community and to outsiders.\n\nThis aspect of the rabbinate, setting an example for the public, has a direct application in Jewish law. The way the greatest rabbis and Torah scholars conducted themselves can become a precedent in Jewish law, known as \"ma'aseh.\" For example, based on reports of what rabbis did in the Talmud, Moses Maimonides ruled that one engaged in public affairs should not break off his duties to recite certain prayers.\n\n10. Outreach. Some rabbis program and guide activities designed to reach Jews who are unaffiliated with Judaism or lapsed in their observances. These include \"Beginners' Services\" where the Jewish liturgy is shortened and explained, and Shabbatons, where unaffiliated Jews are hosted by an observant family during Sabbath to experience the day in a religious setting and to learn about its rituals and customs. Chabad outreach, known as \"kiruv\" (bringing close), finds many rabbis and their spouses posted in Chabad Houses worldwide for the express purpose of reaching unaffiliated Jews.\n\n11. Conversions. Most rabbis will from time to time encounter someone who is not Jewish seeking information about Judaism or wishing to explore conversion to Judaism. This may happen when one member of a couple wishing to marry is seeking conversion or on other occasions when intermarriage is not involved. Based on the rabbi's training and assessment of the person's motivations and goals, the rabbi's approach may range from discouragement of the potential convert to mentoring and directing to a conversion class, in accordance with the policy on conversion of the rabbi's movement. One or three rabbis will serve on the \"beth din\" that performs a conversion. There are no rabbis serving as \"Jewish missionaries\" per se; there is no parallel in Judaism to the proselytizing of other faiths.\n\n12. Match-making. In periods when match-making was common, rabbis participated. Rabbis were well-acquainted with their community members and in particular with the young unmarried men attending their yeshivas. Parents did not hesitate to consult the rabbi for suitable matches. Today in Orthodox circles where socializing among the sexes is not common, this practice continues, and in all branches of Judaism, a rabbi who can help in this arena will not hesitate to do so.\n\n13. Synagogue administration. The modern synagogue is a non-profit religious corporation run by a Board of Directors elected by the members. However, on a day-to-day basis, board members are not present. In most synagogues, it is the rabbi's task to administer the synagogue, supervise personnel, manage the physical plant, review (if not write) the newsletter, and interact with the brotherhood, the sisterhood and the youth organizations. Very large synagogues may employ a separate administrator or assistant rabbi to perform some or all of these functions.\n\n14. Chaplaincy.Rabbis go into the field wherever members of the Jewish community may be found. This is most noticeable in the military services and on university campuses where some rabbis serve as Jewish chaplains on a full-time basis. All branches of the U. S. military have Jewish chaplains in their ranks and rabbis serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. The Hillel Foundation provides rabbis and Jewish services on 550 campuses while Chabad operates Jewish centers with a rabbi near 150 college campuses. Local rabbis perform other chaplaincy functions on a part-time basis in hospitals, senior homes and prisons.\n\nWorthy of mention are the rabbis who accompanied Jews to concentration camps during the Nazi era; in dire circumstances they continued to provide rabbinic services, such as ritual observance, advice and counseling, to the victims of Nazi persecution, whenever it was possible to do so.\n15. Public affairs. As leaders of the Jewish community, many rabbis devote a portion of their time to activities in the public arena, especially where Jewish interests are at stake. They dialogue with public officials and community groups, interact with school boards, advocate for and against legislation, engage in public debates, write newspaper columns, appear in the media and march in parades and demonstrations with others to show support for causes. The extent and tenor of these activities is dictated by the rabbi's own conscience and social and political leanings as informed by Jewish values.\n\n16. Defending the faith. Rabbis are often called upon to defend the Jewish faith. During the Middle Ages, the Church arranged a series of public disputations between rabbis and priests that were intended to \"disprove\" the Jewish faith and condemn its religious texts, including the Talmud. The rabbis acquitted themselves well in debate with their superior understanding of Jewish texts and mass conversions to Christianity did not take place. However following these disputations local rulers at the Church's behest consigned cartloads of precious Hebrew manuscripts to the flames.\n\nToday rabbis are involved in countering the activities of missionaries aimed at converting Jews to other religions, explaining for example that one cannot be of the Jewish faith while believing in either the Christian God or the Christian messiah.\n\n17. Interfaith activities. Some rabbis engage in interfaith dialogues with clergy of other faiths. They may host student groups from the religious schools of other faiths and participate in interfaith services. They will view these activities as a means of deepening understanding and reducing misconceptions in a diverse society.\n\nOther rabbis, especially those affiliated with Orthodox Judaism, will generally not participate in interfaith dialogues about theology. They will however engage in discussions with the clergy of other faiths about matters of mutual social concern.\n\n18. Non-practicing rabbis. There is a segment of the rabbinate that does not engage in rabbinic functions on a daily basis, except perhaps to study. Because ordination (\"semicha\") has the features of a post-graduate academic degree, some study to receive ordination but then follow a different career in secular business, education or the professions. These rabbis may be asked from time to time to perform a rabbinic function on an ad hoc and voluntary basis, e.g. to perform a marriage ceremony or answer a religious question. At other times, they act as regular members of the Jewish community. No negative attitudes attach to rabbis who do not practice the profession. They are likely admired in their communities for their decision to spend years engaged in advanced Torah study for its own sake.\n\nIn antiquity those who performed rabbinic functions, such as judging a case or teaching Torah to students, did not receive compensation for their services. Being a rabbi was not a full-time profession and those who served had other occupations to support themselves and their families, such as woodchopper, sandal-maker, carpenter, water-carrier, farmer and tanner. A respected scholar, Rabbi Zadok (1st cent. C.E.), had said \"never to use the Torah as a spade for digging,\" and this was understood to mean never to use one's Torah knowledge for an inappropriate purpose, such as earning a fee. Still, as honored members of the community, Torah sages were allowed a series of privileges and exemptions that alleviated their financial burdens somewhat. These included such things as tax exemption from communal levies, marketplace priority (first in, first out regarding their trade), receiving personal services from their students (\"shimush talmedei hakhamim\"), silent business partnerships with wealthy merchants, and a substitute fee to replace their lost earnings when they had to leave work to perform a rabbinic function (\"sekhar battalah\").\n\nDuring the period of the Geonim (c. 650-1050 C.E.), opinions on compensation shifted. It was deemed inappropriate for the leaders of the Jewish community to appear in the marketplace as laborers or vendors of merchandise, and leading a Jewish community was becoming a full-time occupation. Under these conditions, the Geonim collected taxes and donations at home and abroad to fund their schools (\"yeshivot\") and paid salaries to teachers, officials and judges of the Jewish community, whom they appointed. Moses Maimonides (\"Rambam\", 1135-1204), who supported himself as a physician, reasserted the traditional view of offering rabbinic service to the Jewish community without compensation. It remains the ideal. But circumstances had changed. Jewish communities required full-time rabbis, and the rabbis themselves preferred to spend their days studying and teaching Torah rather than working at a secular trade.\n\nBy the fifteenth century it was the norm for Jewish communities to compensate their rabbis, although the rabbi's contract might well refer to a \"suspension fee\" (\"sekhar battalah\") rather than a salary, as if he were relinquishing a salary from secular employment. The size of salaries varied, depending on the size of the community served, with rabbis in large cities being well-compensated while rabbis in small towns might receive a small stipend. Rabbis were able to supplement their rabbinic incomes by engaging in associated functions and accepting fees for them, like serving as the community's scribe, notary and archivist, teaching in the elementary school or yeshivah, publishing books, arbitrating civil litigations, or even serving as a matchmaker.\n\nWith the formation of rabbinical seminaries starting in the nineteenth century, the rabbinate experienced a degree of professionalization that is still underway. At the present time, an ordained graduate of a rabbinical seminary that is affiliated with one of the modern branches of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, or modern Orthodox, will find employment—whether as a congregational rabbi, teacher, chaplain, Hillel director, camp director, social worker or administrator—through the placement office of his or her seminary. Like any modern professional, he or she will negotiate the terms of employment with potential employers and sign a contract specifying duties, duration of service, salary, benefits, pension and the like. A rabbi's salary and benefits today tend to be similar to those of other modern professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, with similar levels of post-graduate education. It is also possible to engage in the rabbinate part-time, e.g. at a synagogue with a small membership; the rabbi's salary will be proportionate to the services rendered and he or she will likely have additional employment outside the synagogue.\n\nAcceptance of rabbinic credentials involves both issues of practicality and principle. As a practical matter, communities and individuals typically tend to follow the authority of the rabbi they have chosen as their leader (called by some the \"mara d'atra\") on issues of Jewish law. They may recognize that other rabbis have the same authority elsewhere, but for decisions and opinions important to them they will work through their own rabbi.\n\nThe rabbi derives authority from achievements within a meritocratic system. Rabbis' authority is neither nominal nor spiritual — it is based on credentials. Typically the rabbi receives an institutional stamp of approval. It is this authority that allows them to engage in the halakhic process and make legal prescriptions.\n\nThe same pattern is true within broader communities, ranging from Hasidic communities to rabbinical or congregational organizations: there will be a formal or \"de facto\" structure of rabbinic authority that is responsible for the members of the community. However, Hasidic communities do not have a rabbi: they have a Rebbe, who plays a similar role but is thought to have a special connection to god. The rebbes' authority, then, is based on a spiritual connection to god and so they are venerated in a different way from rabbis.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, it is a commandment (\"mitzvah\") to honor a rabbi and a Torah scholar, along with the elderly, as it is written in Leviticus 19:32, \"Rise up before the elderly, and honor the aged.\" One should stand in their presence and address them with respect. Kohanim (priests) are required to honor rabbis and Torah scholars like the general public. However, if one is more learned than the rabbi or the scholar there is no need to stand. The spouse of a Torah scholar must also be shown deference. It is also a commandment for teachers and rabbis to honor their students. Rabbis and Torah scholars, in order to ensure discipline within the Jewish community, have the authority to place individuals who insult them under a ban of excommunication.\n\nA rabbinical student is awarded \"semichah\" (\"rabbinic ordination\") after the completion of a learning program in a yeshiva or modern rabbinical seminary or under the guidance of an individual rabbi. The exact course of study varies by denomination, but most are in the range of 3–6 years. The programs all include study of Talmud, the codes of Jewish law and responsa to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the branch of Judaism. In addition to rabbinical literature, modern seminaries offer courses in pastoral subjects such as counseling, education, comparative religion and delivering sermons. Most rabbinical students will complete their studies in their mid-20s. There is no hierarchy and no central authority in Judaism that either supervises rabbinic education or records ordinations; each branch of Judaism regulates the ordination of the rabbis affiliated with it.\n\nThe most common formula used on a certificate of \"semichah\" is \"Yore yore\" (\"He may teach, he may teach,\" sometimes rendered as a question and answer, \"May he teach? He may teach.\"). Most Rabbis hold this qualification; they are sometimes called a \"moreh le-hora'ah\" (\"a teacher of rulings\"). A more advanced form of \"semichah\" is \"yadin yadin\" (\"He may judge, he may judge\" or \"May he judge? He may judge.\"). This enables the recipient to serve as a judge on a rabbinical court and adjudicate cases of monetary law, among other responsibilities. The recipient of this ordination can be formally addressed as a \"dayan\" (\"judge\") and also retain the title of rabbi. Only a small percentage of rabbis earn the \"yadin yadin\" ordination. Although not strictly necessary, many Orthodox rabbis hold that a \"beth din\" (court of Jewish law) should be made up of \"dayanim\" with this ordination.\n\nReceiving ordination has been a festive occasion accompanied by celebration since Talmudic times. According to the Talmud, when the rabbis ordained Rabbi Zera, they sang a bridal song in his honor: \"No mascara, and no rouge, and no dyeing [of the hair] -- and [yet] a graceful gazelle.\" They also sang at the ordination of Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi: \"Just like these, just like these, ordain for us!\" The ceremony where ordination is conferred is known as \"Chag HaSemichah,\" the festival of ordination. Today in most branches of Judaism, there is no laying on of hands; ordination is conferred as an academic degree with a diploma, signed by the officiating rabbis, often hand-written on parchment.\n\nAn Orthodox semichah requires the successful completion of a program encompassing Jewish law and responsa in keeping with longstanding tradition. Orthodox rabbinical students work to gain knowledge in Talmud, Rishonim and Acharonim (early and late medieval commentators) and Jewish law. They study sections of the Shulchan Aruch (codified Jewish law) and its main commentaries that pertain to daily-life questions (such as the laws of keeping kosher, Shabbat, and the laws of family purity). Orthodox rabbis typically study at yeshivas, which are dedicated religious schools. Modern Orthodox rabbinical students, such as those at Yeshiva University, study some elements of modern theology or philosophy, as well as the classical rabbinic works on such subjects.\n\nThe entrance requirements for an Orthodox yeshiva include a strong background within Jewish law, liturgy, Talmudic study, and attendant languages (e.g., Hebrew, Aramaic and in some cases Yiddish). Since rabbinical studies typically flow from other yeshiva studies, those who seek a semichah are typically not required to have completed a university education. There are some exceptions to this rule, including Yeshiva University, which requires all rabbinical students to complete an undergraduate degree before entering the program and a Masters or equivalent before ordination.\n\nOn March 22, 2009, the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, an Orthodox Synagogue, held a formal ceremony officially giving Sara Hurwitz the title \"Maharat\" – \"Manhigah Halakhtit Ruchanit Toranit\". However, some Orthodox leaders, such as the Rabbinical Council of America and the Agudath Israel of America, opposed this move and said it was not in keeping with Orthodoxy; in any case, Hurwitz was not given the title \"rabbi\". However, she is considered by some the first Orthodox woman rabbi. In February 2010, Avi Weiss announced that he was changing her title of Maharat to a more familiar-sounding title \"Rabba\". The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both Agudath Yisrael and the Rabbinical Council of America, who called the move \"beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism\". Indeed, women's ordination has come to be a focal point of division between YCT and the rest of the spectrum of Orthodoxy, as most of Orthodoxy does not view YCT as normative Orthodoxy. Weiss announced amidst criticism that the term \"Rabba\" would not be used anymore for his future students. However, in June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as \"Rabbi\". In 2018, Dina Brawer, born in Italy but living in Britain, was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat; she chose the title Rabba. \n\nIn 2017 the Orthodox Union adopted a policy banning women from serving as clergy, from holding titles such as \"rabbi\", or from doing common clergy functions even without a title, in its congregations in the United States.\n\nWhile some Haredi (including Hasidic) yeshivas (also known as \"Talmudical/Rabbinical schools or academies\") do grant official \"semichah\" (\"ordination\") to many students wishing to become rabbis, most of the students within the yeshivas engage in learning Torah or Talmud without the goal of becoming rabbis or holding any official positions.\n\nThe curriculum for obtaining \"semichah\" (\"ordination\") as rabbis for Haredi and Hasidic scholars is the same as described above for all Orthodox students wishing to obtain the official title of \"Rabbi\" and to be recognized as such.\n\nWithin the Hasidic world, the positions of spiritual leadership are dynastically transmitted within established families, usually from fathers to sons, while a small number of students obtain official ordination to become dayanim (\"judges\") on religious courts, poskim (\"decisors\" of Jewish law), as well as teachers in the Hasidic schools. The same is true for the non-Hasidic Litvish yeshivas that are controlled by dynastically transmitted rosh yeshivas and the majority of students will not become rabbis, even after many years of post-graduate kollel study.\n\nSome yeshivas, such as Yeshivas Chafetz Chaim and Yeshivas Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, Maryland, may encourage their students to obtain \"semichah\" and mostly serve as rabbis who teach in other yeshivas or Hebrew day schools. Other yeshivas, such as Yeshiva Chaim Berlin (Brooklyn, New York) or the Mirrer Yeshiva (in Brooklyn and Jerusalem), do not have an official \"semichah/rabbinical program\" to train rabbis, but provide semichah on an \"as needed\" basis if and when one of their senior students is offered a rabbinical position but only with the approval of their \"rosh yeshivas\".\n\nHaredim will often prefer using Hebrew names for rabbinic titles based on older traditions, such as: \"Rav\" (denoting \"[great] rabbi\"), \"HaRav\" (\"the [great] rabbi\"), \"Moreinu HaRav\" (\"our teacher the [great] rabbi\"), \"Moreinu\" (\"our teacher\"), \"Moreinu VeRabeinu HaRav\" (\"our teacher and our rabbi/master the [great] rabbi\"), \"Moreinu VeRabeinu\" (\"our teacher and our rabbi/master\"), \"Rosh yeshiva\" (\"[the] head [of the] yeshiva\"), \"Rosh HaYeshiva\" (\"head [of] the yeshiva\"), \"Mashgiach\" (for Mashgiach ruchani) (\"spiritual supervsor/guide\"), \"Mora DeAsra\" (\"teacher/decisor\" [of] the/this place\"), \"HaGaon\" (\"the genius\"), \"Rebbe\" (\"[our/my] rabbi\"), \"HaTzadik\" (\"the righteous/saintly\"), \"ADMOR\" (\"Adoneinu Moreinu VeRabeinu\") (\"our master, our teacher and our rabbi/master\") or often just plain \"Reb\" which is a shortened form of \"rebbe\" that can be used by, or applied to, any married Jewish male as the situation applies.\n\nNote: A \"rebbetzin\" (a Yiddish usage common among Ashkenazim) or a \"rabbanit\" (in Hebrew and used among Sephardim) is the official \"title\" used for, or by, the wife of any Orthodox, Haredi, or Hasidic rabbi. \"Rebbetzin\" may also be used as the equivalent of \"Reb\" and is sometimes abbreviated as such as well.\n\nConservative Judaism confers semikhah after the completion of a program in the codes of Jewish law and responsa in keeping with Jewish tradition. In addition to knowledge and mastery of the study of Talmud and halakhah, Conservative \"semikhah\" also requires that its rabbinical students receive intensive training in Tanakh, classical biblical commentaries, biblical criticism, Midrash, Kabbalah and Hasidut, the historical development of Judaism from antiquity to modernity, Jewish ethics, the halakhic methodology of Conservative responsa, classical and modern works of Jewish theology and philosophy, synagogue administration, pastoral care, chaplaincy, non-profit management, and navigating the modern world in a Jewish context.\n\nEntrance requirements to Conservative rabbinical study centers include a background within Jewish law and liturgy, familiarity with rabbinic literature, Talmud, etc., ritual observance according to Conservative halakha, and the completion of an undergraduate university degree. In accordance with national collegiate accreditation requirements, Conservative rabbinical students earn a Master of Arts in Rabbinic Literature in addition to receiving \"semikhah\". Ordination is granted at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in Los Angeles, the Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem, the Budapest University of Jewish Studies, the Zacharias Frankel College in Potsdam, and the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Most Conservative seminaries ordain women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors.\n\nIn Reform Judaism rabbinic studies are mandated in pastoral care, the historical development of Judaism, academic biblical criticism, in addition to the study of traditional rabbinic texts. Rabbinical students also are required to gain practical rabbinic experience by working at a congregation as a rabbinic intern during each year of study from year one onwards.\n\nAll Reform seminaries ordain women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors.\n\nThe seminary of Reform Judaism in the United States is Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. It has campuses in Cincinnati, New York City, Los Angeles, and in Jerusalem. In addition to training and ordaining women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion has trained and ordained openly transgender people as rabbis (see Elliot Kukla and Reuben Zellman).\n\nIn the United Kingdom the Reform and Liberal movements maintain Leo Baeck College for the training and ordination of rabbis, and in Germany the progressive Abraham Geiger College trains and ordains candidates for the rabbinate.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism has the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, which is located in Pennsylvania and ordains women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis and cantors. In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.\n\nThere are several possibilities for receiving rabbinic ordination in addition to seminaries maintained by the large Jewish denominations. These include seminaries maintained by smaller denominational movements, and nondenominational (also called \"transdenominational\" or \"postdenominational\") Jewish seminaries.\n\n\nHistorically and until the present, recognition of a rabbi relates to a community's perception of the rabbi's competence to interpret Jewish law and act as a teacher on central matters within Judaism. More broadly speaking, it is also an issue of being a worthy successor to a sacred legacy.\n\nAs a result, there have always been greater or lesser disputes about the legitimacy and authority of rabbis. Historical examples include Samaritans and Karaites.\n\nThe divisions between the various religious branches within Judaism may have their most pronounced manifestation on whether rabbis from one movement recognize the legitimacy or the authority of rabbis in another.\n\nAs a general rule within Orthodoxy and among some in the Conservative movement, rabbis are reluctant to accept the authority of other rabbis whose Halakhic standards are not as strict as their own. In some cases, this leads to an outright rejection of even the legitimacy of other rabbis; in others, the more lenient rabbi may be recognized as a spiritual leader of a particular community but may not be accepted as a credible authority on Jewish law.\n\nThese debates cause great problems for recognition of Jewish marriages, conversions, and other life decisions that are touched by Jewish law. Orthodox rabbis do not recognize conversions by non-Orthodox rabbis. Conservative rabbis recognise all conversions done according to halakha. Finally, the North American Reform and Reconstructionst movemements recognize patrilineality, under certain circumstances, as a valid claim towards Judaism, whereas Conservative and Orthodox maintain the position expressed in the Talmud and Codes that one can be a Jew only through matrilineality (born of a Jewish mother) or through conversion to Judaism.\n\nWith some rare exceptions (see below), women historically have generally not served as rabbis until the 1970s and the influence of second-wave feminism, when the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion first ordained women rabbis. Today, female rabbis are ordained within all branches of Progressive Judaism, while in Orthodox Judaism, women cannot become rabbis.\n\nWhile there is no prohibition against women learning halakha that pertains to them, nor is it any more problematic for a woman to rule on such issues than it is for any lay person to do so, the issue lies in the rabbi's position of communal authority. Following the ruling of the Talmud, the decisors of Jewish law held that women were not allowed to serve in positions of authority over a community, such as judges or kings. The position of official rabbi of a community, \"mara de'atra\" (\"master of the place\"), has generally been treated in the responsa as such a position. This ruling is still followed in traditional and orthodox circles but has been relaxed in branches like Conservative and Reform Judaism that are less strict in their adherence to traditional Jewish law.\n\nAsenath Barzani of Iraq is considered the first female rabbi of Jewish history by some scholars; additionally, she is the oldest recorded female Kurdish leader in history. Hannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir, was a 19th-century Hasidic rebbe, the only female rebbe in the history of Hasidism.\n\nThe first formally ordained female rabbi was Regina Jonas, ordained in Germany in 1935. Since 1972, when Sally Priesand became the first female rabbi in Reform Judaism, Reform Judaism's Hebrew Union College has ordained 552 women rabbis (as of 2008).\n\nSandy Eisenberg Sasso became the first female rabbi in Reconstructionist Judaism in 1974 (one of 110 by 2006); and Amy Eilberg became the first female rabbi in Conservative Judaism in 1985 (one of 177 by 2006). Lynn Gottlieb became the first female rabbi in Jewish Renewal in 1981, and Tamara Kolton became the very first rabbi (and therefore, since she was female, the first female rabbi) in Humanistic Judaism in 1999. In 2009 Alysa Stanton became the world's first African-American female rabbi.\n\nThe Conservative movement appointed a special commission to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, The commission met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of eleven men and three women. In 1983, the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, voted, without accompanying opinion, to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors.\n\nIn Europe, Leo Baeck College had ordained 30 female rabbis by 2006 (out of 158 ordinations in total since 1956), starting with Jackie Tabick in 1975.\n\nThe Orthodox Jewish tradition and communal consensus is that the rabbinate is the province of men; the growing calls for Orthodox yeshivas to admit women as rabbinical students have resulted in widespread opposition among the Orthodox rabbinate. Rabbi Norman Lamm, one of the leaders of Modern Orthodoxy and Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, opposes giving semicha to women. \"It shakes the boundaries of tradition, and I would never allow it.\" (Helmreich, 1997) Writing in an article in the \"Jewish Observer\", Moshe Y'chiail Friedman states that Orthodox Judaism prohibits women from being given semicha and serving as rabbis. He holds that the trend towards this goal is driven by sociology, and not halakha (\"Jewish law\"). In his words, the idea is a \"quirky fad.\" No Orthodox rabbinical association (e.g. Agudath Yisrael, Rabbinical Council of America) has allowed women to be ordained using the term \"rabbi\".\n\nHowever, in the last twenty years Orthodox Judaism has begun to develop roles for women as halakhic court advisors and congregational advisors. Rabbi Aryeh Strikovski (Machanaim Yeshiva and Pardes Institute) worked in the 1990s with Rabbi Avraham Shapira (then a co-Chief rabbi of Israel) to initiate the program for training Orthodox women as halakhic \"Toanot\" (\"advocates\") in rabbinic courts. They have since trained nearly seventy women in Israel. Strikovski states that \"The knowledge one requires to become a court advocate is more than a regular ordination, and now to pass certification is much more difficult than to get ordination.\" In 2012 Ephraim Mirvis appointed Lauren Levin as Britain’s first Orthodox female halakhic adviser, at Finchley Synagogue in London.\n\nSome Orthodox Jewish women now serve in Orthodox Jewish congregations in roles that previously were reserved for males. The grammatically correct Hebrew feminine parallel to the masculine title rabbi is \"rabbanit\" (רבנית) sometimes used for women in this role. Sara Hurwitz, considered by some the first Orthodox woman rabbi, following correct Hebrew feminized grammar of rav (רב), has used the title \"rabba\" (רבה) since 2010. Some use another variant, \"rabet\", for a female rabbi. Other women in Jewish leadership, like Rachel Kohl Finegold and Lynn Kaye function as de facto assistant rabbis.The newer title of \"Maharat\" has been used by those who receive this title at Yeshivat Maharat, the first Orthodox seminary for women to confer an equivalent to rabbinic ordination.\n\nIn Israel, the Shalom Hartman Institute, founded by Orthodox Rabbi David Hartman, opened a program in 2009 that will grant semicha to women and men of all Jewish denominations, including Orthodox Judaism, although the students are meant to \"assume the role of 'rabbi-educators' – not pulpit rabbis- in North American community day schools.\n\nIn Israel a growing number of Orthodox women are being trained as \"yoatzot halakhah\" (halakhic advisers).\n\nIn June 2009, Avi Weiss ordained Sara Hurwitz with the title \"maharat\" (an acronym of \"manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit\") rather than \"Rabbi\". In February 2010, Weiss announced that he was changing Maharat to a more familiar-sounding title \"Rabba\". The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both Agudath Yisrael and the Rabbinical Council of America, who called the move \"beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism\". Weiss announced amidst criticism that the term \"Rabba\" would not be used anymore for his future students. Also in 2009, Weiss founded Yeshivat Maharat, a school which \"is dedicated to giving Orthodox women proficiency in learning and teaching Talmud, understanding Jewish law and its application to everyday life as well as the other tools necessary to be Jewish communal leaders.\" In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi. Hurwitz continues to use the title Rabba and is considered by some to be the first female Orthodox rabbi. However, in the fall of 2015 Rabbinical Council of America passed a resolution which states, \"RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution.\" Similarly in the fall of 2015 Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. in June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as \"Rabbi\". In 2018, Dina Brawer, born in Italy but living in Britain, was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat; she chose the title Rabba. \n\nIn 2013, the first class of female halachic advisers trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of Nishmat’s yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan.\n\nThe use of Toanot is not restricted to any one segment of Orthodoxy; In Israel they have worked with Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews. Orthodox women may study the laws of family purity at the same level of detail that Orthodox males do at Nishmat, the Jerusalem Center for Advanced Jewish Study for Women. The purpose is for them to be able to act as halakhic advisors for other women, a role that traditionally was limited to male rabbis. This course of study is overseen by Rabbi Yaakov Varhaftig.\n\nFurthermore, several efforts are underway within Modern Orthodox communities to include qualified women in activities traditionally limited to rabbis:\n\n\n\n"}

The Greek word \"pathos\" was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers. The Stoics used the word to discuss many common emotions such as anger, fear and excessive joy. Chrysippus regarded the passions as evaluative judgements. A person experiencing such an emotion has incorrectly valued an indifferent thing. They are harmful because they conflict with right reason. Failure to reason correctly brings about the occurrence of \"pathē\".\n\nThe Stoics beginning with Zeno arranged the passions under four headings: distress, pleasure, fear and lust. In \"On Passions\", Andronicus reported the Stoic definitions of these passions (trans. Long & Sedley, pg. 411, modified):\n\n\nTwo of these passions (distress and delight) refer to emotions currently present, and two of these (fear and lust) refer to emotions directed at the future. Thus there are just two states directed at the prospect of good and evil, but subdivided as to whether they are present or future:\n\nNumerous subdivisions of the same class are brought under the head of the separate passions. The definitions are those of the translation of Cicero's \"Tusculan Disputations\" by J. E. King.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wise person (\"sophos\") is someone who is free from the passions (\"apatheia\"). Instead the sage experiences good-feelings (\"eupatheia\") which are clear-headed. These emotional impulses are not excessive, but nor are they diminished emotions. Instead they are the correct rational emotions. The Stoics listed the good-feelings under the headings of joy (\"chara\"), wish (\"boulesis\"), and caution (\"eulabeia\"). Thus if something is present which is a genuine good, then the wise person experiences an uplift in the soul—joy (\"chara\"). The Stoics also subdivided the good-feelings:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5312", "title": "The Consolation of Philosophy", "text": "The Consolation of Philosophy\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy () is a philosophical work by Boethius, written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on Medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, as well as the last great Western work of the Classical Period.\n\n\"The Consolation of Philosophy\" was written in AD 523 during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial – and eventual execution – for the alleged crime of treason under the Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of theodicy), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as \"by far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.\"\n\nA link to Christianity is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion other than a few oblique references to Pauline scripture, such as the symmetry between the opening lines of Book 4 Chapter 3 and 1 Corinthians 9:24. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.\n\nBoethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth (\"no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune\"), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the \"one true good\". She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.\n\nBoethius engages questions such as the nature of predestination and free will, why evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin, human nature, virtue, and justice. He speaks about the nature of free will and determinism when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.\n\nIn the \"Consolation\", Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical Greek tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy. In the words of Henry Chadwick, \"If the \"Consolation\" contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian.\"\n\nFrom the Carolingian epoch to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond it was one of the most popular and influential philosophical works, read by statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of philosophers and theologians. It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “last of the Romans and the first of the Scholastics”.\n\nThe philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness. The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas á Kempis.\n\nThe book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself). Its popularity can in part be explained by its Neoplatonic and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages.\n\nTranslations into the vernacular were done by famous notables, including King Alfred (Old English), Jean de Meun (Old French), Geoffrey Chaucer (Middle English), Queen Elizabeth I (Early Modern English), and Notker Labeo (Old High German).\n\nFound within the \"Consolation\" are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nCitations from it occur frequently in Dante's \"Divina Commedia\". Of Boethius, Dante remarked \"“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”\n\nBoethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in Geoffrey Chaucer's poetry, e.g. in \"Troilus and Criseyde\", \"The Knight's Tale\", \"The Clerk's Tale\", \"The Franklin's Tale\", \"The Parson's Tale\" and \"The Tale of Melibee\", in the character of Lady Nature in \"The Parliament of Fowls\" and some of the shorter poems, such as \"Truth\", \"The Former Age\" and \"Lak of Stedfastnesse\". Chaucer translated the work in his \"Boece\".\n\nThe Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola used some of the text in his choral work \"Canti di prigionia\" (1938). The Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work \"Rites of Passage\" (1972–73), which was commissioned for the opening of the Sydney Opera House but was not ready in time.\n\nTom Shippey in \"The Road to Middle-earth\" says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from Frodo, Treebeard and Elrond.\n\nBoethius and \"Consolatio Philosophiae\" are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" (1980).\n\nIt is a prosimetrical text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of prose and metered verse. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of Latin poetry. It is classified as a Menippean satire, a fusion of allegorical tale, platonic dialogue, and lyrical poetry.\n\nIn the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its popularity.\n\nIn 2016, researchers from the University of Cambridge reconstructed the original melodies to which The Consolation of Philosophy was performed 1,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30356", "title": "Thelema", "text": "Thelema\n\nThelema () is a social or spiritual philosophy derived from Western esotericism. The word \"thelema\" itself is Ancient or Koine Greek for \"will\". While Thelema is most often regarded as a religion—a new religious movement and contemporary mystery religion in particular—it is also referred to as a philosophy, \"religious philosophy\", \"spiritual philosophy\", or \"religious matrix\". An adherent of Thelema is traditionally referred to as a \"Thelemite\", and all phenomena within the scope of Thelema are termed \"Thelemic\".\n\nThe fundamental axiom, tenet, or boilerplate underlying Thelema—known as the \"Law of Thelema\"—is \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\". The traditional corresponding phrase is \"Love is the law, love under will.\" These expressions can be characterized as having moral, mystical, and socio-political implications. In the thelemic worldview or model, each person has a \"True Will\" and (insofar as each person acts in accordance with his or her Will) the nature of a person's interactions with the world (or universe) is a form of \"love\" or harmony. This is expressed further by a third metaphor, \"every man and every woman is a star,\" which portrays the distinct nature of every individual as residing in a non-overlapping point of space and time; collisions between different persons being infrequent if each is aware of—and acting in accordance with—their true purpose in life. The overall conception is quite similar to Taoist philosophy but with a cosmological underpinning 2500 years more recent.\n\nThelema was developed in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley, an English writer, mystic, and ceremonial magician. He believed himself to be the prophet of a new age, the Æon of Horus, based upon a spiritual experience that he and his wife, Rose Edith, had in Egypt in 1904. By his account, a possibly non-corporeal or \"praeterhuman\" being that called itself Aiwass contacted him and dictated a text known as \"The Book of the Law\" or \"Liber AL vel Legis\", which outlined the principles of Thelema.\n\nThe Thelemic pantheon includes a number of deities, primarily a trio adapted from ancient Egyptian religion, who are the three speakers of \"The Book of the Law\": Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley described these deities as a \"literary convenience\". The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\". This statement indicates adherents, known as Thelemites, should seek and follow their true paths in life, known as their True Wills. The philosophy also emphasizes the ritual practice of Magick.\n\nThe word \"thelema\" is the English transliteration of the Koine Greek noun θέλημα () \"will\", from the verb \"to will, wish, want or purpose.\" As Crowley developed the religion, he wrote widely on the topic, as well as producing more 'inspired' writing that he collectively termed The Holy Books of Thelema. He also included ideas from occultism, yoga, and both Eastern and Western mysticism, especially the Qabalah.\n\nAspects of Thelema and Crowley's thought in general provided inspiration for the development of Wicca and, to a certain degree, the rise of Modern Paganism as a whole, as well as, chaos magick, and Satanism. Additionally, aspects of Thelema are believed by scholars such as Hugh Urban to have been an influence on the development of Scientology, however, other scholars such as J. Gordon Melton deny any such connections.\n\nThe word θέλημα (thelema) is rare in Classical Greek, where it \"signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual\", but it is frequent in the Septuagint. Early Christian writings occasionally use the word to refer to the human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil, but it usually refers to the will of God. \n\nOne well-known example is in the \"Lord's Prayer\" (), “Thy kingdom come. Thy will (Θελημα) be done, On earth as it is in heaven.” It is used later in the same gospel (), \"He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, \"My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Thy will be done.\" In his 5th-century Sermon on , Augustine of Hippo gave a similar instruction: \"Love, and what thou wilt, do.\" (\"Dilige et quod vis fac\").\n\nIn the Renaissance, a character named \"Thelemia\" represents will or desire in the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of the Dominican monk Francesco Colonna. The protagonist Poliphilo has two allegorical guides, Logistica (reason) and Thelemia (will or desire). When forced to choose, he chooses fulfillment of his sexual will over logic. Colonna's work was a great influence on the Franciscan monk François Rabelais, who in the 16th century, used \"Thélème\", the French form of the word, as the name of a fictional abbey in his novels, \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\".The only rule of this Abbey was \"fay çe que vouldras\" (\"Fais ce que tu veux\", or, \"Do what thou wilt\"). \n\nIn the mid-18th century, Sir Francis Dashwood inscribed the adage on a doorway of his abbey at Medmenham, where it served as the motto of the Hellfire Club. Rabelais's Abbey of Thelema has been referred to by later writers Sir Walter Besant and James Rice, in their novel \"The Monks of Thelema\" (1878), and C. R. Ashbee in his utopian romance \"The Building of Thelema\" (1910).\n\nAs the forerunner of today's concept of will, the Greek \" boule \" (βουλή) is considered by classic philology, not \" thelo \" (θέλω) or 'thelema'.\n\nThere are, in Greek, two words for will, which are used, for example, in New Testament partly synonym: \" thelema \" and \" boule \".\n\n\nThe verb \" thelo \" appears very early (Homer, early Attic inscriptions) and has the meaning of 'ready', 'Decide' and 'desire' (Homer, 3, 272, also in the sexual sense).\n\n\"Aristotle says in the book \" de plantis \" that the goal of the human will is perception - unlike the plants that do not have 'epithymia' (translation of the author). \"Thelema,\" says the Aristoteles, \"has changed here, epithymia,\" and thelema, \"and that thelema\" is to be neutral, not somehow morally determined, the covetous driving force in man.\n\nIn Septuaginta the term is used for the will of God himself, the religious desire of the God-fearing, and the royal will of a secular ruler. It is thus used only for the representation of high ethical willingness in the faith, the exercise of authority by the authorities, or the non-human will, but not for more profane striving. In the translation of the Greek Old Testament (the Septuaginta), the terms \"boule\" and \"thelema\" appear, whereas in the Vulgate text, the terms are translated into the Latin \"Voluntas\" ('will'). Thus, the different meaning of both concepts was lost.\n\nIn the New Testament in Koine 'thelema' is used 62 times, twice in the plural (\" thelemata \"). Here, God's will is always and exclusively designated by the word \"thelemma\" (θέλημα, mostly in the singular), as the theologian Federico Tolli points out by means of the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament of 1938. (\"Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven). In the same way the term is used in the Apostle Paul and Ignatius of Antioch. For Tolli it follows that the genuine idea of Thema does not contradict the teachings of Jesus (Tolli, 2004).\n\nFrançois Rabelais was a Franciscan and later a Benedictine monk of the 16th century. Eventually he left the monastery to study medicine, and moved to the French city of Lyon in 1532. There he wrote \"Gargantua and Pantagruel,\" a connected series of books. They tell the story of two giants—a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures—written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein.\n\nMost critics today agree that Rabelais wrote from a Christian humanist perspective. The Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin notes this when contrasting the French author's beliefs with the Thelema of Aleister Crowley. In the previously mentioned story of Thélème, which critics analyze as referring in part to the suffering of loyal Christian reformists or \"evangelicals\" within the French Church, the reference to the Greek word θέλημα \"declares that the will of God rules in this abbey\". Sutin writes that Rabelais was no precursor of Thelema, with his beliefs containing elements of Stoicism and Christian kindness.\n\nIn his first book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a classical utopia presented in order to critique and assess the state of the society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled. Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction. The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being \"Do What Thou Wilt\". Rabelais believed that men who are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.\n\nSome modern Thelemites consider Crowley's work to build upon Rabelais's summary of the instinctively honourable nature of the Thelemite. Rabelais has been variously credited with the creation of the philosophy of Thelema, as one of the earliest people to refer to it, or with being \"the first Thelemite\". However, the current National Grand Master General of the U.S. Ordo Templi Orientis Grand Lodge has stated:\n\nAleister Crowley wrote in \"The Antecedents of Thelema,\" (1926), an incomplete work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth the law of Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that he claimed to have received, \"The Book of the Law\". Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.\n\nRabelais is included among the Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.\n\nSir Francis Dashwood adopted some of the ideas of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as the Hellfire Club). An abbey was established at Medmenham, in a property which incorporated the ruins of a Cistercian abbey founded in 1201. The group was known as the Franciscans, not after Saint Francis of Assisi, but after its founder, Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer. John Wilkes, George Dodington and other politicians were members. There is little direct evidence of what Dashwood's Hellfire Club practiced or believed. The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle. He describes the group as hedonists who met to \"celebrate woman in wine\", and added ideas from the ancients just to make the experience more decadent.\n\nIn the opinion of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the inscription over the door. He believes that they used caves as a Dionysian oracular temple, based upon Dashwood’s reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais. Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his \"Historical Memoires\" (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay. Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard say the Monks worshipped \"the Goddess\". Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself and even if the underground version followed its public model precisely.\n\nThelema was founded by Aleister Crowley (1875–1947) who was an English occultist and writer. In 1904, Crowley claimed to have received \"The Book of the Law\" from an entity named Aiwass, which was to serve as the foundation of the religious and philosophical system he called Thelema.\n\nCrowley's system of Thelema begins with \"The Book of the Law\", which bears the official name \"Liber AL vel Legis\". It was written in Cairo, Egypt during his honeymoon with his new wife Rose Crowley (née Kelly). This small book contains three chapters, each of which he claimed to have written in exactly one hour, beginning at noon, on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904. Crowley claims that he took dictation from an entity named Aiwass, whom he later identified as his own Holy Guardian Angel. Disciple, author, and onetime Crowley secretary Israel Regardie prefers to attribute this voice to the subconscious, but opinions among Thelemites differ widely. Crowley claimed that \"no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles\" and that study of the text would dispel all doubts about the method of how the book was obtained.\n\nBesides the reference to Rabelais, an analysis by Dave Evans shows similarities to \"The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk\", a play by Florence Farr. Evans says this may result from the fact that \"both Farr and Crowley were thoroughly steeped in Golden Dawn imagery and teachings\", and that Crowley probably knew the ancient materials that inspired some of Farr's motifs. Sutin also finds similarities between Thelema and the work of W. B. Yeats, attributing this to \"shared insight\" and perhaps to the older man's knowledge of Crowley.\n\nCrowley wrote several commentaries on \"The Book of the Law\", the last of which he wrote in 1925. This brief statement called simply \"The Comment\" warns against discussing the book's contents, and states that all \"questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings\" and is signed Ankh-af-na-khonsu.\n\nAccording to Crowley, every individual has a \"True Will\", to be distinguished from the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's \"calling\" or \"purpose\" in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, without the aid of God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. Others follow later works such as \"Liber II\", saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. The Thelemite is a mystic. According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. \n\nIn order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a \"daimon\" unique to each individual. The spiritual quest to find what you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.\nThelema draws its principal gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She is the night sky arched over the Earth symbolized in the form of a naked woman. She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things. The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in \"Liber AL vel Legis\" as \"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star\". The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. \n\nOther deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a force of nature.\n\nThelemic magick is a system of physical, mental, and spiritual exercises which practitioners believe are of benefit. Crowley defined magick as \"the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will\", and spelled it with a 'k' to distinguish it from stage magic. He recommended magick as a means for discovering the True Will. Generally, magical practices in Thelema are designed to assist in finding and manifesting the True Will, although some include celebratory aspects as well. Crowley was a prolific writer, integrating Eastern practices with Western magical practices from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He recommended a number of these practices to his followers, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); rituals of his own devising or based on those of the Golden Dawn, such as the \"Lesser ritual of the pentagram\", for banishing and invocation; \"Liber Samekh\", a ritual for the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel; eucharistic rituals such as \"The Gnostic Mass\" and \"The Mass of the Phoenix\"; and \"Liber Resh\", consisting of four daily adorations to the sun. Much of his work is readily available in print and online. He also discussed sex magick and sexual gnosis in various forms including masturbatory, heterosexual, and homosexual practices, and these form part of his suggestions for the work of those in the higher degrees of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Crowley believed that after discovering the True Will, the magician must also remove any elements of himself that stand in the way of its success.\nThe emphasis of Thelemic magick is not directly on material results, and while many Thelemites do practice magick for goals such as wealth or love, it is not required. Those in a Thelemic magical Order, such as the A∴A∴, or Ordo Templi Orientis, work through a series of degrees or grades via a process of initiation. Thelemites who work on their own or in an independent group try to achieve this ascent or the purpose thereof using the Holy Books of Thelema and/or Crowley's more secular works as a guide, along with their own intuition. Thelemites, both independent ones and those affiliated with an order, can practice a form of performative prayer known as \"Liber Resh\".\n\nOne goal in the study of Thelema within the magical Order of the A∴A∴ is for the magician to obtain the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: conscious communication with their own personal daimon, thus gaining knowledge of their True Will. The chief task for one who has achieved this goes by the name of \"crossing the abyss\"; completely relinquishing the ego. If the aspirant is unprepared, he will cling to the ego instead, becoming a Black Brother. Rather than becoming one with God, the Black Brother considers his ego to be god. According to Crowley, the Black Brother slowly disintegrates, while preying on others for his own self-aggrandisement.\n\nCrowley taught skeptical examination of all results obtained through meditation or magick, at least for the student. He tied this to the necessity of keeping a magical record or diary, that attempts to list all conditions of the event. Remarking on the similarity of statements made by spiritually advanced people of their experiences, he said that fifty years from his time they would have a scientific name based on \"an understanding of the phenomenon\" to replace such terms as \"spiritual\" or \"supernatural\". Crowley stated that his work and that of his followers used \"the method of science; the aim of religion\", and that the genuine powers of the magician could in some way be objectively tested. This idea has been taken on by later practitioners of Thelema, chaos magic and magick in general. They may consider that they are testing hypotheses with each magical experiment. The difficulty lies in the broadness of their definition of success, in which they may see as evidence of success things which a non-magician would not define as such, leading to confirmation bias. Crowley believed he could demonstrate, by his own example, the effectiveness of magick in producing certain subjective experiences that do not ordinarily result from taking hashish, enjoying oneself in Paris, or walking through the Sahara desert. It is not strictly necessary to practice ritual techniques to be a Thelemite, as due to the focus of Thelemic magick on the True Will, Crowley stated \"every intentional act is a magickal act\".\n\nLiber AL vel Legis does make clear some standards of individual conduct. The primary of these is \"Do what thou wilt\" which is presented as the whole of the law, and also as a right. Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others to do their own wills without interference, but \"Liber AL\" makes no clear statement on the matter. Crowley himself wrote that there was no need to detail the ethics of Thelema, for everything springs from \"Do what thou Wilt\". Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which do address the topic interference with others: Liber OZ, \"Duty\", and \"Liber II\".\n\n\"Liber Oz\" enumerates some of the rights of the individual implied by the one overarching right, \"Do what thou wilt\". For each person, these include the right to: live by one's own law; live in the way that one wills to do; work, play, and rest as one will; die when and how one will; eat and drink what one will; live where one will; move about the earth as one will; think, speak, write, draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build, and dress as one will; love when, where and with whom one will; and kill those who would thwart these rights.\n\n\"Duty\" is described as \"A note on the chief rules of practical conduct to be observed by those who accept the Law of Thelema.\" It is not a numbered \"Liber\" as are all the documents which Crowley intended for A∴A∴, but rather listed as a document intended specifically for Ordo Templi Orientis. There are four sections:\n\n\nIn \"Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion\", the Law of Thelema is summarized succinctly as \"Do what thou wilt—then do nothing else.\" Crowley describes the pursuit of Will as not only with detachment from possible results, but with tireless energy. It is Nirvana but in a dynamic rather than static form. The True Will is described as the individual's orbit, and if they seek to do anything else, they will encounter obstacles, as doing anything other than the will is a hindrance to it.\n\nThe core of Thelemic thought is \"Do what thou wilt\". However, beyond this, there exists a very wide range of interpretation of Thelema. Modern Thelema is a syncretic philosophy and religion, and many Thelemites try to avoid strongly dogmatic or fundamentalist thinking. Crowley himself put strong emphasis on the unique nature of Will inherent in each individual, not following him, saying he did not wish to found a flock of sheep. Thus, contemporary Thelemites may practice more than one religion, including Wicca, Gnosticism, Satanism, Setianism and Luciferianism. Many adherents of Thelema, none more so than Crowley, recognize correlations between Thelemic and other systems of spiritual thought; most borrow freely from the methods and practices of other traditions, including alchemy, astrology, qabalah, tantra, tarot divination and yoga. For example, Nu and Had are thought to correspond with the Tao and Teh of Taoism, Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras, Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism, Ain Soph and Kether in the Hermetic Qabalah.\n\nThere are some Thelemites who do accept \"The Book of the Law\" in some way but not the rest of Crowley's \"inspired\" writings or teachings. Others take only specific aspects of his overall system, such as his magical techniques, ethics, mysticism, or religious ideas, while ignoring the rest. Other individuals who consider themselves Thelemites regard what is commonly presented as Crowley's system to be only one possible manifestation of Thelema, creating original systems, such as those of Nema and Kenneth Grant. And one category of Thelemites are non-religious, and simply adhere to the philosophical law of Thelema.\n\nThe Book of the Law gives several holy days to be observed by Thelemites. There are no established or dogmatic ways to celebrate these days, so as a result Thelemites will often take to their own devices or celebrate in groups, especially within Ordo Templi Orientis. These holy days are usually observed on the following dates:\n\n\nAleister Crowley was highly prolific and wrote on the subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print. During his time, there were several who wrote on the subject, including U.S. O.T.O. Grand Master Charles Stansfeld Jones, whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller.\n\nJack Parsons was a scientist researching the use of various fuels for rockets at the California Institute of Technology, and one of Crowley's first American students, for a time leading the Agape Lodge of the Ordo Templi Orientis for Crowley in America. He wrote several short works during his lifetime, some later collected as \"Freedom is a Two-edged Sword.\" He died in 1952 as a result of an explosion, and while not a prolific writer himself, has been the subject of two biographies; \"Sex and Rockets\" by John Carter, and \"Strange Angel\" by George Pendle.\n\nSince Crowley's death in 1947, there have been other Thelemic writers such as Israel Regardie, who edited many of Crowley's works and also wrote a biography of him, \"The Eye in the Triangle\", as well as books on Qabalah. Kenneth Grant wrote numerous books on Thelema and the occult, such as \"The Typhonian Trilogy\". Lon Milo DuQuette has written several books which analyze Crowley's system.\n\nOther notable contemporary writers who address Thelema include Allen H. Greenfield, Christopher Hyatt, Richard Kaczynski, Marcelo Ramos Motta, Rodney Orpheus, Phyllis Seckler, James Wasserman, Sam Webster, and Robert Anton Wilson. There are also journals which print original Thelemic writing.\n\nMichael Ende's fantasy novel \"The Neverending Story\" features the AURYN, inscribed with \"DO WHAT YOU WISH\".\nWhen the boy Bastian becomes supreme ruler, he finds the consequences of his wishes and what his strongest wish really is.\n\nSeveral modern organizations of various sizes claim to follow the tenets of Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the A∴A∴, an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the Golden Dawn system; and Ordo Templi Orientis, an order which initially developed from the Rite of Memphis and Mizraim in the early part of the 20th century, and which includes Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as its religious arm.\n\nSince Crowley's death in 1947, other organizations have formed to carry on his initial work, for example, the Typhonian Order of Kenneth Grant and The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn. Other groups of widely varying character exist which have drawn inspiration or methods from Thelema, such as the Illuminates of Thanateros and the Temple of Set. Some groups accept the Law of Thelema, but omit certain aspects of Crowley's system while incorporating the works of other mystics, philosophers, and religious systems. \n\nThe Fraternitas Saturni (Brotherhood of Saturn), founded in 1928 in Germany, accepts the Law of Thelema, but extends it with the phrase \"Mitleidlose Liebe!\" (\"Compassionless love!\"). The Thelema Society, also located in Germany, accepts Liber Legis and much of Crowley's work on magick, while incorporating the ideas of other thinkers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Sanders Peirce, Martin Heidegger and Niklas Luhmann.\n\nThelemites can also be found in other organizations. The president of the Church of All Worlds, LaSara FireFox, identifies as a Thelemite. A significant minority of other CAW members also identify as Thelemites.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In June, they reached Dexing (德興; present-day Julu Hebei) and stayed in the Longyang Taoist Temple (龍陽觀) from summer to end of winter. On February 1221, they resumed their journey. When asked by friends and disciples when to expect the master to return, the master answered \"In three years, three years\". On February 3, they reached Cuiping Pass (翠帡口; west of Zhangjiakou), they saw the Taihang Mountains to their south. Travelling north then north east, they arrived at Gailipo salt lake (蓋里泊; now named Jiuliancheng Naoer 九連城淖爾; in the south of the Taibus Banner). From there they went to Lake Buir, Hulunbuir, Ulan Bator, Arkhangai, Altay Mountains, Beshbalik, Dzungaria, Samarkand and arrived at Hindu Kush of Afghanistan in 1222 and presented himself before Genghis Khan. \n\nThe journey to Persia and back took three years, from 1220 to 1224. The record was written by a disciple Li Zhichang (李志常), who accompanied Qiu on the journey. The \"Travels\" consisted of two parts, the first part described the details of the travel to the west and back; the second part contains advice from Qiu Chuji to Genghis Khan.\n\nThe \"Travels\" was published by another disciple Sun Xi (孫錫), with a preface dated 1228.

{"id": "146054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146054", "title": "Virgin birth of Jesus", "text": "Virgin birth of Jesus\n\nThe virgin birth of Jesus is the belief that Jesus was conceived in the womb of his mother Mary through the Holy Spirit without the agency of a human father and born while Mary was still a virgin. The New Testament references are Matthew 1:18-25 and Luke 1:26-38; it is not expressly mentioned elsewhere in the Christian scriptures, and \"the modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation.\"\n\nThe virgin birth was universally accepted in the Christian church and, except for some minor sects, was not seriously challenged until the 18th century. It is enshrined in the creeds that most Christians consider normative, such as the Nicene Creed (\"incarnate of the Virgin Mary\") and the Apostles' Creed (\"born of the Virgin Mary\"), and is a basic article of belief in the Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant churches.\n\nMuslims also believe in the virgin birth of Jesus.\n\nThe story of Jesus' miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit is found only in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBoth Matthew and Luke probably date from the period AD 80-100, and both were originally anonymous (the attributions to Matthew and Luke were added in the 2nd century). It is widely, though not universally, accepted that both are based on the Gospel of Mark, but Mark has no birth story, and the differences between Matthew and Luke are so great that it is highly unlikely either comes from the other or that they shared a common independent source. Some scholars, notably Raymond E. Brown, have suggested that Joseph was the source of Matthew's account and Mary of Luke's, but modern scholars consider this \"highly unlikely\", given that this so-called family tradition emerged only at a late stage in the Christian tradition.\n\nMatthew quotes a prophecy from the Isaiah as the basis for the virgin birth. In this vignette the prophet Isaiah informs King Ahaz that his enemies will be destroyed before a child born to a young woman in his retinue is old enough \"to refuse evil and know good;\" this child, he says, will be named Immanuel, \"God is with us,\" because God is with Israel:\n\nScholars agree that the Hebrew word used in Isaiah, \"almah\", signifies a girl of childbearing age without reference to virginity, and Isaiah is in any case talking about his own immediate circumstances in the year 735 BC, not the distant future. In Isaiah the Immanuel prophecy has an immediate aim, but Matthew uses it to find patterns of God's dealings with Israel rather than a single and specific fulfillment.\n\nIn the genealogy preceding his birth story the author of Matthew calls Joseph \"the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.\" In the original Greek, the phrase \"of whom\", ἐξ ἧς, is feminine singular, clearly showing that it refers to Mary, and that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus. As the story progresses the Book of Matthew underlines the virginity of Mary through references to the Book of Isaiah (using the Greek translation rather than the Hebrew original) and by his narrative statement that Joseph had no sexual relations with her until after the birth (a choice of words which leaves open the possibility that they did have relations after that).\n\nThe Book of Luke differs from Matthew in depicting a virginal conception rather than a virgin birth (there is nothing in Luke that suggests Joseph did not have sexual relations with Mary after the angelic visit).\n\nLuke's virgin birth story is a standard plot from the Jewish scriptures, as for example in the annunciation scenes for Isaac and for Samson, in which an angel appears and causes apprehension, the angel gives reassurance and announces the coming birth, the mother raises an objection, and the angel gives a sign.\n\nThomas Aquinas wrote that human beings incur original sin through being begotten by the active power in a man's semen. Therefore, he felt, it was proper that Christ assumed flesh from a woman, as \"the power of a man's semen ought not to have accomplished the formation of Christ's body.\"\n\nThe Apostle Paul, writing several decades before Matthew and Luke, shows no awareness of any virgin birth tradition. He makes three explicit references to Jesus' birth, and assumes Jesus' full humanity and says nothing of the circumstances of the birth. The three are Galatians 4:4, which speaks of Jesus as \"born of a woman, born under the law\"; Romans 1:1-4, which says that Jesus was \"of the seed of David according to the flesh\"; and Philippians 2:6-7, in which Jesus is described as \"born in the likeness of men\". \n\nPaul's expression \"born of a woman, born under the law\" has been interpreted as implying that Jesus had no human father. The opening of the Epistle to the Romans includes the words: \"who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord\". Some, pointing out that the Greek word translated as \"descendant\" in some Bibles is \"sperma\", which literally means \"seed\", and interpreting this as indicating descent through the male line, take \"descended from David according to the flesh\" to mean that Joseph, a descendant of David, was the physical father of Jesus, thus denying the virgin birth of Jesus, others take it as indicating that Mary was also a descendant of David. Others point out that here, as in Galatians 4:4, Paul does not use the ordinary word for \"born\" (γεννητός, \"gennetos\", the word used in Matthew 11:11 in relation to John the Baptist being \"born of a woman\"), but the word γενόμενος, \"genomenos\", literally meaning \"become\", \"come to be\", a fact that some interpret as an allusion to incarnation of the pre-existent Son of God.\n\nIn Timothy 1:4, the author urges people not to \"occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations\". Some scholars see this passage as reflecting a negative view of the developing virgin birth stories and their variant genealogies.\n\nThe Islamic faith echoed some strands within Christian tradition that Mary (or Maryam) was a literal virgin when Jesus was conceived. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Surah 3 (Al Imran) and 19 (Maryam) of the Quran where the story is narrated that God (Allah) sent an angel to announce that Maryam could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.\n\nSome academics have noted that the account in Surah 19 is particularly close to that in the Christian Gospel of Luke. The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary/ Maryam is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In the first instance, the bearer of the news (who is believed by most Muslims to be the archangel Gabriel), delivered the news in (3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (19:16-22). The details of the conception are not discussed but when Mary asks how she can bear a son in view of her chastity she is told that God creates what he wills and that these things are easy for God. The Quran (21:91 and 66:12) says that God blew through his angel into Mary and she, although being chaste bore Jesus without any father.\n\nThe modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation. According to Matthew, an angel appears to Joseph in a dream, to inform Joseph of the virginal conception; while in Luke the angel Gabriel informs Mary before the conception occurs. There are at least two rival explanations for the \"double attestation\" of Matthew and Luke regarding the virgin birth of Jesus:\n\nHowever, the fact that the virgin birth is mentioned only by Matthew and Luke is considered to produce doubt as to its truth by scholars such as Jürgen Moltmann. He writes: \"In the New Testament, Christ's 'virgin birth' is related only by Luke and Matthew. It was unknown, or considered unimportant, in wide areas of early Christian belief (the Pauline and Johannine sectors, for example). But from the third century onwards it became a firm component of the Christian creeds and theological christologies.\" He also writes: \"The virgin birth is not one of the pillars that sustains the New Testament faith in Christ. The confession of faith in Jesus, the Son of God, the Lord, is independent of the virgin birth, and is not based on it.\" \"Moreover, we find the confession of faith in Christ in Christian traditions which know nothing of the virgin birth, or do not mention it.\" He concludes: \"that the virgin birth does not provide the justification for confessing Christ.\" John L. McKenzie notes that, if these two narratives were missing from the New Testament, \"there would be no biblical mention of the virgin birth\". He adds, \"the event is unusual enough for one to wonder why an author who knew of it would not mention it.\" Bart D. Ehrman writes, \"The tradition that Jesus' mother was a virgin is given by both Matthew and Luke, and to that extent, it's independently attested. But it has always struck scholars as odd that the tradition—which surely would be an important thing to know!—isn't attested anywhere else in our earliest sources, even among writers who would have had a real interest in publicizing the fact that God himself was actually Jesus' father.\" \"The Oxford Companion to the Bible\", on the fact that nowhere else in the Bible is the virgin birth attested, has: Such an argument from silence cannot be determinative, but it is an important consideration for people who see the virgin birth as a feature created within the early traditions about Jesus rather than a historical occurrence. Those who doubt the historicity of the virgin birth argue that it was created by the early church as a way of honoring the coming of Jesus as the Son of God or of explaining the idea of God becoming flesh. Miraculous human birth stories are common in biblical tradition, going back to Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17.15—19, 18.9—15, I. 1—7), and numerous references to deities impregnating women are found within the Greco-Roman tradition. The mother of Heracles, for instance, was said to have been impregnated by Zeus (Diodorus Siculus, 4-9, 1—10).\n\nAmong other hypotheses that have been proposed as explanations of the origin of the accounts in Matthew and Luke of the birth of Jesus from a virgin is that of professor of humanities and religious studies Stephen L. Harris, who proposed that these were written to answer Jewish slanders about Jesus' illegitimate birth, of which there is evidence from the 2nd century, but which may have been a subsequent polemical Jewish response to the account in Matthew and Luke. Helmut Köster views the narratives of Jesus' virgin birth as having roots in Hellenistic mythology.\n\nThroughout Christian history a small number of groups have denied the virgin birth. This view existed among some early Jewish Christian groups such as some of the Ebionites who considered Jesus the Messiah, but rejected the apostle Paul as an apostate. However, in the 4th century the Nicene Creed rejected the teaching that Jesus was a mere human.\nIn the 2nd century, Celsus, a pagan anti-Christian Greek philosopher, wrote that Jesus's father was a Roman soldier named Pantera. The views of Celsus drew responses from Origen, who considered it a fabricated story. Raymond E. Brown states that the story of Pantera is a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, as part of the conflicts with Christians, a satirical parody of the Christian gospels called the Toledot Yeshu was written. The book referred to Pantera, or Pandera, as the father of Jesus. Robert E. Van Voorst states that the literary origins of Toledot Yeshu cannot be traced with any certainty, and that, given its medieval composition without a fixed form, it is \"most unlikely\" to contain reliable historical information. \"The Blackwell Companion to Jesus\" states that the Toledot Yeshu contains no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.\n\nHistorically notable figures to deny the virgin birth included the translator of the first Bible in Belarusian, Symon Budny (who was excommunicated by the Polish Unitarians), and Joseph Priestley and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn 1st-century Judea, Jewish girls were betrothed around the age of twelve or twelve and a half. During the betrothal period, which lasted about a year, the marriage was not consummated and the bride remained in her parents' house. Betrothal was formalised by a contract, and voiding the contract required a divorce document freeing the girl to remarry.\n\nThe ancient world had no idea that male semen and female ovum were both needed to form a fetus; instead they thought that the male contribution in reproduction consisted of some sort of formative or generative principle. According to the understanding of the time, Mary's bodily fluids would provide all the matter that was needed for Jesus' bodily form, including his male sex.\n\nTales of virgin birth and the impregnation of mortal women by deities were well known in the 1st-century Greco-Roman world, and Second Temple Jewish works were also capable of producing accounts of the appearances of angels and miraculous births for ancient heroes such as Melchizedek, Noah, and Moses. Nevertheless, \"plausible sources that tell of virgin birth in areas convincingly close to the gospels' own probable origins have proven extremely hard to demonstrate\". Similarly, while it is widely accepted that there is a connection with Zoroastrian (Persian) sources underlying Matthew's story of the Magi (the wise men from the East) and the Star of Bethlehem, a wider claim that Zoroastrianism formed the background to the infancy narratives has not achieved acceptance.\n\nAs part of the conflicts between Christians and other groups during the 1st and 2nd centuries, statements were made by both Jews and pagans criticizing the Christian virgin birth narratives. Early Christian Justin Martyr countered these arguments in \"The First Apology of Justin\" and \"Dialog with Trypho\". Perhaps intending to make Jesus' virgin birth more palatable to non-Christians, Justin argued that \"the extraordinary birth of Jesus is something that He has in common with Perseus\". However, Justin also says that such pagan stories were given them by Satan, and the stories were not really virgin births.\n\nThe early Christian document The Ascension of Isaiah, which may date to the 2nd century, also has a narrative of the virgin birth of Jesus. However, the date and origin of this document are questionable, given that the author disguised his identity behind Isaiah. The narrative of the virgin birth of Jesus can be found also in other New Testament apocrypha, for instance the Protevangelium of James, perhaps written in the 2nd century.\n\nChristians celebrate the conception of Jesus on 25 March (Lady Day) and his birth at Christmas (25 December) or Epiphany (6 January). Among the many traditions associated with Christmas are the construction of cribs and the performance of re-enactments of elements of the story in the Gospels of the birth of Jesus, a tradition started in the 13th century by the Franciscans.\n\nThe festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the Western Church, notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated. There has been debate about the reason why Christians came to choose the 25 December date to celebrate the birth of Jesus. One theory is that they did so in order to oppose the existing winter-solstice feast of the \"Natalis Solis Invicti\" (Birthday of the Unconquered Sun) by celebrating on that date the birth of the \"Sun of Righteousness\".\n\nAnother tradition derived the date of Christmas from that of the Annunciation, the virginal conception of Jesus. Since this was supposed to have taken place on 14 Nisan in the Jewish calendar, calculated to have been either 25 March or 6 April, it was believed that the date of Christ's birth will have been nine months later. A tractate falsely attributed to John Chrysostom argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March, a computation also mentioned by Saint Augustine of Hippo.\n\nThe Magnificat, based on Luke 1:46-55 is one of four well known Gospel canticles: the \"Benedictus\" and the\" Magnificat\" in the first chapter, and the \"Gloria in Excelsis\" and the \"Nunc dimittis\" in the second chapter of Luke, which are now an integral part of the Christian liturgical tradition. The Magnificat is one of the eight most ancient Christian hymns and perhaps the earliest Marian hymn. The Annunciation, representing the virgin birth, became an element of Marian devotions in Medieval times, and by the 13th century direct references to it were widespread in French lyrics.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church uses the title \"Ever Virgin Mary\" as a key element of its Marian veneration, and as part of the Akathists (hymns) to Mary which are an integral part of its liturgy.\n\nThis doctrine of the Virgin Birth is often represented Christian art in terms of the annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, and in Nativity scenes that include the figure of Salome. The Annunciation is one of the most frequently depicted scenes in Western art. Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art. The depiction of Joseph turning away in some Nativity scenes is a discreet reference to the fatherhood of the Holy Spirit, and the doctrine of Virgin Birth.\n\n\n"}

The party is described variously as right-wing,\nright-wing populist or far-right.\n\nVox was founded on 17 December 2013, and publicly launched at a press conference in Madrid on 16 January 2014. The reasons for this schism seem to be the way the incumbent PP government dealt with the issue of the violence of separatist group ETA, the fiscal policy of the PP and the desire for a more centralized government in contrast to the current, quasi-federal political system (\"State of Autonomies\") instituted in 1978. Vox opposes Basque and Catalan separatism in general. VOX have labelled themselves as a right-wing and Christian democratic party. The first provisional chairman was the philosopher (provisional until the party's internal election in late 2014). Other members are Santiago Abascal and José Antonio Ortega Lara (well known for having been kidnapped by ETA for more than a year).\n\nVox ran for the first time in the 2014 European elections but narrowly failed to win a seat in the European Parliament.\n\nIn September 2014 the party elected Santiago Abascal, one of the founders, as new President, and Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, also a founder, as General Secretary. Eleven members of the National Executive Committee were also elected.\n\nAs of 2017 Vox remains a marginal political actor in Spain. In the fall of 2017 the number of members increased 20% in forty days as a consequence of the terrorist attack in Barcelona and the Catalan independence process.\n\nAfter the Catalan referendum of 2017 and the start of a Spanish constitutional crisis, Vox opted to not participate in the Catalan regional elections of 2017. After the Catalan declaration of independence, the party sued the Parliament of Catalonia and several independentist politicians.\n\nOn 10 September 2018 Vox enlisted an independent legislator in the regional parliament of Extremadura (who had dropped out of the PP parliamentary group) as party member. On 2 December 2018 they won 12 parliamentary seats in the Andalusian regional election.\n\nVox takes a pro-life stance on abortion and opposes same-sex marriage because they consider the Spanish word for marriage, \"matrimonio\", to be etymologically inadequate for same sex couples. Vox seeks to create a new type of union, called a \"civil union\", to replace same-sex marriage.\n\nStarting with a focus in economically liberal stances and recentralization proposals, the focus of their message shifted towards stances compatible with European right-wing populism, endorsing anti-Islam and anti mass-immigration discourses as well as criticism of multiculturalism. Their view of European Union is that of a soft euroscepticism, arguing that Spain should make no sovereignty concessions to the EU, because they consider Spanish sovereignty to reside in the Spanish nation alone. However, they propose to remove Spain's autonomous communities, negating the sovereignty of other nationalities and regional identities within Spain.\n"}

{"id": "29845725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29845725", "title": "Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan", "text": "Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan\n\nWat Ong Teu Mahawihan (Temple of the Heavy Buddha) is one of many Buddhist monasteries in the city of Vientiane in Laos. This name is given to the temple due to the large, bronze \"Phra Ong Teu\" Buddha image that is in the temple: the largest Buddha in Vientiane. This temple was initially constructed by King Settathirat I in the 16th century (known as the golden age of Buddhism in Laos) when Laos was being bombarded by the Burmese, but was later demolished during a foreign invasion. Thus, it may have gone through many reconstructions during the 19th or 20th century to attain the appearance it has today.\n\nThough this temple is created in Vientiane, it has the basic shape for what is known as the ‘Luang Prabang I style’ with its scarce use of brickwork and rectangular-like body.\n\nWat Ong Teu is said to have been placed along a cardinal point in accordance with three other temples but that may just be coincidental.\n\nAfter commanding for the relocation of the capital of Laos from the city of Luang Prabang to Vientiane, King Setthathirat I produced many monasteries such as Wat That Luang and Wat Phra Kaew. The reason this \"wat\" (Lao for temple) was built was because Setthathirat I desired to create the \"Phra Ong Teu\" image that would be placed in it and to have it as his living quarters. There would be six other sculptures of this image in other monasteries, but Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan contains the first. Since this period is known as the golden age, the wat would evolve into a complex with a \"sim\" (ordination hall), a \"ho rackhang\" (bell tower), a \"ho kong\" (drum tower), a that (stupa), and a \"kuti\" (monks’ living quarters). Each of these parts of the complex all share the artistic motif of the architecture of the central \"wat\", which is discussed later.\n\nThe original use of this \"wat\" was for ceremonies of allegiance to the king. However, in the 17th century, Souligna Vongsa as king transformed the temple into a Buddhist learning center to ‘teach, enlighten and inspire worshippers.’ It became a school for monks coming from around Southeast Asia to study the \"dhamma\". This becomes apparent because surrounding countries of Laos sent their monks to Vientiane to study this religion. Such a function is more understandable of Wat Ong Teu since there are many details that give the suggestion of a learning center.\n\nWhen Siam sacked Laos in 1827-28, as a punishment, almost all of the monasteries in Laos, including Wat Ong Teu, were destroyed. This was only made worse afterwards when the Ho bandits tried sack Vientiane again to take gold from Wat Ong Teu and others.\n\nIn 1900, following the establishment of the Franco-Siamese treaty in 1843, the French chose Vientiane as their capital and started the reconstruction of its monasteries including Wat Ong Teu. As an addition, the French may have created a school, in the same format and appearance as the rest of the complex to further exemplify the function of Wat Ong Teu as a place of study. The Lao Buddhist Institute was made in 1929 and still functions today as a school for the Theravada Buddhist religion.\n\nIn retrospect, the influence on the style of the original temple can be traced predominantly to India, though not directly. Indochina was part of the sphere of influence of India, known by George Coedès as the ‘Indianization of Southeast Asia.’ The religion and customs of Indian civilization came ‘thoroughly yet peacefully’ to the people of this region, especially due to marriages between Indian men and local women. Laos, however, was a not a country during this time. The kingdom of Lan Xang (‘Land of a million elephants’) wasn’t established until the mid-13th century of the common era just years after all direct contact with India was completely diminished. Instead, the original Wat Ong Teu took its traits from other mixed ideas of architecture from surrounding countries that were established earlier than the 13th century. In essence, the variant notions of these Southeastern Asian countries on the Theravada Buddhist architecture of India, such as Cambodia and Siam (present day Thailand), influenced the ideas of how Wat Ong Teu would be depicted.\n\nEven though Laos borrowed traditions from these other cultures, the 16th century turned a new leaf for the Lao people in the form of a golden age. Thus, Wat Ong Teu has most of its own Lao Buddhist features and only minor details of surrounding influences.\n\nAfter the temple’s destruction, some of the techniques used to create it were lost but much of it wasn’t forgotten. Instead, modern techniques were blended in with the old during the temple’s reconstruction, especially in what was used to fortify the walls and roof. The result became a rich new style that is exclusive to Lao architecture. This primarily is because the modern reconstruction completed by the French kept sincere adherence to these Lao notions already established on temple aesthetics, with some artistic liberties since Laos at this time was a protectorate of France.\n\nA multi-tiered archway serves as the entrance into the complex. It is miniature compared to that of Pha That Luang. The functionality of this seemingly simple archway is similar to that of the \"torana\", or gateway, of Indian culture. The torana served as the passageway from secular ground to sacred ground. The difference is that this archway does not have any images for which a person can meditate and it doesn’t involve circumambulating a stupa. This characteristic may be present in all the temples and stupas that in Laos, especially at King Setthathirat’s more famous architectural creation, Pha That Luang.\n\nThe entrance to Wat Ong Teu is known to have many eccentricities that are indigenous only to Laos and no other Buddhist temple in Asia. Just before going up the stairs at the front of the temple, one can find the frieze that is exceedingly baroque, highlighting this Lao style. The green backdrop shimmers as many carved and gilded vine leaves curve in no apparent order or pattern. This motif is repeated throughout the whole front part of the temple, even surrounding the six small Buddhas that are just below the frieze. This foliage may be an allusion to the lotus flower which is an aniconic symbol of the Buddha.\n\nAnother Lao characteristic of monasteries is the pointed double archway that flanks the six Buddhas. There are many variations of this characteristic, but the archway of Wat Ong Teu is the most simplistic aesthetically.\n\nOne of the most native features to Laos is the \"Naga\", or mythical water serpent, that serves as the guardian of the entrance. The \"Naga\" was widely known in Southeast Asia before Buddhism arrived. They would symbolize the Hindu god Shiva in which they represented destruction and renewal. How they relate to the Buddha lies in the story of Siddhartha under the Bodhi tree.\n\nThis could be the second area one would pass from less secular ground to completely sacred ground. Though \"Nagas\" are usually seen with multiple heads. Wat Ong Teu’s version of the \"Naga\" has a single head with a its bright green body stretched out. There are three sets of \"Nagas\" that all give access to the same patio-type area in front the temple. This aspect is interesting because there is only one door that gives an entrance into the temple. It may be a reference to the original function of this \"wat\" as the king’s temple, with the front stairs only being walked on by the king while the others were reserved for normal patrons. The posts perpendicular to these \"Naga\" resemble the sort of pagoda or tower one would see in Laos.\n\nThe doors and windows are made of wood and are decorated with many leaves and stems that spiral sporadically. These images are all carved, painted red and gilded to make the door and windows look as if they were made of metal. Each of the windows and the door have different images of the Buddha either directly or by aniconic representation. Some of them may evidently portray a \"Jataka\", or story given of one of the Buddha’s past incarnations.\n\nSeemingly the most intricate part of the exterior of Wat Ong Teu is its roof. It illustrates myriad styles from around Asia that blend in an extraordinarily harmonious way. \n\nA commonly used feature in Asia is for a curved roof. This non-linear approach was originated by the Chinese. In China, architects thought that evil spirits despised curved lines, therefore giving an apotropaic effect to the temple. Lao ideas of the curved roof should have been similar to China’s as well. This aspect is especially important when the principal function of this temple is to teach the Buddhist religion. Students learning the Buddhism should especially be protected from the evils of the outside world.\n\nAn interesting feature is the multiple roofs that descend past the boundaries of the wall at a slope. This aspect is exclusive to Laos. Specifically, there are three or four superimposed roofs, with the two bottom roofs being supported by columns from within the temple. The reason for this intricate design is unknown, but it may be another aspect of protection because multiple roofs could cause confusion among evil spirits.\n\nThe stone spire decoration with stacked, superimposed, decreasingly sized disks in the center of the keel is definitively a Buddhist element. It is known that before the Buddha went through enlightenment, he was always covered by parasols to indicate his status as a prince. Therefore, it is not unusual to see a parasol-like spire atop this temple. The other flame-like decorations, called chaw faa (sky clusters), lining the edges and vertices of the roof are frequently used in Laos. This may be another quality that emphasizes the apotropaic effect of the roof.\n\nThe exterior may have much detail that is used for protection and attraction, but the interior does not mirror the same intricacy. In the temple, the floors are glossed and the walls and ceiling are painted with the same colors as the exterior. There is a red mat that is lined perfectly from the middle to the back of the \"sim\" where the \"Phra Ong Teu\" image resides. The most intricate objects in the temple are the columns that hold up the roof. They may have been made to look like oversize lotus flowers that have grown from the ground to support the roof of the temple. This may illustrate the natural world for which the Buddha would have liked to teach his followers.\n\nOnce Laos became a French protectorate and reconstruction began, there may have been many liberties made to some of the minute details of the temple, but most of the essential attributes of the temple remain similar to the original construction. A very important change is in the stone and well-kept wood that fortifies the structure of the temple. The brackets are included in this use of preserved timber. There brackets on the outside and the inside. However, the columns are the objects that provide the most support for the three- or four-tiered roofs, so they are treated with more care than the brackets. Therefore, in essence, the modern approach is more of a post-and-lintel technique rather than the use of brackets. The lack of non-perishable material before French rule over Laos is indicative of their weak government.\n\nSome details (that are usually seen in developed countries in Europe and North America) include small, hanging chandeliers as well as fans placed on each column that lines the \"sim\". These simple touches seem to emit a waning of sacredness for which the temple was originally created, but it may not be complete departure from belief.\n\nMost of the modern techniques may have been meant for the surrounding complex rather than the monastery itself. The central theme of all these buildings and towers remain faithful to that of Wat Ong Teu.\n\nThese original sculptures reside in the sim of the temple toward the furthest wall from the entrance. The \"Phra Ong Teu\" is made of a mix of metals, predominately bronze, and is seated atop a golden pedestal that was cast separately. The head may have been cast separately from the body and put together by the ‘tonged and grooved joint techniques’ showing the skill of Lao craftsmanship. The two standing Buddhas are connected to their respective platforms. These sculptures are raised on top of a platform with a color scheme similar to the rest of the temple.\n\nMore recently, these sculptures are draped in linen or silk cloth, depicting the saffron clothing monks usually wear in Laos, with neon-colored halos placed on the wall behind them. This may add an artistic effect to the Buddhas so that a more prestigious role can be emphasized. However, Lao artists of this time never thought of these or other Buddha images as art, only as a means to ‘educate and enlighten.’ Therefore, later use of this temple as a place for further learning of the Hinayana Buddhism would be the exact purpose the artists intended.\n\nIt is usual to see the Enlightened One alone or accompanied by bodhisattvas in a triad, but here all three of these sculptures depict the \"Phra Ong Teu\" Buddha. A strong indication that these sculptures are Buddhas is the parasols that are suspended over them. The smaller Buddhas each have a parasol above them that is attached to a post protruding from behind them. The main Buddha has a distinctively rectangular parasol that is fastened to the ceiling. These parasols act in the same way as the parasol on the keel of the \"wat\", but the parasols that hang over the Buddhas are more decorative. The rectangular parasol hanging over the \"Phra Ong Teu\" is more of a Japanese trait than anything Laos. The only record of any Japanese interaction with Laos would be during a five-year period in WWII. The only action caused by them was the nationalistic passion that the Lao people had in opposition to them. Not enough time was put into having any influence on their art of this Buddha or the temple that it is in.\n\nThere are many other features of \"Phra Ong Teu\" Buddha that are common in relation to the codified Buddha, but it still has its Lao differences. The earliest image of the Buddha in Laos was influenced by the ‘Pha Bang Khmer style’ but started to become more distinctive in the 16th century along with the golden age. For example, the tightly curled hair that is displayed on the main Buddha is strongly reminiscent of the Gandhara style of India during the Gupta period, which is mirrored by the \"Pha Bang\". However, the pointed swelling coming out of the top of the image’s head, signifying ‘transcendent knowledge,’ expresses an exclusively Lao idea. This type of swell may be a facet solely of the \"Phra Ong Teu\" image that King Setthathirat created. Some other modified aspects of the image are the sharp ear rims with long lobes, the equal, extended length of the fingers and toes, and the sharp wide nose.\n\nThere are a few \"mudras\", or hand gestures, that these Buddhas portray. These gestures illustrate the Indian influence. Both of the smaller standing Buddhas have their hands up with palms facing outward, meaning fearlessness. The \"Phra Ong Teu\" Buddha instead adopts two mudras that allude to the moments just before Siddhartha’s Enlightenment. Specifically, the left hand is placed in the lap with the palm facing up toward the face which represents the idea of meditation. The greater gesture that captures the Enlightenment comes from his right hand. His hand is rested over his knee with fingers extended toward the earth. This symbolizes the calling of the Earth to protect the Buddha from \"Mara\", India’s interpretation of the devil. This can then be connected to the \"Naga\" that was conjured up to help Siddhartha in his path for Enlightenment. In creating this image, King Setthathirat I proved his adherence to the Theravada Buddhism that has always been present in Laos since Lan Xang.\n\nOf the many temples in Vientiane, Laos today, Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan is one of the more undervalued ones. Every detail that makes up the composition of this monastery has some sort of allusion to the teachings or image of the Buddha. From the \"Nagas\" guarding the entrance to the fastidiously heavy Buddha at the back of the \"sim\" in the temple, from the carved windows and doors to the lotus columns supporting the roof, Wat Ong Teu is a complete illustration of the story of Siddhartha meditating under the Bodhi tree. No area of the temple is left untouched which results in a sense of sacred ground. \n\nThough it may not be an international symbol, Wat Ong Teu is more widely known as an educational institute that provides widespread teaching of the Theravada Buddhism that originated in India. That belief hasn’t meandered to this day. As a center for learning, Wat Ong Teu continues to house the teachings of the beginning of Buddhism straight from the Buddha, though the two parties live centuries apart.\n\nWith respect to Laos, education of this religion is what allowed France to be interested in them even though France’s main focus was Vietnam. From to the French came Lao nationalism in opposition to the Japanese. All of this sparked from monasteries in Laos, Wat Ong Teu included.\n\n"}
{"id": "8233397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8233397", "title": "Woman of the Apocalypse", "text": "Woman of the Apocalypse\n\nThe Woman of the Apocalypse (or Woman clothed in the Sun, ; \"\") is a figure described in Chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation (written c. AD 95).\n\nThe woman gives birth to a male child who is threatened by a dragon, identified as the Devil and Satan, who intends to devour the child as soon as he is born. When the child is taken to heaven, the woman flees into the wilderness leading to a \"War in Heaven\" in which the angels cast out the dragon. The dragon attacks the woman, who is given wings to escape, and then attacks her again with a flood of water from his mouth, which is subsequently swallowed by the earth. Frustrated, the dragon initiates war on \"the remnant of her seed\", identified as the righteous followers of Christ.\n\nThe Woman of the Apocalypse is widely identified as the Virgin Mary. This interpretation is held by the ancient Church as well as in the medieval and modern Roman Catholic Church. This view does not negate the alternative interpretation of the Woman representing the Church, as in modern Catholic dogma, Mary is herself considered both the Mother of God and the Mother of the Church. Some Catholic commentaries, such as Thomas Haydock's Catholic Bible Commentary (1859), allow for the interpretation of the woman as either the Church or Mary. The commentary of the New American Bible (the official Roman Catholic Bible for America) states that \"The woman adorned with the sun, the moon, and the stars (images taken from Genesis 37:9–10) symbolizes God’s people in the Old and the New Testament. The Israel of old gave birth to the Messiah (Rev 12:5) and then became the new Israel, the church, which suffers persecution by the dragon (Rev 12:6, 13–17); cf. Is 50:1; 66:7; Jer 50:12.\"\n\nIn Reformed theology and traditions which are averse to Marian veneration, the interpretation of the Woman represents the church.\n\nThe text describes \"a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars\" (12:1).\nThe woman is pregnant and about to give birth, \"travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered\" (12:2).\n\nThen there is \"a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads\" (12:3) who is about to \"devour her child as soon as it was born\" (12:4). But her child is \"caught up unto God\" (12:5), and the woman herself is \"fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.\" (12:6)\n\nThen there is a description of \"War in Heaven\" of the angels against the dragon, and \"the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\" (12:9)\n\nThe woman is again mentioned in 12:13, as she is persecuted by the dragon, and \"two wings of a great eagle\" are given to her to escape (12:14).\nThe dragon attacks her by \"water as a flood\" emerging from his mouth (12:15), but the flood is swallowed up by the earth (12:16), so the dragon went \"to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ\" (12:17).\n\nAncient witnesses to the Marian interpretation include St. Epiphanius, Tychonius (who heavily influenced St. Augustine), the unknown author of the History of Joseph the Carpenter, Quodvultdeus (a disciple of St. Augustine), Cassiodorus (Complexiones in Apocalypsi, written c. 570 AD), and the Greek Fathers Andreas of Caesarea (late 6th c. / early 7th c.) and Oikoumenios (6th c.).\n\nIn modern times, the Marian interpretation has been affirmed by Pope Pius X,\nPope Pius XII,\nPope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe woman's \"male child\" is a reference to Jesus (Revelation 12:5), since he is destined to \"rule all nations with a rod of iron\" (Revelation 12:5). The dragon trying to devour the woman's child at the moment of his birth (Revelation 12:4) is a reference to Herod the Great's attempt to kill the infant Jesus (Matthew 2:16). Through his death and resurrection and Ascension, Jesus \"was snatched up to God and to his throne\" (Revelation 12:5).\n\nIn the interpretation of Pius X (1904), the birth is not that of Jesus but \"surely ours,\" (i.e. the Church Militant) \"we who, being yet detained in exile, are still to be brought forth to the perfect love of God and eternal happiness\". Pius XII (1950) makes explicit the reference to the Assumption of Mary.\nAnd John Paul II (1987) to the Protoevangelium interpretation of Genesis 3:15, and by extension the symbolic identification of the Woman with both Mary and Eve.\n\nFor an assessment of the logical and theological reasons for identifying the Woman of Revelation 12 with Mary Mother of God, see , \"Raised to Heaven because Co-Redemptrix on Earth. Thoughts on the Foundation of the Catholic Dogma\" (2012) and D'Argon J-L, \"The Apocalypse\" in The Jerome Biblical Commentary (1968).\n\nBoth Marian veneration and the interpretation of the Woman of the Apocalypse are recorded since at least the 4th century, but the specific veneration of Mary in this form becomes tangible only in the medieval period. Iconographically, Marian figures associated with the Revelations narrative are recognizable by the astronomical attributes, specifically her standing on a crescent moon, and the crown of twelve stars (while the description \"clothed with the sun\" is sometimes rendered by rays emanating from her figure).\n\nAssociation of Mary with a single star is recorded from the early medieval period, in the hymn \"Ave Maris Stella\".\n\nMany depictions of Mary from the Gothic period (14th to 16th century) show her standing on a crescent moon inspired by the association of Mary with the woman of the Apocalypse. The motif became so popular in 15th-century Germany that pre-existing Madonna figures were refitted with a crescent (e.g. Madonna of Bad Doberan, c. 1300, refitted in the 15th century).\nThe Virgin of Guadalupe was depicted as the Madonna of the Apocalypse since at least the 16th century.\n\nThe Madonna of the Apocalypse became associated with Our Lady of the Rosary, the \"crown of twelve stars\" being identified with a \"rosary of twelve privileges\" of Mary. The Virgin of the Rosary is frequently shown with the crown or halo of twelve stars (but not the crescent moon) in modern depictions (since the 19th century). A notable example is the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei.\n\nAn anecdote (first published in the 1980s) connects the design of the Flag of Europe (1955) to this aspect of Marian iconography.\n\nCommentators who adhere to Reformed Theology in their eschatology sometimes identify the woman as the Church, and the man-child she gives birth to are the saints. According to this interpretation, Revelation 12:17 describes the remnant of the seed of the woman as those who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. The offspring of the Woman, the Woman's seed, then refers to the saints. The man child \"who shall rule the nations with a rod of iron\" is a symbol of the faithful members of the Church.\n\nIn Revelation 2:18-29, the Church in Thyatira is promised that the faithful shall rule the nations with a rod of iron. In Revelation 19:15 the same thing is stated of Jesus. In Galatians 4:26, Paul the Apostle refers to the \"New Jerusalem\" as \"our mother\", and in Revelation 21:2 and Ephesians 5:21-32 the New Jerusalem and the Church is portrayed as the Bride of Christ.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church has traditionally identified itself as the end-time \"remnant church\" described in Revelation 12:17.\n\nThe Catholic Church recognizes the 'woman' as part of the polyvalent symbolism that is found in the book in four referents: Israel, the Church, Eve, and Mary.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also interprets the woman to be the Church, and the man-child to be the political kingdom that will grow out of the Church prior to or during the Second Coming of Christ; this interpretation arises from Joseph Smith's translation of the twelfth chapter of Revelation. Some in the church interpret the woman to be a symbol of the earth. Baptisms of fire and water being poured upon the earth and the sun clothing the earth daily are just a couple examples of this reference.\n\nDispensational Premillennialists, and Amillennialists who believe in multiple valid interpretations will often identify the woman as the nation of Israel. There are several reasons given to support this interpretation. The woman is said to be clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and twelve stars. These symbols are drawn from Genesis 37:9–11, in which Joseph has a dream of the sun and moon symbolizing his father and mother, and stars representing his eleven brothers, which bow down to him. The Old Testament's prophets referred to Israel as a \"woman\" (Isaiah 54:5-6; Jeremiah 4:31; Micah 4:9-10).\n\nThe woman flees into the wilderness where she is nourished for 1260 days, the equivalent of three and a half years or forty-two months (cf. Rev. 11:1-3). According to this interpretation, these terms are used prophetically in Scripture either for the first half or the last half of the \"Seventieth Week of Daniel,\" in Daniel 9:24-27, a prophecy specifically addressed to Daniel and his people, Israel (Dan. 9:24).\n\nIn the latter part of the seventieth week, a remnant of Israel will flee into the wilderness to escape the persecution of Antichrist, who is called \"the son of destruction,\" \"the lawless one,\" and \"whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan\" (2 Thess. 2:1-12; cf. Rev. 12:4,9). Jesus, in the Olivet discourse, warned the people of this time which would occur just prior to His return to set up His earthly, Millennial kingdom (Matt. 24:15-22). Further, the archangel Michael is called the guardian over the sons of Israel in Dan. 12:1. And he will arise at that time of national Israel's tribulation (Dan. 12:1; cf. Rev. 12:7).\n\nAmillennialist belief can also interpret this passage as the nation of Israel, however this belief as expressed by amillennialists refers, not to the modern Israel, but to the Ancient religious state of Israel(Judea) as it existed in the time of Christ. The Child is Christ, born into the then existing state of Israel, and of Israel's lineage.\n\nThe remnant or sons of Israel is, in this understanding, the followers of Christ, the followers of the true religion of Israel as it exists after the coming of the messiah. The \"Seventieth Week of Daniel,\" and prophecy of the Olivet discourse, in this belief, are ascribed as concerning the first coming of Christ, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D(During which enforced emperor worship occurred in the temple of Jerusalem, which was later almost totally destroyed, and many Jews were made slaves in distant lands resulting presumably in their remaining families not knowing what happened to them or where they were), and the establishment of Christ's Church, as it currently exists, both on earth and in heaven.\n\nLutheran scholar Craig Koester, for example, says, \"The woman encompasses the story of Israel, from whom the Messiah was born, as well as the story of the church, which was persecuted after Jesus' death and resurrection... John's visionary account of the threat against the woman and the woman's preservation uses imagery that encompasses many moments in the story of God's people. This allows the story to apply to people in many times and places.\"\n\nRussian Orthodox theologian Sergei Bulgakov (1871–1944) in his interpretation of Revelation notes of the astronomical attributes of the woman in Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Egyptian mythologies. He takes the crown of twelve stars as representing the Zodiac. In his interpretation, astronomical attributes of a pagan goddess are here \"translated into the language of Christian theology and assume the new symbolism\n\nIn Joseph Smith's Inspired Translation of the King James Bible the woman is identified as \"the church of God\".\n\n\"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore years. And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought against Michael; And the dragon prevailed not against Michael, neither the child, nor the woman which was the church of God, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ. (Revelation 12:1-17 JST)\n\n\"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\" (1875), the foundational text of Christian Science, presents the woman in the Apocalypse as symbolizing \"generic man, the spiritual idea of God; she illustrates the coincidence of God and man as the divine Principle and divine idea...the spiritual idea of God's motherhood.\" The man child represents \"Christ, God's idea, [which] will eventually rule all nations and peoples - imperatively, absolutely, finally - with divine Science.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "70364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70364", "title": "Worship", "text": "Worship\n\nWorship is an act of religious devotion usually directed towards a deity. An act of worship may be performed individually, in an informal or formal group, or by a designated leader.\n\nThe word is derived from the Old English weorþscipe, meaning \"worship, honour shown to an object\", which has been etymologised as \"\"worthiness\" or \"worth-ship\"\"—to give, at its simplest, worth to something.\n\nWorship in Buddhism may take innumerable forms given the doctrine of skillful means. Worship is evident in Buddhism in such forms as: guru yoga, mandala, thanka, yantra yoga, the discipline of the fighting monks of Shaolin, panchamrita, mantra recitation, tea ceremony, ganacakra, amongst others. Buddhist Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. According to a spokesman of the Sasana Council of Burma, devotion to Buddhist spiritual practices inspires devotion to the Triple Gem. Most Buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations. In Buddhism, puja (Sanskrit & Pali: pūjā) are expressions of \"honour, worship and devotional attention.\" Acts of puja include bowing, making offerings and chanting. These devotional acts are generally performed daily at home (either in the morning or evening or both) as well as during communal festivals and Uposatha days at a temple.\n\nMeditation (samādhi) is a central form of worship in Buddhism. This practice is focused on the third step of the Eightfold Path that ultimately leads to self awakening, also known as enlightenment. Meditation promotes self-awareness and exploration of the mind and spirit. Traditionally, Buddhist meditation had combined samatha (the act of stopping and calming oneself) and vipasyana (seeing clearly within) to create a complete mind and body experience. By stopping one's everyday activities and focusing on something simple, the mind can open and expand enough to reach a spiritual level. By practicing the step of vipasyana, one does not achieve the final stage of awareness, but rather approaches one step closer. Mindful meditation teaches one to stop reacting quickly to thoughts and external objects that present themselves, but rather to peacefully hold the thought without immediately responding to it. Although in traditional Buddhist faith, enlightenment is the desired end goal of meditation, it is more of a cycle in a literal sense that helps individuals better understand their minds. For example, meditation leads to understanding, leading to kindness, leading to peace, etc.\n\nIn Christianity, a church service is a formalized period of communal worship, often but not exclusively occurring on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism. The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the \"Word of God\" (the Holy Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the \"church\" in \"church service\" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which it takes place. In Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God. In the New Testament various words are used for worship. The word proskuneo \"to worship\" means to bow down to Gods or kings.\n\nMass is the central act of divine worship in the Catholic Church, The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy. Roman Catholic devotions are \"external practices of piety\" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics. They do not become part of liturgical worship, even if conducted in a Catholic church, in a group, in the presence of a priest.\n\nAnglican devotions are private prayers and practices used by Anglican Christians to promote spiritual growth and communion with God. Among members of the Anglican Communion, private devotional habits vary widely, depending on personal preference and on their affiliation with low-church or high-church parishes.\n\nIn the New Testament various words are used for worship. The word \"proskuneo\" \"to worship\" means to bow down to gods or kings.\nRoman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Eastern Orthodoxy make a technical distinction between \"adoration\" or \"latria\" (Latin \"adoratio\", Greek \"latreia\", \"[λατρεία]\"), which is due to God alone, and \"veneration\" or \"dulia\" (Latin \"veneratio\", Greek \"douleia\" \"[δουλεία]\"), which may be lawfully offered to the saints. The external acts of veneration resemble those of worship, but differ in their object and intent. Protestant Christians, who reject the veneration of saints, question whether such a distinction is always maintained in actual devotional practice, especially at the level of folk religion.\n\nAccording to Mark Miravalle the English word \"worship\" is equivocal, in that it has been used in Catholic writing, at any rate, to denote both adoration/\"latria\" and veneration/\"dulia\", and in some cases even as a synonym for veneration as distinct from adoration:\nAs St. Thomas Aquinas explains, adoration, which is known as latria in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word \"adoration\" which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God—for example, when a husband says that he \"adores his wife\"—in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.\n\nVeneration, known as dulia in classical theology, is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based on achievement in excellence.\n\nWe must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term \"worship\" in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term \"worship\" as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between \"worship of adoration\" and \"worship of veneration.\" The word \"worship\" (in a similar way to how the liturgical term \"cult\" is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term \"worship\" not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.\nOrthodox Judaism and orthodox Sunni Islam hold that for all practical purposes veneration should be considered the same as prayer; Orthodox Judaism (arguably with the exception of some Chasidic practices), orthodox Sunni Islam, and most kinds of Protestantism forbid veneration of saints or angels, classifying these actions as akin to idolatry.\n\nSimilarly, Jehovah's Witnesses assert that many actions classified as patriotic by Protestant groups, such as saluting a flag, are equivalent to worship and are therefore considered idolatrous as well.\n\nWorship in Hinduism involves invoking higher forces to assist in spiritual and material progress and is simultaneously both a science and an art. A sense of \"bhakti\" or devotional love is generally invoked. This term is probably a central one in Hinduism. A direct translation from the Sanskrit to English is problematic. Worship takes a multitude of forms depending on community groups, geography and language. There is a flavour of loving and being in love with whatever object or focus of devotion. Worship is not confined to any place of worship, it also incorporates personal reflection, art forms and group. People usually perform worship to achieve some specific end or to integrate the body, the mind and the spirit in order to help the performer evolve into a higher being.\n\nIn Islam, worship refers to ritualistic devotion as well as actions done in accordance to Islamic law which is ordained by and pleasing to Allah (God). Worship is included in the Five Pillars of Islam, primarily that of \"salat\", which is the practice of ritual prayer five times daily.\n\nAccording to Muhammad Asad, on his notes in The Message of the Qur'an translation on 51:56,\nThus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition of the existence of Allah and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Quran describes as \"worship\". As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed \"need\" on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshipper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus closer to Allah Himself.\nWorship of God in Judaism is called \"Avodat Hashem\". During the period when the Temple stood, the rites conducted there were considered the most important act of Jewish worship. However, the most common form of worship was and remains that of prayer. Other forms of worship include the conduct of prescribed rituals, such as the Passover Seder and waving the Four Species, with proper intent, as well as various types of Jewish meditation.\n\nJewish sources also express the notion that one can perform any appropriate mundane activity as the worship of God. Examples would include returning a lost article and working to support oneself and one's family.\n\nThe Code of Jewish Law (Orach Chayim, Chapter 231) cites Proverbs (3:6), \"in all your ways, know him\" (Hebrew: בכל דרכיך דעהו (\"b'chol d'rachecha dei'eihu\")), as a biblical source for this idea.\n\nIn Sikhism, worship takes place after the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the work of the 10 Sikh Gurus all in one. Sikhs worship God and only one God, known as \"One Creator\", \"The Wonderful Teacher\" (Waheguru), or \"Destroyer of Darkness\".\n\nWiccan worship commonly takes place during a full moon or a new moon. Such rituals are called an Esbat and may involve a magic circle which practitioners believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection.\n\nIn modern society and sociology, some writers have commented on the ways that people no longer simply worship recognised deities, but also (or instead) worship consumer brands, sports teams, and other people (celebrities). Sociology therefore extends this argument to suggest that religion and worship is a process whereby society worships itself, as a form of self-valorization and self-preservation.\n\n"}
