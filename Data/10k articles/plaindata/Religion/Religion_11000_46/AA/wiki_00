The best-known defender of the argument from consciousness is J. P. Moreland.\n\nThe argument may be stated in inductive or deductive form\n\nGiven theism and naturalism as live options fixed by our background beliefs, theism provides a better explanation of consciousness than naturalism, and thus receives some confirmation from the existence of consciousness.\n\n\nTheists such as Robert Adams and Richard Swinburne have advanced slightly a different version of this argument which focuses on mental/physical correlations and not merely the existence of mental states.\n\nWilliam Lane Craig put the argument from consciousness as follows :\n\nThe first premise, assertion that non-physical mental states exist, implies a dualist view of mind. Therefore, one serious line of attack is to argue the case for physicalism about the human mind. Moreland takes the arguments for the first premise and refers to classic defenses of dualism. However, the first premise is rejected by many philosophers of mind. Frank Jackson, known for the knowledge argument in support of dualism about the mind, comments on the debate between physicalist and dualist conceptions of mind:\nIf one is willing to accept the first premise that reductive forms of physicalism are false, then the argument takes off. Thus, one could think of Moreland as making an argument that tries to move a person from \"rejecting physicalism\" to \"accepting theism\". The crucial step in this move is the fifth premise, which asserts that naturalism can not account for non-physical mental states. A simple critique of this premise is offered by Andrew Melnyk:\nHowever Moreland charges that such attempts to accommodate consciousness within an atheistic worldview are \"ad hoc\" and contrived and fail to take into account many features of conscious experience.\nMoreland spends much of the book defending this premise against philosophers, such as Michael Martin, who accept pluralist naturalism. He also critiques contemporary philosophers of mind such as John Searle, Timothy O' Connor, Colin McGinn, David Skriba, Philip Clayton and Jaegwon Kim, who attempt to account for consciousness.\n\nFinally, one can also question premise seven: why does a personal explanation have to lead to monotheistic (as opposed to deistic or polytheistic) accounts of intention? However, Moreland maintains that questioning these minor premises is of little consolation to the naturalist as they essentially constitute intramural theist debates, and that for most westerners theism is the only viable candidate to accommodate personal explanations. Similarly Occam's razor can be applied so only one personal agent is required.\n"}

Bahá'í topics may be minimized in favor of a general curriculum, often with an internationalist form, with accreditation from a variety of sources.\n\nForemost among them are Green Acre, the \"paradigmatic of a Bahá'í institution\", was founded in 1894 for exploring religious diversity seeking unity, and the first Bahá'ís appearing there in 1901. It came officially under Bahá'í management institutionally from 1916 after several years of promoting Bahá'í ideas under Sarah Farmer. As a Bahá'í institution it began to inspire other regional schools in the United States for the religion: first came Bosch Bahá'í School becoming more formally a Bahá'í school in 1927 and another in 1931 at Louhelen Bahá'í School.\n\nPrior to 1911 a private school for girls existed in Tehran which was opened by Iranian Bahá'í women. During the Persian Constitutional Revolution situations required the close of the school. The successor Tarbiyat-i Banat (Girls’ Education), established in 1911, was the most respected Baha’i girls’ school. Founded on the efforts of private school for girls by Bahá'ís, it was re-opened under the direction of an Iranian Bahá'í boys’ school committee and several American Bahá'í female pioneers. Even though it catered to the Iranian Bahá'í community, Tarbiyat attracted children from non-Bahá'í families, as the curriculum was largely secular.\n\nOther examples of Bahá'í schools include the Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute in Canada, the Townshend International School in the Czech Republic, or the New Era High School in India. Bahá'í membership is not required. In Iran, struggles with persecution of Bahá'ís have led to the development of a sophisticated University-like institution (such as the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education).\n\nIn recent decades a trend to multiply services of the community in neighbourhood children's classes has taken hold in Bahá'í communities at the urging of the Universal House of Justice. This is not meant to replace central schools but to provide spiritual education on a local basis. In some communities this has resulted in the closing of a central \"Sunday school\", while in others, both approaches are maintained. See Ruhi Institute.\n\nA Bahá'í-inspired school is a school run by an independent agency unaffiliated with any institution of the Bahá'í Faith but with explicit connections - such as having Bahá'ís in its administrative leadership or involved in the founding of the school. While these schools often focus on general ideas from Bahá'í teachings, , or Bahá'í administration, Bahá'í topics are minimized in favor of academic strength. Examples include Banani International Secondary School in Zambia; Townshend International School in the Czech Republic; Forel International School in Slovakia; School of the Nations in Macau; the Barli Development Institute for Rural Women in India; and the now-defunct Maxwell International School in Canada.\n\n\n"}

The history of the caves can be traced back to the Satavahana period in the 1st century BCE. They are some 9 km from the Bhaja Caves.\n\nThere are two main caves. The best known cave is the \"chaitya\" (prayer hall - Cave 7) with a comparatively large stupa, the other cave is the monastery or vihara (Cave 11). They are marked by a profusion of decorative gavaksha or chaitya arch motifs. \n\nCave 7, the chaitya hall, is reached by a long narrow passage into the rock. The front verandah has four very elaborate columns with capitals of pairs of animals and riders of \"solemn grandeur\". Beside these the side walls are covered with low-relief gavakshas and latticework representing architectural railings, comparable to those in the same place at the slightly later chaitya in the Karla Caves. In contrast, and unlike Karla, the chaitya hall itself has little decoration, with plain octagonal columns. The decorative ribs on the roof, which in other chaityas are stone replicating wooden architecture, were actual wood here, and have been lost. \n\nAn inscription on one of the gate arches reads: \"Gift of Pushyanka, son of Ananda Sethi from Nashik\".\n\nThe vihara at Cave 11 has a rather unusual form, with a main chamber shaped somewhat like a chaitya, with a rectangular plan with a rounded apsidal far end, and a vaulted roof. This is now open to the outside, but presumably originally had a wooden screen. Around the chamber are nine doors to cells, each with a relief chaitya-arch surround. Friezes with railing patterns run round the room at two levels. There are four further cells outside where the screen would have been.\n\nThere is also a small stupa outside to the right of the main caves. Until around 1861 the caves were regularly maintained - even painted. These works were ordered by local authorities in order to please British officers who often visited caves. This has caused loss of the remnants of plaster with murals on it.\n\nBoth caves face eastwards so it is recommended to visit the caves in the early morning, as in sunlight the beauty of carvings is enhanced. \n\nBedse Caves can be reached from Pune via Kamshet. Upon reaching Kamshet Chowk, left route is to be taken. That route goes straight to Bedse Village where the caves are located. They can also be reached via Paud - Tikona Peth - Pawananagar. Alternate route is from Somatne-Phata on the Pune-Mumbai NH4 Highway.\n\nBedse Caves are comparatively less known and less visited. People know about the nearby Karla Caves and Bhaja Caves but have hardly heard of Bedse Caves. The trilogy of the caves (Karla - Bhaje - Bedse) in Mawal Region can't be completed without Bedse. An easy hike through 400 steps leads to the caves. Also close to the Bedse caves are the famous foursome of Lohagad, Visapur, Tung and Tikona forts adjoining the Pawana Dam.\n\nThe best time to visit Bedse Caves is the rainy season as the hills are filled with lush greenery during that time. Also many small waterfalls are created that can only be enjoyed during the rainy season. As this is one of the lesser known spots, not many tourists throng the place, so makes it easy to enjoy the views.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at the Boys Grammar School of Pärnu, Estonia. Later he studied at the Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nIn 1912, he immigrated to Glasgow, where he gained an engineering diploma from the Royal Technical College. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing office of John Brown and Company, a Clydebank shipbuilders, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art.\n\nSchotz became a full-time sculptor in 1923. An important early patron was the Dundee art collector William Boyd, thanks to whose influence both Dundee Dental School and Dundee Art Galleries & Museums hold pieces by him. From this point onwards his reputation grew and he became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art (a post he held from 1938 until his retirement in 1961), and eventually was appointed the Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland in 1963. His pupils included the artists Hannah Frank, Stewart Bowman Johnson, and Inge King (née Neufeld).\n\nHis homes at West Campbell Street and later Kirklee Road were a focus for meetings of artists, writers, actors, and politicians. He was also a member of Glasgow Art Club. He also helped refugees such as Jankel Adler and Josef Herman.\n\nHe was a committed Zionist, and also proud of his adopted Scotland. He worked until a few weeks before his death at the age of 93. He was buried in Jerusalem.\n\nHe was made a Freeman of the City of Glasgow in 1981. In that same year, Gordon Wright published his autobiography, \"Bronze in My Blood\".\n\nDuring his career, Schotz produced several hundred portraits and compositions including figure compositions, religious sculptures, semi-abstracts and modelled portraits. His bust of James Maxton is on public display at the Maxton remembrance garden in Barrhead near Paisley. Other publicly accessible work includes:\n\nThe majority of these works were all in Glasgow and the surrounding area. He was responsible for the repair on the bridge sculpture at Kelvingrove Park beside the now refurbished art gallery and museum.\n\nAlthough Benno Schotz is frequently referred to as an Estonian sculptor, all his professional life was in Scotland. He became a naturalised British subject in 1930.\nHe became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1937. He headed the Sculpture and Ceramics dept. of the Glasgow School of Art from 1938 until his retirement in 1960. His active life as a sculptor continued thereafter with renewed vigor and he created his most ambitious and monumental works over the next 20 years. \nIn 1963, he was appointed The Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland, a member of the Royal household. \nA major retrospective exhibition of his works (1971) was held at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh.\nHis interest in the drawing of trees developed, the drawings becoming more and more complex and abstract. He mounted a successful exhibition of Sculptures and Related Drawings in Glasgow (1961). His last sculpture was executed less than six weeks before his death, aged 93.\nHe was Life-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.\nHonors include: Freedom of the City of Glasgow; Honorary Fellow of The Hebrew University; Honorary LL.D, Strathclyde University; Honorary Member of the British Society of British Sculptors; Honorary Member of the Royal Institute of Architects in Scotland.\nSource: his daughter, Mrs. S.C.

{"id": "4559718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4559718", "title": "Catholicity", "text": "Catholicity\n\nCatholicity (from Greek , \"catholicity of the church\") or catholicism (from Greek , \"universal doctrine\") is a concept that encompasses the beliefs and practices of numerous Christian denominations, most notably those that describe themselves as \"Catholic\" in accordance with the Four Marks of the Church, as expressed in the Nicene Creed of the First Council of Constantinople in 381: \"\"[I believe] in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church\".\"\n\nWhile \"catholicism\" is most commonly associated with the faith and practices of the Catholic Church led by the Pope in Rome, the traits of catholicity, and thus the term \"catholic\", are also claimed and possessed by other denominations such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Church of the East. It also occurs in Lutheranism, Anglicanism, as well as Independent Catholicism and other Christian denominations. While traits used to define catholicity, as well as recognition of these traits in other denominations, vary among these groups, such attributes include formal sacraments, an episcopal polity, apostolic succession, highly structured liturgical worship, and other shared Ecclesiology. The Catholic Church is also known as the Roman Catholic Church; the term \"Roman Catholic\" is used especially in ecumenical contexts and in countries where other churches use the term \"Catholic\", to distinguish it from broader meanings of the term.\n\nAmong Protestant and related traditions, \"catholic\" is used in the sense of indicating a self-understanding of continuity of continuity of faith and practice from Early Christianity as delineated in the Nicene Creed. Among Methodist, Lutheran, Moravian, and Reformed denominations the term \"catholic\" is used in the in claiming to be \"heirs of the apostolic faith\". These denominations consider themselves to be catholic, teaching that the term \"designates the historic, orthodox mainstream of Christianity whose doctrine was defined by the ecumenical councils and creeds\" and as such, most Reformers \"appealed to this catholic tradition and believed they were in continuity with it.\"\n\n\"catholicity\" and \"catholicism\" are used in two basic forms, with capital \"C\" or just with small \"c\". When used with small \"c\", terms \"catholicity\" and \"catholicism on the personal views and theological positions of any particular author.\n\nA common belief related to catholicity is institutional continuity with the early Christian church founded by Jesus Christ. Many churches or communions of churches identify singularly or collectively as the authentic church. The following summarizes the major schisms and conflicts within Christianity, particularly within groups that identify as Catholic; there are several competing historical interpretations as to which groups entered into schism with the original early church.\n\nAccording to the theory of Pentarchy, the early undivided church came to be organized under the three patriarchs of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch, to which later were added the patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem. The Bishop of Rome was at that time recognized as first among them, as is stated, for instance, in canon 3 of the First Council of Constantinople (381)—many interpret \"first\" as meaning here first among equals—and doctrinal or procedural disputes were often referred to Rome, as when, on appeal by Athanasius against the decision of the Council of Tyre (335), Pope Julius I, who spoke of such appeals as customary, annulled the action of that council and restored Athanasius and Marcellus of Ancyra to their sees. The Bishop of Rome was also considered to have the right to convene ecumenical councils. When the Imperial capital moved to Constantinople, Rome's influence was sometimes challenged. Nonetheless, Rome claimed special authority because of its connection to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who, all agreed, were martyred and buried in Rome, and because the Bishop of Rome saw himself as the successor of Saint Peter.\n\nThe 431 Council of Ephesus, the third ecumenical council, was chiefly concerned with Nestorianism, which emphasized the distinction between the humanity and divinity of Jesus and taught that, in giving birth to Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary could not be spoken of as giving birth to God. This Council rejected Nestorianism and affirmed that, as humanity and divinity are inseparable in the one person of Jesus Christ, his mother, the Virgin Mary, is thus Theotokos, God-bearer, Mother of God. The first great rupture in the Church followed this Council. Those who refused to accept the Council's ruling were largely Persian and are represented today by the Assyrian Church of the East and related Churches, which, however, do not now hold a \"Nestorian\" theology. They are often called Ancient Oriental Churches.\n\nThe next major break was after the Council of Chalcedon (451). This Council repudiated Eutychian Monophysitism which stated that the divine nature completely subsumed the human nature in Christ. This Council declared that Christ, though one person, exhibited two natures \"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation\" and thus is both fully God and fully human. The Alexandrian Church rejected the terms adopted by this Council, and the Christian Churches that follow the tradition of non-acceptance of the Council—they are not Monophysite in doctrine—are referred to as Pre-Chalcedonian or Oriental Orthodox Churches.\n\nThe next great rift within Christianity was in the 11th century. Longstanding doctrinal disputes, as well as conflicts between methods of Church government, and the evolution of separate rites and practices, precipitated a split in 1054 that divided the Church, this time between a \"West\" and an \"East\". Spain, England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Poland, Bohemia, Slovakia, Scandinavia, the Baltic states, and Western Europe in general were in the Western camp, and Greece, Romania, Russia and many other Slavic lands, Anatolia, and the Christians in Syria and Egypt who accepted the Council of Chalcedon made up the Eastern camp. This division between the Western Church and the Eastern Church is called the East–West Schism.\n\nIn 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Several eastern churches reunited, constituting some of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\n\nAnother major division in the Church occurred in the 16th century with the Protestant Reformation, after which many parts of the Western Church rejected Papal authority, and some of the teachings of the Western Church at that time, and became known as \"Reformed\" or \"Protestant\".\n\nA much less extensive rupture occurred when, after the Roman Catholic Church's First Vatican Council, in which it officially proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility, small clusters of Catholics in the Netherlands and in German-speaking countries formed the Old-Catholic (Altkatholische) Church.\n\nUse of the terms \"catholicity\" and \"catholicism\" depends on context. For times preceding the Great Schism, it refers to the Nicene Creed and especially to tenets of Christology, i.e. the rejection of Arianism.\nFor times after the Great Schism, Catholicism (with the capital C) in the sense of the Catholic Church, combines the Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches of Greek tradition, and the other Eastern Catholic Churches. \nLiturgical and canonical practices vary between all these particular Churches constituting the Roman and Eastern Catholic Churches (or, as Richard McBrien calls them, the \"Communion of Catholic Churches\").\nContrast this with the term Catholicos (but not \"Catholicism\") in reference to the head of a Particular Church in Eastern Christianity.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the term \"catholic\" is understood as to cover those who are baptized and in communion with the Pope.\n\nOther Christians use it in an intermediate sense, neither just those Christians in communion with Rome, but more narrow than all Christians who recite the Creeds. They use it to distinguish their position from a Calvinistic or Puritan form of Protestantism. It is then meaningful to attempt to draw up a list of common characteristic beliefs and practices of this definition of catholicity:\n\n\nChurches in the Catholic tradition administer seven sacraments or \"sacred mysteries\": Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist, Penance, also known as Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. In some Catholic churches this number is regarded as a convention only.\n\nIn churches that consider themselves catholic, a sacrament is considered to be an efficacious visible sign of God's invisible grace. While the word \"mystery\" is used not only of these rites, but also with other meanings with reference to revelations of and about God and to God's mystical interaction with creation, the word \"sacrament\" (Latin: \"a solemn pledge\"), the usual term in the West, refers specifically to these rites.\n\n\nMany individual Christians and Christian denominations consider themselves \"catholic\" on the basis, in particular, of apostolic succession. They may be described as falling into five groups:\n\nFor some confessions listed under category 3, the self-affirmation refers to the belief in the ultimate unity of the universal church under one God and one Savior, rather than in one visibly unified institution (as with category 1, above). In this usage, \"catholic\" is sometimes written with a lower-case \"c\". The Western Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, stating \"I believe in ... one holy catholic ... church\", are recited in worship services. Among some denominations in category 3, \"Christian\" is substituted for \"catholic\" in order to denote the doctrine that the Christian Church is, at least ideally, undivided.\n\nProtestant Churches each have their own distinctive theological and ecclesiological notions of catholicity.\n\nIn its \"Letter on Some Aspects of the Church Understood as Communion\", the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stressed that the idea of the universal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning that \"every particular Church is a subject complete in itself, and that the universal church is the result of a \"reciprocal recognition\" on the part of the particular Churches\". It insisted that \"the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches\".\n\nThe Catholic Church considers only those in full communion with the Holy See in Rome as Catholics. While recognising the valid episcopates and Eucharist of the Eastern Orthodox Church in most cases, it does not consider Protestant denominations such as Lutheran ones to be genuine churches and so uses the term \"ecclesial communities\" to refer to them. Because the Catholic Church does not consider these denominations to have valid episcopal orders capable of celebrating a valid Eucharist, it is does not classify them as churches \"in the proper sense\".\n\nThe Catholic Church's doctrine of infallibility derives from the belief that the authority Jesus gave Peter as head of the church on earth has been passed on to his successors, the popes. Relevant Bible verses include ; \"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\"\nThe Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches together form the \"Catholic Church\", or \"Roman Catholic Church\", the world's second largest religious denomination after Sunni Islam, and the largest Christian denomination, as well as its largest Catholic church, comprising over half of all Christians (1.27 billion Christians of 2.1 billion) and nearly one-sixth of the world's population. Richard McBrien would put the proportion even higher, extending it to those who are in communion with the Bishop of Rome only in \"degrees\". It comprises 24 component \"particular Churches\" (also called \"rites\" in the Second Vatican Council's Decree on the Eastern Catholic Churches and in the Code of Canon Law), all of which acknowledge a primacy of jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome and are in full communion with the Holy See and each other.\n\nThese particular churches or component parts are the Latin Church (which uses a number of different liturgical rites, of which the Roman Rite is by far prevalent) and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. Of the latter particular churches, 14 use the Byzantine Rite for their liturgy. Within the universal Church, each \"particular church\", whether Eastern or Western, is of equal dignity. Finally, in its official documents, the Catholic Church, though made up of several particular churches, \"continues to refer to itself as the 'Catholic Church or, less frequently but consistently, as the 'Roman Catholic Church', owing to its essential link with the Bishop of Rome.\n\nMcBrien, in his book \"Catholicism\", disagrees with the synonymous use of \"Catholic\" and \"Roman Catholic\": But is 'Catholic' synonymous with 'Roman Catholic'? And is it accurate to refer to the Roman Catholic Church as simply the 'Roman Church'? The answer to both questions is no. The adjective 'Roman' applies more properly to the diocese, or see, of Rome than to the worldwide Communion of Catholic Churches that is in union with the Bishop of Rome. Indeed, it strikes some Catholics as contradictory to call the Church 'Catholic' and 'Roman' at one and the same time. Eastern-rite Catholics, of whom there are more than twenty million, also find the adjective 'Roman' objectionable. In addition to the Latin, or Roman, tradition, there are seven non-Latin, non-Roman ecclesial traditions: Armenian, Byzantine, Coptic, Ethiopian, East Syriac (Chaldean), West Syriac, and Maronite. Each to the Churches with these non-Latin traditions is as Catholic as the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, not all Catholics are Roman Catholic... [T]o be Catholic—whether Roman or non-Roman—in the ecclesiological sense is to be in full communion with the Bishop of Rome and as such to be an integral part of the Catholic Communion of Churches.\nMcBrien says that, on an official level, what he calls the \"Communion of Catholic Churches\" always refers to itself as \"The Catholic Church\". However, counter examples such as seen above of the term \"Roman Catholic Church\" being used by popes and departments of the Holy See exist. The Latin-rite Archdiocese of Detroit, for example, lists eight Eastern Catholic churches, each with its own bishop, as having one or more parishes in what is also the territory of the Latin archdiocese, yet each is designated as being in \"full communion with the Roman Church\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the position that it is their communion which actually constitutes the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. Eastern Orthodox Christians consider themselves the heirs of the first-millennium patriarchal structure that developed in the Eastern Church into the model of the pentarchy, recognized by Ecumenical Councils, a theory that \"continues to hold sway in official Greek circles to the present day\".\n\nSince the theological disputes that occurred from the 9th to 11th centuries, culminating in the final split of 1054, the Eastern Orthodox churches have regarded Rome as a schismatic see that has violated the essential catholicity of the Christian faith by introducing innovations of doctrine (see Filioque). On the other hand, the model of the pentarchy was never fully applied in the Western Church, which preferred the theory of the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome, favoring Ultramontanism over Conciliarism. The title \"Patriarch of the West\" was rarely used by the popes until the 16th and 17th centuries, and was included in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" from 1863 to 2005, being dropped in the following year as never very clear, and having become over history \"obsolete and practically unusable\".\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches (Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Malankaran) also maintain the position that their communion constitutes the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. In this sense, Oriental Orthodoxy upholds its own ancient ecclesiological traditions of apostolicity (apostolic continuity) and catholicity (universality) of the Church.\n\nSimilar notion of the catholicity was also maintained in the former Church of the East, with its distinctive theological and ecclesiological characteristics and traditions. That notion was inherited by both of its modern secessions: the Chaldean Catholic Church that is part of the Catholic Church, and the Assyrian Church of the East whose full official name is: \"The Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East\", along with its off-shot in turn the Ancient Church of the East whose full official name is: \"The Holy Apostolic Catholic Ancient Church Of the East\". These churches are using the term catholic in their names in the sense of traditional catholicity. They are not in communion with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\". When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have \"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils\".\n\nFollowing the Reformation, Lutheran Churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Church of Sweden, retained apostolic succession, with former Roman Catholic bishops simply becoming Lutheran and continuing to occupy their chairs. The 20th century movement of High Church Lutheranism championed Evangelical Catholicity, restoring, in some cases, apostolic succession, to Lutheran Churches in Germany where it was lacking.\n\nIntroductory works on Anglicanism, such as \"The Study of Anglicanism\", typically refer to the character of the Anglican tradition as \"Catholic and Reformed\", which is in keeping with the understanding of Anglicanism articulated in the Elizabethan Settlement of 1559 and in the works of the earliest standard Anglican divines such as Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes. Yet different strains in Anglicanism, dating back to the English Reformation, have emphasized either the Reformed, Catholic, or \"Reformed Catholic\" nature of the tradition.\n\nAnglican theology and ecclesiology has thus come to be typically expressed in three distinct, yet sometimes overlapping manifestations: Anglo-Catholicism (often called \"high church\"), Evangelical Anglicanism (often called \"low church\"), and Latitudinarianism (\"broad church\"), whose beliefs and practices fall somewhere between the two. Though all elements within the Anglican Communion recite the same creeds, Evangelical Anglicans generally regard the word \"catholic\" in the ideal sense given above. In contrast, Anglo-Catholics regard the communion as a component of the whole Catholic Church, in spiritual and historical union with the Roman Catholic, Old Catholic and several Eastern churches. Broad Church Anglicans tend to maintain a mediating view, or consider the matter one of \"adiaphora\". These Anglicans, for example, have agreed in the Porvoo Agreement to interchangeable ministries and full eucharistic communion with Lutherans.\n\nThe Catholic nature or strain of the Anglican tradition is expressed doctrinally, ecumenically (chiefly through organizations such as the Anglican—Roman Catholic International Commission), ecclesiologically (through its episcopal governance and maintenance of the historical episcopate), and in liturgy and piety. The 39 Articles hold that \"there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord\", and that \"those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel\"; some Anglo-Catholics interpret this to mean that there are a total of Seven Sacraments. Many Anglo-Catholics practice Marian devotion, recite the rosary and the angelus, practice eucharistic adoration, and seek the intercession of saints. In terms of liturgy, most Anglicans use candles on the altar or communion table and many churches use incense and bells at the Eucharist, which is amongst the most pronounced Anglo-Catholics referred to by the Latin-derived word \"Mass\" used in the first prayer book and in the American Prayer Book of 1979. In numerous churches the Eucharist is celebrated facing the altar (often with a tabernacle) by a priest assisted by a deacon and subdeacon. Anglicans believe in the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Anglo-Catholics interpret this to mean a corporeal presence, rather than a pneumatic presence. Different Eucharistic rites or orders contain different, if not necessarily contradictory, understandings of salvation. For this reason, no single strain or manifestation of Anglicanism can speak for the whole, even in ecumenical statements (as issued, for example, by the Anglican - Roman Catholic International Commission).\n\nThe growth of Anglo-Catholicism is strongly associated with the Oxford Movement of the 19th century. Two of its leading lights, John Henry Newman and Henry Edward Manning, both priests, ended up joining the Roman Catholic Church, becoming cardinals. Others, like John Keble, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and Charles Gore became influential figures in Anglicanism. The previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, is a patron of Affirming Catholicism, a more liberal movement within Catholic Anglicanism. Conservative Catholic groups also exist within the tradition, such as Forward in Faith. There are about 80 million Anglicans in the Anglican Communion, comprising 3.6% of global Christianity.\n\nThe 1932 Deed of Union of the Methodist Church of Great Britain teaches that:\n\nThe theologian Stanley Hauerwas wrote that Methodism \"stands centrally in the Catholic tradition\" and that \"Methodists indeed are even more Catholic than the Anglicans who gave us birth, since Wesley, of blessed memory, held to the Eastern fathers in a more determinative way than did any of the Western churches—Protestant or Catholic.\"\n\nWithin Reformed Christianity the word \"catholic\" is generally taken in the sense of \"universal\" and in this sense many leading Protestant denominations identify themselves as part of the catholic church. The puritan Westminster Confession of Faith adopted in 1646 (which remains the Confession of the Church of Scotland) states for example that:\n\nThe catholic or universal Church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of Him that fills all in all.\n\nThe London Confession of the Reformed Baptists repeats this with the emendation \"which (with respect to the internal work of the Spirit and truth of grace) may be called invisible\". The Church of Scotland's Articles Declaratory begin \"The Church of Scotland is part of the Holy Catholic or Universal Church\".\n\nIn Reformed Churches there is a Scoto-Catholic grouping within the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Such groups point to their churches' continuing adherence to the \"Catholic\" doctrine of the early Church Councils. The Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland of 1921 defines that church legally as \"part of the Holy Catholic or Universal Church\".\n\nThe Old Catholics, the Liberal Catholic Church, the Augustana Catholic Church, the American National Catholic Church, the Apostolic Catholic Church (ACC), the Aglipayans (Philippine Independent Church), the African Orthodox Church, the Polish National Catholic Church of America, and many Independent Catholic churches, which emerged directly or indirectly from and have beliefs and practices largely similar to Latin Rite Catholicism, regard themselves as \"Catholic\" without full communion with the Bishop of Rome, whose claimed status and authority they generally reject. The Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, a division of the People's Republic of China's Religious Affairs Bureau exercising state supervision over mainland China's Catholics, holds a similar position, while attempting, as with Buddhism and Protestantism, to indoctrinate and mobilize for Communist Party objectives.\n\nRichard McBrien considers that the term \"Catholicism\" refers exclusively and specifically to that \"Communion of Catholic Churches\" in communion with the Bishop of Rome. According to McBrien, Catholicism is distinguished from other forms of Christianity in its particular understanding and commitment to tradition, the sacraments, the mediation between God, communion, and the See of Rome. According to Bishop Kallistos Ware, the Orthodox Church has these things as well, though the primacy of the See of Rome is only honorific, showing non-jurisdictional respect for the Bishop of Rome as the \"first among equals\" and \"Patriarch of the West\". Catholicism, according to McBrien's paradigm, includes a monastic life, religious institutes, a religious appreciation of the arts, a communal understanding of sin and redemption, and missionary activity.\n\nHenry Mills Alden, in \"Harper's New Monthly Magazine\", writes that:\n\nAs such, according to this viewpoint, \"for those who 'belong to the Church', the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic.\" \"It simply means that body of Christian believers over the world who agree in their religious views, and accept the same ecclesiastical forms.\"\n"}

{"id": "9123163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9123163", "title": "Dhammakaya meditation", "text": "Dhammakaya meditation\n\nDhammakaya meditation is a method of Buddhist meditation developed and taught by the Thai meditation teacher Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro (1885–1959). In Thailand, it is known as vijjā dhammakāya, which translates as 'knowledge of the body of truth'. It is the meditation tradition that is at the center of the Dhammakaya Movement. The Dhammakaya meditation method has become very popular in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and has been described as a revival of \"samatha\" (tranquility) meditation in Thailand.\n\nThe method was discovered by Luang Pu Sodh in the 1910s. Followers of the Dhammakaya Movement believe the method was the same as the original method the Buddha used to attain enlightenment. According to Luang Pu Sodh, the \"Dhammakāya\", the core concept of the tradition, can be found within every human being. The most important aspect of the meditation method is the focus on the center of the body. As of 2008, there was still scholarly debate as to the origins of Dhammakaya meditation. Scholars refer to the Yogavacara tradition as a possible source, or that the method might be new or partly new. Dhammakaya meditation is taught at several temples of the movement, and consists of a stage of \"samatha\" (tranquility) and \"vipassana\" (insight), following the structure of the Visuddhimagga, a standard fifth-century Theravāda guide about meditation. In the method, the stages are described in terms of inner bodies (), but also in terms of meditative absorptions ().\n\nDhammakaya meditation has been the subject of considerable discussion among Buddhists as to its authenticity and efficacy, and also has been the subject of several scientific studies.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th-century Thailand, public perception of the practice of Buddhism changed. Originally, Thai people saw meditation mostly as a personal and quite esoteric practice. In response to threats of colonial powers, the Thai kings and the reformed Dhammayut fraternity attempted to modernize Buddhism, and strip Buddhist practice of its ritualized and mystical appearance. In this process, meditation was devalued among monastics as study was more valued. Education in Buddhist doctrine was standardized and centralized, as local meditation lineages gradually died out. Meditation traditions responded by reforming their methods, and referring more to scripture in an attempt to establish orthodoxy and survive. Meditation became less esoteric, as temples were pressured to practice the uniform meditation practice considered orthodox.\n\nTemples that refer to Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro as their teacher have published several biographies about him. According to these biographies, the principles of Dhammakaya meditation were discovered by Luang Pu Sodh at Wat Botbon, in Nonthaburi Province on a full-moon night of the tenth lunar month, sometime in the 1910s. Though he had practised several other forms of meditation in Thailand with well-known meditation teachers, he felt he had not yet accomplished the enlightenment which the Buddha had experienced. That night, he decided to take a vow to meditate until he could at least accomplish some part of what the Buddha had once attained. He then experienced what followers consider a breakthrough in meditation.\n\nThis breakthrough is described in the biographies as a deeper meaning to the Middle Way, a teaching described in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, an early Buddhist discourse. This deeper meaning involves meditation technique. Essential in this process is the \"center of the body\", which Luang Por Sodh precisely describes as being at a point two finger widths above the navel of each person: whatever technique someone might use to meditate, the mind can only attain a higher level of insight through this center. This center is also believed to play a fundamental role in the birth and death of an individual. According to Luang Pu Sodh, the \"Dhammakaya\", the core concept of the tradition, can be found within every human being. It has the shape of a Buddha sitting within oneself. Followers of the Dhammakaya Movement believe that the Buddha became enlightened by using this method, and believe that knowledge of the method was lost five hundred years after the Buddha's death. Temples of the movement refer to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta or the Visuddhimagga among others for Dhammakaya meditation's theoretical foundations.\n\nSince the 2000s, scholars have brought forward new evidence that Luang Pu Sodh's approach may have roots in the Yogavacara tradition (also known as tantric Theravāda; not to be confused with the Yogacāra School in Mahāyāna Buddhism). During the revival and modernization of Thai Buddhism in the nineteenth and early twentieth century CE, Thai temples in the Mahānikāya fraternity were forced to adjust to new reforms, including the meditation method used and taught. In particular, leading monks in the Mahanikaya fraternity promoted the New Burmese method of U Nārada and Mahasi Sayadaw. The Dhammakaya meditation method managed to survive despite these pressures to reform. Therefore, Dhammakaya and \"Yogavacara\" meditation are both meditation forms that date back before these modernization efforts, and scholars have theorized that the two disciplines may share a common ancestry. This ancestry would be related to Wat Rajasittharam, the temple where Luang Pu Sodh used to practice before he went on to develop Dhammakaya meditation. An alternative theory suggests an origin in Tibetan or other forms of Mahāyāna Buddhism, but scholars C.S. Newell and Phibul Choompolpaisal believe a Yogavacara origin to be more likely. Newell notes that some aspects of Dhammakaya meditation cannot be found in Yogavacara practices, and theorizes that Dhammakaya meditation could have been \"grafted onto an existing, preparatory system of concentration\" and further developed. Theologian Rory Mackenzie does not draw any conclusions about the matter yet; he states that a Tibetan origin is unlikely, that a Yogavacara origin cannot yet be proven, and it is also \"quite possible\" that Luang Pu Sodh developed his approach through his own \"psychic experiences\".\n\nAfter discovering the method of Dhammakaya meditation, Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro first taught it to others at Wat Bangpla, in Nakhon Pathom Province. Luang Pu Sodh was given his first position as abbot at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, a temple that has been associated with Dhammakaya meditation ever since. Luang Pu Sodh devoted the remainder of his life to teaching Dhammakaya meditation. In 1931, he set up what he called a 'meditation workshop' () with meditation practitioners meditating in six-hour shifts throughout the day. According to a textbook of one temple, the meditation workshop was reserved for gifted practitioners able to practice Dhammakaya meditation on a higher level. The purpose of the workshop was to use meditation to study certain subjects, which included understanding the nature of the world and the universe, \"to learn the truth about the worlds and the galaxies\".\n\nSince Luang Pu Sodh's death in 1959, Dhammakaya meditation has been taught by his students at several major temples, including Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, Wat Phra Dhammakaya in Pathum Thani, Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram in Damnoen Saduak District, Ratchaburi Province, and Wat Rajorasaram in Bang Khun Thian District, Bangkok, as well as in branch centers of these temples across and outside of Thailand. Of these, Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram have published instructive books on Dhammakaya meditation in English. Both also offer training retreats for the public. The method has become very popular in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and has been described as a revival of \"samatha\" (tranquility) meditation in Thailand.\n\nAccording to Newell, Dhammakaya meditation is taught more or less the same by each temple. However, the emphasis differs, with some temples being more esoteric about the method than others. For example, Wat Luang Phor Sod Dhammakayaram is more specific about the higher stages of meditation in their publications than Wat Phra Dhammakaya, while Wat Phra Dhammakaya emphasizes the calm and concentration the method brings.\n\nDhammakaya meditation is also known as \"vijjā dhammakāya\", which translates as 'knowledge of the body of truth'.\n\nThere are several techniques which can be used by practitioners in focusing the attention on the center of the body. Practitioners may visualize a mental image at the center of the body–characteristically, a crystal ball or a crystal clear Buddha image. This has been compared with meditation on a bright object in the Visuddhimagga. Temples in the tradition often use crystal balls in meditation teaching, to the extent that the crystal ball has become a sacred symbol of the meditation tradition. Practitioners then visualize this image in front of themselves, and then move the mental image inwards through seven bases of the mind, that is:\nIn this context, the center of the body is often called the \"seventh base\". In the tradition, the other six bases have a minor role, as they only function as reference points for the visualization. In this respect, the tradition's approach differs from the extensive symbolism of the \"cakras\" as found in Tibetan Tantric tradition, for example.\n\nAt the same time, practitioners may use a \"mantra\" (), that is \"Sammā-Arahaṃ\", which refers to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (\"sammā\") attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (\"arahaṃ\"), as can be found in the traditional \"Tiratanavanda\" chant. This is a form of \"Buddhanussati\", i.e. recollecting the Buddha qualities. This mantra has also been used by monks from Northern Thailand. Alternatively, according to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, practitioners can also place the attention at the center of the body directly, and can even do so without visualizing or using a mantra.\n\nThe types of practices, such as use of a mantra and use of a bright object, are not unique to Dhammakaya meditation, but the details of the technique are. As with many forms of Buddhist meditation, Dhammakaya meditation has both \"samatha\" and \"vipassana\" stages. As is common with traditional \"samatha\" practice, the goal of Dhammakaya meditation at the \"samatha\" level is to overcome mental hindrances to concentration. When the mind becomes peaceful and stable during \"samatha\", it overcomes those hindrances and reaches a state of concentration. The indication of reaching this stage is that a bright light will arise at the center of the body. The mind should then be directed continuously at the center of this sphere helping to transport the mind towards an inner path with several stages. During these stages, the practitioner may experience goose bumps or other physical responses. Known as \"pīti\", this phenomenon is understood to be temporary.\n\nThe process of concentration in Dhammakaya meditation correlates with the description of \"samatha\" meditation in the Visuddhimagga, specifically \"kasina\" meditation. Once the mental hindrances are overcome, the visual image imagined is transformed. The first stage of this path Luang Pu Sodh simply called the 'beginning of the path' ().\nAfter that, Luang Pu Sodh would usually describe the level of attainment in terms of inner bodies (\"\") within every human being, which are successively more subtle, and come in pairs. Mackenzie compares this with Russian dolls nestled within each other. These bodies indicate to what extent the practitioner has attained in meditation practice. Each of these bodies is preceded by several spheres of light. In total, every human being consists of nine types of bodies, each of which has a normal and refined form. The first four pairs of these bodies are equated with the orthodox \"jhāna\" meditation attainments. The final four of these inner pairs are called the \"Dhammakayas\" and are equated with the four stages of enlightenment, leading to the final stage of enlightenment (\"arahant\"). In between is the 'change-of-lineage' () intermediary Dhammakaya state: this is the intermediate state between not being enlightened yet and the four stages of enlightenment.\n\nThe attainment of the \"Dhammakaya\" (or \"Dhammakayas\") is thus described as the result of many steps of practice, culminating in the cessation of the defilements in the mind, or, in positive terms, as the highest happiness. The \"Dhammakaya\" is considered the \"purest element\" within every human being, which is permanent and essential, and is equated with Nirvana. The purest element has the shape of a luminous Buddha figure sitting within oneself. Besides the unorthodox definition of Nirvana as true happiness, permanent and essential, it is also described by the movement from a more orthodox perspective, as the absence of greed, hatred and delusion. Religion scholar Rachelle Scott, however, has argued that the positive description of Nirvana as happiness, permanent and essential, is what has contributed to the popularity of the method and its proponents.\n\nDhammakaya meditation begins with the \"vipassana\" level at a later stage than some other meditation schools in Thailand. In Dhammakaya meditation, a distinction is made between \"seeing the Dhammakāya\" and \"being the Dhammakāya\". Only the latter is equated with having attained the stages of enlightenment at a stable level. It is believed that the further practitioners progress through the successive stages of the practice, the more their mind will become more pure and refined. After practitioners have attained the \"Dhammakaya\", they can gain insight into the reality of life through observation of their own physical and mental processes. It is believed they can understand birth, death and suffering at a deeper level, when they see the literal essence of these phenomena through meditative attainment. The practitioner can accomplish a purification of the mind until an end can be reached, that is Nirvana. Nirvana is described as a subtle sphere () and, controversially, as \"true self\" (). Orthodox teachings on not-self () are regarded as methods to let go of what is not the true self.\n\nDhammakaya meditation at the higher levels is believed to bring forth \"abhiñña\", mental powers. Through such powers practitioners are believed to be able to see different realms of the cosmos following Buddhist cosmology. These powers can also be used for the benefit of society at large. Dhammakaya meditation is believed by some practitioners to have been used during the Second World War to prevent Thailand from being bombed, and used to extinguish the negative forces in the cosmos (Māra). This belief that Dhammakaya meditation can be used to extinguish negative forces has strongly affected the attitudes of practitioners at Dhammakaya movement temples, who therefore hold that Dhammakaya meditation is not only important for the individual, but also for the at large.\n\nScientific research done on Dhammakaya meditation at the \"samatha\" level has shown that it reduced serum cortisol level and blood pressure, while increasing serum protein level. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse rate were also reduced, as well as tidal capacity, tidal volume and maximal voluntary ventilation. Finally, reaction time was reduced. Psychologically, Dhammakaya meditation reduced clinical depression.\n\nAccording to Scott, in the time of Luang Pu Sodh the method was criticized by some for being extra-canonical, although Asian studies scholar Edwin Zehner downplays this, stating there was no widespread criticism. Discussion within the Thai monastic community led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but no fault could be found in Luang Pu Sodh's method. More recently, Dhammakaya meditation has been depicted as a fast and effective meditation method for competitive professionals with little time. Mackenzie does remark, however, that the method is not simpler than other methods, but that its appeal is that its benefits can be more readily experienced than more orthodox models. As with other meditation methods emphasizing \"samatha\", opponents writing from a modernist standpoint have criticized the method. These critics point at the emphasis on pleasant feelings as opposed to insight. They argue against the mystical dimension of meditation practice, saying that bliss in meditation is a hindrance to insight. On the other hand, practitioners of the method often argue how the method is capable of changing people for the better, and has positive effects in all aspects of the practitioner's daily life. Religion scholar Donald Swearer calls the meditation method \"a unique method of meditation which involves a visualization technique not unlike that associated with certain yogic or tantric forms of meditation, and is easily taught to large groups of people\". Meditation in large groups, as is common in the activities of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, contrasts with the emphasis of most Thai temples on meditation in solitude. The temple stresses the importance of meditating as a group to counterbalance the negativity in the world.\n\nThe interpretations of the true self by the Dhammakaya movement have been criticized by orthodox Thai scholars such as Phra Payutto, and have led to considerable debate in Thailand. The word \"dhammakāya\" in its orthodox sense is commonly understood as a figurative term, meaning the \"body\" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings. The idea of a body of spiritual attainment can be found in the early Buddhist scriptures, though, but this is described as a \"body accomplished by the mind\" () and not directly connected with the attainment of Nirvana. However, in a later Sinhalese Pāli text, Nirvana is described as a \"body of emptiness\", which is a similar concept. Finally, the concept of the Dharmakāya has been much further developed in Mahāyāna Buddhism. The interpretations of the Dhammakaya movement with regard to true self have been compared with Mahāyāna ideas like the Buddha Nature, but such influence has been rejected by the movement itself. Proponents of the movement cite several Pāli texts, such as one text stating that Nirvana is true happiness, and argue that the true self is a logical conclusion that follows from these texts. Other proponents feel that the problem is a matter of practice more than debate.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6718101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6718101", "title": "Ekasarana Dharma", "text": "Ekasarana Dharma\n\nEkasarana Dharma (Assamese ; literally: 'Shelter-in-One religion') is a panentheistic form of Hinduism founded and propagated by Srimanta Sankardeva in the 15th century. Most of the adherents of this religion today live in the Indian state of Assam. As part of the greater Bhakti movement in other parts of India, it rejects vedic and other esoteric rites of worship, and instead replaces them by a simplified form that requires just uttering the name (\"naam\") of God.\n\nThe simple and accessible religion attracted already Hinduized as well as non-Hindu tribal populations into its egalitarian folds. The new converts were accepted via a system of individual initiation and were given a path to social improvement. Institutions like \"sattra\" (monasteries) and village \"Namghar\" (prayer houses), had profound influence in the evolution of social makeup of Assam's society. The artistic oeuvres lead to engendering of new forms of literature, music (\"Borgeets\" or songs celestials), theatre (\"Ankia Naat\") and dance (Sattriya dance).\n\nThe central religious text of this religion is Bhagavat of Sankardeva, which was transcreated from the Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana by Srimanta Sankardeva and other religious preceptors. This book is supplemented by the two books of hymns: \"Kirtan Ghoxa\" by Sankardeva and \"Naam Ghoxa\" by Madhabdev. These books are written in the Assamese language.\n\nThe religion is also called \"Mahapuruxiya\" because it is based on the worship of the Mahapurux or Mahapurush (Sanskrit: \"Maha\": Supreme and \"purush:\" Being), an epithet of Lord Vishnu in the Bhagavata and its adherents are often called \"Mahapuruxia\", \"Sankari\", \"Saraniya\" etc. In course of time, the epithet 'Mahapurux' came to be (secondarily) applied also to Sankardeva and Madhabdev, the principal preceptors. Non-adherence to the Hindu varnasrama system and egalitarianism marked its character.\n\nA strictly monotheistic religion, the only form of worship prescribed by this religion is uttering the name of God (\"Sravana-Kirttana\"), who is worshiped in the form of Krishna or Hari. Thus it is also called \"ek sarana Hari naam dharma\". Though a part of the wider Bhakti movement, it does not worship Radha with Krishna which is common in other bhakti movements. It is characterised by the \"dasya\" form of worship. Historically, it has been against caste system, and especially against animal sacrifices common in \"sakta\" forms of Hinduism. Noted for its egalitarianism, it posed a serious challenge to Brahminical Hinduism, and converted into its fold people of all castes, ethnicity and religion (including Islam).\n\nThe preceptors as well as later leaders of the Ekasarana religion focused mainly on the religious practice of \"bhakti\" and kept away from systematically expounding philosophical positions. Nevertheless references found scattered in the voluminous works of Sankardeva and Madhavdeva indicate that their theosophical positions are rooted in the Bhagavata Purana with a strong Advaita influence via its commentary \"Bhavartha-dipika\" by Sridhar Swami. Nevertheless, Sankardeva's interpretation of these texts were seen at once to be \"original and new\". Scholars hold that these texts are not followed \"in-toto\" and deviations are often seen in the writings especially when the original philosophical contents came into conflict with the primary focus of \"bhakti\" as enunciated in the Ekasarana-dharma.\n\nThough it acknowledges the impersonal (nirguna) god, it identifies the personal (saguna) one as worshipful which it calls Narayana. The sole aspect that distinguishes the personal from the impersonal one is the act of creation, by which Narayana created everything. Unlike in Gaudiya Vaishnavism it claims no distinction between Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavat, which are considered in \"Ekasarana\" as just different appellations applied to the same supreme reality.\n\nEven though Narayana is sometimes used synonymously with Vishnu, the gods Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva are considered of lower divinity.\n\nNarayana as the personal and worshipful god is considered to be a loving and lovable god, who possesses auspicious attributes that attract devotees. He is non-dual, omnipotent and omniscient; creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all. He also possesses moral qualities like \"karunamaya\" (compassionate), \"dinabandhu\" (friend of the lowly), \"bhakta-vatsala\" (beloved of devotees) and \"patit-pavana\" (redeemer of sinners) that make him attractive to devotees. Though it does not deny the existence of other gods, it asserts that Narayana alone is worshipful and the others are strictly excluded.\n\nFollowing the Bhagavata Purana, the object of devotion in Ekasarana is Krishna, who is the supreme entity himself. who is suddha (pure), satya (true). All other deities are subservient to Him. Brahman, Vishnu and Krishna are fundamentally one. Krishna is alone the supreme worshipful in the system. Sankaradeva's Krishna is Nārāyana, the Supreme Reality or Parama Brahma and not merely an avatara of Visnu. Krishna is God Himself. It considers Narayana (Krishna) as both the cause as well as the effect of this creation, and asserts Narayana alone is the sole reality. From the philosophical angle, He is the Supreme Spirit (Param-Brahma). As the controller of the senses, the Yogis call him Paramatma. When connected with this world, He assumes the name of Bhagavanta. Moreover, some of the characteristics usually reserved for the impersonal God in other philosophies are attributed to Narayana with reinterpretations.\n\nThe embodied self, called \"jiva\" or \"jivatma\" is identical to Narayana. It is shrouded by \"maya\" and thus suffers from misery, When the ego (\"ahamkara\") is destroyed, the \"jiva\" can perceive himself as Brahma. The \"jiva\" attains \"mukti\" (liberation) when the jiva is restored to its natural state (\"maya\" is removed). Though other Vaishnavites (Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha, Caitanya) recognise only \"videhamukti\" (\"mukti\" after death), the Ekasarana preceptors have recognised, in addition, \"jivanmukti\" (\"mukti\" during lifetime). Among the five different kinds of \"videhamukti\", the Ekasarana rejects the \"Sayujya\" form of \"mukti\", where the complete absorption in God deprives \"jiva\" of the sweetness and bliss associated with \"bhakti\". \"Bhakti\" is thus not a means to \"mukti\" but an end to itself, and this is strongly emphasised in Ekasarana writings——Madhavdeva begins his Namaghosha with an obeisance to devotees who do not prefer \"mukti\". This identity between the \"jivatma\" and Narayana is beautifully expressed by Sankaradeva through the words of the Vedas in the 'Veda Stuti' (The Prayer of the Vedas) section of his Kirttana Ghosā, \"jiva amse Tumi pravesilā gāve gāve\":-\n\nMaya or nescience in Sankaradeva is seen as a barrier to the Lord's bhakti (Devotion). And therefore, to break the fetters of maya, is prescribed the path of adoration (bhajana) of the Lord solely through the listening to (Sravana) and recitation (Kirttana) of His Glories, taking sole-refuge (Eka-Sarana) in Him, in the company of His (single-minded) devotees (bhaktas):-\n\nNarayana often manifests through \"avatars\", and Krishna is considered as the most perfect one who is not a partial manifestation but Narayana himself. It is in the form of Krishna that Narayana is usually worshiped. The description of Krishna is based on the one in Bhagavat Puran, as one who resides in Vaikuntha along with his devotees. Thus the worshipful form is different from other forms of Krishna-based religions (Radha-Krishna of Caitanya, Gopi-Krishna of Vallabhacharya, Rukmini-Krishna of Namadeva and Sita-Rama of Ramananda). The form of devotion is infused with the \"dasya\" and \"balya bhava\" in the works of Sankardev and Madhabdev. \"Madhura bhava\", so prevalent in the other religions, is singularly absent here.\n\nThe \"cari vastu\" or the \"Four Reals\" defined this religious system. They are:\n\nThe single most important religious text is the Bhagavata, especially the Book X (\"Daxama\"). This work was transcreated from the original Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana to Assamese in the 15th and 16th centuries by ten different individuals, but chiefly by Srimanta Sankardev who rendered as many as ten Cantos (complete and partial) of this holy text.\n\nThree other works find a special place in this religion: \"Kirtan Ghoxa\", composed by Sankardev; and \"Naam Ghoxa\" and \"Ratnavali\", composed by Madhavdev.\n\nThe religion fissured into four \"sanghati\" (\"samhatis\" or sub-sects) soon after the death of Srimanta Sankardeva. Sankardev handed down the leadership to Madhabdev, but the followers of Damodardev and Harideva did not accept Madhabdev as their leader and formed their own group (\"Brahma sanghati\"). Madhabdeva at the time of his death did not name a successor. After his death three leaders formed their own denominations: Bhabanipuria Gopal Ata (\"Kaal sanghati\"), Purushuttom Thakur Ata, a grandson of Sankardev (\"Purusa sanghati\") and Mathuradas Burhagopal Ata (\"Nika Sanghati\"). They differ mostly in the emphasis of the \"cari vastus\" (four fundamental principles)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its principles are explained in \"The manifesto of the movement \"Essence of Time\"\".\n\nThe manifesto declares that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a great tragedy. The objective of the movement is to restitute the USSR in a better and more capable form. The ascertainment of what was responsible for the USSR's fall is considered a key step in this process.\n\nAccording to Kurginyan, capitalism is inherently incompatible with Russian historical and cultural heritage. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991 \"the capitalism in Russia has not built anything, and destroyed everything\", but, fortunately, after 20 years, Russia is slowly starting to \"wake up\". The Fall of the USSR was just a part of a game, played by the postmodern entities against \"the history and humanity\". Kurginyan considers his manifesto to be a new Communist manifesto, analysis of new bourgeoisie, whose nature has evolved since Marx's time.\n\nThe movement is grounded in modern philosophy and incorporates the ideas of Karl Marx, Max Weber, Erich Fromm, Antonio Gramsci, Alexander Bogdanov, Viktor Frankl, and others. One of the main principles of the movement's ideology is the ascription of great importance to the human spirit as a philosophical category, which is considered to be linked directly to the question of the ascent of humanity. The project subscribes to conception of \"uber-modernity\" (in Russian сверхмодерн, tr. sverkhmodern), not to be confused with post-modernity, and on this principle hopes to build a new historical project for Russia. The project conceives of a great historical role for Russia in moving the world out of the global crisis of capitalism, based on the country's experience of alternatives to capitalist modernity and so-called post-modernity).\n\nThe movement seeks to unite people with socialist and communist political views as well as those with patriotic views and Orthodox Christian values, hoping on this basis to create a spiritual synthesis.\n\nOne of the main aims of the movement is a revival of the Soviet Union on new principles, taking into account the mistakes of the past (the project is thus dubbed \"USSR 2.0\"). EoT envisions a new red union state - a union of equal nations where the Russian nation plays the role of the state's core.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the movement is the bringing to life the best of communism's ideas -namely a state of being in society which provides for the awakening and development of the higher creative abilities of every human being.\n\nOn July 19, 2010, the show \"Court of Time\" began broadcasting nationally on Russian television's Fifth Channel. The subject of the show was a serious discussion of historical events and personalities in the form of the hearing. The main participants were Leonid Mlechin and Sergei Kurginyan. The show gained certain measure of public acclaim, in part because of the subject matter, but also because the studio audience and internet and telephone voters were asked to vote whose side they agreed with. While the small studio audience was often won over by Mlechin, who adheres to liberal political and economic values, online and telephone voters always decisively sided with Sergei Kurginyan (ranging from a minimum of 72% to 97%), who consistently defended the pro-Soviet stance. The last broadcast of this show was held on December 30, 2010.\n\nAfter the conclusion of \"Court of Time\" Sergei Kurginyan began his own web show entitled \"Essence of Time\", which, in lecture format, outlined his views on the causes of the Soviet Union's collapse, the prospects for the political, socioeconomic and cultural development of Russia, and the political situation in the world and its relation to the previous two questions. Kurginyan noted that he conceived of the program as an opportunity to continue the discussion, started in the program \"Court of Time\", but now among a circle of friends. On the basis of this web show the virtual club \"Essence of Time\" was soon created, quickly gathering enthusiasts and building local sections of the club.\n\nTogether with supporters of the current government \"Essence of Time\" became one of the main organizers of the anti-Orange revolutionary meeting on Poklonnaya Hill on February 4, 2012. On the eve of the meeting activists with flags and symbology of the movement participated in pickets near Moscow subway stations, handing out leaflets, talking about the movement's activities and calling on citizens to take part in the meeting. According to the MOI Moscow the meeting was attended by about 140 thousand people. The penalty for exceeding the number of participants in the meeting was paid for by Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn May 2012, Kurginyan published the book \"Essence of Time: Philosophical justification of messianic claims of Russia in the 21st century\". Consisting of 4 volumes, the book consists of the texts of the online web show \"Essence of Time\" and the explanatory diagrams that go along with them.\n\n"}
{"id": "279621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279621", "title": "Etiäinen", "text": "Etiäinen\n\nIn Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming.\n\nIn modern Finnish the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.\n\nOne explanation given for the detail of the apparition is that when a person is waiting for someone, their anticipation can augment everyday sounds, for example of a cat or the wind, and bring to consciousness a vivid recollection of the person. This recollection will tend to produce the feeling that the remembered person is \"coming\". If no one comes, the \"possible etiäinen\" is forgotten. The failure of this explanation is that etiäinen is not necessary when you expect someone to come. It more often indicates an unexpected visitor who would otherwise come as a surprise without phone calls or any kind of announcement beforehand.\n\n"}

Having formed the resolution, three years later, to study for the priesthood, he returned to Sedgley, going afterwards to Oscott College, where he was ordained by John Milner in 1820. \n\nAfter serving the Stourbridge mission, near Oscott, for a time, he was sent to Cossey Hall, Norfolk, as chaplain to Sir George Stafford Jerningham, who became Baron Stafford in 1825. He took up his residence in a cottage in the village, and continued his ministrations here to the Catholics of the mission until within a few months of his death. \n\nDuring this long period, extending over more than half a century, he is said to have been absent from his mission only on three Sundays. Seven years after his appointment to Cossey he became grand vicar under Bishop Walsh, successor of Bishop Milner as Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District. In 1841 he opened St. Wulstan's Chapel, for which he had collected funds, and in 1850 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Rome. \n\nShortly after the restoration of the English hierarchy by Pope Pius IX, Husenbeth was nominated provost of the Chapter, of Northampton, and Vicar-General of the diocese. In the spring of 1872 he resigned his mission, and he died at St. Wulstan's Presbytery on the last day of October in the same year.\n\nHe had no particular liking for religious institutes, and was quite opposed to the new forms of devotion which had grown up since his student days at Oscott.\n\nIn his quiet country presbytery, he found ample leisure time, and between the years 1823 and 1849 forty-nine works written or edited by him appeared in London, Dublin, and Norwich. Many of these were controversial publications, written in refutation of George Stanley Faber and Joseph Blanco White, while others treated of historical, liturgical, or doctrinal matters. Perhaps his most important work is the \"Life of Bishop Milner\", published in 1862; defective as biography, it was a contribution to the history of Catholicism on England. \n\nIn 1852 he brought out, assisted by John Polding, a new edition, with abridged notes, of George Leo Haydock's illustrated Bible and he published also editions, for the use of the laity, of the Missal and the vesper-book. The \"Emblems of Saints\" (1850) was one of his best original works, and the style of his pulpit eloquence is well shown by the various sermons which he printed from time to time.\n\nHe contributed a large number of uncollected verses to the periodicals of his time. He also published articles on a great variety of subjects in different Catholic journals, and was a lifelong writer in the columns of \"Notes and Queries\", in which more than thirteen hundred contributions appeared over his initials. He was a voluminous letter-writer, and maintained a correspondence with various literary celebrities, and with many distinguished converts of his time. Husenbeth's valuable library collection of crucifixes, reliquaries and similar objects and of letters chiefly on religious subjects, were sold at Norwich a few months after his death. Most of the letters passed into the possession of the Bishop of Northampton.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16880874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16880874", "title": "Freedom of Worship (painting)", "text": "Freedom of Worship (painting)\n\nFreedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is the second of the \"Four Freedoms\" oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the goals known as the Four Freedoms enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union Address delivered on January 6, 1941. Rockwell considered this painting and \"Freedom of Speech\" the most successful of the series. \"Freedom of Worship\" was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of \"The Saturday Evening Post\" alongside an essay by philosopher Will Durant.\n\n\"Freedom of Worship\" is the second of a series of four oil paintings by Norman Rockwell entitled \"Four Freedoms\". The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941, known as Four Freedoms. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution are freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the Allies' World War II policy statement, the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in \"The Saturday Evening Post\", accompanied by essays from noted writers: \"Freedom of Speech\" (February 20), \"Freedom of Worship\" (February 27), \"Freedom from Want\" (March 6) and \"Freedom from Fear\" (March 13). For the essay accompanying \"Freedom of Worship\", \"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume \"The Story of Civilization\", coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.\n\nThe painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with his head covered carrying a religious book who is Jewish, an older woman who is Protestant, and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding rosary beads who is Catholic. In 1966, Rockwell used \"Freedom of Worship\" to show his admiration for John F. Kennedy in a \"Look\" story illustration entitled \"JFK's Bold Legacy\". The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to \"Freedom of Worship\" along with Peace Corps volunteers.\n\nThe original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a oil on canvas depicting tolerance as \"the basis for a democracy's religious diversity\". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.\n\nIn June 1942, \"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works. By October, the \"Post\" was worried about Rockwell's progress on the \"Four Freedoms\" and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on \"Freedom of Worship\", his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that was inspired by the phrase \"Each according to the dictates of his own conscience.\" His Arlington, Vermont, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the Episcopal Church. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with \"The Post\" who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by \"'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his fez, was too obviously foreign to offend.\" The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.\n\nRockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to \"Freedom of Worship\", \"I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over.\" Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion \"is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings.\"\n\n\"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs said of \"Speech\" and \"Worship\", \"To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The \"Four Freedoms\" did — and do.\" Walt Disney wrote, \"I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it.\" Rockwell believed that \"Freedom of Worship\" and \"Freedom of Speech\" were his better results in the series. Laura Claridge has written that the inspirational phrase \"Each according to the dictates of his own conscience\" is a \"platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the \"Thirteen Articles of Faith\" by Joseph Smith.\" In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression \"according to the dictates of his conscience\" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.\n\nCritical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in \"Freedom of Religion\". Claridge feels that the tight amalgam of faces ... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking. Claridge stated that the earlier version was \"clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage.\" Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the \"storytelling style\" that Rockwell is known for.\n\nDeborah Solomon considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat \"didactic\". Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the Norman Rockwell Museum, and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive. Bruce Cole of \"The Wall Street Journal\" noted that Rockwell's \"depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2235585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2235585", "title": "Hindu wedding", "text": "Hindu wedding\n\nA Hindu wedding is \"Vivaha\" (Sanskrit: विवाह) and the wedding ceremony is called \"Vivaah Sanskar\" in North India and \"Kalyanam\" (generally) in South India. Hindus attach a great deal of importance to marriage. The wedding ceremonies are very colourful, and celebrations may extend for several days. The bride's and groom's home—entrance, doors, wall, floor, roof—are sometimes decorated with colors, balloons, and other decorations.\n\nThe rituals and process in a Hindu wedding vary widely. Nevertheless, the Hindu wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a Vedic \"yajna\" ritual and three key rituals are almost universal: \"Kanyadaan\", \"Panigrahana\", and \"Saptapadi\"—which are respectively, giving away of his daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hands near the fire to signify union, and taking seven ‘steps before fire’. (Each ‘step’ is a complete circuit of the fire.) \n\nAt each step promises are made by (in the long form—see below) each to the other. The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) \"Agni\", in the presence of family and friends. The ceremony is traditionally conducted entirely or at least partially in Sanskrit, considered by Hindus as the language of holy ceremonies. The local language of the bride and groom may also be used. The rituals are prescribed in the \"Gruhya sutra\" composed by various \"rishis\" such as \"Baudhayana\" and \"Ashvalayana\". \n\nThe pre-wedding and post-wedding rituals and celebrations vary by region, preference and the resources of the groom, bride and their families. They can range from one day to multi-day events. Pre-wedding ceremonies include engagement, which involves \"vagdana\" (betrothal) and \"lagna-patra\" (written declaration), and the arrival of the groom's party at the bride's residence, often as a formal procession with dancing and music. The post-wedding ceremonies may include \"Abhishek\", \"Anna Prashashan\", \"Aashirvadah\", and \"Grihapravesa\" – the welcoming of the bride to her new home. The wedding marks the start of the \"Grihastha\" (householder) stage of life for the new couple.\n\nIn India, by law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding or complete unless the ritual of seven steps and vows in presence of fire (\"Saptapadi\") is completed by the bride and the groom together. This requirement is under debate, given that several Hindu communities (such as the Nayars of Kerala or Bunts of Tulu Nadu) do not observe these rites.\n\nAncient Hindu literature, in for example the \"Asvalayana Grhyasutra\" and \"Atharvaveda\", identifies eight forms of marriage. They are traditionally presented, as here, in order of religious appropriateness (\"prashasta\"). They also differ very widely in social acceptability. (Legal aspects are regulated mainly by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.)\n\n\nThe above four forms of marriage were considered socially proper, and religiously appropriate – \"prashasta\" – under Hinduism, since the rituals include vows from Vedic scriptures. Both bride and groom commit to each other and share responsibilities to their families. The remaining four do not include vows and were considered \"aprashasta\" (inappropriate). Among these, two were socially acceptable:\n\n\nThe last two forms of marriage were not only inappropriate, but religiously forbidden:\n\n\nJames Lochtefeld comments that these last two forms were forbidden but the marriages themselves were still recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to allow these acts but rather to provide the woman and any resulting children with legal protection in the society.\n\nThere is no single standard Hindu marriage ceremony. Regional variation is prevalent in the sequence of rituals comprising the ceremony. There is also considerable flexibility within each ritual. Variation reflects family traditions, local traditions, resources of the families and other factors. Three key rituals predominate, as follows. Two are \"yajna\".\n\n\nThe Kanyadaan ceremony is performed by the bride’s father. If the father has died, a guardian of the bride's choosing performs the ritual. The father brings the daughter, then takes the bride's hand and places it in the groom's. This marks the beginning of the ceremony of giving away the bride. The groom accepts the bride's hand, while the \"kama-sukta\" (hymn to love) is pronounced, in the presence of the father, the bride and the groom. The \"Kamasukta\" verse is:\n\n<poem>\n\"Who offered this maiden?, to whom is she offered?\"\n\"Kama (the god of love) gave her to me, that I may love her\"\n\"Love is the giver, love is the acceptor\"\n\"Enter thou, the bride, the ocean of love\"\n\n\"With love then, I receive thee\"\n\"May she remain thine, thine own, O god of love\"\n\"Verily, thou art, prosperity itself\"\n\"May the heaven bestow thee, may the earth receive thee\"\n</poem>\n\nAfter this ritual recital, the father asks the groom to not fail the bride in his pursuit of \"dharma\" (moral and lawful life), \"artha\" (wealth) and \"kama\" (love). The groom promises to the bride's father that he shall never fail her in his pursuit of \"dharma\", \"artha\" and \"kama\". The groom repeats the promise three times.\n\nThis repeated promise by the groom marks the end of the \"kanyadaan\" ritual in the Hindu wedding.\n\nThe ritual of \"Panigrahana\" comes after \"Kanyadaan\". It is sometimes preceded by the \"vivaha-homa\" rite, wherein a symbolic fire is lit by the groom to mark the start of a new household.\n\n\"Panigrahana\" is the 'holding the hand' ritual as a symbol of the bride and groom’s impending marital union, with the groom acknowledging responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, and while the bride sits in front of him, with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the following Rig vedic mantra is recited:\n\n<poem>\n\"I take thy hand in mine, yearning for happiness\"\n\"I ask thee, to live with me, as thy husband\"\n\"Till both of us, with age, grow old\"\n\n\"Know this, as I declare, that the Gods\"\n\"Bhaga, Aryama, Savita and Purandhi, have bestowed thy person, upon me\"\n\"that I may fulfill, my Dharmas of the householder, with thee\"\n\n\"This I am, That art thou\"\n\"The Sāman I, the Ŗc thou\"\n\"The Heavens I, the Earth thou\"\n</poem>\n\nIn the Gujarati Wedding this step is called \"Hast-Milap\" (literally, “meeting of hands”). The whole ceremony was timed around an auspicious time (\"Mauhurat\") for this step and a few decades ago the wedding invitation would even list the time when this event was going to take place.\n\nThe \"Saptapadi\" (Sanskrit “seven steps”/“seven feet”; sometimes called \"Saat Phere\": “seven rounds”) is the most important ritual of Vedic Hindu weddings, and represents the legal element of the Hindu marriage ceremony. The couple conduct seven circuits of the Holy Fire (\"Agni\"), which is considered a witness to the vows they make to each other. In some regions, a piece of clothing or sashes worn by the bride and groom are tied together for this ritual. Elsewhere, the groom holds the bride's right hand in his own right hand. Each circuit of the consecrated fire is led by either the bride or the groom, varying by community and region. Usually, the bride leads the groom in the first circuit. In North India, the first six circuits are led by the bride, and the final one by the groom. In Central India and Suriname, the bride leads the first three or four circuits. With each circuit, the couple makes a specific vow to establish some aspect of a happy relationship and household for each other.\n\nIn some South Indian weddings, after each saying a mantra at each of the seven steps, the couple say these words together:\n\nIn North Indian weddings, the bride and the groom say the following words after completing the seven steps:\n\nThe long form of \"Saptapadi\" starts with a preface announced by the priest, introducing a series of vows the groom and bride make to each other, as follows.

This ritual is where the \"baraat\" (groom's procession party) arrives at the bride's home or the location where the bride is and marriage will be celebrated. The \"baraat\" typically includes dancing and joyous members of groom's family, relatives and friends. On their arrival, there is a ritual where key persons from the groom's side and bride's side are introduced to each other. The introduction is typically followed by \"jai mala\" (garland exchange between bride and groom) and a reception that serves food and drinks. \n\nMany other rituals and ceremonies are sometimes found in Hindu weddings, such as \"madhuparka\", \"vivaah-homa\", \"agni-parinayana\", \"asmarohana\", \"laja homa\", \"abhishek\", \"anna-prashashan\", and \"aashir-vadah\". All these ceremonies are carried out at the wedding location, typically at or near the bride's home. These additional rituals include the participation of the brothers, sisters, maternal/paternal relatives, guardians, or friends of the bride.\n\nIn some parts of India, such as Gujarat and Northern India, a \"laja homa\" ritual called \"mangal pherā\" is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire. It follows \"hasta milap\" (meeting of hands of the couple), but precedes \"saptapadi\". The first three circles is led by the groom, and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life – \"Dharma\", \"Artha\", \"Kama\". The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life – \"Moksha\". After \"saptapadi\", as hymns are being recited, the groom performs \"māņg sindoor\" ritual where a saffron or red color powder is marked into the parting of the wife's hair. Instead of circling the fire and other steps, the rituals and ceremonies may be performed symbolically, such as stepping on small heaps of rice or throwing grains into the fire.\n\nSome rituals involve rice or other grains, seeds and pastes. In these ceremonies, rice is thrown at the bride, groom or they kick a container containing the grain. Rituals include \"darshan\", where the newly married couple are met, blessed and greeted by family and friends of the bride and groom.\n\nAfter the Hindu wedding is complete, the bride leaves for groom's home via groom's car. In groom's car, bride and groom sit together, and groom's younger brother drive the car. bride's two sister also come with groom's family, when they arrive to groom house where Hindu family members of the groom welcome the newly wedded couple in a ritual known as \"grihapravesa\" (home coming/entry). This ceremony typically requires participation of the mother, father, brothers, and sisters, or other guardians of the groom.\n\nAncient literature suggests the Hindu couple spent time with each other, but delayed the consummation for at least three nights following the wedding. Some scholars have proposed the observance of this rite in the past – known as \"chaturthikarma\" – “the rite performed on the fourth day of marriage”. Chaturthikarma is followed by most of South Indian communities as a possible basis for the validity of a marriage. Other scholars suggest \"saptapadi\" and regionally customary wedding rituals, not consummation, defines legal validity of a Hindu marriage. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, Article 7, is consistent with the latter. \"Chaturthikarma\" is not a common practice in Hindu communities.\n\nIn modern Hindu families, the couple proceed to honeymoon after \"grihapravesa\".\n\nIn the Hindu culture of Nepal, marriage rituals are done by the \"Chhetri\" in a sixteen step process that centers on the household. The household is important during the marriage ritual because it is the center of the concept of \"mandala\"; the Chhetri's homes are considered to be domestic mandalas and so have roles as householders. The act of marriage brings men and women into the householder role. Marriage is the most important rite of passage for the Chhetris and is one of the most serious. Women move from their houses to the home of the groom after marriage. The ceremony is done in a precise and careful manner as to not bring bad luck to the families of the bride and groom; certain traditions, for example no one seeing the face of the bride until the end, are followed in order to ensure future prosperity. Prior to the marriage ceremony, there is no kinship between families of the bride and groom and the bride must be a virgin. The marriage ceremony consists of a series of rites that are performed over a two-day period between the houses of the bride and the groom. Within each home the enclosed area in the courtyard (\"jagya\") and the kitchen are used the most; the jagya and the kitchen are considered the most important parts of the domestic mandala structure because it is where rice (an important part of the Chhetri's culture) is prepared and consumed. At the end of the ceremony is the establishment of the role of the wife and husband in the husband's home.\n\nThe first step in the marriage ceremony is called \"Purbanga\". In the kitchen of their homes, the bride and the groom worship the seven Mother Goddesses as so to pay respect to their ancestors and ask for peace. In the second, third, and fourth step, the groom is then blessed by his mother and is taken outside to his jagya where his father and procession (\"janti\") carry him and bring gifts for the bride to her house in a ceremony called dulähä anmäune. In the fifth step as the groom waits before the house of the bride, gifts of clothes and food are placed around the jagya; the father of the bride then places red paste on the groom's forehead indicating that he is no longer an outsider to his family. The sixth step is the performance of the \"Barani\" or welcoming for the groom and his janti as they enter the jagya. The father purifies the body of the groom using panchämrit (nectar from five pure liquids). A small feast is then held for the groom as the next steps in the marriage continue.\n\nAfter the small feast, the marriage process for the bride begins. The seventh step takes place in the kitchen of the bride where the process of \"kanya dan\" starts; the bride's parents give their daughter in marriage to her groom thereby allowing the bride to be a part of the groom's lineage and making the father's lineage secondary. After they wash their feet they dress in red and, in the eighth step, sit beside in each other in the jagya. They perform post-marriage rites as they make sacrificial offerings to the fire in the center of the jagya. During these rites the bride and groom perform tasks such as placing red powder in the hair of the bride and the bride eats leftover food of the groom and at the end the now husband gives his wife a personal name for which she is to be called by.\n\nAfter the post-marriage ceremony, the married couple being to leave the bride's home. In the ninth step, the husband and wife return to the kitchen of the wife and worship their ancestors and the seven Mother Goddesses. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth step, the couple leave the wife's house as she is given a garland from her parents; the wife and husband enter the jagya and are then escorted out riding on palanquins as they return to their permanent home of the husband. The thirteenth step beings once they enter the jagya of the groom and his virgin sisters welcome the wife in a ceremony called \"arti syäl\". They unveil the bride and adorn her with flower garlands and sprinkle puffed rice on her (a sign of prosperity). The fourteenth step is completed once the bride promises gifts to the sisters; she then moves on the fifteenth step where she steps on piles of rice in a path toward the kitchen. The final step is a series of rites, the first of which is the bride worshiping the ancestors and deities of the husband; she then demonstrates her skills in handling rice to the husband's mother and sisters and then they entwine her hair. Finally, the mother unveils the bride again in front of the husband and in a ceremony called \"khutta dhog\", the bride places the foot of the mother on her forehead thereby ending the marriage ceremony.\n\nWhile there are many rituals in Hinduism, such as those at birth and deaths of loved ones, the Hindu wedding is the most important and extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life. Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings.\n\nIn 2008, Indian weddings market was estimated to be $31 billion a year. Various sources estimate India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year, and over 80% of these are Hindu weddings. The average expenditures exceed US$3,000 per wedding. Another $30 billion per year is spent on jewelry in India, with jewelry for weddings being the predominant market. In a nation with per capita annual income of $1,500, weddings are a major financial burden for the typical Hindu family.\n\nIn India, where most Hindus live, the laws relating to marriage differ by religion. According to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, passed by the Parliament of India, for all legal purposes, all Hindus of any caste, creed or sect, Sikh, Buddhists and Jains are deemed Hindus and can intermarry. By the Special Marriage Act, 1954, a Hindu can marry a person who is not Hindu, employing any ceremony, provided specified legal conditions are fulfilled. By Section 7 of Hindu Marriage Act, and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding and complete before the seventh step of the \"Saptapadi\" ritual, in presence of fire, by the bride and the groom together. In some cases, such as South Indian Hindu marriages, this is not required.\n\nA Vedic sage emphasized that the basis of happy and fulfilling married life is the sense of unity, intimacy and love between husband and wife both physically, mentally and spiritually. Hence wife is considered to be the Ardhangani of husband as per Hindu tradition. Marriage is not for self-indulgence, but is considered a lifelong social and spiritual responsibility. Married life is considered an opportunity for two people to grow as life partners into soul-mates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14321687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14321687", "title": "Homeric Prayer", "text": "Homeric Prayer\n\nIn the Homeric works humans indirectly control their destiny by their actions and decisions. Homer allows his heroic mortals to stand close to the gods. Characters communicate with their gods through prayers, in an act which merges the divine world of the epic creation with that of mankind. Gods usually hear, often react and sometimes grant human prayers in epic poetry. “But Zeus does not bring to accomplishment all thoughts in men’s minds” (Iliad, XVIII 328), as Achilleus stresses in admitting humanity’s restrained power.\n\nHomeric prayers, signaling moments at which the fictional characters face extreme threats, can and do determine the events of the plot. The prayers of the heroes seek specific tangible benefits from the gods expressing their belief that the gods superintend mortals, sympathize with them, become involved in human affairs, answer their prayers or deny their wishes. In literature an included prayer externalizes sentiments of panic or highlights pivotal moments in the narrative. Prayer becomes more than a mere verbal expression of one’s wish; it is a means to channel feelings, thoughts, energy, spiritual tension, a ritual which if performed as an act of honor or duty is powerful enough to change the course of the world of the epic creation with only constraint the mortal characters' inevitable fatal end. \n\nPhoinix, a fictional character in the Iliad, commenting upon the power of prayer reinforces that: “the very immortals can be moved; their virtue and honor and strength are greater than ours are, / and yet with sacrifices and offerings for endearment, / with libations and with savor men turn back even the immortals / in supplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses” (Iliad, IX 497-501)\n\nFormal Greek prayer in the epic poems attributed to Homer is ritualized and consists of four basic stages: cleansing, prayer, sacrifice and libation . Acts and gestures form part of the homeric prayer as much as words do. The characters wash their hands, purifying themselves in the context of catharsis. They attain an appropriate posture, lift their arms. They address their gods directly, praise the divine admitting the omnipotence of the Olympians and thus the cosmic hierarchy. They remind the gods of the already established relationship between the supplicant and the divine in an effort to deem themselves worthy of their god’s attention. The characters are now ready to verbally announce their noble wish to be granted and proceed to offer mostly in form of a sacrifice an act of submission.\n\nIn his prayer to Apollo (Iliad, I, 445-457), Chryses, a priest of the god in a Trojan-allied town in the Iliad, washes his hands and lifts his hands prior to requesting fulfillment of his wish. He admits his lower status in relation to the all mighty god, “who set your power about Chryse and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over Tenedos” (Iliad, I, 451-3); the gods’ ruling over humanity is accepted. \n\nSimilar is Achilleus' prayer to Zeus. The great hero holds a ritual, purifies himself, pours wine to his god, addresses Zeus in words of commendation and admits the nobler nature of the divinity through contrasting the father of gods with the unpurified humans of “unwashed feet”.\n\nGlaukos, co-leader of the Lycian forces, (XVI, 533) prays on the battlefield requesting healing of his wounds to “fight for Sarpedon”. The practical part of the rite is not performed.\n\nIn the Trojan women's prayer to Athena in the sixth book of the Iliad, Hekabe seems to mechanically carry out the ritual without realizing the significance of its constituent stages, which diminishes the spirituality of her actions. She is about to offer “honey sweet wine, to pour out a libation to father Zeus and the other immortals ” (Iliad, VI, 258-9 ) to Hektor who has not previously been cleansed to participate in the ritual. Offering is encountered in the form of a material gift, a robe, to Athene. The priestess lifts the hands to the sky, home of gods, and exalts Athena as “shining among the goddesses”.\n\nHomer\n\nIliad\n\nList of characters in the Iliad\n\nEpic poetry\n"}

However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's \"Grand Secretary\", Ichadon, devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery.\n\nIchadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527 CE. Ichadon's body was then taken to the Geumgang mountains and buried there with respect. His martyrdom led to the construction of Heungryun monastery, Silla's first state-sponsored temple.\n"}
{"id": "2449732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2449732", "title": "Indian Shaker Church", "text": "Indian Shaker Church\n\nThe Indian Shaker Church is a Christian denomination founded in 1881 by Squaxin shaman John Slocum and his wife Mary Slocum in Washington State. The Indian Shaker Church is a unique blend of American Indian, Catholic, and Protestant beliefs and practices.\n\nThe Indian Shakers are unrelated to the Shakers of New England (United Society of Believers) and are not to be confused with the Native American Church.\n\nAs tradition tells, John Slocum (Squ-sacht-um) had died from sickness in 1881 when he revived during his wake reporting a visit to heaven, where he was told by an angel that, \"you've been a pretty bad Indian\", and where he received instructions to start a new religion. When Slocum became ill again several months later, his wife, Mary, began to shake and tremble uncontrollably in prayer. Soon afterward, Slocum recovered and his healing was attributed to Mary's convulsions. The religion is thus named for the shaking of members during religious congregations. The shaking is reported to have healing powers.\n\nThe story is told that Mary had sent for a casket. John was dead. The casket was brought by canoe, down the river. The casket was just coming around the bend in the river when John revived. ... and told the people he had met Jesus and what they were to do.\n\nThe first church was built at Mud Bay outside Olympia, Washington near the homes of church co-founders and brothers Mud Bay Louie and Mud Bay Sam.\n\nIndian Shakers originally rejected the Bible and all other written scriptures and instead relied on direct communication between God and the individual. Such Shakers believe that the experience of the Gospel does not require a book, but rather is encoded in the mind and soul in accordance with the will of God. The religion began to be practiced by many unrelated peoples along the Northwest Coast of North America, such as the Klallam, Quinault, Lower Chehalis, Yakama, Hoh, Quileute, Wiyot, Yurok, and Hupa, among others.\n\nPractices reflecting Catholic influence include the use of hand-held candles, the ringing of individual hand bells (to a very loud volume), and the sign of the cross (usually repeated three times). Protestant influence is shown in public testifying and confession of shortcomings. Native elements include brushing or stroking to remove evil influence, counter-clockwise movement of service participants around the room (often with loud stomping), and spontaneous reception of songs from the spirit. Church members are expected to refrain from using alcohol and tobacco. Carefulness, kindness, and supplication to God for help are emphasized.\n\nThe new religion encountered much opposition and hostility from Euro-Americans. As had happened with the Ghost Dance, there was much misunderstanding and Anglos feared an Indian uprising. For a time, all Indian religious practices were banned by law and the Indian Shakers were included. Many members were imprisoned and chained for their practices. Powell et al. (1976) show two notices posted by the US Indian Service at Quileute Reservation:\n\nIn the 1960s, a break occurred among Indian Shakers in which one \"conservative\" faction continued to reject written religious material while another \"progressive\" faction was more tolerant of the use of the Bible and other written material.\n\nIndian Shakers continue to practice on the Northwest Coast in Washington, Oregon, California, and British Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The plant is a broadleaf evergreen large shrub native to South Africa and southern Africa, where it is very common. It is known for its medicinal and mild psychoactive properties. The main psychoactive component of \"Leonotis leonurus\" is claimed to \nbe leonurine, even though leonurine has never been found in the plant using chemical analysis. Like other plants in the mint family, it also contains marrubiim. The name 'wild dagga' links it closely to cannabis as 'dagga' derived from the Khoikhoi 'dachab' is an indigenous South African name for cannabis species. This name may be a misnomer, as no part of the plant is used as a hallucinogen.\n\nThe shrub grows tall by wide. The medium-dark green long leaves are aromatic when crushed. The plant has tubular orange flowers in tiered whorls, typical to the mint family, that encircle the square stems. They rise above the foliage mass during the summer season, with flowering continuing into winter in warmer climates.\n\nA white variety (known colloquially as 'Alba') and a yellow variety also exist.\n\nThe native habitat of \"Leonotis leonurus\" is damp grasslands of southern Africa. It attracts nectivorous birds (mainly sunbirds), as well as various insects such as butterflies. The flowers' mainly orange to orange-red colour and tubular shape are indicative of its co-evolution with African sunbirds, which have curved bills suited to feeding from tubular flowers.\n\n\"Leonotis leonurus\" is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its copious orange blossom spikes and is used as an accent or screen in gardens and parks. It is moderately drought tolerant, and a nectar source for birds and butterflies in landscape settings. It was introduced to Europe in the 1600s.\n\nLion's tail can especially be found in other subtropical and Mediterranean climate regions beyond South Africa such as California, Hawaii, and Australia where it has naturalized in areas. In cooler climates it is used as an annual and winter conservatory plant.\n\nThe main active component marrubiin has both antioxidant and cardioprotective properties and has shown to significantly improve myocardial function.\n\nOne experimental animal study suggests that the aqueous leaf extract of \"Leonotis leonurus\" possesses antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties.\n\nAn animal study in rats indicated that in high doses, lion's tail has significant toxicological adverse effects on organs, red blood cells, white blood cells and other important bodily functions. Acute toxicity tests in animals caused death for those receiving 3200 mg/kg dose. At 1600 mg/kg extract led to changes in red blood cells, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, and white blood cells.\n\nThe infusions made from flowers and seeds, leaves or stems are widely used to treat tuberculosis, jaundice, muscle cramps, high blood pressure, diabetes, viral hepatitis, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The leaves, roots and bark are used as an emetic for snakebites, bee and scorpion stings. The fresh stem juice is used as an infusion drunk for 'blood impurity' in some places of South Africa.\n\nThe dried leaves and flowers have a mild calming effect when smoked. In some users, the effects have been noted to be similar to the cannabinoid THC found in \"Cannabis\", except that it has a much less potent high. It has also been reported to cause mild euphoria, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, sweating, sedation and lightheadedness.\n\nIt is sometimes used as a \"Cannabis\" substitute by recreational users as an alternative to illegal psychoactive plants.\n\n\"Leonotis leonurus\" is illegal in Latvia since November 2009. It is Schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euro. Possession and distribution of larger quantities can be punished with up to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"Leonotis leonurus\" was banned in Poland in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to a criminal charge.\n\n\n"}

A contribution to the popularisation of Pagan ideas in the Hungarian society was the tremendous success of the rock opera \"István, a király\" in 1984.\n\nMany Pagan groups in Hungary make use of Christian terminology and iconography re-interpreted in an ethnic Pagan way. This is the case of the \"Church of Esoteric Beliefs — Church of the Holy Crown\" (Hungarian: \"Ezoterikus Tanok Egyháza — Szent Korona Egyház\"), conceptualising a Scythian ancient religion with Christian character, worshiping the \"Fény Jézus\" (\"Light Jesus\") and the \"Boldogasszony\" (\"Blessed Lady\"), with the \"táltos\" as priests. The church has been establishing \"naptemplomok\" (singular: \"naptemplom\"), \"temples of the Sun\", as its places of worship. Another organisation of this kind is the \"Our Lady's Love Church\" (\"Nagyboldogasszony Szeretet Egyház\").\n\nHungarian Neopaganism, the Hungarian native faith, or \"Ősmagyar Vallás\" (meaning \"Ancient Hungarian Religion\" or more accurately \"Arch-Hungarian Religion\") as it is called in the local Neopagan discourse, defines the movements which seek to rebuild a purely Hungarian ethnic religion, inspired to Hungarian mythology and folklore. This drift has roots in the ethnological studies of the early 20th century, while the elaboration of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in the interwar Turanist circles (1930s-40s), finally blossoming alongside other Pagan religions since the fall of the Soviet Union. The difference between Hungarian Neopagan groups is often determined by their differing ideas about the historical origins of the Hungarians.\n\nThe development of the Hungarian Neopagan movements largely rely on the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the \"táltos\", who may organise themselves in associations, set up schools, or establish larger religious organisations. The shamans' movement started to come to light in the 1980s, organising cooperation with representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986. Those \"táltos\" who espouse a Turanist ideology often choose to affiliate with Tengrism.\n\nThe most important organisations of this kind are the \"Yotengrit\", and the \"Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház\" (\"Arch-Hungarian Táltos Church\") founded by András Kovács-Magyar, who later also founded the \"Táltos Iskola\" (\"Táltos School\"). Other groups of this stream are the \"Ősmagyar Egyház\" (\"Arch-Hungarian Church\") and the \"Magyar Vallás Közössége\" (\"Community of Hungarian Religion\").\n\nAnother church of the Hungarian native faith is the \"Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház\" (\"Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád\"), founded in 2009. It is inspired by the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the concept of a common Indo-European paganism.\n\nThe \"Ankh — Church of Eternal Life\" (Hungarian: \"Ankh — Az Örök Élet Egyháza\") is a Kemetic church in Hungary, founded in 1999. They propose a theory that sees God as the source of the universe, himself being the universe, inclosing every conscious and unconscious being. The aim of the organisation is to cultivate and meet the gods, who are the powers acting in the creation.\n\nThe \"Sodalitas Mithraica\" (Latin for \"Mithraic Fellowship\") is a Neo-Mithraic group active in Hungary.\n\n (meaning \"Hungarian Witchcraft\") is a Budapest-based Neopagan organization formed in 1986. Wicca, a religion of English origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of Western Europe. Zsuzsanna Budapest, a Hungarian who emigrated to the United States, is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as Dianic Wicca, popular in North America. The (\"Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza\") is a Celtic Wiccan church in Hungary.\n\n\n\n"}

He was brought up, and finished his schooling, in Minsk. He took his pseudonym from the city he grew up in. He studied law at the University of Saint Petersburg.\n\nHis first poems were written on \"civil topics\". In 1889, he began work on the book \"With the Light of Conscience\", employing a deliberately pompous tone to present its theory of \"meonism\" (\"me on\" being Greek for \"nonexistent\"). The objective of the work is to show that the main purpose of humanity is \"nonexistence itself\".\n\nIn 1900, Dmitri Merezhkovsky, Minsky, Zinaida Gippius, Vasily Rozanov, and others founded the Religious-Philosophical Society in Saint Petersburg. Minsky, like the majority of intellectuals, sympathized with the revolution and social democracy. He was the nominal editor of the legal Bolshevik newspaper \"New Life\".\n\nAfter the revolution was defeated in 1905, Minsky became one of the leaders of Russian decadence and symbolism. These ideas represented the cult of beauty and enjoyment and declared war on the public tendencies that threatened to damage the \"cleanliness\" of artistic creation. After 1905, he lived abroad.\n\nA religious-philosophical concept is presented in the treatises \"With the Light of Conscience\" (1890) and \"The Religion of the Future\" (1905).

{"id": "3764617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3764617", "title": "Our Lady of Lourdes", "text": "Our Lady of Lourdes\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary venerated in honour of the Marian apparitions that reportedly occurred in 1858 in the vicinity of Lourdes in France. The first of these is the apparition of 11 February 1858, when 14-year old Bernadette Soubirous told her mother that a \"lady\" spoke to her in the cave of Massabielle (a kilometre and a half (1 mi) from the town) while she was gathering firewood with her sister and a friend. Similar apparitions of the \"Lady\" were reported on seventeen occasions that year, until the climax revelation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception took place.\n\nIn 18 January 1862, Pope Pius IX authorized Bishop Bertrand-Sévère Laurence to permit the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes. On 3 July 1876, the same Pontiff officially granted a Canonical Coronation to the image that used to be in the courtyard of what is now part of the Rosary Basilica. The image of Our Lady of Lourdes has been widely copied and reproduced in shrines and homes, often in garden landscapes. Soubirous was later canonized as a Catholic saint.\n\nIn 1858, Bernadette Soubirous reported a vision of Our Lady of Lourdes. A simple 14-year-old peasant girl of no significant educational experience, Soubirous claimed she saw “\"uo petito damizelo\"”, \"a petite damsel,\" in white, with a golden rosary and blue belt fastened around her waist, and two golden roses at her feet. In subsequent visitations she heard the lady speak to her, saying \"Que soy Immaculada Concepcion\" (\"I am the Immaculate Conception\"), and asking that a chapel be built there. At first ridiculed, questioned, and belittled by Church officials and other contemporaries, Soubirous insisted on her vision. Eventually the Church believed her and she was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933.\n\nAfter church investigations confirmed her visions, a large church was built at the site. Lourdes is now a major Marian pilgrimage site: within France, only Paris has more hotels than Lourdes.\n\nOn 11 February 1858, Soubirous went with her sister Toinette and neighbor Jeanne Abadie to collect some firewood and bones in order to buy some bread. After taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she heard the sound of two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.\n\nSoubirous tried to make the sign of the Cross but she could not, because her hands were trembling. The lady smiled, and invited Soubirous to pray the rosary with her. Soubirous tried to keep this a secret, but Toinette told her mother. After parental cross-examination, she and her sister received corporal punishment for their story.\n\nThree days later, 14 February, Soubirous returned to the Grotto. She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: \"The second time was the following Sunday. ... Then I started to throw holy water in her direction, and at the same time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go. She started to smile, and bowed ... This was the second time.\"\n\nSoubirous's companions are said to have become afraid when they saw her in ecstasy. She remained ecstatic even as they returned to the village. On 18 February, she spoke of being told by the Lady to return to the Grotto over a period of two weeks. She quoted the apparition: \"The Lady only spoke to me the third time. ... She told me also that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next.\"\n\nSoubirous was ordered by her parents to never go there again. She went anyway, and on 24 February, Soubirous related that the apparition asked for prayer and penitence for the conversion of sinners. \nThe next day, she said the apparition asked her to dig in the ground and drink from the spring she found there. This made her dishevelled and some of her supporters were dismayed, but this act revealed the stream that soon became a focal point for pilgrimages. Although it was muddy at first, the stream became increasingly clean. As word spread, this water was given to medical patients of all kinds, and many reports of miraculous cures followed. Seven of these cures were confirmed as lacking any medical explanations by Professor Verges in 1860. The first person with a \"certified miracle\" was a woman whose right hand had been deformed as a consequence of an accident. Several miracles turned out to be short-term improvement or even hoaxes, and Church and government officials became increasingly concerned. The government fenced off the Grotto and issued stiff penalties for anybody trying to get near the off-limits area. In the process, Lourdes became a national issue in France, resulting in the intervention of Emperor Napoleon III with an order to reopen the grotto on 4 October 1858. The Church had decided to stay away from the controversy altogether.\n\nSoubirous, knowing the local area well, managed to visit the barricaded grotto under cover of darkness. There, on 25 March, she said she was told: \"I am the Immaculate Conception\" (\"que soy era immaculada concepciou\"). On Easter Sunday, 7 April, her examining doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held her hands over a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the Grotto. \"I have never seen her so beautiful before,\" she reported.\n\nThe Church, faced with nationwide questions, decided to institute an investigative commission on 17 November 1858. On 18 January 1860, the local bishop finally declared that: \"The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous.\" These events established the Marian veneration in Lourdes, which together with Fátima, is one of the most frequented Marian shrines in the world, and to which between 4 and 6 million pilgrims travel annually.\n\nIn 1863, Joseph-Hugues Fabisch was charged to create a statue of the Virgin according to Soubirous's description. The work was placed in the grotto and solemnly dedicated on 4 April 1864 in presence of 20,000 pilgrims.\n\nSoubirous was later canonized as a saint in 1933. \n\nThe veracity of the apparitions of Lourdes is not an article of faith for Catholics. Nevertheless, all recent Popes visited the Marian shrine at some time. Benedict XV, Pius XI, and John XXIII went there as bishops, Pius XII as papal delegate. He also issued an encyclical, \"Le pèlerinage de Lourdes\", on the one-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions in 1958. John Paul II visited Lourdes three times during his pontificate, and twice before as a bishop.\n\nMany Marian apparitions, although they may occur in different ages and cultures, share similarities. Soubirous's visions took place against a cultural backdrop of apparitions and other supernatural events that bear some resemblance to Soubirous's experiences. It is likely that Soubirous would have known of, and may even have been influenced by, such events, which were woven into the fabric of her society.\n\nIn nearby Lestelle-Bétharram, only a few kilometres from Lourdes, some shepherds guarding their flocks in the mountains observed a vision of a ray of light that guided them to the discovery of a statue of the Virgin Mary. Two attempts were made to remove the statue to a more prominent position; each time it disappeared and returned to its original location, at which a small chapel was built for it.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, a twelve-year-old shepherdess called Anglèze de Sagazan received a vision of the Virgin Mary near the spring at Garaison (part of the commune of Monléon-Magnoac), somewhat further away. Anglèze's story is strikingly similar to that of Soubirous: she was a pious but illiterate and poorly educated girl, extremely impoverished, who spoke only in the local language, Gascon Occitan, but successfully convinced authorities that her vision was genuine and persuaded them to obey the instructions of her apparitions. Like Soubirous, she was the only one who could see the apparition (others could apparently hear it); however, the apparition at Garaison's supernatural powers tended toward the miraculous provision of abundant food, rather than healing the sick and injured. Mid-nineteenth century commentators noted the parallels between the events at Massabielle and Garaison, and interpreted the similarities as proof of the divine nature of Soubirous's claims. At the time of Soubirous, Garaison was a noted center of pilgrimage and Marian devotion.\n\nThere are also several similarities between the apparition at La Salette, near Grenoble, and Lourdes. La Salette is many hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, Virgin Mary's appearance of La Salette was tall and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages. It is not certain if Soubirous was aware of the events at La Salette.\n\nOn 18 January 1862, Bishop Laurence, the Bishop of Tarbes, declared the following:\n\nBecause the apparitions are private, and not public revelations, Catholics are not required to believe them. They do not add any additional material to the truths of the Catholic Church as expressed in \"public revelation\". Soubirous said, \"One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church celebrates a mass in honor of \"Our Lady of Lourdes\" (optional memorial) in many countries on February 11 of each year — the anniversary of the first apparition. There had long been a tradition of interpreting the Song of Songs as an allegory of God's love for the Church, so up until the liturgical reforms following Vatican II, a passage from this Old Testament book was used during the mass for its reference to the \"beloved\" appearing in a cleft of a rock and its parallel with what Catholics have described as the \"Mother of the Church\" being seen in the cleft of a rock in Lourdes.\n\nPope Pius IX approved the veneration in Lourdes and supported the building of the Cathedral in 1870 to which he donated several gifts. He approved the veneration and promoted Marian piety in Lourdes with the granting of special indulgences and the formation of local Lourdes associations. Pope Leo XIII crowned Our Lady of La Salette and issued an apostolic letter \"Parte Humanae Generi\" in commemoration of the consecration of the new Cathedral in Lourdes in 1879. Pope Benedict XV, when archbishop of Bologna, organized a diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes, asking for the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin there. In 1907, Pope Pius X introduced the feast of the apparition of the Immaculate Virgin of Lourdes. In the same year he issued his encyclical \"Pascendi dominici gregis\", in which he specifically repeated the permission to venerate the virgin in Lourdes.\n\nIn 1937, Pius XI nominated Eugenio Pacelli as his 'Papal Delegate' to personally visit and venerate in Lourdes. Pius XI beatified Soubirous on 6 June 1925. He canonized her on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 1933 and determined her Feast Day to be 18 February. Soubirous, who suffered from asthma and bone cancer, had lived on the borderline of social acceptance in the church during her lifetime. The Virgin Mary reportedly told Soubirous 'that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next.'\n\nPope Pius XII, commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the Immaculate conception dogma, announced a Marian year, the first one on Church history. In his encyclical \"Fulgens corona\", he described the events in Lourdes:\n\n\"Le pèlerinage de Lourdes\", the only encyclical written on Lourdes, was issued on the centenary of the apparitions at Lourdes. The Pope presents Mary as the model of alternative lifestyle. The school of Mary teaches selflessness and charity.\n\nThe Basilica of St. Pius X was consecrated on 25 March 1958, by the Patriarch of Venice, cardinal Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII. Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, had visited Lourdes as archbishop of Milan. Pope John Paul II undertook three pilgrimages to Lourdes, the last one shortly before his death. Pope Benedict XVI visited Lourdes commemorating the 150th anniversary of the apparitions in September 2008. Born on Soubirous' feast day 16 April in 1927, three days after his 78th birthday the then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected to the See of Peter on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave and celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24 April 2005.\n\nThe location of the spring was described to Soubirous by an apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes on 25 February 1858. Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to \"drink at the spring and wash in it\".\n\nAlthough never formally encouraged by the Church, Lourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. Since the apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it, and the Lourdes authorities provide it free of charge to any who ask for it.\n\nAn analysis of the water was commissioned by Mayor Anselme Lacadé of Lourdes in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in Toulouse, who determined that the water was potable and that it contained the following: oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, carbonates of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of iron, an alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of potassium and sodium, traces of sulphates of potassium and soda, traces of ammonia, and traces of iodine. Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring Cauterets and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.\n\nHistorical, psychological, natural analogies and other empirical explanations have been forwarded, all of which are welcomed by the Catholic Church, provided they are generally open-ended and unbiased. \n\nSoubirous described the apparition as \"uo petito damizelo\" (\"a tiny maiden\") of about twelve years old. Soubirous insisted that the apparition was no taller than herself. At tall, Soubirous was diminutive even by the standards of other poorly nourished children.\n\nSoubirous described that the apparition as dressed in a flowing white robe, with a blue sash around her waist. This was the uniform of a religious group called the Children of Mary, which, on account of her poverty, Soubirous was not permitted to join (although she was admitted after the apparitions). Her Aunt Bernarde was a long-time member.\n\nThe statue that currently stands in the niche within the grotto of Massabielle was created by the Lyonnais sculptor Joseph-Hugues Fabisch in 1864. Although it has become an iconographic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Soubirous's description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. On seeing the statue, Soubirous was profoundly disappointed with this representation of her vision.\n\nThe Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes or the Domain (as it is most commonly known) is an area of ground surrounding the shrine (Grotto) to Our Lady of Lourdes in the town of Lourdes, France. This ground is owned and administrated by the Church, and has several functions, including devotional activities, offices, and accommodation for sick pilgrims and their helpers. The Domain includes the Grotto itself, the nearby taps which dispense the Lourdes water, and the offices of the Lourdes Medical Bureau, as well as several churches and basilicas. It comprises an area of 51 hectares, and includes 22 separate places of worship. There are six official languages of the Sanctuary: French, English, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and German.\n\n\nTo ensure claims of cures were examined properly and to protect the town from fraudulent claims of miracles, the Lourdes Medical Bureau (Bureau Medical) was established at the request of Pope Saint Pius X. It is completely under medical rather than ecclesiastical supervision. Approximately 7000 people have sought to have their case confirmed as a miracle, of which 69 have been declared a scientifically inexplicable miracle by both the Bureau and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe officially recognized miracle cures in Lourdes are among the least controversial in the Catholic world, because Lourdes from the very beginning was subject to intense medical investigation from skeptical doctors around the world. All medical doctors with the appropriate specialization in the area of the cure have unlimited access to the files and documents of the Lourdes Medical Bureau (Bureau Medical), which also contains all approved and disapproved miracles. Most officially recognized cures in Lourdes were openly discussed and reported on in the media at the time. Nevertheless, there were a few instances where medically ascertained incomprehension turned out not to be miracles, because the illness reappeared in later years. In the vast number of cases however, the judgment of the medical and ecclesiastical authorities was upheld as beyond medical explanation in later critical investigations.\n\nThe pilgrimage site is visited by millions each year, and Lourdes has become one of the prominent pilgrimage sites of the world. Miraculous healings have been claimed, and a number of these have been documented by the Lourdes Medical Commission. Large numbers of sick pilgrims travel to Lourdes each year in the hope of physical healing or spiritual renewal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23877930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23877930", "title": "Papunhank", "text": "Papunhank\n\nPapunhank was born in the early 18-century, he was a Munsee man whose ancestors were notable sachems. He spent his entire life growing up in the area around the Susquehanna Valley, a region which increasingly became embroiled in violence between settlers and Indigenous nations, including Munsee, Conoy, Nanticoke, Mahican, and Lenape. While Papunhank eventually converted to Christianity, during his early life he had been regarded as a prophet in Munsee society. Up until the 1750’s he reportedly struggled with an alcohol problem but following the death of his father, he isolated himself for five days in the woods and was struck by a spiritual vision which had a profound impact on his life. He became even further devoted to God, and renounced alcohol and became a pacifist. Papunhank came to use aspects of both Christianity and traditional Munsee spirituality, and was seen as a medicine man by many of his people.\n\nScholars such as Earl Olmstead have argued that white settlement pressure caused Papunhank, alongside his family and other Munsee people to start a village named Machiwihilusing upon the Susquehanna river. Amongst the village which had a population of some 300 people, almost half became followers of Papunhank, and to European settlers they became known as “Quaker or religious Indians”, emphasizing the perceived gap between the two cultures. His syncretism of Munsee spirituality and Christianity was a source of conflict with some European missionaries, who sought a decreased emphasis on Indigenous traditional world views. Some of these Europeans went so far as to call him a heathen, criticizing his adaptation of Christianity as offensive. Papunhank invited some Moravian Christians to visit the village in the year 1756, where concerns were raised over the outbreak of the Seven Years War and general anxieties about the deterioration in Indigenous-settler relations were discussed.\n\nPapunhank’s skills as a negotiator and diplomat are worth noting, both for his impact within Indigenous society and in his interactions with colonial officials. He became critical of economic agreements made with colonial governments, and in 1760 refused offers of gifts from Pennsylvania, pointing to the ways in which some of these gift giving agreements had been used to exploit Indigenous communities into disadvantageous treaties. Instead, he adopted an argument that trade relationships should not be based on kinship ties, drawing on his Christian faith to emphasize that economic agreements should be equitable under God, attempting to find new grounds for more advantageous arrangements for his community. Papunhank would again formulate criticisms and questions for Quaker missionaries in 1761, suggesting that although Europeans claimed to adhere to the Bible, they frequently interacted with Indigenous people in a way that clearly disregarded their scripture. As he argued, the Bible was supposed to direct the way in which Europeans lived their lives, yet they clearly adopted it only when it suited them, while continuing to dictate to Indigenous people how they should live their lives.\n\nMichael Goode is one scholar who has argued that Papunhank, in addition to his efforts to support temperance within his community, lobbied for cutting alcohol sales and trading by white settlers, efforts which gained him further attention from Quaker society. Papunhank’s critique of alcohol and its effect on society had a profound impact, as he became a model of piety and temperance to Quakers, many of whom were involved in the alcohol trade. The location of Machiwihilusing with its proximity to the Pennsylvania settlements, encouraged Papunhank to engage in these diplomatic exchanges, attempting to bridge the gap between the communities by making himself an indispensable ally to the Pennsylvania government. For example, he reached out to the governor in 1763 after the Paxton Boys massacred some Susquehannock Indigenous people, appealing to settlers’ common faith in an attempt to de-escalate the cyclical violence of the period. His efforts to bring about more peaceful relationships with settlers at times brought him trouble from Indigenous groups, at one point he was attacked and injured with a tomahawk for accosting some Indigenous people who had stolen horses from colonizers. While Papunhank may not have wielded a position of power over all Munsee people, he certainly held enough influence to catch the attention of missionaries, several of whom visited his village. When he preached to a Quaker audience via means of a translator, some in attendance came to believe that he had been blessed with direct communication with God and were struck with his similarities to their religious world views.\n\nOne Quaker who took the journey to Machiwihilusing was John Woolman, who felt compelled to do so after having met Papunhank earlier in 1761 when he had been in Philadelphia. To embark on such a journey during a time of increasing violence speaks to his dedication to see Papunhank again, visiting his village despite language and cultural barriers. He would write fondly of his time spent in the region, describing feelings of mutuality while engaging in a shared feeling of religious experience that contrasted much of the violence that surrounded them. In 1763, Papunhank was baptised as a Moravian by a prominent missionary and clergyman David Zeisberger, during his visit to the settlement. He adopted the name Johannes, and in the context of heightened colonial violence infringing upon their village he petitioned officials in Philadelphia to start a new settlement with Moravian support. This settlement began in 1765 and came to be known as Friedenshutten, which was composed of mostly Munsee and Mohicans with a limited number of Moravian settlers. This community was short-lived and was displaced by 1768 following an influx of white British colonizers. In 1771 an accusation was levelled against Papunhank by another Munsee healer, who alleged that Papunhank may have poisoned a community member. These rumours were ultimately sidelined but are reflective of divisions within his social group. Papunhank retained his spiritual and religious views until he eventually died May 15, 1775. He left behind a daughter named Sophia."}

He gained worldwide fame as the bass guitarist and singer for the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of popular music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon remains the most successful in history. After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.\n\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \"Yesterday\", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and he had 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.\n\nMcCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children.\n\nJames Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\"Jim\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael and a stepsister, Ruth. The children were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant, who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.\n\nMcCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees, he passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: \"I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\"\n\nMcCartney's mother, Mary, was a midwife and the family's primary wage earner; her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964. She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow\". On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an embolism. McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, had died when he was 17.\n\nMcCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn by ear. At age 11, he encouraged Paul to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir but he was not accepted. Paul then joined the choir at St Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill. He gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, since he wanted to be able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.\n\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960. By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including \"Johnny and the Moondogs\", \"Beatals\" and \"the Silver Beetles\". They adopted the name \"the Beatles\" in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.\n\nThe Beatles were informally represented by Allan Williams; in 1960, the group booked its first performance at a residency in Hamburg. In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player. While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\".\n\nIn August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet. Included on the \"Help!\" LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. \"Yesterday\" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album \"Rubber Soul\", McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, \"from [1965] ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and \"de facto\" musical director of the Beatles.\" Critics described \"Rubber Soul\" as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song \"In My Life\". McCartney said of the album, \"we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the \"Rubber Soul\" sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky.\"\n\nIn 1966, the Beatles released the album \"Revolver\". Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock, the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides, the single \"Paperback Writer\" preceded the LP's release. The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, \"Rain\". The films, described by Harrison as \"the forerunner of videos\", aired on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\" in June 1966. \"Revolver\" also included McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet. According to Gould, the song is \"a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song\". Except for some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.\n\nThe band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour. Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project independently of the group—a film score for the UK production \"The Family Way\". The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations. The soundtrack failed to chart, but it won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.\n\nUpon the end of the Beatles' performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, \"We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men ... and [we] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers.\"\n\nStarting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, \"the Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques ... limiters and ... effects like flanging and ADT.\" Their recording of \"A Day in the Life\" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's \"She's Leaving Home\" was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as \"[among] the finest work on \"Sgt. Pepper\"—imperishable popular art of its time\". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities. The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing \"spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions\", wrote Gould. Scholar David Scott Kastan described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".\n\nEpstein's death at age 32 in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future. McCartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the \"de facto\" leader and business manager of the group that Lennon had once led. In his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership, McCartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become \"Magical Mystery Tour\". According to Beatles' historian Mark Lewisohn, the project was \"an administrative nightmare throughout\". McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response. However, the film's soundtrack was more successful. It was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five songs from the band's recent singles. The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" LP achieved $8 million in sales within three weeks of its release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.\n\nThe Beatles' animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition, premiered in July 1968. Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued six months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their eponymous double album, also known as the \"White Album\". Matters worsened the following year during the \"Let It Be\" sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: \"We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away ... we were always fighting [his] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own\".\n\nIn March 1969, McCartney married his first wife, Linda Eastman, and in August, the couple had their first child, Mary, named after his late mother. \"Abbey Road\" was the band's last recorded album, and Martin suggested \"a continuously moving piece of music\", urging the group to think symphonically. McCartney agreed, but Lennon did not. They eventually compromised, agreeing to McCartney's suggestion: an LP featuring individual songs on side one, and a long medley on side two. In October 1969, a rumour surfaced that McCartney had died in a car crash in 1966 and been replaced by a lookalike, but this was quickly refuted when a November \"Life\" magazine cover featured him and his family, accompanied by the caption \"Paul is still with us\".\n\nMcCartney was in the midst of business disagreements with his bandmates when he announced his departure from the group on 10 April 1970. He filed a suit for the band's formal dissolution on 31 December 1970. More legal disputes followed as McCartney's attorneys– his in-laws John and Lee Eastman–fought the three remaining Beatles' business manager, Allen Klein, over royalties and creative control. An English court legally dissolved the Beatles on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company EMI, Klein, and each other persisted until 1989.\n\nMcCartney was depressed after the group disbanded. His wife helped him pull out of that condition by praising his work as a songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he wrote \"Maybe I'm Amazed\", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, \"that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand... Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you.\" He added that \"every love song I write is for Linda.\"\n\nAfter the Beatles broke up in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, \"McCartney\", a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, \"McCartney\" is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, \"Ram\". A UK number one and a US top five, \"Ram\" included the co-written US number-one hit single \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney had this to say on the group's formation: \"Wings were always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow [the Beatles'] success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping.\" In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.\n\nFollowing the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, \"The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe.\" During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover \"Long Tall Sally\" was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.\n\nIn March 1973, Wings achieved their first US number-one single, \"My Love\", included on their second LP, \"Red Rose Speedway\", a US number one and UK top five. McCartney's collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name. Nominated for an Academy Award, the song reached number two in the US and number nine in the UK. It also earned Martin a Grammy for his orchestral arrangement. Music professor and author Vincent Benitez described the track as \"symphonic rock at its best\".\n\nAfter the departure of McCullough and Seiwell in 1973, the McCartneys and Laine recorded \"Band on the Run\". The album was the first of seven platinum Wings LPs. It was a US and UK number one, the band's first to top the charts in both countries and the first ever to reach \"Billboard\" magazine's charts on three separate occasions. One of the best-selling releases of the decade, it remained on the UK charts for 124 weeks. \"Rolling Stone\" named it one of the Best Albums of the Year for 1973, and in 1975 Paul McCartney and Wings won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance for the song \"Band on the Run\" and Geoff Emerick won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording for the album. In 1974, Wings achieved a second US number-one single with the title track. The album also included the top-ten hits \"Jet\" and \"Helen Wheels\", and earned the 413th spot on \"Rolling Stone's\" list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nWings followed \"Band on the Run\" with the chart-topping albums \"Venus and Mars\" (1975) and \"Wings at the Speed of Sound\" (1976). In 1975, they began the fourteen-month Wings Over the World Tour, which included stops in the UK, Australia, Europe and the US. The tour marked the first time McCartney performed Beatles songs live with Wings, with five in the two-hour set list: \"I've Just Seen a Face\", \"Yesterday\", \"Blackbird\", \"Lady Madonna\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". Following the second European leg of the tour and extensive rehearsals in London, the group undertook an ambitious US arena tour that yielded the US number-one live triple LP \"Wings over America\".\n\nIn September 1977, the McCartneys had a third child, a son they named James. In November, the Wings song \"Mull of Kintyre\", co-written with Laine, was quickly becoming one of the best-selling singles in UK chart history. The most successful single of McCartney's solo career, it achieved double the sales of the previous record holder, \"She Loves You\", and went on to sell 2.5 million copies and hold the UK sales record until the 1984 charity single, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"\n\n\"London Town\" (1978) spawned a US number-one single (\"With a Little Luck\"), and was Wings' best-selling LP since \"Band on the Run\", making the top five in both the US and the UK. Critical reception was unfavourable, and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album. \"Back to the Egg\" (1979) featured McCartney's collaboration with a rock supergroup dubbed \"the Rockestra\". Credited to Wings, the band included Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, Gary Brooker, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Though certified platinum, critics panned the album. Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs \"Got to Get You into My Life\", \"The Fool on the Hill\" and \"Let it Be\".\nIn 1980, McCartney released his second solo LP, the self-produced \"McCartney II\", which peaked at number one in the UK and number three in the US. As with his first album, he composed and performed it alone. The album contained the song \"Coming Up\", the live version of which, recorded in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1979 by Wings, became the group's last number-one hit. By 1981, McCartney felt he had accomplished all he could creatively with Wings and decided he needed a change. The group disbanded in April 1981 after Laine quit following disagreements over royalties and salaries.\n\nIn 1982, McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martin-produced number-one hit \"Ebony and Ivory\", included on McCartney's \"Tug of War\" LP, and with Michael Jackson on \"The Girl Is Mine\" from \"Thriller\". \"Ebony and Ivory\" was McCartney's record 28th single to hit number one on the \"Billboard\" 100. The following year, he and Jackson worked on \"Say Say Say\", McCartney's most recent US number one . McCartney earned his latest UK number one with the title track of his LP release that year, \"Pipes of Peace\".\n\nIn 1984, McCartney starred in the musical \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", a feature film he also wrote and produced which included Starr in an acting role. Disparaged by critics, \"Variety\" described the film as \"characterless, bloodless, and pointless\". Roger Ebert awarded it a single star and wrote, \"you can safely skip the movie and proceed directly to the soundtrack\". The album fared much better, reaching number one in the UK and producing the US top-ten hit single \"No More Lonely Nights\", featuring David Gilmour on lead guitar. In 1985, Warner Brothers commissioned McCartney to write a song for the comedic feature film \"Spies Like Us\". He composed and recorded the track in four days, with Phil Ramone co-producing. McCartney participated in Live Aid, performing \"Let it Be\", but technical difficulties rendered his vocals and piano barely audible for the first two verses, punctuated by squeals of feedback. Equipment technicians resolved the problems and David Bowie, Alison Moyet, Pete Townshend and Bob Geldof joined McCartney on stage, receiving an enthusiastic crowd reaction.\n\nMcCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on \"Press to Play\" (1986), with Stewart co-writing more than half the songs on the LP. In 1988, McCartney released \"Снова в СССР\", initially available only in the Soviet Union, which contained eighteen covers; recorded over the course of two days. In 1989, he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\", for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund. That same year, he released \"Flowers in the Dirt\"; a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins.\nMcCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda, with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars, Paul \"Wix\" Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums. In September 1989, they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour, his first in over a decade. During the tour, McCartney performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990, when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. That year, he released the triple album \"Tripping the Live Fantastic\", which contained selected performances from the tour.\n\nMcCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing \"Liverpool Oratorio\". The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. \"The Guardian\" was especially critical, describing the music as \"afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo\", and adding that the piece has \"little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole\". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, \"happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work.\" \"The New York Times\" was slightly more generous, stating, \"There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions\". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the \"Liverpool Oratorio\" reached number one on the UK classical chart, \"Music Week\".\n\nIn 1991, McCartney performed a selection of acoustic-only songs on \"MTV Unplugged\" and released a live album of the performance titled \"Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)\". During the 1990s, McCartney collaborated twice with Youth of Killing Joke as the musical duo \"the Fireman\". The two released their first electronica album together, \"Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest\", in 1993. McCartney released the rock album \"Off the Ground\" in 1993. The subsequent New World Tour followed, which led to the release of the \"Paul Is Live\" album later that year.\n\nStarting in 1994, McCartney took a four-year break from his solo career to work on Apple's \"Beatles Anthology\" project with Harrison, Starr and Martin. He recorded a radio series called \"Oobu Joobu\" in 1995 for the American network Westwood One, which he described as \"widescreen radio\". Also in 1995, Prince Charles presented him with an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Music—\"kind of amazing for somebody who doesn't read a note of music\", commented McCartney.\n\nIn 1997, McCartney released the rock album \"Flaming Pie\". Starr appeared on drums and backing vocals in \"Beautiful Night\". Later that year, he released the classical work \"Standing Stone\", which topped the UK and US classical charts. In 1998, he released \"Rushes\", the second electronica album by the Fireman. In 1999, McCartney released \"Run Devil Run\". Recorded in one week, and featuring Ian Paice and David Gilmour, it was primarily an album of covers with three McCartney originals. He had been planning such an album for years, having been previously encouraged to do so by Linda, who had died of cancer in April 1998.\n\nMcCartney did an unannounced performance at the benefit tribute, \"Concert for Linda,\" his wife of 29 years who died a year earlier. It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 10 April 1999, and was organised by two of her close friends, Chrissie Hynde and Carla Lane. Also during 1999, he continued his experimentation with orchestral music on \"Working Classical\".\n\nIn 2000, he released the electronica album \"Liverpool Sound Collage\" with Super Furry Animals and Youth, using the sound collage and musique concrète techniques that had fascinated him in the mid-1960s. He contributed the song \"Nova\" to a tribute album of classical, choral music called \"A Garland for Linda\" (2000), dedicated to his late wife.\n\nHaving witnessed the 11 September 2001 attacks from the JFK airport tarmac, McCartney was inspired to take a leading role in organising the Concert for New York City. His studio album release in November that year, \"Driving Rain\", included the song \"Freedom\", written in response to the attacks. The following year, McCartney went out on tour with a band that included guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, accompanied by Paul \"Wix\" Wickens on keyboards and Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums. They began the Driving World Tour in April 2002, which included stops in the US, Mexico and Japan. The tour resulted in the double live album \"Back in the US\", released internationally in 2003 as \"Back in the World\". The tour earned a reported $126.2 million, an average of over $2 million per night, and \"Billboard\" named it the top tour of the year. The group continues to play together; McCartney has played live with Brian Ray, Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel Jr. and Wix Wickens longer than he played live with the Beatles.\n\nIn July 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills. In November, on the first anniversary of George Harrison's death, McCartney performed at the Concert for George. He participated in the National Football League's Super Bowl, performing \"Freedom\" during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 and headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. The English College of Arms honoured McCartney in 2002 by granting him a coat of arms. His crest, featuring a Liver bird holding an acoustic guitar in its claw, reflects his background in Liverpool and his musical career. The shield includes four curved emblems which resemble beetles' backs. The arms' motto is \"Ecce Cor Meum\", Latin for \"Behold My Heart\". In 2003, the McCartneys had a child, Beatrice Milly.\n\nIn July 2005, he performed at the Live 8 event in Hyde Park, London, opening the show with \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (with U2) and closing it with \"Drive My Car\" (with George Michael), \"Helter Skelter\", and \"The Long and Winding Road\". In September, he released the rock album \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\", for which he provided most of the instrumentation. In 2006, McCartney released the classical work \"Ecce Cor Meum\". The rock album \"Memory Almost Full\" followed in 2007. In 2008, he released his third Fireman album, \"Electric Arguments\". Also in 2008, he performed at a concert in Liverpool to celebrate the city's year as European Capital of Culture. In 2009, after a four-year break, he returned to touring and has since performed over 80 shows. More than forty-five years after the Beatles first appeared on American television during \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", he returned to the same New York theatre to perform on \"Late Show with David Letterman\". On 9 September 2009, EMI reissued the Beatles catalogue following a four-year digital remastering effort, releasing a music video game called \"\" the same day.\n\nMcCartney's enduring fame has made him a popular choice to open new venues. In 2009, he played to three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field—a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. These performances yielded the double live album \"Good Evening New York City\" later that year.\n\nIn 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 2011, McCartney performed at two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium. A \"New York Times\" review of the first concert reported that McCartney was \"not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts.\" McCartney was commissioned by the New York City Ballet, and In September 2011 he released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called \"Ocean's Kingdom\". Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell. He released \"Kisses on the Bottom\", a collection of standards, in February 2012; that same month the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honoured him as the MusiCares Person of the Year, two days prior to his performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nMcCartney remains one of the world's top draws. He played to over 100,000 people during two performances in Mexico City in May, with the shows grossing nearly $6 million. In June 2012, McCartney closed Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace, performing a set that included \"Let It Be\" and \"Live and Let Die\". He closed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 27 July, singing \"The End\" and \"Hey Jude\" and inviting the audience to join in on the coda. Having donated his time, he received £1 from the Olympic organisers.\nOn 12 December, McCartney performed with three former members of Nirvana (Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Pat Smear) during the closing act of , seen by approximately two billion people worldwide. On 28 August 2013, McCartney released the title track of his upcoming studio album \"New\", which came out in October 2013. A primetime entertainment special was taped 27 January 2014 at the Ed Sullivan Theater with a 9 February 2014 CBS airing. The show featured Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, and celebrated the legacy of the seven-time Grammy-winning group the Beatles and their groundbreaking 1964 first performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". The show, titled \"\", featured 22 classic Beatles songs as performed by various artists, which included original Beatles McCartney and Starr.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, the news reported that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders due to an unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included a stop at the famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take it easy to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966. In 2014, McCartney wrote and performed \"Hope for the Future,\" the ending song for the video game \"Destiny\". In November 2014, a 42-song tribute album titled \"The Art of McCartney\" was released, which features a wide range of artists covering McCartney's solo and Beatles work. Also that year, McCartney collaborated with American recording artist Kanye West on the single \"Only One\", released on 31 December.\n\nIn January 2015, McCartney collaborated with West and Barbadian singer Rihanna on the single \"FourFiveSeconds\". They released a music video for the song in January and performed it live at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on 8 February 2015. McCartney is a featured guest on West's 2015 single \"All Day\", which also features Theophilus London and Allan Kingdom. On 15 February 2015, McCartney appeared and performed with Paul Simon for the \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\". McCartney and Simon performed the first verse of \"I've Just Seen a Face\" on acoustic guitars, and McCartney later performed \"Maybe I'm Amazed\". McCartney shared lead vocals on the Alice Cooper-led \"Hollywood Vampires\" supergroup's cover of his song \"Come and Get It\" which appears on their debut album, released 11 September 2015. On 10 June 2016, McCartney released the career-spanning collection \"Pure McCartney\". The set includes songs from throughout McCartney's solo career and his work with Wings and the Fireman, and is available in three different formats (2-CD, 4-CD, 4-LP and Digital). The 4-CD version includes 67 tracks, the majority of which were top 40 hits. McCartney appeared in the adventure film \"\", which was released in 2017.\n\nIn January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, McCartney released two songs, \"I Don't Know\" and \"Come On to Me\", from his album \"Egypt Station\", which was released on 7 September through Capitol Records. \"Egypt Station\" became McCartney's first album in 36 years to top the \"Billboard 200\", and his first to debut at number one.\n\nMcCartney was largely a self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as \"by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". McCartney commented, \"I prefer to think of my approach to music as ... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training.\"\n\nMcCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He does not use slapping techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.\n\nDuring McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.\n\nMacDonald identified \"She's a Woman\" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out \"Rubber Soul\" as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on \"The Word\". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track \"a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.\" MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and Wilson Pickett's \"In the Midnight Hour\", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he \"delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date\".\n\nBacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song \"Rain\" as \"an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.\" MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in \"exotic melismas in the bass part\" on \"Rain\" and described the playing as \"so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track\". By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed \"Something\" as creative but overly busy and \"too fussily extemporised\". McCartney identified \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\n\nMcCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include \"Yesterday\", \"I'm Looking Through You\", \"Michelle\", \"Blackbird\", \"I Will\", \"Mother Nature's Son\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\". McCartney singled out \"Blackbird\" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: \"I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time ... I was trying to emulate those folk players.\" He employed a similar technique for \"Jenny Wren\". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.\n\nMcCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a \"fiercely angular slide guitar solo\" on \"Drive My Car\", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument, \"if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this.\" He contributed what MacDonald described as \"a startling guitar solo\" on the Harrison composition \"Taxman\" and the \"shrieking\" guitar on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Helter Skelter\". MacDonald also praised McCartney's \"coruscating pseudo-Indian\" guitar solo on \"Good Morning Good Morning\". McCartney also played lead guitar on \"Another Girl\".\n\nDuring his years with Wings, McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members, though he played most of the lead guitar on \"Band on the Run\". In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, \"but I still like Hendrix the best\". He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.\n\nOften renowned as one of the greatest singers in pop music, McCartney was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by \"Rolling Stone\", voted the 8th greatest singer ever by \"NME\" readers and number 10 by \"Music Radar\" readers in the list of \"the 30 greatest lead singers of all time\". He is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves. Heavily influenced by Little Richard, McCartney's vocals would cross several musical genres throughout his career. On \"Call Me Back Again\", according to Benitez, \"McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist\" while MacDonald called \"I'm Down\" \"a rock-and-roll classic\" that \"illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility\". MacDonald described \"Helter Skelter\" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and \"Hey Jude\" as a \"pop/rock hybrid\", pointing out McCartney's \"use of gospel-style melismas\" in the song and his \"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out\". Benitez identified \"Hope of Deliverance\" and \"Put It There\" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" and \"Honey Pie\" attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the \"swinging beat\" of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, \"She's a Woman\" as \"the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date\", with McCartney's voice \"at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment.\" MacDonald described \"I've Got a Feeling\" as a \"raunchy, mid-tempo rocker\" with a \"robust and soulful\" vocal performance and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as \"the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers\", McCartney's \"belting\" vocals among his best since \"Drive My Car\", recorded three years earlier.\n\nMcCartney also teasingly tried out classical singing, namely singing various renditions of \"Besame Mucho\" with the Beatles. He continued experimenting with various musical and vocal styles throughout his post-Beatles career. \"Monkberry Moon Delight\" was described by Pitchfork's Jayson Greene as \"an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear\", adding that \"it could be a latter-day Tom Waits performance\". Over the years, McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by a number of renowned artists, including Chris Cornell, Billy Joel, Steven Tyler, Brad Delp and Axl Rose.\n\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including \"She's a Woman\", \"For No One\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". MacDonald considered the piano part in \"Lady Madonna\" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and \"Let It Be\" as having a gospel rhythm. MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" an integral feature of the song's character. McCartney played a Moog synthesizer on the Beatles song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and the Wings track \"Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)\". Ingham described the Wings songs \"With a Little Luck\" and \"London Town\" as being \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches\".\n\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Dear Prudence\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo albums \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\", as well as on the Wings album \"Band on the Run\" and most of the drums on his solo LP \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\". McCartney also played drums on Paul Jones' rendition of \"And the Sun Will Shine\" in 1968. Using the pseudonym Paul Ramon, which he had first used during the Beatles first tour in Scotland in 1960, McCartney played drums on Steve Miller Band's 1969 tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him. Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as \"electronic symphonies\". He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"The Fool on the Hill\".\n\nMcCartney's earliest musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry. When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the \"Sgt. Pepper\" cover, McCartney replied, \"Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King.\" McCartney stated that for his bassline for \"I Saw Her Standing There\", he directly quoted Berry's \"I'm Talking About You\".\n\nMcCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalisations inspired McCartney's own vocal technique. McCartney said he wrote \"I'm Down\" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation. In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual \"Buddy Holly Week\" in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.\n\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college. During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, using his painting of an apple for the Apple Records logo. McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also co-founded \"International Times\", an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, \"Many Years From Now\" (1997).\n\nMcCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool. McCartney said, \"I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet\". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.\n\nWhen McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their \"word power\", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published \"Blackbird Singing\", a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: \"When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since\". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, \"High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail\", a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. \"The Observer\" labelled it an \"anti-capitalist children's book\".\n\nIn 1981, McCartney asked Geoff Dunbar to direct a short animated film called \"Rupert and the Frog Song\"; McCartney was the writer and producer, and he also added some of the character voices. His song \"We All Stand Together\" from the film's soundtrack reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1992, he worked with Dunbar on an animated film about the work of French artist Honoré Daumier, which won them a BAFTA award. In 2004, they worked together on the animated short film \"Tropic Island Hum\". The accompanying single, \"Tropic Island Hum\"/\"We All Stand Together\", reached number 21 in the UK.\n\nMcCartney also produced and hosted \"The Real Buddy Holly Story\", a 1985 documentary featuring interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, the Holly family, and others. In 1995, he made a guest appearance on the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa the Vegetarian\" and directed a short documentary about the Grateful Dead.\n\nSince the Rich List began in 1989, McCartney has been the UK's wealthiest musician, with an estimated fortune of £730 million in 2015. In addition to an interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, an umbrella company for his business interests, he owns a significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals \"Guys and Dolls\", \"A Chorus Line\", \"Annie\" and \"Grease\". He earned £40 million in 2003, the highest income that year within media professions in the UK. This rose to £48.5 million by 2005. McCartney's 18-date On the Run Tour grossed £37 million in 2012.\n\nMcCartney signed his first recording contract, as a member of the Beatles, with Parlophone Records, an EMI subsidiary, in June 1962. In the United States, the Beatles recordings were distributed by EMI subsidiary Capitol Records. The Beatles re-signed with EMI for another nine years in 1967. After forming their own record label, Apple Records, in 1968, the Beatles' recordings would be released through Apple although the masters were still owned by EMI. Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US, Canada and Japan, acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canada—reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world. As part of the deal, CBS offered McCartney ownership of Frank Music, publisher of the catalogue of American songwriter Frank Loesser. McCartney's album sales were below CBS' expectations and reportedly the company lost at least $9 million on the contract. McCartney returned to Capitol in the US in 1985, remaining with EMI until 2006. In 2007, McCartney signed with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist. He remains there 's \"Kisses on the Bottom\".\n\nIn 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney. McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and McCartney Music. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.\n\nMcCartney and Yoko Ono attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman Robert Holmes à Court. Michael Jackson subsequently purchased ATV in 1985. McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95 million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership. Northern Songs was formally dissolved in 1995, and absorbed into the Sony/ATV catalogue. McCartney receives writers' royalties which together are 33⅓ percent of total commercial proceeds in the US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent. Two of the Beatles' earliest songs—\"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\"—were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before signing with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by MPL Communications.\n\nMcCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of \"Help!\", McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.\n\nInitially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \"acid trip\" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a \"Sgt. Pepper\" studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, \"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\" He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in \"The Times\", which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.\n\nIn 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: \"cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.\" In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: \"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\" He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.\n\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian; he and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage. They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists. In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients. In 1995, he narrated the documentary \"Devour the Earth\", written by Tony Wardle. McCartney is a supporter of the animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009 McCartney narrated a video for them titled \"Glass Walls\", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare. McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation.\n\nFollowing McCartney's marriage to Mills, he joined her in a campaign against land mines, becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield. In 2003 in a meeting at the Kremlin with Vladimir Putin, ahead of a concert in Red Square, McCartney and Mills urged Russia to join the anti-landmine campaign. In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting. The couple debated with Danny Williams, Newfoundland's then Premier, on \"Larry King Live\", stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead. McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign.\n\nMcCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances, including the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Live Aid, Live 8, and the recording of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\". In 2004, he donated a song to an album to aid the \"US Campaign for Burma\", in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. In 2008, he donated a song to Aid Still Required's CD, organised as an effort to raise funds to assist with the recovery from the devastation caused in Southeast Asia by the 2004 tsunami.\n\nIn 2009, McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking him why he was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, \"He wrote back very kindly, saying, 'my doctors tell me that I must eat meat'. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right—the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'\"\n\nIn 2012, McCartney joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.\n\nSave the Arctic is a campaign to protect the Arctic and an international outcry and a renewed focus concern on oil development in the Arctic, attracting the support of more than five million people. This includes McCartney, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners.\n\nIn 2015, following British prime minister David Cameron's decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against fox hunting, McCartney was quoted: \"The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things but the vast majority of us will be against them if hunting is reintroduced. It is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself.\"\n\nIn August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton and later went to Bangor in North Wales to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation. He said, \"The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing.\" In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising three million dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.\n\nMcCartney has publicly professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, \"Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'\"\n\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959. According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like Brigitte Bardot's, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement.\n\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London. They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in St. John's Wood, in March 1966. He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including \"Yesterday\", \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\" and \"I'm Looking Through You\", the latter three having been inspired by their romance. They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with Francie Schwartz.\n\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, \"all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.\" At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, \"It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.\" The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!\" Linda said this about their meeting: \"I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up.\" The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, \"We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment.\" He added, \"We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did.\"\n\nAfter the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically and formed Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, \"she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy.\" Paul defended her musical ability: \"I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard ... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things ... she did very well and made it look easier than it was ... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic.\" He went on to say, \"We thought we were in it for the fun ... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves.\" Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, \"trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nThey had four children—Linda's daughter Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James—and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul stated in the \"Daily Mail\", \"I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time ... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.\"\n\nIn 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills, a former model and anti-landmines campaigner. In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts. They separated in April 2006 and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008. In 2004, he commented on media animosity toward his partners: \"[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher ... I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that\".\n\nMcCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The wedding was a modest event attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends. The couple had been together since November 2007. Shevell is vice-president of a family-owned transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight. She is a former member of the board of the New York area's Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nThough McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion. In later years, the two grew apart. While McCartney would often phone Lennon, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, \"You're all pizza and fairytales!\" In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread.\n\nOn 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were watching an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the \"SNL\" studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film \"Two of Us\". McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released \"Double Fantasy\", was friendly; he said this about the call: \"[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up.\"\n\nOn 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: \"It's a drag\". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained, \"When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, \"It's a drag\".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.\" He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:\n\nI talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, \"John was really fond of you.\" The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, \"it's only me.\" They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.\nIn 1983, McCartney said, \"I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his \"mask\" and have a better relationship with him.\" He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told \"Mojo\" magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, \"All Those Years Ago\", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released \"Here Today\" in 1982, a song Everett described as \"a haunting tribute\" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.\n\nDiscussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said, \"Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually ... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass ... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something.\"\n\nAfter Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney said he was \"a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour\". He went on to say, \"We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together – that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother.\" On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's \"Something\" on a ukulele at the Concert for George. He also performed \"For You Blue\" and \"All Things Must Pass\", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\nDuring a recording session for \"The Beatles\" in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band. Starr later commented on working with McCartney: \"Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined ... [to] get his own way ... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time.\"\n\nMcCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and backing vocals for \"Six O'Clock\", a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album \"Ringo\". McCartney played a kazoo solo on another track from the album \"You're Sixteen\". Starr appeared (as a fictional version of himself) in McCartney's 1984 film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", and played drums on most tracks of the soundtrack album, which includes re-recordings of several McCartney-penned Beatles songs. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on \"Beautiful Night\" from McCartney's 1997 album \"Flaming Pie\". The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's \"Vertical Man\", which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one. In 2009, the pair performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation. They collaborated on Starr's album \"Y Not\" in 2010. McCartney played bass on \"Peace Dream\", and sang a duet with Starr on \"Walk with You\". On 7 July 2010, Starr was performing at Radio City Music Hall in New York with his All-Starr Band in a concert celebrating his seventieth birthday. After the encores, McCartney made a surprise appearance, performing the Beatles' song \"Birthday\" with Starr's band. On 26 January 2014 McCartney and Starr performed \"Queenie Eye\" from McCartney's new album \"New\" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. McCartney inducted Starr into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, and plays bass on his 2017 album \"Give More Love\".\n\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999. In 1979, the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" recognised McCartney as the \"most honored composer and performer in music\", with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 with Wings) and, as a member of the Beatles, sales of over 100 million singles and 100 million albums, and as the \"most successful song writer\", he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. In 2009, \"Guinness World Records\" again recognised McCartney as the \"most successful songwriter\" having written or co-written 188 charted records in the United Kingdom, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one.\n\nMcCartney has written, or co-written 32 number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; seven solo or with Wings; one as a co-writer of \"A World Without Love\", a number-one single for Peter and Gordon; one as a co-writer on Elton John's cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; one as a co-writer on Stars on 45's \"Medley\"; one as a co-writer with Michael Jackson on \"Say Say Say\"; and one as writer on \"Ebony and Ivory\" performed with Stevie Wonder. , he has 15.5 million RIAA certified units in the United States as a solo artist plus another 10 million with Wings.\n\nCredited with more number ones in the UK than any other artist, McCartney has participated in twenty-four chart topping singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Band Aid 20 and \"The Christians et al.\" He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", the Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).\n\n\"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in history with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and according to the BBC, \"the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list ... [and] is the most played song by a British writer [last] century in the US\". His 1968 Beatles composition \"Hey Jude\" achieved the highest sales in the UK that year and topped the US charts for nine weeks, which is longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band and, at seven minutes eleven seconds, was at that time the longest number one. \"Hey Jude\" is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.\n\nIn July 2005, McCartney's performance of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with U2 at Live 8 became the fastest-released single in history. Available within forty-five minutes of its recording, hours later it had achieved number one on the UK Official Download Chart.\n\n\nHe was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25525228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25525228", "title": "Punjabi folk religion", "text": "Punjabi folk religion\n\nPunjabi folk religion incorporates local mysticism and refers to the beliefs and practices strictly indigenous to the Punjabi people, of the Punjab region including ancestral worship, worship of indigenous gods, and local festivals. There are many shrines in Punjabi folk religion which represents the folk religion of the Punjab region which is a discourse between different organised religions. These shrines represent inter-communal dialogue and a distinct form of cultural practice of saint veneration.\n\nPunjabis, irrespective of their organised religion, continue to practice Punjabi folk religion which at times runs independently of organised religion or derives beliefs from institutionalised religions which then form part of Punjabi folk religion.\n\nIn Punjabi folk cosmology, the universe is divided into three realms:\n\nDevlok is the realm of the gods, saints and ancestors, existing in akash, the sky. Ancestors can become gods or saints.\n\nA \"jathera\" is a shrine constructed to commemorate and show respect to the founding common ancestor of a surname and all subsequent common clan ancestors.\n\nWhenever a founder of a village dies, a shrine is raised to him on the outskirts of the village and a \"jandi\" tree is planted there. A village may have many such shrines.\n\nThe \"jathera\" can be named after the founder of the surname or the village. However, many villages have unnamed \"jathera\". In some families, the founder of the \"jathera\" is also a saint. In such instances, the founder has a dual role of being the head of a \"jathera\" (who is venerated by his descendants) and also of being a saint (such as Baba Jogi Pir; who can be worshiped by any one).\n\nPunjabi people believe that members of a surname all hail from one common ancestor. A surname in Punjabi is called a \"gaut\" or \"gotra\".\n\nMembers of a surname are then subdivided into smaller clans comprising related members who can trace their family tree. Typically, a clan represents people related within at least seven generations but can be more.\n\nIn ancient times, it was normal for a village to comprise members of one surname. When people moved to form a new village, they continued to pay homage to the founding \"jathera\". This is still the case for many people who may have new \"jathera\" in their villages but still pay homage to the founding ancestor of the entire surname.\n\nOver time, Punjabi villages changed their composition whereby families from different surnames came to live together. A village therefore can have one \"jathera\" which can be communally used by members of different surnames but has the founder of the village as the named ancestor or many \"jathera\" can be built to represent the common ancestors of specific surnames.\n\nWhen members of a clan form a new village, they continue to visit the \"jathera\" in the ancestral village. If this is not possible, a link is brought from the old \"jathera\" to construct a new \"jathera\" in the new village.\n\nPeople visit the \"jathera\" when getting married, the 15th of the Indian month and sometimes on the first Sunday of an Indian month. The descendants of the elder go to a pond and dig earth and make shivlinga and some put it on the mound of their \"jathera\" and offer ghee and flowers to the Jathera.So, It is a form of shivlinga puja also. In some villages it is customary to offer flour.\n\n\"Jathera\" veneration is not strictly a part of organised religion and forms part of Punjabi folk religion. \"Jathera\" veneration in Punjab does not take the same form as in organised religion and is seen as showing respect to elders.\n\nThe following are some fairs celebrated in Punjab.\n\nA large Mela is organized at village Nathana (near Bhucho Mandi) in district Bathinda in the month of February–March in honor of Baba Kaallu Nath of the Romana surname. The Mela lasts for four days. The first day is especially for Romana's and three days for all people to attend.\n\nA Mela is held in honor of Baba Kala Mehar every year in Amritsar district.\n\nThe fair takes place in and around April each year with Sandhus and people from other clans and tribes attending from around Punjab and Rajasthan.\n\nAccording to legend, Baba Kala Mehar used to tend to his cattle and one day while doing so, he happened to meet Baba Gorakh Nath (Gorakshanath). Baba Gorakh Nath asked Pir Baba Kala Mehar if he can give him some milk from his buffaloes. A miracle happened that while the cattle being tended at that time were all bulls, Baba Ji is said to have miraculously taken milk out of bulls on striking them with his stick.\n\nThe village of Bhopal falls in the Mansa tehsil of Bathinda district.\n\nThe village is known for the fair of Baba Jogi Pir who is said to be the guru (preceptor) of Chahal jatts. It is said that during the times of Mughal rule, Baba Jogi Pir fought against the forces of the Mughal rulers.\n\nDuring the battle, his head was chopped off, but his headless body kept on fighting until it fell down dead in this village. The people were deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jogi Pir, constructed a shrine, and began to hold a fair.\n\nAnother legend narrates that once a few people stayed under a grove of trees in the premises of the shrine. They felt pangs of thirst at night, but there was no source of water where from they could quench their thirst . A heavenly voice which was believed to be that of Jogi Pir was heard: “why do you die of thirst? Pick out a brick from the pond and take water”. They did likewise, found water from underneath the brick they picked up and thus they quenched their thirst.\n\nA fair is held twice annually for three days on Bhadon 28 (August–September)and Chet 16 (March- April) at the shine of Jogi Pir. It is attended by both Hindus and Sikhs. The people pay their obeisance at the shrine, especially after the birth of a child or the solemnization of marriage. Earth is also scooped one of the tank by the people for invoking the blessings of Jogi Pir.\n\nShrines in honour of saints are common in the Punjab region. A Shaheed Shrine is a building constructed to commemorate and show respect to a saint. Muslim shrines are referred to a dargahs and Hindu shrines are known as samadhs.\n\nIn the Punjab region, Khawaja Khidr is a river spirit of wells and streams. He is mentioned in the Sikandar-nama as the saint who presides over the well of immortality, and is revered by both many faiths. He is sometimes pictured as an old man dressed in green, and is believed to ride upon a fish. His principal shrine is on an island of the Indus River by Bhakkar in Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nSanjhi is a festival dedicated to the Mother Goddess.\n\nGugga Pir is venerated for protection against snakes. The fair known as Chhapar Mela is organised annually.\n\nTraditionally, on the first day of Navratri people in Punjab sow pulses, cereals and other seeds in a pot which is watered for nine days at the end of which the seeds sprout. This custom is known as \"Khetri\". It signifies prosperity and abundance. It is very important to plant grains of barley in a pot. On the tenth day, the shoots are about 3 - 5 inches in length. On Dussehra Goddess Gorja (Goddess Parvati), in the form of seedlings, is covered with a piece of red cloth and worshipped and propitiated. After saying prayers, these seedlings or the \"Khetri\" is submerged in water on Dussehra. This custom suggests a link to harvesting. The sowing and reaping of barley is symbolic of the \"first fruit\".\n\nAccordingly, Punjabi farmers traditionally start to harvest the kharif (monsoon) rice crops after Dussehra and sow the wheat (rabi crop) after Diwali. Therefore, Dussehra doubles up as a thanksgiving festival and Diwali is also considered to be a harvest festival.\n\nMany villages in Punjab, India and Pakistan, have shrines of Sakhi Sarwar who is more popularly referred to as Lakha Data Pir. There is a shrine of pir sakhi sarwar in district Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab provence of Pakistan. There is great fair held in March every year at the shrian of Lakh data pir. Village name is also sakhi sarwar. It is 34 km far away from Deara Ghazi Khan. A 9-day fair is organised every year in Mukandpur, Punjab, India.\n\nSeetla Mata is worshiped for protection against childhood diseases. A notable fair is held annually in Ludhiana district and is known as the Jarag mela.\n\nGorakhnath was an 11th to 12th centuryNath yogi, connected to Shaivism as one of the two most important disciples of Matsyendranath, the other being Caurangi. Gorakhnath healed Puran Bhagat.\n\nPuran Bhagat is a revered saint in the Punjab region and other areas of the subcontinent. He was the Prince of Sailkot and the son of Raja Sálbán. He is also worshipped as Baba Sahaj Nath Ji. Puran Bhagat received spiritual training from Gorakhnath after spending time in a well as a child, on the orders of his father.\n\nPeople visit Puran's well located in Sialkot, especially childless women travel from places as far as Quetta and Karachi.\n\nPunjabi fasts form part of Punjabi folk religion,\n\nPunjab is a state involved in agriculture. For this reason Punjabis continue to show respect to the seasonal festivals of Lohri, Basant Panchami Festival, Baisakhi and Teeyan. Over time some seasonal festivals have come to coincide with religious festivals but the original meaning of the festivals has not been lost.\n"}
{"id": "519237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519237", "title": "Ranjit Singh", "text": "Ranjit Singh\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh (1780 –1839) was the leader of the Sikh Empire, which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. He survived smallpox in infancy but lost sight in his left eye. He fought his first battle alongside his father at age 10. After his father died, he fought several wars to expel the Afghans in his teenage years and was proclaimed as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\" at age 21. His empire grew in the Punjab region under his leadership through 1839.\n\nPrior to his rise, the Punjab region had numerous warring misls (confederacies), twelve of which were under Sikh rulers and one Muslim. Ranjit Singh successfully absorbed and united the Sikh misls and took over other local kingdoms to create the Sikh Empire. He repeatedly defeated invasions by outside armies, particularly those arriving from Afghanistan, and established friendly relations with the British.\n\nRanjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernisation, investment into infrastructure and general prosperity. His Khalsa army and government included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. His legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He was popularly known as \"Sher-e-Punjab\", or \"Lion of Punjab\".\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh was succeeded by his son Maharaja Kharak Singh.\n\nRanjit Singh was born on 13 November 1780, to Maha Singh Sukerchakia and Raj Kaur – the daughter of Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind, in Gujranwala, in the Majha region of Punjab (now in Pakistan) His birth name was Buddh Singh, after his ancestor who was a disciple of Guru Gobind Singh, a Khalsa, and whose descendants created the Sukerchakia \"misl\" before the birth of Ranjit Singh, which became the most powerful of many small Sikh kingdoms in northwestern Southern Asia in the wake of the disintegrating Mughal Empire. The child's name was changed to Ranjit (literally, \"victor in battle\") by his father to commemorate his army's victory over the Muslim Chatha chieftain Pir Muhammad.\n\nRanjit Singh contracted smallpox as an infant, which resulted in the loss of sight in his left eye and a pockmarked face. He was short in stature, never schooled, and did not learn to read or write anything beyond the Gurmukhi alphabet, however, he was trained at home in horse riding, musketry and other martial arts.\n\nAt age 12, his father died. He then inherited his father's Sukkarchakkia misl estates and was raised by his mother Raj Kaur, who, along with Lakhpat Rai, also managed the estates. The first attempt on his life was made when he was age 13, by Hashmat Khan, but Ranjit Singh prevailed and killed the assailant instead. At age 18, his mother died and Lakhpat Rai was assassinated, and thereon he was helped by his mother-in-law from his first marriage.\n\nIn his teens, Ranjit Singh took to alcohol, a habit that intensified in the later decades of his life, according to the chronicles of his court historians and the Europeans who visited him. However, he neither smoked nor ate beef, and required all officials in his court, regardless of their religion, to adhere to these restrictions as part of their employment contract.\n\nRanjit Singh married many times, in various ceremonies, and had twenty wives. Some scholars note that the information on Ranjit Singh's marriages is unclear, and there is evidence that he had many mistresses. According to Khushwant Singh in an 1889 interview with the French journal \"\", his son Dalip (Duleep) Singh remarked, \"I am the son of one of my father's forty-six wives\".\n\nAt age 15, Ranjit Singh married his first wife Mehtab Kaur, the only daughter of Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya and his wife Sada Kaur, and the granddaughter of Jai Singh Kanhaiya, the founder of the Kanhaiya Misl. This marriage was pre-arranged in an attempt to reconcile warring Sikh \"misls\", wherein Mahtab Kaur was betrothed to Ranjit Singh. However, the marriage failed, with Mehtab Kaur never forgiving the fact that her father had been killed by Ranjit Singh's father and she mainly lived with her mother after marriage. The separation became complete when Ranjit Singh married his second wife Raj Kaur of Nakai Misl in 1798. Mehtab Kaur died in 1813.\n\nRaj Kaur (renamed Datar Kaur), the daughter of Sardar Ran Singh Nakai, the third ruler of Nakai Misl, was Ranjit Singh's second wife and the mother of his heir, Kharak Singh. She changed her name from Raj Kaur to avoid confusion with Ranjit Singh's mother. Throughout her life she remained the favourite of Ranjit Singh, who called her \"Mai Nakain\". Like his first marriage, the second marriage brought him a strategic military alliance. His second wife died in 1818.\n\nRatan Kaur and Daya Kaur were wives of Sahib Singh Bhangi of Gujrat (a \"misl\" north of Lahore, not to be confused the state of Gujarat). After Sahib Singh's death, Ranjit Singh took them under his protection in 1811 by marrying them via the rite of \"chādar andāzī\", in which a cloth sheet was unfurled over each of their heads. Ratan Kaur gave birth to Multana Singh in 1819, and Daya Kaur gave birth to Kashmira Singh in 1819 and to Pashaura Singh in 1821.\n\nHis other wives include Moran Sarkar in 1802, Chand Kaur in 1815, Lakshmi in 1820, Mehatab Kaur in 1822, Saman Kaur in 1832, as well as Guddan, Banso, Gulbahar, Gulab, Ram Devi, Rani, Bannat, Har and Danno before his last marriage.\n\nJind Kaur was the final spouse of Ranjit Singh. Her father, Manna Singh Aulakh, extolled her virtues to Ranjit Singh, who was concerned about the frail health of his only heir, Kharak Singh. The Maharaja married her in 1835 by 'sending his arrow and sword to her village'. On 6 September 1838 she gave birth to Duleep Singh, who became the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.\n\nIn 1802, Ranjit Singh married Moran Sarkar, a Muslim nautch girl. This action, and other non-Sikh activities of the Maharaja, upset orthodox Sikhs, including the Nihangs, whose leader Akali Phula Singh was the Jathedar of the Akal Takht. When Ranjit Singh visited Amritsar, he was called outside the Akal Takht, where he was made to apologise for his mistakes. Akali Phula Singh took Ranjit Singh to a tamarind tree in front of the Akal Takht and prepared to punish him by flogging. Then Akali Phula Singh asked the nearby Sikh pilgrims whether they approved of Ranjit Singh's apology. The pilgrims responded with \"Sat Sri Akal\" and Ranjit Singh was released and forgiven.\n\nRanjit Singh had eight sons. Kharak Singh was the eldest from his second wife. His first wife gave birth to Ishar Singh, who died at the age of two, and, after her separation from Ranjit Singh, to the twins Tara Singh and Sher Singh. The two widows he took under his protection and married gave birth to Multana Singh, Kashmira Singh and Pashaura Singh. Duleep Singh was from his last wife. Ranjit Singh acknowledged only Kharak Singh and Duleep Singh as his biological sons\n\nIn the 1830s, Ranjit Singh suffered from numerous health complications as well as a stroke, which some historical records attribute to alcoholism and a failing liver. He died in his sleep on 27 June 1839. Four of his wives, and seven concubines with royal titles committed sati by throwing themselves on his funeral pyre by their own desire.\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and declined in its ability to tax or govern most of the Indian subcontinent. In the northwestern region, particularly the Punjab, the creation of the Khalsa community of Sikh warriors by Guru Gobind Singh accelerated the decay and fragmentation of the Mughal power in the region. Raiding Afghans attacked the Indus river valleys but met resistance from both organised armies of the Khalsa Sikhs as well as irregular Khalsa militias based in villages. The Sikhs had appointed their own \"zamindars\", replacing the previous Muslim revenue collectors, which provided resources to feed and strengthen the warriors aligned with Sikh interests. Meanwhile, colonial traders and the East India Company had begun operations in India on its eastern and western coasts.\n\nBy the second half of the 18th century, the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and parts of north India) were a collection of fourteen small warring regions. Of the fourteen, twelve were Sikh-controlled \"misls\" (confederacies), one named Kasur (near Lahore) was Muslim controlled, and one in the southeast was led by an Englishman named George Thomas. This region constituted the fertile and productive valleys of the five rivers – Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias and Sutlej. The Sikh \"misls\" were all under the control of the Khalsa fraternity of Sikh warriors, but they were not united and constantly warred with each other over revenue collection, disagreements, and local priorities; however, in the event of external invasion such as from the Muslim armies of Ahmed Shah Abdali from Afghanistan, they would usually unite.\n\nTowards the end of 18th century, the five most powerful \"misls\" were those of Sukkarchakkia, Kanhayas, Nakkais, Ahluwalias and Bhangi Sikhs. Ranjit Singh belonged to the first, and through marriage had a reliable alliance with Kanhayas and Nakkais. Among the smaller misls, some such as the Phulkias \"misl\" had switched loyalties in the late 18th century and supported the Afghan army invasion against their Khalsa brethren. The Kasur region, ruled by Muslim, always supported the Afghan invasion forces and joined them in plundering Sikh \"misls\" during the war.\n\nRanjit Singh's fame grew in 1797, at age 17, when the Afghan Muslim ruler Shah Zaman, of the Ahmad Shah Abdali dynasty, attempted to annex Panjab region into his control through his general Shahanchi Khan and 12,000 soldiers. The battle was fought in the territory that fell in Ranjit Singh controlled misl, whose regional knowledge and warrior expertise helped resist the invading army. This victory gained him recognition. In 1798, the Afghan ruler sent in another army, which Ranjit Singh did not resist. He let them enter Lahore, then encircled them with his army, blocked off all food and supplies, burnt all crops and food sources that could have supported the Afghan army. Much of the Afghan army retreated back to Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1799, Raja Ranjit Singh's army of 25,000 Khalsa, supported by another 25,000 Khalsa led by his mother-in-law Rani Sada Kaur of Kanhaiya \"misl\", in a joint operation attacked the region controlled by Bhangi Sikhs centered around Lahore. The rulers escaped, marking Lahore as the first major conquest of Ranjit Singh. The Sufi Muslim and Hindu population of Lahore welcomed the rule of Ranjit Singh. In 1800, the ruler of Jammu region ceded control of his region to Ranjit Singh.\n\nIn 1801, Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\", and agreed to a formal investiture ceremony, which was carried out by Baba Sahib Singh Bedi - a descendant of Guru Nanak. On the day of his coronation, prayers were performed across mosques, temples and gurudwaras in his territories for his long life. Ranjit Singh called his rule as \"Sarkar Khalsa\", and his court as \"Darbar Khalsa\". He ordered new coins to be issued in the name of Guru Nanak named the \"NanakShahi\" (\"of the Emperor Nanak\").\n\nIn 1802 Ranjit Singh, aged 22, took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sikh \"misl\", paid homage at the Harmandir Sahib temple, which had previously been attacked and desecrated by the invading Afghan army, and announced that he would renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.\nOn 1 January 1806, Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British officials of the East India Company, in which he agreed that his Sikh forces would not attempt to expand south of the Sutlej river, and the Company agreed that it would not attempt to militarily cross the Sutlej river into the Sikh territory.\n\nIn 1807, Ranjit Singh's forces attacked the Muslim ruled misl of Kasur and, after a month of fierce fighting, defeated the Afghan chief Qutb-ud-Din, thus expanding his empire northwest towards Afghanistan. He took Multan in 1818, and the whole Bari Doab came under his rule with that conquest. In 1819, he successfully defeated the Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers and annexed Srinagar and Kashmir, stretching his rule into the north and the Jhelum valley, beyond the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nThe most significant encounters between the Sikhs in the command of the Maharaja and the Afghans were in 1813, 1823, 1834 and in 1837. In 1813, Ranjit Singh's general Dewan Mokham Chand led the Sikh forces against the Afghan forces of Shah Mahmud led by Dost Mohammad Khan. The Afghans lost their stronghold at Attock in that battle.\n\nIn 1813–14, Ranjit Singh's first attempt to expand into Kashmir was foiled by Afghan forces led by General Azim Khan, due to a heavy downpour, the spread of cholera, and poor food supply to his troops.\n\nIn 1818, Darbar's forces led by Misr Dewan Chand occupied Multan, killing Muzaffar Khan and defeating his forces, leading to the end of Afghan influence in the Punjab.\n\nIn July 1818, an army from the Punjab defeated Jabbar Khan, a younger brother of governor of Kashmir Azim Khan, and acquired Kashmir, along with a yearly revenue of Rs seventy lacs. Dewan Moti Ram was appointed governor of Kashmir.\n\nIn November 1819, Dost Mohammed accepted the sovereignty of the Maharaja over Peshawar, along with a revenue payment of Rs one lac a year. The Maharaja specifically ordered his forces not to harass or molest any civilian. In 1820 and 1821, Dera Ghazi Khan, Hazara and Mankera, with huge tracts of land between Jhelum and Indus, Singh Sagar Daob, were also annexed. The victories of Kashmir, Peshwar and Multan were celebrated by naming three newborns after them. Prince Kashmira Singh, Peshaura Singh and Prince Multana Singh were born to Daya Kaur and Ratan Kaur, wives of Ranjit Singh.\n\nIn 1823, Ranjit Singh defeated a large army of Yusufzai north of the Kabul River.\n\nIn 1834, Mohammed Azim Khan once again marched towards Peshawar with an army of 25,000 Khattak and Yasufzai tribesmen in the name of jihad, to fight against infidels. The Maharaja defeated the forces. Yar Mohammad was pardoned and was reinvested as governor of Peshawar with an annual revenue of Rs one lac ten thousand to Lahore Darbar.\n\nIn 1837, the Battle of Jamrud and his march through Kabul in 1838, in cooperation with the colonial British army stationed in Sindh, became the last confrontation between the Sikhs led by him and the Afghans, which helped extend and establish the western boundaries of the Sikh Empire.\n\nIn 1838, Ranjit Singh with his troops marched into Kabul to take part in the victory parade along with the British after restoring Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne at Kabul.\n\nThe Sikh Empire, also known as the Sikh Raj and Sarkar-a-Khalsa, was in the Punjab region, the name of which means \"the land of the five rivers\". The five rivers are the Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Jhelum, all of which are tributaries of the river Indus.\n\nThe geographical reach of the Sikh Empire under Singh included all lands north of Sutlej river, and south of the high valleys of the northwestern Himalayas. The major towns at time included Srinagar, Attock, Peshawar, Bannu, Rawalpindi, Jammu, Gujrat, Sialkot, Kangra, Amritsar, Lahore and Multan.\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh allowed men from different religions and races to serve in his army and his government in various positions of authority. His army included a few Europeans, such as Jean-François Allard, but he did not employ British people, who were attempting to create a colony in the Indian subcontinent. Despite not employing them, he did maintain a diplomatic channel with the British; in 1828, he sent gifts to George IV and in 1831, he sent a mission to Simla to confer with the British Governor General, William Bentinck; while in 1838, he cooperated with them in removing the hostile Islamic Sultan in Afghanistan.\n\nRanjit Singh's policies were based on respect for all communities, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh. A devoted Sikh, Ranjit Singh restored and built historic Sikh Gurdwaras – most famously, the Harmandir Sahib, and used to celebrate his victories by offering thanks at the Harmandar. He also joined the Hindus in their temples, prohibited cow slaughter out of respect for Hindu sentiments, and visited Sufi mosques and holy places. He ordered his soldiers to neither loot nor molest civilians.\n\nThe Sikhs led by Singh never razed places of worship to the ground belonging to the enemy. However, he did convert Muslim mosques into other uses. For example, Ranjit Singh's army desecrated Lahore's Badshahi Mosque and converted it into an ammunition store, and horse stables. Lahore's Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was converted into \"Moti Mandir\" (Pearl Temple) by the Sikh army, and Sonehri Mosque were converted into a Sikh Gurdwara, but upon the request of Sufi Fakirs, Ranjit Singh restored the latter back to a mosque. Lahore's Begum Shahi Mosque was also used as a gunpowder factory, earning it the nickname \"Barudkhana Wali Masjid\", or \"Gunpowder Mosque.\"\n\nSingh's sovereignty was accepted by Afghan and Punjabi Muslims, who fought under his banner against the Afghan forces of Nadir Shah and later of Azim Khan. His court was ecumenical in composition: his prime minister, Dhian Singh, was a Dogra; his foreign minister, Fakir Azizuddin, was a Muslim; and his finance minister, Dina Nath, was a Brahmin. Artillery commanders such as Mian Ghausa were also Muslims. There were no forced conversions in his time. His wives Bibi Mohran, Gilbahar Begum retained their faith and so did his Hindu wives.\n\nThe army under Ranjit Singh was not limited to the Sikh community. The soldiers and troop officers included Sikhs, but also included Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Hindu Brahmins and people of all creeds and castes served his army, while the composition in his government also reflected a religious diversity. His army included Polish, Russian, Spanish, Prussian and French officers. In 1835, as his relationship with the British warmed up, he hired a British officer named Foulkes.\n\nHowever, the Khalsa army of Ranjit Singh reflected regional population, and as he grew his army, he dramatically increased the Rajput and Jat Sikhs who became the predominant members of his army. In the Doaba region his army was composed of the Jat Sikhs, in Jammu and northern Indian hills it was Hindu Rajputs, while relatively more Muslims served his army in the Jhelum river area closer to Afghanistan than other major Panjab rivers.\n\nRanjit Singh changed and improved the training and organisation of his army. He reorganised responsibility and set performance standards in logistical efficiency in troop deployment, manoeuvre, and marksmanship. He reformed the staffing to emphasise steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined the best of both old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.\n\nWhile Ranjit Singh introduced reforms in terms of training and equipment of his military, he failed to reform the old \"Jagirs\" (\"Ijra\") system of Mughal middlemen. The \"Jagirs\" system of state revenue collection involved certain individuals with political connections or inheritance promising a tribute (\"nazarana\") to the ruler and thereby gaining administrative control over certain villages, with the right to force collect customs, excise and land tax at inconsistent and subjective rates from the peasants and merchants; they would keep a part of collected revenue and deliver the promised tribute value to the state. These \"Jagirs\" maintained independent armed militia to extort taxes from the peasants and merchants, and the militia prone to violence. This system of inconsistent taxation with arbitrary extortion by militia, continued the Mughal tradition of ill treatment of peasants and merchants throughout the Sikh Empire, and is evidenced by the complaints filed to Ranjit Singh by East India Company officials attempting to trade within different parts of the Sikh Empire.\n\nAccording to historical records, states Sunit Singh, Ranjit Singh's reforms focused on military that would allow new conquests, but not towards taxation system to end abuse, nor about introducing uniform laws in his state or improving internal trade and empowering the peasants and merchants. This failure to reform the \"Jagirs\"-based taxation system and economy, in part led to a succession power struggle and a series of threats, internal divisions among Sikhs, major assassinations and coups in the Sikh Empire in the years immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh; an easy annexation of the remains of the Sikh Empire into British India followed, with the colonial officials offering the \"Jagirs\" better terms and the right to keep the system intact.\n\nRanjit Singh ensured that Panjab manufactured and was self-sufficient in all weapons, equipment and munitions his army needed. His government invested in infrastructure in the 1800s and thereafter, established raw materials mines, cannon foundries, gunpowder and arm factories. Some of these operations were owned by the state, others operated by private Sikh operatives.\n\nHowever, Ranjit Singh did not make major investments in other infrastructure such as irrigation canals to improve the productivity of land and roads. The prosperity in his Empire, in contrast to the Mughal-Sikh wars era, largely came from the improvement in the security situation, reduction in violence, reopened trade routes and greater freedom to conduct commerce.\n\nThe mid 19th-century Muslim historians, such as Shahamat Ali who experienced the Sikh Empire first hand, presented a different view on Ranjit Singh's Empire and governance. According to Ali, Ranjit Singh's government was despotic, and he was a mean monarch in contrast to the Mughals. The initial momentum for the Empire building in these accounts is stated to be Ranjit Singh led Khalsa army's \"insatiable appetite for plunder\", their desire for \"fresh cities to pillage\", and entirely eliminating the Mughal era \"revenue intercepting intermediaries between the peasant-cultivator and the treasury\".\n\nAccording to Ishtiaq Ahmed, Ranjit Singh's rule led to further persecution of Muslims in Kashmir, expanding the previously selective persecution of Shia Muslims and Hindus by Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers between 1752 and 1819 before Kashmir became part of his Sikh Empire. Bikramjit Hasrat describes Ranjit Singh as a \"benevolent despot\".\n\nThe Muslim accounts of Ranjit Singh's rule were questioned by Sikh historians of the same era. For example, Ratan Singh Bhangu in 1841 wrote that these accounts were not accurate, and according to Anne Murphy, he remarked, \"when would a Musalman praise the Sikhs?\" In contrast, the colonial era British military officer Hugh Pearse in 1898 criticised Ranjit Singh's rule, as one founded on \"violence, treachery and blood\". Sohan Seetal disagrees with this account and states that Ranjit Singh had encouraged his army to respond with a \"tit for tat\" against the enemy, violence for violence, blood for blood, plunder for plunder.\n\nSingh made his empire and the Sikhs a strong political force, for which he is deeply admired and revered in Sikhism. However, his era also marked a general decline in religious and moral fervour towards a life of alcoholism and licentiousness, along with a demoralisation of the Sikh court and nobility. He failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire rapidly declined after his death. The British subsequently easily defeated the confused and demoralised Khalsa forces, then disbanded them into destitution. Sikhism itself did not decline.\n\nClive Dewey has argued that the decline of the empire after Singh's death owes much to the jagir-based economic and taxation system which he inherited from the Mughals and retained. After his death, a fight to control the tax spoils emerged, leading to a power struggle among the nobles and his family from different wives. This struggle ended with a rapid series of palace coups and assassinations of his descendants, and eventually the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British.\n\nSingh is remembered for uniting Sikhs and founding the prosperous Sikh Empire. He is also remembered for his conquests and building a well-trained, self-sufficient Khalsa army to protect the empire. He amassed considerable wealth, including gaining the possession of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, which he left to Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha in 1839.\n\nPerhaps Singh's most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, the most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, which is now known popularly as the \"Golden Temple\". Much of the present decoration at the Harmandir Sahib, in the form of gilding and marblework, was introduced under the patronage of Singh, who also sponsored protective walls and water supply system to strengthen security and operations related to the temple. He also directed construction of two of the most sacred Sikh temples, being the birthplace and place of assassination of Guru Gobind Singh - Takht Sri Patna Sahib and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, respectively - whom he much admired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15204950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15204950", "title": "Religion and children", "text": "Religion and children\n\nChildren usually acquire the religious views of their parents, although they may also be influenced by others they communicate with such as peers and teachers. Aspects of this subject include rites of passage, education and child psychology, as well as discussion of the moral issue of religious education of children.\n\nMost Christian churches practice infant baptism to enter children into the faith. Some form of confirmation ritual occurs when the child has reached the age of reason and voluntarily accepts the religion.\n\nRitual circumcision is used to mark Jewish and Muslim and Coptic Christian and Ethiopian Orthodox Christian infant males as belonging to the faith. Jewish boys and girls then confirm their belonging at a coming of age ceremony known as the Bar and Bat Mitzvah respectively.\n\nA parochial school (US) or faith school (UK), is a type of school which engages in religious education in addition to conventional education. Parochial schools may be primary or secondary, and may have state funding but varying amounts of control by a religious organization. In addition there are religious schools which only teach the religion and subsidiary subjects (such as the language of the holy books), typically run on a part-time basis separate from normal schooling. Examples are the Christian Sunday schools and the Jewish Hebrew schools. Islamic religious schools are known in English by the Arabic loanword Madrasah.\n\nReligion may have an influence on what goes on in state schools. For example, in the UK the Education Act 1944 introduced the requirement for daily prayers in all state-funded schools, but later acts changed this requirement to a daily \"collective act of worship\", the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 being the most recent. This also requires such acts of worship to be \"wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character\". The term \"mainly\" means that acts related to other faiths can be carried out providing the majority are Christian.\n\nThe creation-evolution controversy, especially the status of creation and evolution in public education, is a debate over teaching children the origin and evolution of life, mostly in conservative regions of the United States. However, evolution is accepted by the Catholic Church and is a part of the Catholic Catechism.\n\nIn France, children are forbidden from wearing conspicuous religious symbols in public schools.\n\nMany legal experts have argued that the government should create laws in the interests of the welfare of children, irrespective of the religion of their parents. Nicholas Humphrey has argued that children \"have a human right not to have their minds crippled by exposure to other people's bad ideas,\" and should have the ability to question the religious views of their parents.\n\n\"Parents' religion and children's welfare: debunking the doctrine of parents' rights,\nPhilosopher Arthur Schopenhauer spoke of the subject in the 19th century:\nSeveral authors have been critical of religious indoctrination of children, such as Nicolas Humphrey, Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins. Christopher Hitchens and Dawkins use the term child abuse to describe the harm that some religious upbringings inflict on children. A. C. Grayling has argued \"we are all born atheists... and it takes a certain amount of work on the part of the adults in our community to persuade [children] differently.\"\n\nDawkins states that he is angered by the labels \"Muslim child\" or \"Catholic child\". He asks how a young child can be considered intellectually mature enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity’s place within it. By contrast, Dawkins points out, no reasonable person would speak of a \"Marxist child\" or a \"Tory child.\" He suggests there is little controversy over such labeling because of the \"weirdly privileged status of religion\".\n\nOn several occasions Dawkins made the claim that sexually abusing a child is \"arguably less\" damaging than \"the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first place\".\n\nAs a means to transmit his opinions directly to children Dawkins wrote a profusely illustrated book of scientific divulgation, The Magic of Reality, in which some natural phenomena that's usually left explained to them by means of the action of gods or other mythical creatures are demystified. Each chapter book is devoted to a single natural phenomenon, such as earthquakes, always starting with a myth or folklore of world's major religions followed by an actual scientific explanation that debunks the latter.\n\nIslam has permitted the child marriage of older men to girls as young as 10 years of age if they have entered puberty. The Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children describes cases of a 10-year-old girl being married and raped in Yemen (Nujood Ali), a 13-year-old Yemeni girl dying of internal bleeding three days after marriage, and a 12-year-old girl dying in childbirth after marriage.\n\nLatter Day Saint church founder Joseph Smith married girls as young as 13 and 14, and other Latter Day Saints married girls as young as 10. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints eliminated underaged marriages in the 19th century, but several fundamentalist branches of Mormonism continue the practice.\n\nA study of 2604 US children ages six to nineteen found positive correlations between physical and psychological health and religious affiliation and/or church attendance. This included 272 children whose parents (children 6–9) or the children themselves (12–19) expressed no religious affiliation. However, of this group, 22% state that religion is important and 35% attend church. The study found children ages six to nineteen who attend religious services are at lower risk of suicide or suicide attempts, as well as alcohol and drug use and dangerous sexual behavior. Some religions prohibit blood transfusions, vaccinations, contraception, and abortions, which may lead to adverse health consequences. Membership in religious groups can moderate unhealthy behavior, provide social support, and enhance marital or financial prospects, and strengthen family bonds if the religion is shared by the whole family. Religions can also help both adults and children with self-esteem, as well as provide meaning to life and reduce anxiety, but can increase guilt over perceived misdeeds. Thus it is not clear whether this positive association is because of a positive effect of religion on health, an effect in the other direction, or an as of yet unknown lurking variable.\n\n85 percent of religiously affiliated children are healthy overall, as opposed to 79 percent of non-affiliated children. 79 percent of religious children are deemed psychologically healthy compared to 73 percent of non religious children. 85 percent of children who attend church at least weekly are healthy and 83 percent of those who seldom or never attend are healthy. For psychological health the numbers are 82 and 74 percent respectively.\n\n62 percent of children say religion is important to them, 26 percent say it's somewhat important, and 13 percent say it's not important. 81 percent of those who view religion as important were found to be healthy and 65 percent of the not important group were healthy. There was no difference found among the various religious denominations in regard to health. The positive correlation between religion and health was strongest for 12-15 year olds. Overall religious belief and participation have the same positive health association as being breastfed or having a mother who went to school 2.2 years longer than one who didn't. They have half the health benefit of living with both parents. Whether this association is a causal relationship in either direction (religion to good health or good health to religion) remains to be seen (see Correlation does not imply causation).\n\nSome religions treat illness, both mental and physical, in a manner that does not heal, and in some cases exacerbates the problem. Specific examples include faith healing of certain Christian sects, the Christian Science religion which eschews medical care, and exorcisms.\n\nFaith based practices for healing purposes have come into direct conflict with both the medical profession and the law when victims of these practices are harmed, or in the most extreme cases, killed by these \"cures.\" A detailed study in 1998 found 140 instances of deaths of children due to religion-based medical neglect. Most of these cases involved religious parents relying on prayer to cure the child's disease, and withholding medical care.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses object to blood transfusion primarily on religious grounds, they believe that blood is sacred and God said \"abstain from blood\" (Acts 15:28-29).\n\nDawkins proposes that religion is a by-product arising from other features of the human species that are adaptive. One such feature is the tendency of children to \"believe, without question, whatever your grown-ups tell you\" (Dawkins, 2006, p. 174).\n\nPsychologist Paul Bloom sees religion as a by-product of children's instinctive tendency toward a dualistic view of the world, and a predisposition towards creationism. Deborah Kelemen has also written that children are naturally teleologists, assigning a purpose to everything they come across.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13193885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13193885", "title": "Religulous", "text": "Religulous\n\nReligulous () is a 2008 American documentary film written by and starring comedian Bill Maher and directed by Larry Charles. The title of the film is a portmanteau derived from the words \"religious\" and \"ridiculous\". The documentary \nexamines and challenges religion and religious belief.\n\nA range of views on various world religions is explored as Bill Maher travels to numerous religious destinations including Jerusalem, the Vatican, and Salt Lake City, interviewing believers from a variety of backgrounds and groups. These include a former member of Jews for Jesus, Christians, Muslims, former Mormons, and Hasidic Jews. Maher travels to Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London, where he \"preaches\" Scientology beliefs.\n\nMaher also takes a tour around Creation Museum and the Holy Land Experience.\n\nMaher said he used a fake title \"A Spiritual Journey\" for the film to obtain interviews. Creationist Ken Ham of the group Answers in Genesis, who appeared in the film, was critical of what he called Maher's \"deception\" to obtain the interview.\n\nThe documentary was produced by Thousand Words and distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Originally slated for an international release date coinciding with the Christian Easter holiday 2008 (March 23), post-production delays resulting from a screenwriters guild strike pushed the release date back. The film was eventually released on October 3, 2008.\n\n\"Religulous\" had an opening weekend take of $3.5 million from an early October 1 release in Los Angeles and New York City and also a limited 502-theater release, averaging $6,972 per theater. As a result, the film was ranked at #10 at the box office that weekend. Its per-screen receipts were almost three times those of a competing film to which it has been compared in the media, the politically conservative \"An American Carol\", which edged out \"Religulous\" to finish at #9 over the same weekend, but had a per theater average of only $2,325. Only the #1 movie, \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", at $9,020, had a higher per-screen average than \"Religulous\".\n\nFor the second weekend, \"Religulous\" had a 35.5% drop in box office receipts and dropped to #13 with a gross of $2,200,000 at 568 theaters for a per screen average of $3,873.\n\n\"Religulous\" grossed over $13 million after having a production budget of $2.5 million. As of 2012, it's 15th among the highest grossing documentaries in the US and was the highest grossing documentary of 2008.\n\n\"Religulous\" received mixed to positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69%, based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Religulous\" is funny and offensive in equal measure, and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, \"mixed or average reviews\". \n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, and wrote: \"I report faithfully that I laughed frequently. You may very well hate it, but at least you've been informed. Perhaps you could enjoy the material about other religions, and tune out when yours is being discussed. That's only human nature.\"\n\nRobert W. Butler of \"The Kansas City Star\" gave the film a rating of three stars, and commented: \"The film is one-sided, less a measured argument than a bunch of rants and barbed observations. But it’s also very funny, which trumps everything else.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a rating of A-, and wrote: \"The movie is funny as...well, hell.\" \"The Canadian Press\" said the movie \"delivers a laugh-out-loud attack on the most sacred of cows.\" Christie Lemire, of the Associated Press, wrote: \"If you're an atheist or an agnostic, you'll be completely on board and happy to tag along with Maher as he travels the globe asking people about their faith — everywhere from Jerusalem to the Vatican to Amsterdam, where he finds not only the Cannabis Ministry but also a Muslim gay bar (with two people in it).\" John Anderson of \"Newsday\" wrote: \"much that's funny, insightful and thought-provoking. But it certainly doesn't give the religious a lot of slack.\"\n\nThe documentary received some negative reviews, with Rick McGinnis of \"Metro\" concluding that, \"Maher is preaching to the choir with an undisguised dishonesty that only the true believers will forgive.\" James Berardinelli wrote, \"If the subject of religion is as important to Maher as he claims during his end comments, then he should have followed those words with actions and made a movie that's more than a sum of inauthentic interviews, ranting attacks, and obvious observations. The choir may hum along with Maher but the rest of those watching this movie will be singing the blues.\" Nick Schager of \"Slant Magazine\" called it an \"atheistic wannabe-dissection of modern faith.\"\n\nIn a review for \"The New York Times\", Stephen Holden notes that when Maher \"turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam, its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy\". Sam Greenspan argues that \"Jewish people seemed to get handled with kid gloves\" by Maher. Muslims, however, are portrayed as relentlessly anti-Semitic and as holding views on freedom of speech and of religion incompatible with Western culture.\n\nIn his review Stephen Holden also wrote that \"the movie has the same loose, on-the-road structure\" as Larry Charles' previous film \"\" and commented: \"Much of Mr. Maher’s film is extremely funny in a similarly irreverent, offhanded way.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" wrote: \"those with a taste for irreverent humor and clear-eyed analysis will find it funny, enlightening and disturbing.\" Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" characterized the film as \"An often hilarious but relentlessly shallow attack on religious fundamentalism by humorist Bill Maher\". Louis Peitzman of the \"San Francisco Bay Guardian\" wrote that \"It doesn't even matter that he goes out of his way to be offensive, as he's consistently funny enough to pull it off.\" Scott Indrisek wrote at \"Style.com\" that: \"\"Religulous\" earns many of its laughs from skillful editing, with Maher's interviews jazzed up by video clips\". Ben Kenigsberg of \"Time Out New York\" gave the film a rating of three out of six stars, and wrote: \"The worst scenes in \"Religulous\" are appalling for their methods; the best are appalling for their information.\"\n\nHarry Forbes of Catholic News Service condemned the film, deeming it \"morally offensive.\"\n\nThe 3rd Annual Independent Investigative Group IIG Awards presented an award to \"Religulous\" recognizing the promotion of science and critical thinking in popular media on May 18, 2009.\n\nLions Gate Entertainment released the film on DVD February 17, 2009. Special features on the DVD include a commentary with Bill Maher and director Larry Charles, deleted scenes, and extended Bill Maher monologues from around the world that were either edited down or not included in the film at all.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, Maher tweeted a photo of himself and director Larry Charles with the caption: \"Director Larry Charles on the Hawaii trip this year...was \"Religulous II\" discussed??\", suggesting the possibility of a sequel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24999861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24999861", "title": "Sahajananda Saraswati", "text": "Sahajananda Saraswati\n\nSahajananda Saraswati (10 July 1925 – 10 December 2007) was the spiritual head of the Divine Life Society of South Africa. He was born in the small midlands town of Estcourt, South Africa.\n\nSahajananda did well in school, from primary through secondary and college, always gaining firsts. He was highly ambitious in the pursuit of his academic career, but Sivananda Saraswati, founder of the Divine Life Society movement worldwide, had other plans in store for him and his intervention came at the appropriate time.\n\nSahajananda attempted to finish his PhD, but got only a second class pass as a result of doing poorly on the geometry portion of his final exams. He got a teacher's certificate instead.\n\nDuring his first year of teaching, he came across the Sivananda's book, \"Practice of Karma Yoga\", and took it up, giving up sports and ambition in his teaching career in exchange for pursuit of this religion. In 1948 he gave up his teaching post and went to India to meet Sivananda. He was not qualified to reside at the Ashram and returned to South Africa. Sivananda readily gave consent, adding, \"The qualities will come\". The only instruction Sahajananda received from Sivananda during this visit was: \"learn to type and to make tea!\" The youthful seeker accepted the advice passively. Only years later did Sahajananda understand that Sivananda's cryptic words were pregnant with deep spiritual meaning—it was dissemination of spiritual knowledge through his literature, and service of the underprivileged.\n\nReturning to South Africa, Sahajananda took up a teaching post at the FOSA (Friends of Sick Association) TB Settlement, teaching in the school and serving the sick in the wards. It was during this time that Sivananda wrote to him with a request to start a branch of Divine Life Society in South Africa. Being nervous and shy by temperament, and unaccustomed to any kind of organisational work, Sahajananda felt quite incompetent to undertake the task, and did not respond to his letter. Sivananda wrote a second letter dated 18 October 1949, requesting him to open a branch. Sahajananda was now in a fix, and thought that since he was a disciple, he should obey and forwarded the affiliation fee to register the branch. Sivananda was evidently impatient to get the branch opened, for before the affiliation fee could reach him, Sivananda sent a third letter, dated 11 November 1949, requesting a branch to be opened. Thus began the saga of Divine Life Society of South Africa.\n\nSahajananda commenced with publishing Sivananda's writings and disseminating the literature (funding it himself), as well as conducting prayer services. He worked as a teacher and print the literature in the evenings together with a few devotees. They worked long hours, sometimes working until the early hours of the morning. They led a hard life, sleeping on the bare cement floor with newspapers as mattresses. Bricks served as pillows. Sahajananda recounted, \"It was not that I was practising some kind of austerity. It was just that I wished to offer every spare cent of my income to the promotion of my Master's Mission.\"\n\nIn 1956 Sahajananda visited Sivananda and Sivanananda initiated him into the holy Order of Sannyas. At his farewell function, Sivananda said: \"Swami Sahajananda is styled as the spiritual king of South Africa, Durban. He is also called African Chota Guru. He does not want anything. He is a silent worker. He is a man of renunciation, Vairagya (dispassion) and meditation. He is a very good organiser. He talks little. You have never seen him talking. He thinks much and does much. Such a spiritual Yogi is he. His devotion to his teacher is unique. He has a pure heart. So let us pray for the health of this small Yogi, full of strength. One who can transform the materialistic intellect of the whole of South Africa—what tremendous purity, what tremendous Yogic power, what tremendous meditation, spiritual aura and selfless aura!\"\n\nSahajananda returned to South Africa and served the spiritual and social needs of the country. His selflessness, love, kindness, high level of ethics, meticulousness, and strict discipline drew thousands to devotees to him. He wrote spiritual books.\n\nFor the underprivileged and disadvantaged of South Africa, Sahajananda has undertaken over 300 projects that include schools, hospitals, clinics, crèches, old age homes, children’s homes, technical colleges, hydroponic gardening tunnels, sewing centres, feeding schemes, peace and skills training centres, low-cost housing, and more. Many of the projects are in rural areas where access to such facilities are scarce. For this humanitarian work, Sahajananda received numerous local and international awards, including the Martin Luther King Jnr. Peace Award from the Centre for Non-violent Social Change in Atlanta, USA, and from statesmen including the South African President, Dr Jacob Zuma, past Premiers of the Province of KwaZulu Natal, Mayors of district and local municipalities, the King and Prince of the Zulu Nation, etc. In 2008, in recognising Sahajananda for his efforts of uplifting the people of South Africa, the University of KwaZulu Natal posthumously conferred upon Sahajananda the Honorary Degree, Doctor of Theology, \"honoris causa\".\n\nSahajananda brought the teachings of Sivananda to the people of South Africa and the world. Sahajananda did not preach these teachings, he lived them. His entire life was an example of kindness, love, obedience, dedication and devotion to God and the Guru. Sahajananda built numerous ashrams (Hindu prayer centres) and provided the facilities to take people towards God. Worth mentioning are the Divine Life Society's headquarters—Sivanandashram, Reservoir Hills, and the Sivananda International Cultural Centre (or SICC), Sivananda Nagar, La Mercy, KwaZulu Natal. SICC is probably one of the largest Hindu spiritual centres in the southern hemisphere. Everyone that visits the place comments on the peace and bliss experienced there. The comment invariably made is that the place is \"heaven on earth\".\n\nSahajananda had attracted around him a large congregation of devotees devoted to Sivananda. He never allowed himself to be worshipped and encouraged all to direct their devotion to Sivananda. He attributed all success of Divine Life society of South Africa to the Grace of Sivananda.\n\nFor over 50 years, Sahajananda worked in the service of Sivananda.

News of his death spread to all corners of the world from Swamis, statesmen, devotees, etc. His body lay in state the day of the 10th and throughout the night, allowing people to pay their final respects to him.

Therion's female counterpart is Babalon, another Thelemic deity. Therion, as a Thelemic personage, evolved from that of \"The Beast\" from the Book of Revelation, whom Crowley identified himself with since childhood, because his mother called him that name. Indeed, throughout his life he occasionally referred to himself as “Master Therion” or sometimes “The Beast 666”. He wrote:\n\nBefore I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666. I did not understand in the least what that implied; it was a passionately ecstatic sense of identity.\n\nThe word \"therion\" is mentioned in several Thelemic rituals, such as \"The Star Ruby\". In total, there are five mentions of The Beast in \"Liber AL vel Legis\", the first being in 1:15, and the remaining four are all in the third chapter—verses 14, 22, 34, and 47, respectively—although the word “beast” can be found elsewhere therein. Aleister Crowley believed that the references to The Beast and the Scarlet Woman (Babalon) in the book “do not denote persons but are titles of office”. The first mention reads thus:\n\nNow ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given.\n\nThe Number of the Beast is 666. The number is of prominent significance in the system of Thelema. It is the sum of the numbers inside the 6-by-6 magic square, which is associated with the sun by some Kabbalists, astrologists, and numerologists, who still use it today. According to Crowley, it is a solar number. The Stele of Revealing bore the catalogue number 666 at the time when Crowley discovered it, which was one of the events that led to the writing of the Book of the Law.\n\nIt can be said that the Hebrew letter shin (ש), which is written at the beginning and end of the Hebrew word for \"sun\" (shemesh ), conceals in itself the number of The Beast, because its shape is like three vavs (ו) conjoined together, whose gematrical value is 6. It has been noted by some that the abbreviation W.W.W. may be interpreted as 666, for the Latin letter “W” formed out of the Phoenician letter waw, whose value is 6. This can be explained by saying that the rise of the internet is one of the events by which the beginning of the Age of Aquarius has been marked, which is strongly tied with the concept of the Aeon of Horus in Thelema.\nThe following words and phrases have 666 for their gematrical value:\n\n"}

{"id": "7390476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7390476", "title": "Vadama", "text": "Vadama\n\nVadama () meaning \"Northerners\" are a sub-sect of the Iyer community of Tamil Brahmins. While some believe that their name is an indication of the fact that they were the most recent Brahmin migrants to the Tamil country others interpret the usage of the term \"Vadama\" as a reference to their strict adherence to the Sanskrit language and Vedic rituals which are of northerly origin . It may also be possible that Vadamas may be Brahmins whose origins lie in the Dravida region of northern Tamil Nadu. Like other Iyer communities, they follow the \"Advaita\" philosophy propounded by Adi Shankara. A significant proportion of the Vadama community adopted Vaishnavism, and are thus believed to have given rise to the Vadagalai Iyengar community. The oldest historical references to Vadamas date from the first millennium AD. A large number of Vadamas migrated to Kerala during the medieval period, so that Vadamas along with the Brahacharnam form the majority of the Kerala Iyer community. A section of the Vadama community also migrated north to the Telugu country and Maharashtra where they were known as \"Dravidas\".\n\nVadamas have a martial tradition unlike most other Iyer communities. They are believed to have been the protectors of Brahmin villages or \"agraharams\" and served as administrators and advisors to Tamil and Telugu kings during the medieval and early modern period.\n\nThe term Vadama may have originated from the Tamil term 'Vadakku' meaning North, indicating the Northern origin of the Vadama Brahmins. This claim is supported by the fact that, unlike other subsects of Iyers, some Vadama pay oblations in their daily Sandhyavandanam to the river Narmada in Central India. However, what is not certain is whether 'North' refers to northern Tamil Nadu/Southern Deccan, or regions farther north. Other scholars are of the opinion that rather than the superficial indication of a northern origin for the people, the term \"vadama\" would rather refer to proficiency in Sanskrit and Vedic ritual, generally associated with the north prior to the first millennium A. D.\n\nVadamas are further sub-divided into five categories\n\n\nIntermarriage with other Iyer sects has been increasing in recent times, while earlier, most marriages were arranged only within the same subsect of Vadama. Such a degree of exclusion has become rather uncommon now. Exceptions did exist, such as the marriage of Kurratalwan's sons(Considered to be Vadama followers of Sri Vaishnavism), which took place outside the Vadama fold.\n\nSome historians hold that all Brahmins who migrated to the far-south during and after the age of the Gupta Emperors, came to be classified as Vadama.\n\nThere is a perception that some Kashmir-linked Vadama settled in Tirunelveli between 750 and 800 AD. An interesting fact corroborating this migration may be had from the treatise called \"Natyashastra\" written by Bharata Muni, held by some to have been from Kashmir and by others to be from the south, formed the basis of the dance-form Bharatanatyam which is particularly associated with Tamil Nadu. Art Historians such as Vasundhara Filliozat claim that there are inscriptional evidences to prove the continuous migration of teachers from Kashmir to South. Such scholars also state that some other South Indian Saivaite and Tantric traditions were also introduced by teachers from Kashmir.\n\nIt appears that the Sabhaiyar group of the Vadama, were present in the Chola Empire in the 9th century, since the grant of the \"entire village of Chirri[dai]yarru excluding the \"kani\" of Samgappadi-kilan was made to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirumalpperu as a tax-free \"devadana\" in the 21st year [892 A.D.] of the reign of Chola Aditya I and the administration of the charity was entrusted to the \"sabhaiyar\" of Puduppakkam in Purisanadu\".\n\nThe Srivaishnava hold that their guru Ramanujacharya, born in the first quarter of the 11th century, was a Vadama by birth.\n\nInstability prevailed in Peninsular India in the aftermath of the defeat of the Yadavas of Deogiri and Kakatiyas of Warangal in the early 14th century by the Tughlaqs. In response to the Moslem irruptions the Kingdom of Vijayanagar was founded in 1336, and came to be locked in an existential struggle with the Bahmani Sultanate from 1347 to 1490, when the Moslem state broke up. This early period was marked by much strife, especially in the \"jihads\" of Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah (1397–1422) and his brother Ahmad Shah I Wali (1422–1435), when thousands of Hindus, especially Brahmins, were enslaved and temples of the northern Deccan desecrated. The oppression was also felt in the eastern peninsula as far as the Gajapati Kingdom where, for instance in 1478, Muhammad Shah III Lashkari (1463–1482) demolished the Great Temple of Kondavidu and was acclaimed as a \"ghazi\", for personally decapitating all the Brahmins. Such excesses induced Brahmins to seek refuge in the realms of Vijayanagar, where many were appointed \"karnams\" (bailiffs) in preference to other castes, from the reign of Harihara I (1336–1357) onward.\n\nAfter the division of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1490, into the Sultanates of Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar and Berar, the armies of Vijayanagar were successful in fending of invasions and restricting the Sultanates to Central India, especially in the reign of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529), who also began the practice of appointing Brahmins commanders of strategically important forts.\n\nRelative peace prevailed until the Battle of Talikota, in 1565, when Rama Raya of Vijayanagar was killed and the capital city razed to the ground. The land, in addition to being plundered by the combined armies of the Sultanates, came to be oppressed by renegade \"polygars\" and bandits whose rise commenced with the destruction of the central power. The Mogul invasion of Peninsular India and the depredations of the Deccan by the Mahrattas under Shivaji also began early in the 17th century.\n\nA combination of these belligerent powers and the desolation they helped create appears to have made the relative peace offered in the far south of the country under the Hindu kings of Travancore, Madurai, Tanjore and Mysore, far more desirable and induced many Hindus to migrate there. A fact supporting this idea, we have from English chroniclers in the 17th century, who state that their procurement of goods along the Western Concan and Canara coasts, suffered severely after the Mogul invasions and the mass depopulation of the peninsula they caused. Another statement often encountered in their annals is that the economic growth of the factory at Fort St. George, Madras was in a large measure attributable to the fact that many people chose to settle there to escape the chaotic conditions farther north. When we consider, in conjunction with these two facts, Fort St. George's position as a newly established, well-fortified and growing settlement in Aurangzeb's time, and therefore a secure refuge, a mass exodus southwards seems to have occurred in the period in question.\n\nThe relatives and family members of C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, a Vadadesa Vadama, believed that they were descended from Brahmins of the Desh region of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh who migrated to Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh from where they migrated to the northern part of Tamil Nadu in the 16th century where they were granted the village of Chetpet by a local chieftain.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Vadamas along with other Tamil Brahmins made ample use of the opportunities provided by British rule to dominate the civil services, legislature and the judiciary in the Madras Presidency. Throughout the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century there was intense political rivalry between the Vadamas and the Brahacharanams for the domination of Brahmin villages called \"agraharams\".\n\nThe Vaishnavite spiritual leader Ramanuja is generally believed to have been born a Vadama. Under his tutelage, numerous Vadamas adopted Vaishnavism and are believed to have given rise to the Vadakalai Iyengar community. The transformation of the Vadama Ramanuja into a Sri Vaishnava, which happened concurrently with his education and increasing philosophic investigation, gave rise to a Tamil proverb - \"Vadamam muthi Vaishnavam\", \"i.e.\" a \"Vadama ripens into a Vaishnava\". Edgar Thurston recounts at the beginning of the 20th century, the widespread prevalence of inter-marriage between Vaishnavite converts from the Thummagunta Dravida sub-group and Smartha girls from the same sub-sect. Thurston also recounts that Vadamas often observed death pollution in some Vaishnavite families and vice versa.\n\nSome of the Gurukkal in temples in Tamil Nadu, are Vadama, though not recognised as such by the community, since they have certain practices that are prohibited for the Vadama.\n\nThere is also evidence that some South Indian Brahmins settled in Kashmir. The actual sect of their origin is not known.\n\nThere is a perception that the ancestors of some Aarama Dravidulu Brahmins of Andhra Pradesh migrated in the 13th and 14th centuries, from Saurashtra to the banks of the River Cauvery in Tamil Nadu, whence some of them migrated to Andhra Pradesh, by all accounts before the 18th century.\n\nThey are held to have been the land-lords and head-men of the Brahmin villages called \"agraharams\". Sociologist Andre Beteille, in his thesis \"Caste, class, and power: changing patterns of stratification in a Tanjore village\", describes them as the biggest \"mirasidars\" among the Iyer community. They may also have organised the agraharams' defence in turbulent times for though there were not many who joined the army, they were not specifically forbidden to take to arms. A proverb still prevalent amongst the Iyers indicating the supposed short-temper of Vadama Brahmins, may be indicative of their martial past. They were among the Brahmin nobles and administrators under the Nayaka, Travancore and Vijayanagar rulers. Administrative practices adopted by them were strictly in accordance with those prescribed in the Hindu Dharma-Shastras, as may be observed from the records of the kings themselves.\n\nBut, as with other Brahmins, their primary duties were to study the Vedas, teach them and perform the ceremonies they entailed. The vast majority of them, until the 19th century, were household priests with some even being temple-priests, particularly in Travancore.\n\nMany were great scholars and served in the courts of kings. Nilakanta Dikshitar was a minister to Thirumalai Nayak of Madurai.\n\nIn the 19th century, as with other Iyers, many of the Vadama joined, the judiciary of British India as lawyers and judges, or served in the Indian Civil and Revenue Services. Many others continued in the service of the kings of the princely states of Travancore, Mysore, Pudukottai, and Ramnad.\n\nWhile the religious rituals of the Vadama are, in almost all respects, identical with those of other Iyers, there are a few minor deviations from them. One of these lies in the practice of some men applying \"Gopi Chandanam\", an yellow pigment of mineral origin similar in appearance to that obtained from sandalwood, on the forehead, instead of \"Vibhuthi\". However, others like Appayya Dikshitar's family applied only Vibhuti, being staunch devotees of Shiva. While it was more common in former times, the use of Gopi Chandanam continues, being replaced by Vibhuthi otherwise. Some Vadamas also sported the Vaishnavite \"namam\". They were known as \"kutthunamakarar\".\n\nThe Vadama traditionally claim to be superior to other classes of Iyers. One ritualistic difference from other Iyers, arises in their having to recite the following verse in honour of the River Narmada, and to ward of serpents, as part of their Sandhyavandanam:\n\nAlso, in some parts of Kerala, as Nambudiri Brahmacharis were not commonly found, a Brahmachari belonging to the Vadadesa Vadama was required to pour water into the hands of a Nambudiri sanyasi as part of the rituals connected with the latter's breakfast.\n\nVadamas have also significantly contributed towards popularizing and propagating the worship of Lord Shiva and Devi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6938475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6938475", "title": "Zmanim", "text": "Zmanim\n\nZmanim (, literally \"times\", singular \"zman\") are specific times of the day in Jewish law.\n\nFor either purpose, the status of the twilight hours just after sunset or just before sunrise is ambiguous. Judaism provides its own definitions for this period; at the same time, various rabbinic authorities differ on just how those definitions are to be applied for different purposes.\n\nThe Talmud often states calculations of these \"zmanim\" in terms of the time it takes to walk some distance, stated in \"mils\". Most authorities reckon the time it takes to walk one \"mil\" as being 18 minutes, though there are opinions of up to 24 minutes. Many authorities, indeed, hold such calculations to be absolute: if nightfall follows sundown by \"the amount of time it takes to walk four \"mils\",\" for example, that means \"72 minutes after sundown\" in all places on all dates. Other authorities, especially those living in higher latitudes, noted that the darkness of the sky 72 minutes after sundown (for example) can vary substantially from place to place, and from date to date. They therefore hold that \"72 minutes after sundown\" actually refers to how dark the sky is 72 minutes after sundown \"in Jerusalem on an equinox\". Then that degree of darkness is reckoned as being true when the sun has fallen a certain number of degrees below the horizon (for example, 7°5′ below the horizon), and that becomes the actual standard used for all places and all dates.\n\nOne calendar day ends, and the next day begins, during the evening. The Talmud states there is an uncertainty as to whether the day ends at sunset or nightfall, so the time in between has a status of doubt. The Talmud in Pesachim states there are four \"mil\" between sunset and nightfall. However, the Talmud in Tractate Shabbat states that there are just three-quarters of a \"mil\" between sunset and nightfall. \nAccording to the first opinion, nightfall is 13½-18 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, sun falls 3-4° below the horizon). According to the second opinion, nightfall occurs exactly 72 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, when the sun has fallen anywhere from 6.45 to 16.1 degrees below the horizon).\n\nIn practice, when the question is whether it is too late to do a something that must be done \"by day,\" the practice is to follow one of the earlier opinions. When the question is whether it is too early to do something that must be done \"by night,\" the practice is to follow one of the later opinions. For calculating the end of Shabbat or major holidays, the desire not to end Shabbat early, along with the Talmud's description of the end of Shabbat in terms of the appearance of stars in the sky, leads to the use of the later opinions. (See End of Shabbat below.)\n\nThere is also a difference of opinion as to when one may begin to do activities than must be done \"during the day:\" \nThe Talmud in Pesachim (see above) holds symmetrically that the time between daybreak and sunrise is also the time in which one can walk four \"mils.\" For morning calculations, daybreak is normally held to be when the sun is 16.1° below the horizon, or a fixed 72 minutes or 90 minutes before sunrise.\n\nFor almost all halakhic purposes, each day is divided into twelve equal \"hours.\" There are two major opinions: \nThe result is that \"Magen Avraham times\" are earlier in the morning than \"Vilna Gaon times\"; in practice there are communities that follow each of those standards. For times in the afternoon, the Vilna Gaon's times are earlier, and are almost universally followed.\n\nThese are called \"seasonal\" or \"variable\" hours because they depend on the length of time between sunrise (or daybreak) and sunset (or nightfall), and those vary through the year. Near New York, for example, a \"seasonal hour\" based on the Vilna Gaon's calculations lasts around 45 minutes near winter solstice, around 60 minutes near the equinoxes, and around 75 minutes near summer solstice.\n\nDaybreak (עֲלוֹת הַשַּׁחַר, \"Alot Hashachar\") refers to when the first rays of light are visible in the morning.\n\nSunrise (הַנֵץ הַחַמָּה, \"Hanetz Hachamah\") refers to when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon. Technically, it is preferable to pray the morning Shema just before this time and begin the Amidah just afterwards, although this is rarely done nowadays. Most mitzvot that must be performed during the day (such as the Four Species or Hallel) should be done after this time \"ab initio.\"\n\n\"Sof Zman Kriyat Shema\" (סוֹף זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע) means \"end of the time to say the [morning] Shema.\" This is three halachic hours into the day. These hours are variable/seasonal hours and refer to one twelfth of the time between daybreak and nightfall (according to the Magen Avraham) \"or\" one twelfth of the time between sunrise and sunset (according to the Vilna Gaon).\n\n\"Sof Zman Tefilah\" (סוֹף זְמַן תְּפִלָּה) means \"end of the time to say the Shacharit Amidah.\" This is four (variable) hours into the day. The above comments apply here also. However, since the Amidah is only rabbinically required (unlike the Shema which is Scriptually mandated) it is common to rely on the later time, and few calendars publish the earlier time.\n\nMidday (חֲצוֹת הַיּוֹם, \"Chatzot Hayom\" or just \"Chatzot\") means the midpoint between sunrise and sunset, or equivalently between daybreak and sundown. The absolute latest time for the Shacharit Amidah, \"ex post facto,\" is this time. On the Shabbat and on holidays, one is supposed to eat before this time (except on Rosh Hashanah). On Tish'a Ba'av one may sit on a chair at this time, and those who fast on Erev Rosh Hashanah usually eat at this time.\n\n\"Minchah Gedolah\"' (מִנְחָה גְּדוֹלָה, literally the greater Minchah), one-half variable hour after midday, is the earliest time to recite Minchah, although one should try, if possible, to wait until Minchah Ketanah (literally the smaller Minchah). On Yom Kippur, the congregation \"must\" begin Mussaf by this time, because otherwise they would be required to pray the more frequent prayer (Mincha) first.\n\n\"Minchah Ketanah\" (מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, literally the smaller [window of praying] Minchah), two and one-half variable hours before sunset, is the preferable earliest time to recite Minchah.\n\n\"Plag Hamincha\" (פְּלַג הַמִּנְחָה, literally half of the Minchah) is the midpoint between Minchah Ketanah and sunset, i.e. one and one-quarter variable hours before sunset. If one prayed Minchah before this time, one may recite Maariv afterwards (at the conclusion of the Sabbath, this may only be done under extenuating circumstances). Otherwise, one must wait until sunset, unless one is praying as a congregation.\n\nSunset (שְׁקִיעַת הַחַמָּה, \"Shkiyat Hachamah\" - often referred to simply as '/'/\"\") is the time at which the ball of the sun falls below the horizon. The new day begins at this point for almost all purposes. For example, the calendar date changes.\n\nMitzvot that must be performed during the day may no longer be performed \"ab initio.\" Minchah should not be delayed past now. Maariv may be recited now, although many wait until after nightfall.\n\nSunset's calendar date change effects include knowing how to match secular date of passing away with Yartzeit date.\n\n\"Bein Hashemashot\" (בֵּין הַשְּׁמָשׁוֹת, literally between the suns) is the period between sunset and nightfall, and is considered a time of questionable status. On the Sabbath, festivals, and fast days the stringencies of both the previous and following days apply. For example, if the fast of Tish'a Ba'av immediately follows the Sabbath, the intervening Bein Hashemashot is forbidden in eating, drinking, \"and\" working. However, there are occasional leniencies.\n\nNightfall (צֵאת הַכּוֹֹכָבִים, \"Tzet Hakochavim\") is described in detail above. After nightfall, it is considered definitely the following day. All restrictions of the previous day go away, and any Mitzvot that must be performed at night (such as the evening Shema, the Seder, or Bedikas Chametz may be performed.\n\nמוצאי שבת, the End of Shabbat (or equivalently, the end of a festival or fast), is described in the Talmud as a time when \"three medium stars are [visible] in the sky.\" There is much discussion of what this means, and not to end Shabbat \"too\" early, it tends to be construed strictly in practice. There are various observed practices, all of which have support in the halachic literature:\n\nMidnight (חֲצוֹת הַלַּילָה, \"Chatzot Halaylah\" or just \"Chatzot\") is the midpoint between nightfall and daybreak, or equivalently between sunset and sunrise. The evening Shema should be recited by now, and the Afikoman on Passover should be eaten by this time. The Talmud in Berachot rules that all \"night\" mitzvot should be performed by \"Chatzot,\" at least \"ab initio,\" in case the person would otherwise fall asleep and then fail to perform the mitzvot. Some rise at this time and recite \"Tikkun Chatzot\", a series of supplications for the rebuilding of the Temple.\n\nOn the Eve of Passover, chametz may not be eaten after four variable hours, and must be burned before five variable hours.\n\nThe Mussaf prayer should preferably be recited before seven variable hours, on days it is recited.\n\n"}
