It treats of the crippled virgin daughter of Peter, who was accused by the crowd that gathered before his door, among whom he had caused many blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the lame to walk: \"But your virgin daughter, who has grown up to be beautiful and who has believed in the name of God, why have you not helped her? For behold, one side of her is completely paralyzed and she lies crippled there in the corner.\"\n\nPeter bids the girl rise and walk, and she does, and the crowd rejoices. \"Then Peter said to his daughter, 'Go to your place, sit down, and become an invalid again.'\" The crowd weeps.\n\nPeter then relates the vision he received when the girl was born, that she would wound many with her beauty. \"\"When the girl became ten years old, many were tempted by her. And a man rich in property, Ptolemy, after he had seen the girl bathing with her mother, sent for her so that he might take her for his wife.\"\n\nA section is missing, and when the text resumes, Ptolemy's servants are putting her down before the house, and depart. Finding her \"with one whole side of her body, from her toes to her head, paralyzed and withered, we picked her up, praising the Lord who had saved his servant from defilement, [and] pollution.\"\n\nThe contrite Ptolemy receives a vision, saying \"Ptolemy, God did not give his vessels for corruption and pollution. But it was necessary for you, since you believed in me, that you not defile my virgin, whom you should have recognized as your sister, since I have become one Spirit for you both.\" This is the one Gnostic detail of the text, which is in every other way a conventional miracle tale.\n\nPtolemy leaves a plot of land to the girl, \"since because of her he believed in God and was saved\", and Peter sells it and distributes the price to the poor.\n\nOnly nominally connected with the Peter of the New Testament, this brief \"Act\" expresses in a characteristically extreme form the cult of virginity in the male-dominated 5th-century Christian Church, a cultural thread that may also be detected in many early \"Acta\" of female martyrs.\n\n\n"}

He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAnthropology circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with magical thinking, and that it is a cultural product. The complete continuity between magic and religion has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s. The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the \"projection idea\", a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human community that worships it, that \"creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man.\" In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion. A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was Giambattista Vico, and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer Xenophanes, which observed that \"the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes.\"\n\nIn 1912 Émile Durkheim, building on Feuerbach, considered religion \"a projection of the social values of society,\" \"a means of making symbolic statements about society,\" \"a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order\"; in short, \"religion is society worshiping itself\".\n\nIn the 19th century, cultural anthropology was dominated by an interest in cultural evolution; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter. In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach. Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber. They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.\n\nOne major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself. At one time anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or ghosts, the use of magic as a means of controlling the supernatural, the use of divination as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of rituals such as prayer and sacrifice as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of shamanism or ancestor worship. According to Clifford Geertz, religion is\nToday, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European primitivism). Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion – such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual – but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.\n\nAnthony F. C. Wallace proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.\n\n\n"}

The film also deals with themes of bisexuality, as a romantic drama film.\n\nIt is one of the first feature narratives from the Caribbean to address homosexuality. It was the opening night film of the Bahamas International Film Festival. The Bahamas had banned the film \"Brokeback Mountain\" in 2006. The film made its International Premiere at the Miami International Film Festival and has premiered at over 100 film festivals around the world, winning 17 awards. \"Children of God\" was named one of the top ten films of 2010 on BET.com.\n\nJonny (Johnny Ferro), an awkward painting student, is “banished” by his instructor to the remote island of Eleuthera, to focus on his work and find his artistic voice. But first he finds Romeo (Stephen Tyrone Williams), a handsome, self-confident guy who shows Jonny the scenic spots, and a bit more. Romeo's got a girlfriend, however, as well as a blustery mother who willfully ignores any clue or hint he drops to set her straight.\n\nMeanwhile, Lena (Margaret Laurena Kemp), a pastor's wife, has also made her way to this distant spot to contemplate her future in relative calm. Tired of her husband spouting high-and-mighty, anti-gay rhetoric at rallies while refusing to own up to the cruelty and contradictions in his private life, Lena has a decision to make.\n\nThe phrase, \"Children of God\" is the religious expression used by Christians to refer to human divinity as being all God's Children. Four Bahamian individuals set out on a journey from the frenetic energy of Nassau to the slower-paced and open Eleuthera. The year is 2004, when the Caribbean world is rocked by the emergence of Rosie O'Donnell's gay family cruise ship. Actual documentary footage details the mass hysteria that divides the Caribbean, as some fundamentalists lead widespread rallies.\n\nJonny, a young, obsessive-compulsive white Bahamian artist, faces losing his scholarship at a local university if he does not live up to the potential his professors believe he has. Jonny escapes from his gritty inner-city life, in Nassau, to the under-populated and dramatic Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Here he decides to paint his 'masterpiece' and then gets killed by a closeted homosexual when Jonny was en route to meet Romeo. It could have had a happy ending. However, in this film, life does not have happy endings for many gay and lesbians.\n\nLena Mackey is an extremely conservative forty-year-old, anti-gay activist who finds out that her husband is not who he represents himself to be. She believes that the only way to fix problems in her life is to limit the rights of homosexuals. She heads to Eleuthera for the purpose of galvanizing the community to oppose gay rights. When Jonny arrives, his and Lena's paths cross, and together these two embark on a series of physical and emotional adventures that not only inspire Jonny to paint, but also give him a new zest for life.\n\n\n\"Children of God\" made its International Premiere at the Miami International Film Festival in March 2010. It had a limited theatrical release in May 2011 in New York and Miami. \"Children of God\" went on to premiere on the Showtime television network on June 2, 2010, and the DVD was released on June 7 through TLA Releasing.\n\nJohnny Ferro won Best Actor at the Out on Film festival in Atlanta, Georgia, against runner-up James Franco (for \"Howl\").\n\n\"New York Times\" critic Jeannette Catsoulis found the film mediocre, with the characters standing for overly simplistic representatives of the films' ideas. BET.com reviewer Clay Cane gave it a strongly positive review, praising the acting (especially Margaret Laurena Kemp as Lena) and the photography and technical excellence despite its low budget. \"Variety\" reviewer Boyd van Hoeij similarly praised its cinematography and the lead actors while also noting its \"formulaic elements\".\n\n\n"}

Cultural Muslims can be found across the world, but are especially numerous in the Middle East (Arabic speaking countries as well as in Israel, Turkey and Iran), Europe, Central Asia, North America, and parts of South and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Central Asia and in former communist countries, the term \"cultural Muslim\" came into use to describe those who wished their \"Muslim\" identity to be associated with certain national and ethnic rituals, rather than merely religious faith.\n\nMalise Ruthven (2000) discussed the terms \"cultural Muslim\" and \"nominal Muslim\" as follows:\nThere is, however, a secondary meaning to \"Muslim\" which may shade into the first. A Muslim is one born to a Muslim father who takes on his or her parents' confessional identity without necessarily subscribing to the beliefs and practices associated with the faith, just as a Jew may describe him- or herself as \"Jewish\" without observing the Tanakh or Halacha. In non-Muslim societies, such Muslims may subscribe to, and be vested with, secular identities. The Muslims of Bosnia, descendants of Slavs who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule, are not always noted for attendance at prayer, abstention from alcohol, seclusion of women and other social practices associated with believing Muslims in other parts of the world. They were officially designated as \"Muslims by nationality\" to distinguish them from Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats under the former Yugoslav communist regime. The label \"Muslim\" indicates their ethnicity and group allegiance, but not necessarily their religious beliefs. In this limited context (which may apply to other Muslim minorities in Europe and Asia), there may be no contradiction between being Muslim and being atheist or agnostic, just as there are Jewish atheists and Jewish agnostics. This secular definition of Muslim (sometimes the terms \"cultural Muslim\" or \"nominal Muslim\" are used) is very far from being uncontested.\nA cultural Muslim internalizes the Islamic cultural tradition, or way of thinking, as a frame of reference. Cultural Muslims are diverse in terms of norms, values, political opinions, and religious views. They retain a shared \"discourse or structure of feeling\" related to shared history and memories.\n\nThe concept of a \"cultural Muslim\" - someone who identifies as a Muslim yet is not religious - is not met with acceptance in conservative Islamic religious communities.\n\nAccording to WIN-Gallup International's Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism project, countries with the highest proportion of irreligious Muslims are Turkey (73%), Kosovo (60%), Azerbaijan (51%) and Lebanon (33%).\n\nWhen it comes to mosque attendance about 1% of the Muslims in Azerbaijan, 5% in Albania, 9% in Uzbekistan, 10% in Kazakhstan, 19% in Russia, and 22% in Kosovo attend mosque once a week or more. According to a Pew Research Center study, only 15% of the Muslims in Albania and 18% of the Muslims in Kazakhstan said that religion was very important in their lives. The same study found that only 2% of Muslims in Kazakhstan, 4% in Albania, 10% in Kosovo, 14% in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 14% in Kyrgyzstan, 16% in Uzbekistan, and 21% in Azerbaijan perform all five prayers a day. Furthermore, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center Report, only 7% to 13% of all Turks think that religion should affect laws directly or indirectly.\n\n"}

It also expresses the idea that it is by fulfilling their own needs that people can help others do the same and create space for genuine contact; that is, when they \"find each other, it's beautiful.\"\n\nThe prayer is well known in gestalt and psychotherapy circles, where it is generally taken as a summarizing statement of the philosophy of personal independence central to gestalt therapy. This philosophy still attracts critics, generally arguing that interpersonal relationships require real, hard work to maintain. Supporters counter that an attitude of independence does not refute this, but rather encourages people to realize that relationships need not be founded on obligation or expectation.\nThe prayer remains popular in general culture, although the last line is sometimes omitted. In academic discussion, it sometimes acts as a starting point for debate around issues of autonomy and interdependence.\nIt must be added, however, that it does not characterize Gestalt therapy in general, but rather Fritz Perls' personal attitude during the time at the Esalen Institute.\n\nThe statement \"I am not in this world to live up to your expectations\" was used by the reggae artist Peter Tosh in his 1977 song \"I Am That I Am\".\n"}

The site has the distinction of having the largest sarovar (water pond) of all the gurdwaras. It is famous for the monthly gathering of pilgrims on the day of Amavas (a no-moon night). It is near Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar.\n\nGuru Arjan Dev Ji, the Fifth Sikh Guru, founded Tarn Taran Sahib in the year 1590, in the Land of Panjab (Majha Region). At that time, the digging of the lake tank started. When the tank was completed, it was the biggest and largest sarovar lake in the whole of Panjab. The foundation stone of Darbar Sahib was laid by Dhan Dhan Baba Buddha Ji, a famous Sikh saint (1506–1631). Later, the Sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib, came to the gurdwara and stayed for some time. Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru, also visited Tarn Taran Sahib and preached to the Sikh sangat.\n\nShaheed Baba Deep Singh made a mark on the ground at Tarn Taran Sahib, and he asked the Sikhs if they were ready to die fighting against the enemies before entering into war against the Afhan Empire in 1757.\n\nIn 1768 Sardar Budh Singh Virk of Singhpuria Misl and Maharaja Jassa Singh Ramgarhia of Ramgarhia Misl joined hands to rebuild the Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran. Which then was in a shape of a traditional mud building.\n\nLater Maharaja Ranjit Singh Sher-e-Panjab (1799–1839), who visited Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran from 1802-1837, reconstructed the present Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran in 1836-1837 and also completed the work of the Parikarma which had been left unfinished by the two Sardars Singhpuria Misl and Ramgarhia Misl. Sher-e-Panjab gold-plated the Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran, as he did with the Harmandir Sahib at Amritsar. Artisans were called in by the Maharaja of Panjab Kingdom to decorate the inside of Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran.\n\nSher-e-Panjab built 17 massive gate entrances in Tarn Taran in which elephants could easily go through. When Maharaja Nau Nihal Singh, the grandson of Sher-e-Panjab, came to Tarn Taran, he built a minara (tower) at the end of the sarovar. Only one was completed, which can be seen while walking to Darbar Sahib. Three others were planned on each end of the sarovar, but were not constructed due to the death of Maharaja Nau Nihal Singh and also because of the two Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849) against the British.\n\nIn 1877, Bhai Harsa Singh, a granthi of Darbar Sahib, Tarn Taran, was the first teacher, of the Singh Sabha movement, which came into existence in 1873, to protect the Sikhs of Punjab, against the Arya Samaj, Christian Missionaries, who were at that time trying the best to convert the Sikhs, but found it hard to make there ways into the Sikh population. \n\nIn 1883, Raja Raghubir Singh (1832-1887), the Sikh Chieftain of Jind Princely State, had a channel dug, from the sarovar, to bring in new water, to keep the tank beautified. The channel was latter paved by Sant Gurmukh Singh (1849-1947), of Patiala from 1927-28. During 1923-28, the Sarovar at Tarn Taran was desilted and lined. \n\nDuring the British Rule (1849–1947), Sardar Arur Singh Shergill (1865–1926) was made the manager of Tarn Taran Sahib Gurdwara from 1907-1920, by the British, to keep the Sikh shrine out of direct Sikh Control. In 1905 an earthquake damaged the Lotus Dome of Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran, but soon after it was rebuilt. The Sikhs of Punjab fought and sacrificed to gain independence from the British rulers. In 1921 greedy priests divided the income of the Gurdwara among themselves. It was in 1921 that the Sikhs decided to free Tarn Taran Sahib. Seventeen Sikhs got injured at Tarn Taran. Two Sikhs attained martyrdom - Sardar Hazara Singh of Village Aladinpur District Amritsar and Sardar Hukam Singh of Village Wasoo Kot District Gurdaspur.\n\nThey were the first martyrs of the Gurdwara reform movement. On arrival of more squads on 26 January, the priests handed over the management of the Gurdwara to the Prabhandak Committee. This martyrdom was known as Saka Tarn Taran.\n\nSince the partition of 1947, more work (kar Seva) has been done on Darbar Sahib Tarn Taran. The first work was in 1970, when the Old Bungas Towers of Sikh chieftains were demolished to construct a big complex. In all four corners of Darbar Sahib, the Holy Tank (Sarovar) was cleaned by Sikhs. In the early 1980s, a big hall was built to replace many Old Sikh period buildings. In 2005 the whole of Darbar Sahib was renovated. It was plated in new gold, and inside the Darbar Sahib new work was done. New marble was inlaid; a big complex was built; and more buildings were added around the complex. This Karsewa was done by Baba Jagtar Singh ji Karsewa Tarn Taran Wale.\n\n"}

In the fourth year of Islam, when Muhammad was commanded to invite his closer relatives to come to Islam he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony.

The second volume excerpts from medieval histories and chronicles and from inscriptions concerning the destruction of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples. The authors claim that the material presented in the book as \"the tip of an iceberg\".\n\nThe book contains chapters about the Ayodhya debate. The appendix of the first volume contains a list of temple-destructions and atrocities that the authors claim took place in Bangladesh in 1989. The book also criticizes Marxist historians, and one of the appendices of the second volume includes a questionnaire for \"Marxist professors\", one of which the authors sent to well-known Indian historian Romila Thapar.\n\nIn August 1990, while releasing the book \"Hindu Temples – What Happened To Them\", Bharatiya Janta Party leader L. K. Advani chided Goel for using \"strong language\". There were proposals in November 1990 in Uttar Pradesh to ban the book.\n\nCynthia Talbot in 1995 claimed that Goel's list of destroyed temples is \"greatly inflated\", but also called for a systematic and unbiased study of the subject, without which it is very difficult to gauge the extent of damage wrought on Indian temples. Cynthia Talbot noted that in the decades after 1565, temple desecration were on the rise in Andhra Pradesh, which is in accord with the dates of temple destructed provided by Goel's list (in Goel's chapter \"Let the Mute Witness speak\"). Reflecting on Goel's list, Talbot states: \"Five date from the fourteenth century (phase one), six come from phase two, and nineteen date from 1565 to 1650 CE (phase three). The remaining thirty or so cases stem from the century after 1650, with a notable bunching of incidents in the late 1600s, when the Mughal empire was absorbing the former Qutb Shahi kingdom of Golconda.\"\n\nManini Chatterjee, in a review in the \"Calcutta Telegraph\", called Goel's book a \"very bad book\". Richard Eaton also criticized the book. Eaton discussed one of the cases in Goel's list of destroyed temples: \"an inscription dated 1455, found over the doorway of a tomb-shrine in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh\" which mentions \"the destruction of a Hindu temple by one Abdullah Shah Changal during the reign of Bhoja, a renowned Paramara king who had ruled over the region from 1010 to 1053\". Eaton says that the inscription is \"hardly contemporary\" and \"presents a richly textured legend elaborated over many generations of oral transmission until 1455\". He acknowledges that \"Goel does, however, consider it more likely that the event took place during the reign of Raja Bhoja II in the late thirteenth century rather than during that of Raja Bhoja I in the eleventh century.\" Richard Eaton thinks that \"we cannot know with certainty\" if the temple destruction did take place. Eaton also claimed that Goel has used \"selective translations of premodem Persian chronicles, together with a selective use of epigraphic data\". According to Vimal Yogi Tiwari, such an historical assessment as in Goel's book \"Hindu Temples\" has by and large been missing in India.\n\nGoel's book also includes an exchange of comments between Romila Thapar and Goel.

Well known in the Mouride Brotherhood, Ibrahima Fall established the influential Baye Fall movement.\n\nNeil Savishinsky (1994) contends that Sheikh Ibrahima Fall is “one of the first and most illustrious of Ahmadu Bamba’s disciples”. The Bimestriel Islamique (2000, December) claims that French West Africa called him the minister of economic affairs in the Mouridism. Ibrahima Fall catalysed the Mouride movement. Fall led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride Talibes (Mouride disciples) and their guide, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of \"Dieuf Dieul\" “you reap what you sow”.\n\nSerigne Bassirou Mbacké, son of Sheikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, claims that Ibrahima Fall renovated the Mouride Brotherhood. According to Mbacké, Ibrahima Fall introduced giving money to Aamadu Bàmba. Mourides follow this practice of giving money to their sheikh. Serigne Moussa Kâ understands that “Fall initiated devoting ones life to his Sheikh in search of aura (Wolof \"tarbiya\"). Sheikh Diop (1980) confirms the great importance of Ibrahima Fall to Mouridism, stating that “Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba and Sheikh Ibrahima Fall realise the symbiosis of Mouride values, pray and work” .\n\nIbrahima Fall comes from an aristocratic Wolof family from Cayor. A scholar confirms that Fall came out of an animistic influenced Muslim tradition, but believes Fall’s family was prosperous and formerly powerful in Cayor. Other sources confirm that Fall’s grandfather, Damel Dethialaw, was a ruler of the Cayor kingdom.\n\nIbrahima Fall was born around 1855 in a northern village, Ndiaby Fall, Cayor. His original \"tyeddo\" name was Yapsa Khanth Fall. Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke gave him later the name Ibrahima Fall. Ibrahima Fall was a son of Amadou Rokhaya Fall and Seynabou Ndiaye. At an early age, Ibrahima Fall learned the Qur'an in a neighbouring village, Ndiaré.\nFall achieved major Arabic sciences such as theology, fiqh, tafsir, grammar and rhetoric. Savishinsky (1994) tells us that Ibrahima Fall had “reputation for ferocity and extraordinary strength” (p. 212). Another scholar claims that Fall was viewed as a troubled man who seldom went with his peers and often remained alone in the bush. However, all agree that the turning point of his life was Fall’s search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke.\n\nOne major study of Ibrahima Fall reports that two versions exist of his search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba. In the first version, Fall is rich merchant who travelled in Cayor, Jolof and Saloum. But after meeting Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in Mbacké Bari, Fall gave up business to become Bamba’s disciple.\n\nIn the second version, which is more commonly believed in Senegal, Ibrahima Fall in 1882 went on looking to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Scholars state that Ibrahima Fall knew that his destiny dictated him to search for him. Without any knowledge of him, Ibrahima Fall went on looking for the best Muslim teachers. Ibrahima Fall tested Serigne Massamba Syll and after Serigne Adama Gueye. Adama Gueye conducted Ibrahima Fall through mystic ways to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in 1883.\n\nThe encounter between Ibrahima Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke defined the beginning of Mouridism. Savishinsky claims “Fal (Ibra Faal) performed his obeisance to Ahmadu Bamba in crown-slave style disrobing and falling forward to the ground.\" Serigne Bassirou (1995) narrates the famous speech that Ibrahima Fall and Ahmadou Bamba exchanged:\n\nIbrahima Fall: “If I found only your gravestone, be aware that the force of my intention would satisfy my objective”\n\nSheikh Ahmadou Bamba: “If I found only the stars and the sky that Muhammad watched at, I’m sure that I could attain my objective with my strong love of the prophet [...] Know that from this life, I’ll neither protect you from sun nor provide you material goods. I accept you if you follow God recommendations”.\n\nIn this way, the contract started between Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Ibrahima Fall became his 40th disciple. From this moment, Fall followed the \"Ndiguel\" \"orders\" of the Shaikh until Fall’s death.\n\nWithin this contract called “Diebelou”, Savishinsky claims that Ibrahima Fall displayed an absolute, slave-like devotion to his master. His “pastef” (courage and devotion) served example for all Mourides. In fact, Fall started “growing food, cutting firewood, fetching water and building shelters and mosques” (p. 213). Likewise, Serigne Moussa Kâ tells us that Fall reshaped quickly the relation between a disciple and his guide. Ibrahima Fall instituted five rules of deference to the Sheikh:\nIbrahima Fall himself supervised these rules.\n\nIn appearance, Ibrahima Fall had matted locks. Fall carried a black cudgel especially for making people respecting these rules. Fall also smoked a Western African plant called “pone”. Moussa Kâ claims that Fall often begged in neighbour villages with a wood bowl, which was an unorthodox practice. When Mame Chiekh Ibra Fall was taking a haircut, S.Touba told him not to take a haircut today, because it is not a day to take a haircut and he didn't take a haircut because he didn't have permission.\n\nIn 1890, Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba nominated Fall the third responsible in the Mouride Brotherhood. Fall had to supervise all manual works. With the exile of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Fall’s life changed. He moved to Saint-Louis, Senegal, to defend the innocence of his Shaikh. During Fall’s negotiations with the French, Paul Marty recognised that Fall hid great intelligence. Another scholar cites the multiple Arabic poetries of Ibrahima Fall to prove Fall’s intellectualism. Fall wrote also an Arabic book, \"Jazbul Mouride\".\n\nOn 21 September 1895, the French exiled Aamadu Bàmba to Gabon. Aamadu Bàmba ordered Ibrahima Fall to work for Sherif Hassan. He did so until 1901, when Sherif Hassan died. In this interval (1895–1901), Fall kept sending money (in Wolof “Adiya”) to the Shaikh until his return in 1902. On 11 November 1902, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke returned to Senegal and awarded Ibrahima Fall the degree of Sheikh.\n\nIn June 1912, the French kept Aamadu Bàmba under house arrest in Ndjarèem, Diourbel. Consequently, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall followed him to Diourbel. In Diourbel, Fall created a famous district, Keur Sheikh. In Keur Sheikh, the Baye Fall movement consolidated and expanded very quickly. Many \"tyeddo\"s became his disciples. In 1925, the French banned construction of the Touba Mosque. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall enclosed the area of the mosque with timbers Fall carried from Ndjarèem to Touba.\n\nIn 1927, at the death of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall performed among the first obeisance to the Shaikh's son, Serigne Moustapha Mbacké. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall participated in the difficult creation of the railroads between Diourbel and Touba. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall died 9 June 1930 after helping the succession of Aamadu Bàmba. He lies in Touba.\n\nSheikh Ibrahima Fall obviously helped Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke to expand Mouridism, particularly with Fall’s establishment of the Baye Fall movement. For this contribution, Serigne Fallou (2nd Caliph after Aamadu Bàmba) named him “Lamp Fall\" (the light of Mouridism). In addition, Ibrahima Fall earned the title of “Babul Mouridina”, meaning \"Gate of Mouridism\".\n\n"}

If they find a newborn cub, they kill the mother and take the cub back to the village, where they raise it indoors, as if it were one of their own children. It is said that they even provide the cub with their own breast milk. When the cub grows larger, they take it outdoors, and put it into a small pen made of logs. Throughout their lives, the bears are provided with high-quality food. The cubs are treated as, and traditionally believed to be, gods.\n\nAfter the cub reaches one or two years of age, they release it from the cell and place it in the center of the village, where it is tied to a post with a rope. The males in the village then take shots at the cub with bows and arrows. Even at the age of two years, the brown bears are quite large, and it usually takes numerous shots before they fall. After the bear has been weakened from numerous arrow strikes and is too weak to defend itself, one villager will approach the bear and shoot it in the neck point-blank, to ensure that it is dead. The villagers then slit the bear's throat and drink the blood. The bear is skinned, and the meat is distributed amongst the villagers. Its bare skull is placed on a spear, which is then rewrapped with the bear's own fur. This \"doll\" is an object of worship for the villagers. The bear has now been \"sent off\" to the world of the gods.\n\nHokkaido encouraged local governments to abolish the Iomante in 1955, but the circular notice was abolished in April 2007, because the Ministry of the Environment of Japan announced that animal ceremonies were generally regarded as an exception of the animal rights law of Japan in October 2006.\n\nIyomante videos and artifacts are on display at the Nibutani Ainu Culture Museum in Nibutani, Hokkaidō, as well as the Ainu Museum in Shiraoi-cho, Hokkaidō.\n\n\nSome of the content of this article was taken from the equivalent Japanese-language Wikipedia article (accessed April 10, 2006).\n\n"}

Muslims, who are mostly Arab citizens of Israel, constitute 17.7% of the Israelis, making them the largest minority group in Israel.\n\nJerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. \"Al-Ḥaram ash-Sharīf\" (, The Holy Sanctuary, that is originally part of the Jewish Temple Mount of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to the Heavens. This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque. Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the Temple Mount which is managed day to day by Jordan's Islamic \"Waqf\" (), an administrative body taking responsibility for the conduct of Islamic affairs in the region of the Temple Mount.\n\nIslam was brought to the region of Palestine during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, when armies from the Arabian Peninsula under the Rashidun Caliphate conquered a territory previously under the control of the Byzantine Empire, that is Shaam.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the region became increasingly Islamized. This tendency was temporarily reversed during the 2 centuries of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Christian state established by European Crusaders. As a result of the rise of the Ottoman Empire, from 1516 to 1917, the Sunni Ottoman Turks ruled the Levant. In Ottoman Palestine, Islam was the state religion administered remotely from Constantinople, while Christians, Jews, and Samaritans were mostly tolerated as dhimmi.\n\nThe conquest of Palestine by British forces in 1917 and the subsequent Balfour Declaration opened the gates for the arrival of large numbers of Jews and Arabs and in to the Mandatory Palestine. However, the British transferred the symbolic Islamic governance of the land to the Hashemites based in Jordan, and not to the House of Saud. The Hashemites thus became the official guardians of the Islamic holy places of Jerusalem and the areas around it, particularly strong when Jordan controlled and illegally annexed the West Bank of the River Jordan (1948–1967). In 1922, the British created the Supreme Muslim Council in the Mandatory Palestine and appointed Haj Amin al-Husseini (1895–1974) as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The council was abolished in 1948.\n\nMuslims comprise 17.7% of the Israeli population. The majority of Muslims in Israel are Sunni Arabs, with an Ahmadiyya minority. The Bedouin in Israel are also Arab Muslims, with some Bedouin clans participating in the Israeli army. The small Circassian community is composed of Sunni Muslims uprooted from the Caucasus in the late 19th century. In addition, smaller populations of Kurdish, Romani and Turkish Muslims also live in Israel.\n\nThe city of Haifa in Israel acts as the Middle East headquarters of the reformist Ahmadiyya Islamic movement. Kababir, a mixed neighbourhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs is the only one of its kind in the country. There are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir.\n\nSunni Islam is by far the largest sect in the country. Most Israeli Muslims shared the same school of thought as with many Sunnis in the Levant that is Shafi'i even though there are also Hanafi presence as well. There is a strong community of Sufis in several parts of the country and Sufism has garned popular attention to non-Muslim Israelis. An annual Sufi Festival in Ashram Desert in Negev is dedicated to Sufi arts and traditions.\n\nDuring the British rule in Mandatory Palestine, it used to have seven Shia Twelver majority villages especially in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon before it was deserted during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in which the residents of those seven villages fled to neighbouring Lebanon as refugees. Because of this, Twelver Shias are very tiny minority in Israel.\n\nThere are around 4,000 Alawites in Israel and majority of them lives in Ghajar village in the occupied Golan Heights near the border with Lebanon. Most residents in Ghajar considered themselves as Syrian but majority of them have Israeli citizenship. They are currently the only Alawite community in Israel.\n\n15% of Muslims in Israel have a college degree, which was lower than the number of Jews (33%), but similar to the number of Christians (18%) and Druze (20%) with a degree. The overwhelming majority of Muslims believe that giving their children a good secular education is very/somewhat important (93%). 53% of Muslims say “science and religion are in conflict,” which was lower than the number of Jews agreeing with that statement (58%). On the particular topic of evolution, 38% of Muslims believe humans and other living things have evolved over time. More Muslims in Israel believe in evolution than Christians (37%) and Druze (24%), but fewer than Jews (53%).\n\nWhile Muslims living in Israel, overall, are more religious than Israeli Jews, they are less religious than Muslims living in many other countries in the Middle East. For example, about two-thirds of Muslims in Israel (68%) say religion is very important in their lives, which was similar to the number of Lebanese Muslims who agreed with that statement (59%), but lower than the share of Muslims in Jordan (85%), the Palestinian territories (85%) and Iraq (82%) who say this. Israeli Muslims nearly universally say they believe in Allah and his Prophet Muhammad (97%). A majority of Muslims say they pray daily (61%) and roughly half report that they go to a mosque at least once a week (49%). Muslim women are more likely to say that religion has high importance in their lives, and younger Muslims are generally less observant than their elders.\n\n83% of Muslims in Israel fast during Ramadan, which was the lowest among Muslims in any Middle Eastern country. 33% of Muslims believe that Jesus will return during their lifetime, which was similar to the number of Christians who held that belief (33%). When surveyed in 2015, Muslims were most comfortable with their child marrying outside of the faith compared to Jews, Christians, and Druze. The overwhelming majority of Muslims say that (97%) believe strong family relationships is very/somewhat important to them and the majority (68%) say having the opportunity to travel around the world is very/somewhat important. Younger Muslim adults are considerably more likely than older Muslims to say they value world travel. Among Muslims ages 18–49, 73% say having the opportunity to travel the world is very or somewhat important to them, compared with 52% of older Muslims.\n\nIn a 2015 survey, one-third of Muslims report having experienced at least one incident of discrimination in the past 12 months including being questioned by security officials (17%), being prevented from traveling (15%), physically threatened or attacked (15%), or having suffered property damage (13%) because of their religion. However, about a quarter of Israeli Muslims (26%) say a Jewish person has expressed concern or sympathy toward them in the past year because of their religious identity. Muslim and Christians within Israel have equal rights and many become parliamentarians, judges, diplomats, public health officials and IDF generals. \n\n"}

{"id": "1448262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1448262", "title": "Ketubah", "text": "Ketubah\n\nA ketubah (; pl. \"ketubot\") is a special type of Jewish prenuptial agreement. It is considered an integral part of a traditional Jewish marriage, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom, in relation to the bride. In modern practice, the ketubah has no agreed monetary value, and is never enforced, except in Israel.\n\nThe rabbis in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into the \"ketubah\" as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical \"mohar\" – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The \"ketubah\" became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid in the event of the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. The biblical \"mohar\" created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the \"mohar\" at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they would be more likely to have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the \"mohar\" to be a part of the \"ketubah\". Both the \"mohar\" and the \"ketubah\" amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the \"ketubah\" amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.\n\nOver two hundred \"ketubot\" were discovered, among other manuscripts, in the Cairo Geniza. They date between the 6th and 19th centuries and, whilst many consist of plain text, there are examples that utilise decorative devices such as micrography and illumination to elaborate them.\n\nThe content of the \"ketubah\" is in essence a one-way contract that formalizes the various requirements by Halakha (Jewish law) of a Jewish husband \"vis à vis\" his wife. The Jewish husband takes upon himself in the \"ketubah\" the obligation that he will provide to his wife three major things: clothing, food and conjugal relations, and also that he will pay her a pre-specified amount of cash in the case of a divorce. Thus the content of the \"ketubah\" essentially dictates security and protection for the woman, and her rights in the marriage. (Conservative Jews often include an additional paragraph, called the Lieberman clause, which stipulates that divorce will be adjudicated by a modern rabbinical court (a beth din) in order to prevent the creation of a chained wife.) \n\nThe Mishna and Talmud Bavli record that the \"Beth-Din of Kohanim\" would oversee that the Ketubah of a Bat-Kohen would contract the amount of four hundred Zuz (an increase from the standard amount of two hundred Zuz) in the event the Bat-Kohen would be given a Get (bill of divorce) – the increase was written as the base amount due the Bat-Kohen and not penned as a bonus.\n\nThe Talmud Yerushalmi opines that the Bat-Kohen who marries a non-Kohen receives that standard two hundred Zuz amount, as a penalty for not marrying within the greater family of Kohanim.\n\nBased on the research of A. Epstien, in his work \"Toldot HaKetubah B'Yisrael\", the recording of Four hundred Zuz in the Ketubah of the Bat-Kohen was well in effect during the Amora period, but from thence onward, no mentioning of the increased amount is found in Rabbinic sources.\n\nThe ketubah is a significant popular form of Jewish ceremonial art. Ketubot have been made in a wide range of designs, usually following the tastes and styles of the era and region in which they are made. Many couples follow the Jewish tradition of \"hiddur mitzvah\" which calls for ceremonial objects such as the ketubah to be made as beautiful as possible.\n\nTraditional \"ketubot\" are not written in the Hebrew language, but in Aramaic, the lingua franca of Jews at the time \"ketubot\" became standardized. This was done in order to make sure the bride and groom understood the contract that was being signed. Many contemporary \"ketubot\" have translations into English or other vernacular languages or an accompanying vernacular text. Many Conservative Jews and other non-Orthodox Jews use ketubot written in Hebrew rather than in Aramaic. Others may use Aramaic ketubot but also have an additional official version in Hebrew.\n\nIn recent years kettubot have become available in a variety of formats as well as the traditional Aramaic text used by the Orthodox community. Available texts include Conservative text, using the Lieberman Clause, Reform, Egalitarian and Interfaith texts. Some congregations have texts available for same sex couples too. In addition, Secular Humanist and Anniversary texts are also available today.\n\nIn a traditional Jewish wedding ceremony, the \"ketubah\" is signed by two witnesses and traditionally read out loud under the chuppah. Close family, friends or distant relatives are invited to witness the ketubah, which is considered an honour. The witnesses must be halakhically valid witnesses, and so cannot be a blood relative of the couple. In Orthodox Judaism, women are also not considered to be valid witnesses. The ketubah is handed to the bride for safekeeping.\n\nKetubot are often hung prominently in the home by the married couple as a daily reminder of their vows and responsibilities to each other.\n\nHowever, in some communities, the ketubah is either displayed in a very private section of the home or is not displayed at all. Various reasons given for this include the fact that the details specify personal details, prominent display may invite jealousy or fears of the evil eye. Historically, the ketubah specified whether the bride was a virgin. In Sephardic communities, it still specifies the actual contributions of the family to the new household and the divorce settlement; Ashkenazi communities have adopted the custom of having set amounts for all weddings.\n\nAccording to Jewish law, spouses are prohibited from living together if the ketubah has been destroyed, lost, or is otherwise unretrievable. In such case a second ketubah is made up (called a Ketubah De'irketa), which states in its opening phrase that it comes to substitute a previous ketubah that has been lost.\n\n\n"}

He fought in several battles with his brother, Flying Hawk and first cousin, Crazy Horse during the War for the Black Hills, including Battle of the Greasy Grass.\n\nKicking Bear was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877. The ceremony was held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the victory at the Battle of the Greasy Grass, and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing. The five warrior cousins were brothers Kicking Bear, Flying Hawk and Black Fox II, all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle. The five warrior cousins were braves considered vigorous battle men of distinction.\n\nKicking Bear was also a holy man active in the Ghost Dance religious movement of 1890, and had traveled with fellow Lakota Short Bull to visit the movement's leader, Wovoka (a Paiute holy man living in Nevada). The three Lakota men were instrumental in bringing the movement to their people who were living on reservations in South Dakota. Following the murder of Sitting Bull, Kicking Bear and Short Bull were imprisoned at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Upon their release in 1891, both men joined \"Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show\", and toured with the show in Europe. That experience was humiliating to him . After a year-long tour, Kicking Bear returned to the Pine Ridge Reservation to care for his family. In March 1896, Kicking Bear traveled to Washington, D.C. as one of three Sioux delegates taking grievances to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He made his feelings known about the drunken behavior of traders on the reservation, and asked that Native Americans have more ability to make their own decisions. While in Washington, Kicking Bear agreed to have a life mask made of himself. The mask was to be used as the face of a Sioux warrior to be displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. A gifted artist, he painted his account of the Battle of Greasy Grass at the request of artist Frederic Remington in 1898, more than twenty years after the battle. Kicking Bear was buried with the arrowhead as a symbol of the ways he so dearly desired to resurrect when he died on May 28, 1904. His remains are buried somewhere in the vicinity of Manderson-White Horse Creek.\n\n\n"}

Many letter forms were uncertain, and the texts themselves were cryptic and obscure, so the Catholic authorities found themselves entirely reliant on Morisco translators; chief amongst whom were Miguel de Luna and Alonso del Castillo, who by fortunate chance lived in the nearby Albaicin, and who had indeed been instrumental in the rediscovery of some of the books. One complete book, the so-called \"Libro Mudo\", or \"Mute Book\", has remained undeciphered and untranslated to this day.\n\nAs reported by the Christian Morisco translators, the books recorded the prophetic and liturgical teachings of the Blessed Virgin Mary, chiefly addressed through Saint Peter, in which she gave instructions for Saint James the Great and Saint Caecilius to be dispatched on a mission to evangelise Spain, stating her love for the Arabic peoples and language of that land, and promising her particular guardianship over the city of Granada. Taken together, the books may be regarded as a supplement to the canonical Acts of the Apostles (and taken together, are indeed of similar length), but recording an alternative mission history in which Saint Paul does not appear. The Virgin's words had apparently been delivered in Latin, but were claimed to have been translated and interpreted into Arabic by Caecilius. The texts include an explicit reference, in Latin, to the Counter-Reformation formulation of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (\"Mariam non comprehendit peccatum originale\"), but also employ terminology otherwise closer to Islamic formulae: \"God is One. There is no God but God, and Jesus is the Spirit of God.\"\n\nA consistent theme is to emphasise Arabic as an ancient language of Spain, Arabs in Granada as the first Christians in Spain, and Christianity as the true religion of the Arabs. The form of Christianity presented is such as to be highly acceptable to Catholics in Granada, emphasising the veneration of relics, the cult of the Virgin, and the priority of Granada as a Christian bishopric, but also downplaying some aspects of Christianity that were most repugnant to Muslims, including the cult of icons, the doctrine of the Trinity, the worship of Jesus as the incarnate Son of God and the use of wine in the Eucharist.\n\nThe discovery of the books, and the associated relics, proved to be the occasion of numerous miracles that confirmed their authenticity in the sight of the local population and of the church authorities in Granada, and attracted royal support from both Philip II and Philip III.\n\nEarly 17th century Protestant scholars in the Netherlands also took a keen interest, but their characterisation of the Lead Books as a blatant fabrication only served to discredit dissenting opinions within Catholic Spain by association with heresy. The Vatican remained highly sceptical of the texts, however, and in 1642 succeeded in having the Lead Books sent to Rome, together with an associated \"ancient\" parchment which had been discovered in 1588 in a lead box in the tower of a former mosque in the city of Granada itself. A prolonged investigation by the Holy Office in Rome concluded in 1682 that both the parchment and the Lead Books were heretical forgeries. While the Vatican's condemnation did not implicate any specific individuals, scholarly consensus since the sixteenth century is that the forgers were probably Luna and Castillo, the same two Moriscos who had translated many of the texts. While further discussion of the books by Catholics was officially forbidden, some Spanish scholars continued to maintain the authenticity of the texts through till the 19th century. The Lead Books were kept in the Vatican, but eventually returned to the Abbey of the Sacromonte in the year 2000. The Church authorities in Granada continue to forbid scholarly access however, on the grounds that the official prohibition remains in force. Current studies depend on the various (often partial and highly contradictory) transcripts and translations made at the time of the books' discovery, and on some independent decipherments produced by Vatican Arabists.\n\nAlmost all scholars now concur with the official verdict and believe that the books are a forgery intended to promote toleration of the language, dress and customs of Christian Moriscos in the face of increasing hostility from the Spanish Inquisition and the Castilian state. If so, this exercise was unsuccessful in its general objective, as it did not avoid the order of expulsion of the Moriscos which was carried out between 1604 and 1609. Both Castillo and Luna escaped the expulsion, as the archbishop of Granada, Pedro de Vaca de Castro y Quiñones, grateful for the immense increase in the prestige of his see arising from the discovery of the relics of St Caecilius, extended his personal protection to them and their families. Many of the deported Moriscos remained convinced of the books' authenticity however, and transcripts continued to circulate within Tunisia, until this practice was forcibly suppressed by Islamic religious authorities there.\n\nThe authenticity of the bones and ashes of the 12 martyrs was never officially challenged, and they continue to be venerated in the Abbey that Archbishop Castro built on the spot. Hence the legend has acquired a moral function directly contrary to the intention of its presumed original propagators; far from validating the authentically Spanish identity of Granada's Morisco traditions, the legend has served to sanction and celebrate the supersession of those traditions.\n\n"}

Muslim Job ben Solomon (1701–1773), an African-American who was kidnapped into slavery in Senegal or Gambia, is documented by his slave narrative memoir to have prayed in the forest of Kent Island, Maryland, where he was brought during 1731–33.\n\nSome sources assert that what is likely the first American mosque building was a mosque in Biddeford, Maine that was founded in 1915 by Albanian Muslims. A Muslim cemetery still existed there in 1996.\n\nHowever the first \"purpose-built\" mosque building was probably a mosque opened in 1921 in Detroit, Michigan. It was close to the famous Highland Park Ford Plant which began mass, assembly-line production of Ford Model T cars in 1913, and where \"hundreds of Arab American men\" came to work. This mosque included Sunni, Shia and Ahmadi Muslims, and was funded by Muhammad Karoub, a real estate developer.\n\nThe Mother Mosque of America, built in 1934 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is asserted to be the oldest still-existing mosque building in the U.S. Also is asserted to be the oldest standing mosque in the U.S. is the Al-Sadiq Mosque, built in 1922 in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago.\n\nNation of Islam mosques, mostly of African Americans, are often in storefronts or former churches.\n\nIt has been estimated that there were somewhat more than 100 mosques in the U.S. in 1970, but immigration of more than a million Muslims since then led to hundreds more being built.\n\nIn 1994, the Islamic Center of Yuba City, in California, was destroyed by fire set in a hate-crime, and is one of two mosques destroyed by a hate-crime in U.S. history, (the second being in Joplin, Missouri in 2012) . It had just been completed at cost of $1.8 million plus sweat equity of the Muslims of its rural community, including descendants of Pakistani who immigrated to the area 1902. Its story, including its rebuilding, is told in David Washburn's 2012 documentary film \"An American Mosque\".\n\nIn 2002, a book on \"the American Mosque\" appeared.\n\nThe overall number of mosques in the United States rose from 1,209 in 2000 to 2,106 in 2010, an increase of 74%.\n\nThe \"Ground Zero mosque\", a planned mosque in lower Manhattan, was the subject of controversy from 2010 on. In September 2011, a temporary Islamic center opened in renovated space at the site, and current plans are for a museum to be built, instead of a mosque.\n\nA 2011 study, \"The American Mosque 2011\", sponsored by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research (Hartford Seminary), the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, as well as the nation's largest Islamic civic and religious groups, including the Islamic Society of North America and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, found that the U.S. States with the most mosques were New York (257), California (246), and Texas (166).\n\nThrough 2014, a building boom for mosques has been going on.\n\nNumerous ones mentioned for their architecture:\n\nAn overview is provided.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925818", "title": "Litochoro", "text": "Litochoro\n\nLitochoro (, \"Litóchoro\"; Katharevousa: Λιτόχωρον) is a town and a former municipality in the southern part of the Pieria regional unit, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the Dio-Olympos municipality, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It is located at the base of Mount Olympus, on the western shore of the Thermaic Gulf. The first recorded mention of Litochoro is in an account of a visit by Saint Dionysius (Greek: Άγιος Διονύσιος) to Mount Olympus in the 16th century. The town is a popular destination for those wishing to climb Mount Olympus as almost all climbing routes begin to the southwest of the town. A famous son of the town was Christos Kakkalos, who ascended first Mount Olympos in 1913.\n\nLitochoro is located 22 km S of Katerini, 90 km SSW of Thessaloniki, 58 km N of Larissa and 420 km WNW of Athens, on the eastern slopes of Mount Olympus, of mythological fame as the home of the twelve gods of Olympus. Two important ancient sites are located in the neighbourhood of Litochoro. Dion with its large archaeological park and a museum is located about 8 km to the north. Leivithra with its acropolis and the Leivithra Park is about 9 km to the south. The municipal unit has an area of 169.632 km.\nPine, cedar and fir trees of the forests of Mount Olympus lie to the southwest and northwest. Much of the land around Litochoro, in particular to the South, remains uncultivated. Farmland is predominant to the North. Litochoro has several restaurants and cafeterias.\n\nLitochoro has schools, banks, a post office, a harbour, a sports centre, a town hall, a hospital, a museum, a concert hall, a gym, shopping facilities and squares. There are two main churches: Agios Nikolaos in the centre and Agios Dimitrios in the North. Litochoro has one of the most traditional cemeteries of Greece, known as \"Agios Athanasios\", in the north of the town.\n\nOlympus National Park Information Center\n\nImportant information is provided here for visitors of Mount Olympus National Park. The Information Center informs their visitors about the geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus.\n\nAlexandrion (Litochoro)\n\nLocated beside the highway (GR-1/E75), the Alexandreion is an impressive monument-building devoted to Alexander the Great. Visitors will get informed about his life and his military campaign.\n\nThe Nautical Museum\n\nAt Agios Nikolaou 15, on the first floor, resides the Nautical Museum of Litochoro. Rather unknown, the village has a long maritime history to tell. \n\nThe old Monastery Agios Dionysios \n\nAt an altitude of 850 m, beside the Enipeas gorge, Saint Dionysios built a monastery. Founded 1542, its name was Agia Triada, what means Holy Trinity, later changed to the name of the Saint. Plundered and burned several times in its history, it received the final blow from German troops in April 1943. \n\nThe new Monastery Agios Dionysios \n\nAfter the old monastery was destroyed, the monks moved to the Metochion three kilometers outside of the village and made the place their new monastery.\n\nAn extended coastal area known as Pláka or Pláka Litochorou (Πλάκα Λιτοχώρου) is located east of the town of Litochoro, spreading from the foot of Olympus to the Thermaic Gulf and extending from Leptokarya in the south to Gritsa in the north. The E75 highway passes through the area of Plaka to the south of Litochoro. The coast mainly consists of sandy beaches with seaside resorts as well as hotels, campsites, restaurants, and beach bars (which mostly operate during the summer season from June to September). In the area of Plaka there are private residences, luxurious villas, and cottages.\n\nNorth-east of Litochoro (North from Pláka) the coastal area continues, known by the name Gritsa or Limenas Litochorou extending from Pláka in the south to the community of Variko in the north. Sandy beaches can be also found here but the tourist facilities are much less than Pláka's. Yet here are some cottages and a luxury hotel (Dion resort). Gritsa is also the port of Litochoro, even though its capacity is restricted.\n\nSince the 1960s Litochoro has been served by an interchange with GR-1/E75 to its east. In the mid-1990s, parts of the Greek national road from Athens to Thessaloniki were upgraded to motorway standard. Litochoro is on the Northern stretch of this 6 lane dual carriageway, 90 km from Thessaloniki. Its nearest beach is 5 km to the east. <br>\nThere is a regular bus service to Katerini and a local train service (3 trains daily in each direction) to Thessaloniki and Larissa, where there is an interchange with the main line to Athens. Because Litochoro railway station is about 6 km away from Litochoro and 1 km from the nearest bus stop, people wishing to take the train often take the bus to Katerini and take the train from there. Taxis are to be found in abundance.\n\n\n"}

Also called \"Mother Maya,\" she is an international teacher of Ayurveda, a health activist and the founder of the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda and Mother Om Mission.\n\nMaya Tiwari was born in Guyana, the daughter of Brahmin priest Pandit Bhagawan Ramprasad Tiwari, whose family originated from Lucknow, India. Thereafter, she became a fashion designer in New York City at the age of 18. Her fashion and \"Maya\" boutique was a prominent store at 773 Madison Avenue, New York City where she served clientele like Jackie Onassis, Princess Diana, Nureyev, and Patti La Belle among other celebrities. Her designs were featured in stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel's, and Saks Fifth Avenue to Harrods in the UK.\n\nIn 1981, Maya established the Wise Earth School of Ayurveda, the first school for Ayurveda studies in North America, based in the knowledge of the Greater Vedas.\n\nOn Mother's Day in 1998, Tiwari founded the Mother Om Mission (MOM), a nonprofit organization that provides Ayurveda education and services to at-risk communities in New York's inner cities and Guyana.\n\nIn December 2009, Tiwari was a featured speaker at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nIn 2010 Maya Tiwari renounced her monastic title and spiritual honorific—Her Holiness, Sri Swami Mayatitananda—to, as she puts it, “walk a simpler and more accessible life in service of the populations in need.\" \n\nIn October 2016, Maya Tiwari was the opening guest on the radio show 'Unlock Your Health', where in she recorded a series of four interviews on her cancer healing journey. \n\nAmong the healing programs developed by Tiwari is The Peace Mandala, a program in where she leads hundreds of people worldwide in the creation of Peace Mandalas created from seeds and grains \"to help generate inner harmony by reconnecting to nature's seed memory of wellness and love.\" The purpose of The Peace Mandalas is \"to re-enliven humanity's memory of inner harmony and the awareness necessary to cooperate with and celebrate Mother Earth's profound gifts to humanity. Living Ahimsa brings awareness to the preservation of the seed-memory of nature, human sentiency and the integrity of Mother Earth.\" She appeared at Deepak Chopra's \"Seduction of Spirit\" meditation event in Toronto, Canada in August 2014 where she led the attendees through the creation of making a Peace Mandala.\n\nIn December 2009, at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Melbourne, Australia, Tiwari began The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour and has traveled to several countries leading people in taking an oath of ahimsa, which means non-harm or peace. (Mahatma Gandhi is a key world figure who promoted ahimsa as a vehicle for creating change.) The Living Ahimsa Peace Tour's aim is \"teaching the cultivation of harmony and nonviolence in thought, speech, and action, with the purpose of healing individuals and safeguarding Mother Earth and the world.\" Tiwari states, 'The world can't engender peace until we as individuals . . . discover the state of inner harmony within us.' As of September 2014, Maya Tiwari has been on The Living Ahimsa World Peace Tour for six years. 154,665 people have taken the oath. Hinduism Today writes, \"The Living Ahimsa Vrata mission makes the spirit of nonviolence a palpable reality for individuals [...] The vow can be taken in person or online. Central to the vow is a thirty-minute meditation twice a day. Aum is chanted 108 times, two times, followed by contemplation on key Hindu Vedic verses.\"\n\nTiwari's Inner Medicine Healing principle informs the curricula of Wise Earth Ayurveda education. Tiwari says that \"Inner Medicine Healing is based on the concept that each one of us has the ability to heal ourselves.\" A key part of her teachings is The Cosmic Memory Principle, which refers to achieving healing through the collective timeless memories of all species and life forms in the universe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "254847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254847", "title": "Mazu", "text": "Mazu\n\nMazu, also known by several other names and titles, is a Chinese sea goddess. She is the deified form of the purported historical Lin Mo or Lin Moniang, a Fujianese shamaness whose life span is traditionally dated from 960 to 987. Revered after her death as a tutelary deity of seafarers, including fishermen and sailors, her worship spread throughout China's coastal regions and overseas Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia. She was thought to roam the seas, protecting her believers through miraculous interventions. She is now generally regarded by her believers as a powerful and benevolent Queen of Heaven. Mazuism is popular in Taiwan; her temple festival is a major event in the region, with the largest celebrations around her temples at Dajia and Beigang.\n\nIn addition to Mazu or Ma-tsu, meaning \"Maternal Ancestor\" \"Mother\", \"Granny\", or \"Grandmother\", Lin Moniang is worshipped under various other names and titles:\n\n\nAlthough many of Mazu's temples honor her titles Tianhou and Tianfei, it became customary to never pray to her under those names during an emergency since it was believed that, hearing one of her formal titles, Mazu might feel obligated to groom and dress herself as properly befitting her station before receiving the petition. Prayers invoking her as Mazu were thought to be answered more quickly.\n\nVery little is known of the historical Lin Moniang. She was apparently a shamaness from a small fishing village on Meizhou Island, part of Fujian's Putian County, in the late 10th century. Her Meizhou was an uneducated and superstitious place, where out of \"perhaps a thousand households... not one person [could] read\". She probably did not live there, however, but on the nearby mainland. During this era, Fujian was greatly sinicized by influxes of refugees fleeing invasions of northern China and Mazu's cult may represent a hybridization of Chinese and local culture. The earliest record of her cult is from two centuries later, an 1150 inscription that mentions \"she could foretell a man's good and ill luck\" and, \"after her death, the people erected a temple for her on her home island\".\n\nThe legends around Lin Moniang's life were broadly established by the 13th century.\n\nShe was said to have been born under the reign of the Quanzhounese warlord Liu Congxiao (.962), which eventually developed into the specific date of the 23rd day of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar in 960, the first year of the Song. The late Ming \"Great Collection of the Three Teachings' Origin and Development and Research into the Divine\" (, \"Sānjiào Yuánliú Sōushén Dàquán\"), however, placed her birth much earlier, in 742.\n\nThe early sources speak of her as \"Miss Lin\"; her given name Mo (\"Silent One\") or Moniang (\"the Silent Girl\") appeared later. It was said to have been chosen when she did not cry during birth or during the first month afterwards; she remained a quiet and pensive child as late as four. She was said to have been the sixth or seventh daughter of Lin Yuan (). He is now usually remembered as one of the local fisherman, although the 1593 edition of the \"Records of Research into the Divine\" made him Putian's chief military inspector. The family was helpful and popular within their village. Late legends intended to justify Mazu's presence in Buddhist temples held that her parents had prayed to Guanyin for a son but received yet another daughter. In one version, her mother dreamt of Guanyin giving her a magical pill to induce pregnancy and woke to find the pill still in her hand; rather than being born in the conventional way, Mazu shot from her mother at birth in the form of a fragrant flash of red light. Guanyin was said to have been especially devoted to Mazu or even to have been incarnated as Mazu; for her part, Mazu was said to have been entranced by a statue of Guanyin at a temple she visited as a child, after which she became an ardent Buddhist. \n\nShe is now often said to have studied religious literature, mastering Confucius by 8 and the principal Buddhist sutras by 11. The \"Account of the Blessings Revealed by the Princess of Heaven\" \"Tiānfēi Xiǎnshèng Lù\") collected by her supposed descendants Lin Yaoyu \"Lín Yáoyú\"; ) and Lin Linchang \"Lín Línchàng\"; ) claimed that, while still a girl, she was visited by a Taoist master (elsewhere a Buddhist monk) named Xuantong \"Xuántōng\") who recognized her Buddha nature. By 13, she had mastered the book of lore he had left her \"Xuánwēi Bìfǎ\") and gained the abilities to see the future and visit places in spirit without travel. She was able to manifest herself at a distance as well and used this power to visit gardens in the surrounding countryside, although she asked owners' permission before gathering any flowers to take home. Although she only started swimming at the relatively late age of 15, she soon excelled at it. She was said to have stood on the shore in red garments to guide fishing boats home, regardless of harsh or dangerous weather. She met a Taoist immortal at a fountain at sixteen and received an amulet or two bronze tablets which she translated or used to exorcize demons, to heal the sick, and to avert disasters. She was also said to be a rainmaker during times of drought.\n\nMazu's principal legend concerns her saving one or some members of her family when they were caught offshore during a typhoon, usually when she was 16. It appears in several forms. In one, the women at home feared Lin Yuan and his son were lost but Mazu fell into a trance while weaving at her loom. Her spiritual power began to save the men from drowning but her mother roused her, causing her to drop her brother into the sea. The father returned and told the other villagers of the miracle; this version of the story is preserved in murals at Fengtin in Fujian. One variant is that her brothers were saved but her father was lost; she then spent three days and nights searching for his body before finding it. Another version is that all the men returned safely. Another is that Mazu was praying to Guanyin; another that she was sleeping and assisting her family through her dream. Still another is that the boats were crewed by her four brothers and that she saved three of them, securing their boats together, with the eldest lost owing to the interference of her parents, who mistook her trance for a seizure and woke her.\n\nIn earlier records, Mazu died unmarried at 27 or 28. (Her celibacy was sometimes ascribed to a vow she took after losing her brother at sea.) The date of her passing eventually became the specific date of the Double Ninth Festival in 987, making her 27 by western reckoning and 28 by traditional Chinese dating. She was said to have died in meditation, though in some accounts she did not die but climbed a mountain alone and ascended into Heaven as a goddess in a beam of bright light. In others, she died protesting an unwanted betrothal. Still another places her death at age 16, saying she drowned after exhausting herself in a failed attempt to find her lost father, underlining her filial piety. Her corpse then washed ashore on Nangan Island, which preserves a gravesite said to be hers.\n\nIn addition to the legends surrounding her earthly life, Mazu figures in a number of Chinese myths. \n\nIn one, the demons Qianliyan (\"Thousand-Mile Eye\") and Shunfeng'er (\"Wind-Following Ear\") both fell in love with her and she conceded that she would marry the one who defeated her in combat. Using her martial arts skills, however, she subdued them both and, after becoming friends, hired them as her guardian generals.\n\nIn a book of the Taoist Canon \"Tàishàng Lǎojūn Shuō Tiānfēi Jiùkǔ Língyàn Jīng\"), the Jade Woman of Marvelous Deeds is a star from the Big Dipper brought to earth by Laojun, the divine form of Laozi, to show his compassion for those who might be lost at sea. She is incarnated as Mazu and swears not only to protect sailors but to oversee all facets of life and death, providing help to anyone who might call upon her.\n\nMazuism is first attested in Huang Gongdu's poem \"On the Shrine of the Smooth Crossing\" \"Shùnjì Miào\"), which considered her a menial and misguided shamaness whose continued influence was inexplicable. He notes that her devotees danced and sang together and with their children. Shortly afterwards, Liao Pengfei ()'s 1150 inscription at the village of Ninghai (now Qiaodou Village) in Putian was more respectful. It states that, \"after her death, the people erected a temple for her on her home island\" and that the Temple of the Sacred Mound \"Shèngdūn Miào\") was raised in 1086 after some people in Ninghai saw it glowing, discovered a miraculous old raft or stump, and experienced a vision of \"the goddess of Meizhou\". This structure had been renamed the Smooth Crossing Temple by Emperor Huizong of Song in 1123 after his envoy Lu Yundi \"Lù Yǔndí\") was miraculously saved during a storm the year before while on an official mission to pay respects to the court of Goryeo upon the death of its king, Yejong, and to replace the Liao dynasty as the formal suzerains investing his successor, Injong.\n\nHer worship subsequently spread: Li Junfu's early-13th century \"Putian Bishi\" records temples on Meizhou and at Qiaodou, Jiangkou, and Baihu. By 1257, Liu Kezhuang was noting Putian's \"large market towns and small villages all have... shrines to the Princess\" and that they had spread to Fengting to the south. By the end of the Song, there were at least 31 temples to Mazu, reaching at least as far as Shanghai in the north and Guangzhou in the south.\nAs Mazuism spread, it began to absorb the cults of other local shamanesses such as the other two of Xianyou's \"Three Princesses\" and even some lesser maritime and agricultural gods, including Liu Mian and Zhang the Heavenly Instructor. By the 12th century, she had already become a guardian to the people of Qiaodou when they suffered drought, flood, epidemic, piracy, or brigandage. She protected women during childbirth and when they sought contraception. As the patron of the seas, her temples were among the first erected by arriving overseas Chinese, as they gave thanks for their safe passage. Despite his Islamic upbringing, the Ming admiral and explorer Zheng He credited Mazu for protecting one of his journeys, prompting a new title in 1409. He patronized the Mazu temples of Nanjing and prevailed upon the Yongle Emperor to construct the city's Tianfei Palace; because of its imperial patronage and prominent location in the empire's southern capital, this was long the largest and highest-status center of Mazuism in China. During the Southern Ming resistance to the Qing, Mazu was credited with helping Koxinga's army capture Taiwan from the Dutch; she was later said to have personally aided some of Shi Lang's men in defeating Liu Guoxuan at Penghu in 1683, ending the independent kingdom of Koxinga's descendants and placing Taiwan under Qing control. The Ming prince Zhu Shugui's palace was converted into Tainan's Grand Matsu Temple, the first to bear her new title of \"Heavenly Empress\".\n\nIn late imperial China, sailors often carried effigies of Mazu to ensure safe crossings. Some boats still carry small shrines on their bows. Mazu charms are also used as medicine, including as salves for blistered feet. As late as the 19th century, the Qing government officially credited her divine intervention with their 1884 victory over the French at Tamsui District during the Sino-French War and specially honored the town's temple to her, which had served as General Sun Kaihua's headquarters during the fighting.\nToday, Mazuism is practiced in about 1500 temples in 26 countries around the world, mostly in the Sinosphere or the overseas Chinese communities. Of these temples, almost 1000 are on Taiwan, representing a doubling of the 509 temples recorded in 1980 and more than a dozen times the number recorded before 1911. These temples are generally registered as Taoist, although some are considered Buddhist. There are more than 90 Mazu Temples in Hong Kong. In Mainland China, Mazuism is formally classified as a cult outside of Buddhism and Taoism, although numerous Buddhist and Taoist temples include shrines to her. Her worship is generally permitted but not encouraged, with most surviving temples concentrated around Putian in Fujian. Including the twenty on Meizhou Island, there are more than a hundred in the prefecture and another 70 elsewhere in the province, mostly in the settlements along its coast. There are more than 40 temples in Guangdong and Hainan and more than 30 in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but many historical temples are now treated as museums and operated by local parks or cultural agencies. The A-Ma Temple on Macao Island is the probable source of its name in Portuguese and English; the historic and protected Tin Hau Temple, Causeway Bay in Hong Kong is the source of the Tin Hau area's name from the Cantonese pronunciation of one of Mazu's titles, \"Empress of Heaven\". The Mazu temple in Melbourne is the largest Chinese temple in Australia.\n\nA major project to build the world's tallest Mazu statue at Tanjung Simpang Mengayau in Kudat, Borneo, was officially launched by Sabah. The statue was to be 10 stories high, but was canceled due to protests from Muslims in Sabah and political interference. In its absence, the world's tallest statue of the goddess is the Mazu of Tianjin that was erected in 2012.\n\nInformal centers of pilgrimage for Mazu's believers include Meizhou Island and the Zhenlan Temple in Taichung on Taiwan.\nThe primary temple festival in Mazuism is Lin Moniang's traditional birthday on the 23rd day of the 3rd month of the Chinese lunar calendar. It is celebrated widely in Taiwan, with the largest festivities around the 8-day, annual \"inspection tour\" of a Mazu idol from the Zhenlan Temple in Taichung to Chaotian Temple in Beigang and back again. The highlight is an incense-cutting ritual used to restore the fires of the Taichung temple. As many as 6,000 join the tour itself, some dressed as medieval standard-bearers and foot-soldiers, and more than 30,000 sometimes arrive for the idol's entry into Beigang. Another major festival is that around the Tianhou Temple in Lukang. Depending on the year, Mazu's festival day may fall as early as mid-April or as late as mid-May:\n\n\nThe anniversary of her death or supposed ascension into Heaven is also celebrated, usually on the Double Ninth Festival (the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar).\n\nAfter her death, Mazu was remembered as a young lady who wore a red dress as she roamed over the seas. In religious statuary, she is usually clothed in the attire of an empress, and decorated with accessories such as a ceremonial \"hu\" tablet and a flat-topped imperial cap (\"mian'guan\") with rows of beads (\"liu\") hanging from the front and back. Her temples are usually protected by the door gods Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er. These vary in appearance but are frequently demons, Qianliyan red with two horns and two yellow sapphire eyes and Shunfeng'er green with one horn and two ruby eyes.\n\n\"Lin Moniang\" (2000), a minor Fujianese TV series, was a dramatization of Mazu's life as a mortal. \"Mazu\" 2007) was a Taiwanese animated feature film from the Chinese Cartoon Production Co. depicting her life as a shamaness and goddess. Its production director Teng Chiao admitted the limited appeal to the domestic market: \"If young people were our primary target audience, we wouldn't tell the story of Mazu in the first place since they are not necessarily interested in the ancient legend[;] neither do they have loyalty to made-in-Taiwan productions\". Instead, \"when you look to global markets, the question that foreign buyers always ask is what can best represent Taiwan\". \"Mazu\", with its story about \"a magic girl and two cute sidekicks [Mazu's door gods Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er] spiced up with a strong local flavor\" was instead designed with an intent to appeal to international markets interested in Taiwan.\n\n\n\n"}

The tradition includes a selection of received myths concerning the origin and organization of the universe. Their belief system may be described as a polytheistic religion containing a very strong element of spirituality based on an epistemology of mysticism.\n\nBachué (\"the Grandmother\") is a non-material principle of creation, the will, the thought and the imagination of all the things to come. She is a similar concept to the principle of \"tao\" in the Chinese mythology.\n\nThe time of \"unquyquie nxie\" (\"the first thought\") is the time of the cosmic origin, when the thoughts of Bachué became actions. This is the time when Bachué created the builders of the universe and ordered them to create.\n\nThe world started with \"Chimi\" (\"the pulp\"), the first material object in the world. Then, in the inners of \"tomsa\", were incubated the embryos of stars, embryos of land and embryos of stone. When \"tomsa\" was full, the seeds of the earth emerged and the remains were thrown away, forming the Milky Way.\n\nThe elements were distributed to the deities: the heat to Sué – the sun, the cold to Chía – the Moon, and the clouds and smoke to the Earth, but all the things were still seeds and nothing was germinated. Then, \"Mnya\", gold, energy, was united with \"Chimi\", the pulp, and became \"Chímini\", the creative force, which caused the germination of the seeds of all things.\n\nAccording to Muisca legends, mankind was originated in Lake Iguaque, when mother goddess Bachué came out from the lake with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, they populated the earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. finally, they disappeared unto the lake in the shape of snakes.\n\nDue to transgressions against the divine laws, Chibchacum brought forth a flood that covered the world and nearly destroyed the human race. Then, the protective god Bochica drove away the waters through the Tequendama Falls, and taught humans the basis of civilization, agriculture, religion, the arts, and crafts. When he was about to leave to his heavenly kingdom, Cuchavira (the rainbow) appeared and Bochica announced his second coming, far away in the future, in an event marked by death and disease. These events are similar to the biblical histories of Genesis and Apocalypse.\n\nThe first gods, constructors of the universe, built the first \"cuca\" or ceremonial temple. They were:\n\nThe gods danced a very long dance (\"sas quyhynuca\"), with the music of the \"fo\" drum, in the first ceremony. This ceremony gave origin to space and time.\n\nThen, the gods created the first materials of the universe: \"fiva\" (the air), \"faova\" (the cosmic cloud) and \"ie\" (the smoke). Then, they created the six directions of the material dimension, and in the middle of \"itugue\", the emptiness, they created the centre of power \"tomsa\" (bellybutton of the universe). But, still the universe had no consistence, and they waited many \"bxogonoas\" aeons until the \"sas bequia\", the beginning of the world.\n\n"}

In pre-Islamic times the term was used in the literal sense of the root \"l-ḥ-d\": \"incline, deviate\". Its religious meaning is based on the Quranic verses 7:180, 22:25, and 41:40. Under the Umayyad caliphate it denoted desertion of the ummah and rebellion against legitimate caliphs. Early in the Abbasid era rationalistic theologians began using it in the sense of \"heretic\", and it eventually came to refer to rejection of religion as such, to materialistic scepticism and atheism. In Ottoman usage the term was commonly used in reference to Shia and certain Sufi doctrines that were considered to be subversive.\n\n"}
{"id": "4608529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4608529", "title": "Naga the Serpent", "text": "Naga the Serpent\n\nThe character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of \"Slayers\", Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has numerous character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike.\n\nNaga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series \"Slayers Evolution-R\", Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.\n\nNaga's real full name is Gracia Ul Naga Saillune, making her the first daughter of the kingdom of Saillune's crown prince Philionel El Di Saillune and the older sister of Amelia Wil Tesla Saillune. She has one living uncle, Christopher Wil Brogg Seyruun, one deceased uncle, Randy Saillune, and a deceased cousin, Alfred Seyruun. Her grandfather, Eldoran Saillune, is the king of Saillune, although Philionel acts as a proxy ruler. Naga's mother was murdered several years earlier by the famous assassin Booley. The teenage (16 or 17 years old at the time) Naga immediately took revenge and killed him with the crown princess' original spell, Chaos String. After the funeral, the traumatized Naga found the outfit she currently wears inside her mother's closet, and shortly after this, she left home to learn the ways of the world and gain more magic powers. Naga still keeps in touch with her homeland and occasionally she is sent living expenses money through a messenger. All this was disclosed only in interviews with the \"Slayers\" creator Hajime Kanzaka, but was hinted in Naga's \"White Serpent\" nickname (a white serpent being the coat of arms of Saillune). In \"Slayers NEXT\", Zelgadis states that Seyruun has a \"runaway princess,\" also implied to be Naga.\n\nNaga has originally planned to simply challenge to a duel and defeat the famous teenage sorceress Lina Inverse to inherit her supposed title of the \"Invincible Dark Lord\" (which Naga apparently invented herself). However, as the story progressed, her obsession with Lina has quickly became more complicated and in some ways even more irrational. Naga becomes associate with Lina, is traveling with her supposed archrival and aiding her in battle, yet also often turning against her whenever someone offers Naga enough gain from it. From her side, the cynical and neurotic Lina is often abusive towards Naga and in total disregard of her safety even when they work together (such as repeatedly blowing her away with explosive spells or using her as bait for the enemy), but Naga almost never gets seriously hurt and usually just laughs it off, rarely seen as a serious enemy even when they are fighting. On the other hand, both Naga and Lina also directly saved each other's lives on a number of occasions.\n\nThe novels describe Naga as a remarkably beautiful young woman of about 20 years with a distinguished appearance, long hair (either dark-blue, violet or raven black), and intelligent blue eyes. Tall and well endowed, Naga is in a striking contrast to the diminutive Lina and takes pride in being physically intimidating, preferring a menacing and revealing black leather outfit, which is as a keepsake from her mother but Naga also personally enjoys to wear it (though the exaggerated size of her spiked spaulders is so unpractical that Naga may painfully jab them in her own face when spellcasting). Naga's introduction in the novels describe it as an old-time 'evil sorceress' fashion style that, according to Lina, used to be popular centuries earlier. Her large sword is just a prop that she carries around purely for a show and can be only used defensively for blocking due to Naga's hemophobia after witnessing the killing of her mother; in effect, she has a severe aversion to the sight of blood which can cause her to faint. To her dismay, Naga, who believes herself to be Lina's \"greatest and strongest rival,\" is often referred to as Lina's sidekick or \"that other girl.\" The usually dismissive Lina likes to compare Naga's irritating habit of following her around is akin to goldfish's trailing feces (in the words of Lina: \"She might be a useless ally, but having her as an enemy can sure be amusing\"). However, Naga also often makes her very annoyed (even to the point of rage), especially when Naga makes fun of her small breasts, playing on Lina's physical inferiority complex and her envy of Naga's bust size.\n\nShe has an outrageously loud boisterous 'noblewoman' (\"ojousama\") laugh (which Kanzaka said is similar to the laughter of Naga's mother) that most people in the \"Slayers\" world find unbearably obnoxious (to the point of rendering them physically powerless). Being a princess, Naga does not flaunt the fact that she is royalty (her heritage is never mentioned in any series and has only been acknowledged in interviews and supplemental materials), but the way she acts makes it quite apparent: when she stands before other members of royalty, she speaks to them as equals, while Lina will bow her head and speak only when spoken to. Many of her self-confident and 'dramatic' poses and speeches are strikingly similar to those of Amelia or Martina, another \"Slayers\" princess. Naga's inflated ego, her carefreeness and vanity, recurrent appetite for good food, considerable greed for money and magical treasure, frequent and excessive drinking of alcohol, and often-displayed overconfidence along with her notable lack of common sense mean she often gets herself, and Lina, into trouble.\n\nDespite Lina's mockery of Naga's magical skills, she is an exceptionally talented sorceress, and may, in fact, be Lina's greatest rival. She is well versed in black magic and capable of casting healing spells and golem-forming and dragon-conjuring spells. She is especially proficient at white magic, though she only uses it when absolutely necessary, and also specializes in shamanistic magic, in particular spells of earth and water variety. She enjoys creating golems (even if they usually do not turn out very well and sometimes go berserk and turn against her), has developed several of her own spells (including Bogardic Elm, Freeze Rain, Gu Ru Dooga, Mega Vu Vraimer, Void Breath and Vu Raywa), and her most common spells to use are water/ice-based (such as Freeze Arrow) in contrast to Lina who uses fire-related ones. Naga knows and can use the ultimate shamanistic and white magic spells (Ra Tilt and Resurrection), is able to stop living-dead powered via necromancy with a powerful Flow Break spell, and has learnt Levitation by just observing its use by Lina. According to Kanzaka, Naga and Lina are the mightiest human magic users in the world of \"Slayers\" and Naga actually has a larger potential magical capacity, while Lina knows the ultimate black magic spells (notably the devastating Dragon Slave).\n\nShe also has a strange ability to control jellyfish, and is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat, as well as talented at art and cooking. Her swordsmanship is often the subject of question, as she carries around a large sword yet never uses it. Naga's uncanny potential to survive any peril practically unscathed was at first very surprising to Lina, who has actually left her for dead on a few occasions, before she got used to it and began to take it for granted.\n\nNaga has first appeared in the 1991-2008 \"Slayers Special\" series of light novels, which was later (from volume 30 onward) re-titled as \"Slayers Smash\" (an ongoing series since 2008). Like in the case of other \"Slayers\" novels, most of the \"Special\" series stories were first published in \"Dragon Magazine\". Some of them were first collected in the \"Slayers Delicious\" series and some are subtitled as \"Slayers Excellent\" or \"Slayers Superior\"; some were also later re-published in the series \"Slayers Select\". The \"Special\" series, which axis are the joint adventures of Lina and Naga, serves as a prequel to the main series (starting about three years prior to the first meeting of Lina and Gourry Gabriev) and is less serious in its content. Naga is the main protagonist of \"Slayers Special 3: Nāga no Bouken\" (\"Adventures of Naga\") and is the titular subject of the 2012 bonus book \"Slayers Addition: Nāga Ijin-den\" (\"Legend of Naga the Great\"). An exclusive side-story of Lina and Naga, \"Slayers Gaiden\", was published in the issue #200 of \"Dragon Magazine\" in 2002.\n\nHajime Kanzaka was originally going to make Naga appear in \"The Battle of Saillune\" (volume 4 of the main novel series) but had a trouble to implement this idea properly. This led him to create the character of Amelia. Kanzaka said Naga would not appear in the main series due to Amelia being there, but the two actually meet in \"Slayers VS Orphen\", a novel and CD drama crossover of \"Slayers\" and \"Sorcerous Stabber Orphen\", where the masked Naga appears incognito and keeps her identity secret to Amelia.\n\nNaga also appears in the first volume of Kadokawa Shoten Tsubasa-published alternative series of \"Slayers\" children's novels written by Nambo Hidehisa, where her outfit was redesigned to be a less skimpy (wearing a miniskirt instead of a thong) by the artist Yuji Himukai. When they first meet, Lina mistakes Naga for Gourry's mother due to their similar looks and guesses she is \"about 40 years old.\"\n\nThe 2006 audio drama \"Slayers Kita Kaette EX #4: Kita kaette Naga!?\" provides a closure to the entire \"Slayers\" saga, with the retired Lina and Naga, now elderly in their eighties (with almost all other characters already dead) and vacationing together. After Lina revives the choking Naga (who meets her mother in a near-death experience), the two recall their past but their versions do not match, leading Lina to challenge Naga to a final fight as to decide who is right. The battle ends in both of them trying to cast top-level black magic spells (Naga's Dynast Brass and Lina's Dragu Slave) but breaking their own hips in the process.\n\nNaga is co-protagonist of the first four \"Slayers\" films from the late 1990s: \"\" (\"Slayers Perfect\"), \"Slayers Return\" (and its manga adaptation), \"Slayers Great\", and \"Slayers Gorgeous\" (the scripts for \"Return\", \"Great\" and \"Gorgeous\" were also published in the book \"Slayers Original\"). She has the same role in all episodes of both of the \"Slayers\" OVA series, \"Slayers Special\", and Naga-centered \"Slayers Excellent\" (the latter of which takes place before the events of the first \"Slayers\" film, 1995's \"Slayers Perfect\", and in fact details Naga's initial meeting with Lina). A typical plot of a Lina and Naga anime story features them as mercenary companions-opponents (that relationship being very fluid) meeting strangers who hire them against each other for their own purposes.\n\nNaga's frequent role in the anime is that of a comedic foil to Lina. According to Helen McCarthy, while the \"Slayers\" TV series has \"remained essentially asexual,\" it was \"the absence of TV restrictions\" that allowed to \"retain Naga from the [light novel] stories.\" Naga's Japanese voice actress Maria Kawamura said she had trouble breathing after recording sessions of Naga's laugh for the \"Slayers Special\" episode \"The Scary Chimera Plan\", which featured Naga's ten clones all laughing at once. Kawamura also provided an audio commentary for all the movies and OVAs in the 2015 Blu-ray release.\n\nIn the manga, Naga appears through the early 2000s series \"Slayers Special\". Some of the chapters are based on the novels and the OVA series and some are original stories. As described by Jason Thompson, \"the two bickering heroines go on dungeon crawls, work as maids and waitresses, search for 'bosom growth potions,' and fight the occasional bad guy.\"\n\nNaga makes only a cameo appearances in the 2001 film, manga and CD drama \"Slayers Premium\" (as is the tradition with all of the anime movies and series published thus far, Naga does not actually meet or interact with any of the main characters other than Lina & Amelia) and in the 2008 manga \"The Hourglass of Falces\". She also makes a possible cameo in the first season of the \"Slayers\" TV series (episode 17) and appears as Nama in the first six episodes of the fifth TV season, \"Slayers Evolution-R\".\n\nNaga appears as a supporting player character through the entire official series of the \"Slayers\" role-playing video games from the 1990s: \"Slayers\" for the PC98, \"Slayers\" for the Super Famicon (SNES, in a dual role including as a boss during the first encounter), \"Slayers Royal\", \"Slayers Royal 2\", and \"Slayers Wonderful\", at times interacting with some members of the main story party (often with Gourry). She and Lina are also featured as player characters in the 2008 game \"Magical Battle Arena\". In 2016, Naga, Lina and Gourry were announced to join the cast of \"Granblue Fantasy\".\n\nThe first setting book published for the Japanese tabletop role-playing game \"MAGIUS RPG\" was \"Slayers RPG: Together with Naga\" (スレイヤーズRPG―ナーガ様といっしょ) focused on Naga and her antics. In this fast-paced, gag-based comedic game released by Fujimi Shobo in 1995, the game master-controlled Naga has her own party of player characters; it later saw a release of the collection of illustrated transcripts of play sessions. She is also featured in several cards in the collectible card game \"Slayers Fight\".\n\nKawamura's image songs for Naga were included in several \"Slayers\" soundtracks. Naga-themed single CD (KIDA-109) was released by King Records in 1995.\n\nA plushie of Naga was made by Banpresto in 1995, a PVC figure was released by MegaHouse in 2003, another pre-painted figure was released by Kadokawa as a tie-in for \"Return\", and a small keychain figure of Naga was made by Toei in 1997. A 1/6 scale garage kit Naga figure sculpted by Kitahara Kousuke was released by Volks in 2012; a tiny figure called \"Naga's golem\" was also sold by Volks separately in a limited offer and is now available together with the main statuette. A Nenodroid figure was released in 2018.\n\nNaga makes an extended cameo appearance in the 2009 \"Slayers\" TV series \"Slayers Evolution-R\" as an animated suit of armor calling herself Nama, who bears a striking resemblance to Naga in both mannerisms (including her laugh) and spellcasting preferences. Nama was a treasure hunter (of whom only a Naga-like shadow was shown) who has lost a majority of her memories when her soul got enchanted into the living armor. While it is never directly shown or confirmed to the audience or the characters that she is Naga, Nama is perfectly able to perform the Pacifist Crush move along with Amelia, something only a daughter of Prince Phil would know how to do, and Xellos makes a comment that the name Nama is very close to her actual name, implying that he knows her true identity. During the course of the series, Xellos makes Nama's spirit return to her original body by destroying the urn that has caused the curse.\n\n\nNaga the Serpent was originally planned to be featured only in one \"Slayers\" story (\"Naga's Challenge\"), but a very positive response from readers turned her into the franchise's major recurring character. In 2000, she won the \"Best of \"Dragon Magazine\"\" popular vote in two categories, including first place for the best supporting role in the magazine's history. Writing in 1999, Dave Halverson called Lina and Naga \"two of anime [medium]'s brightest stars in both Japan and the U.S.\" as well as \"perhaps the best character designs in the anime universe.\"\n\nBoth Maria Kawamura's original Japanese voice of Naga and the English dubbing by Kelly Manison were both acclaimed by anime critics, with Halverson calling Manison and Cynthia Martinez (as Lina) the best voice acting duo he has heard in 1998. Kawamura's portrayal of Naga, including her notorious cackling laughter, is considered her most famous role.\n\nNaga was described as \"walking fanservice\" by Citlin Donovan from The Mary Sue and as \"a definite favourite for almost all of male part of the audience\" by Polish magazine \"Kawaii\". Helen McCarthy wrote in 2006, \"Naga and her breasts have become three very popular characters in the series, and long-term fans of the series wait eagerly to see how the writers can explain not only her disappearance between the end of \"Special\" and the beginning of the original series, but also why she is never even mentioned after the events of the videos.\" In 2006, Chris Beveridge of Mania.com listed the absence of Naga in the \"Slayers\" TV series as one of the ten reason it \"will always suck,\" stating that \"besides her wonderful costume that brings about a lot of great eye-candy when it comes to cosplayers, she typified the kind of 'anime laugh' that only a precious few have. She was also the perfect foil when it came to dealing with Lina, something that the TV series never had.\" Crunchyroll's Nate Ming noted Naga for her \"incredibly dominant, overbearing presence,\" and Krzysztof Wojdyło of Polish magazine \"Otaku\" placed her first of his 2012 ranking of top ten buxom characters in all manga and anime, noting that how despite her \"rather dark past hidden under her constant smile and somewhat psychotic behavior,\" she has still remained \"probably the most fun and memorable character\" on that list. That same year, Anime News Network's Lynzee Loveridge also included Naga's outfit among the most impractical fighting regalia for her spaulders. In 2013, Wirtualna Polska ranked Naga's bust as the ninth most beautiful pair of breasts in pop culture.\n\nThe 2001 first edition cover of American role-playing game \"Ironclaw\" shows Lina and Naga cameo role. The protagonists of the 2002 anime miniseries \"Cosplay Complex\", Chako and Reika, dress up as Naga and Lina respectively in the third episode. Lina and Naga also made a cameo appearance in French comic book series \"Les Légendaires Origines\" in 2014.\n"}

All the villagers are strong supporters of Shree Krishna Pranami Sampradaya and are vegetarians. The local authority prohibits smoking, gambling and drinking. \n\nThe village was named Najarpur because this place was selected for settlements by most of the groups who migrated to Terai during 1950s. 'Najar' is a Nepali word meaning 'look' and 'pur' means 'place' in Nepali. Able to gain attention of many migrants for settlement who looked for new places to settle, this place was named 'Najarpur'.\n\nThe Najarpur mandir (also known as Pukhraj Dham, Sundar Dham and Pranami Mandir Najarpur) is an important place of pilgrimage for Shree Krishna Pranami Sampradaya. It was built by new settlers who migrated to Najarpur during 1950s. Over time, many reforms took place. By local standards, the temple has a magnificent structure. \n\nThe temple's structure is adjacent to \"Pukhraj Parbat\" -one of the peaks in \"Paramdham\" as described in the holy book \"Shree Tartam Sagar\" of Nijananda sampradaya. The design was suggested and implemented by Pandit Shree Hem Prasad Dahal- a resident of the village and popular teacher of Nijananda sampradaya around Nepal.\n\nShree Krishna Pranami Community Primary School was established under the Najarpur mandir in 1999.

Bacon's alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However others, including Daphne du Maurier (in her biography of Bacon), have argued there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Historian Dame Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's \"The New Atlantis\" portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.\n\nIn 1618 Francis Bacon decided to secure a lease for York House. This had been his boyhood home in London next to the Queen's York Place before the Bacon family had moved to Gorhambury in the countryside. After Lord Egerton (Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England) died, it became available for Bacon to lease. During the next four years this mansion on the Strand (so large that it had 40 fireplaces) served as the home for Francis and Alice Bacon. Over the next four years Bacon would host banquets at York House that were attended by the leading men of the time, including poets, scholars, authors, scientists, lawyers, diplomats, and foreign dignitaries. Within the banquet hall, Francis gathered the greatest leaders in literature, art, law, education, and social reform. On 22 January 1621 in honour of Sir Francis Bacon's sixtieth birthday, a select group of men assembled in the large banquet hall in York House without fanfare for what has been described as a Masonic banquet. This banquet was to pay tribute to Sir Francis Bacon. Only those of the Rosicrosse (Rosicrucians) and the Masons who were already aware of Bacon's leadership role were invited. The tables were T-tables with gleaming white drapery, silver, and decorations of flowers. The poet Ben Jonson, a long-time friend of Bacon, gave a Masonic ode to Bacon that day. \n\nThere was a depth of love by a large body of men toward Bacon, similar to some degree in the manner that disciples love a Master. This is especially true when taking into account his membership (and some say leadership) of secret societies such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. In the inner esoteric membership, which included Francis Bacon, vows of celibacy for spiritual reasons were encouraged.\n\nVarious authors have written that there were indications that Francis Bacon had gone into debt while secretly funding the publishing of materials for the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, \"Spear-Shakers\", \"Knights of the Helmet\", as well as publishing, with the assistance of Ben Jonson, a selection of the plays that they believe he had written under the pen name of \"Shake-Speare\" in a \"First Folio\" in 1623. Furthermore, they allege that Bacon faked his own death, crossed the English Channel, and secretly traveled in disguise after 1626 through France, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and other areas utilizing the secret network of Freemasons and Rosicrucians that he was associated with. It is alleged that he continued to write under pseudonyms, as he had done before 1626, continuing to write as late as 1670 (using the pseudonym \"Comte De Gabalis\"). Elinor Von Le Coq, wife of Professor Von Le Coq in Berlin, stated that she had found evidence in the German Archives that Francis Bacon stayed after 1626 with the family of Johannes Valentinus Andreae in Germany.\n\nBasil Montagu, a biographer of Bacon, states in his \"Essays and Selections\":\n\nOf his funeral no account can be found, nor is there any trace of the scite of the house where he died. \n\nBeginning early in the 20th century in the United States, a number of Ascended Master Teachings organizations began making the claim that Francis Bacon had never died. They believed that soon after completing the \"Shake-Speare\" plays, he had feigned his own death on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1626 - doing so in Easter Sunday as a symbolism - and then traveled extensively outside England, eventually attaining his physical Ascension to another plane on May 1, 1684 in a castle in Transylvania owned by the Rakoczi family. Their belief is that Bacon took on the name \"Saint Germain\" on that date, May 1, 1684, and became an Ascended Master.\n"}

It was registered in the Supreme Electoral Court in the summer of 2012. The President of the party is the former State Deputy of São Paulo Adilson Barroso, who before creating PEN was a member of the Social Christian Party. The party's TSE (Supreme Electoral Court) Identification Number is 51.\n\nIts platform involves support for conservative policies, a strong national policy of defense, zero tolerance politics regarding violence and crime, support for the Brazilian agrarian sector, the rejection of social and indigenous movements like MST, as well as an anti-communist stance.\nIt is against corruption, and seeks to uphold traditional values based on Christian ethics. The party has links with the Assemblies of God, the largest evangelical denomination in Brazil.\n\nThe party was originally founded as National Ecologic Party (PEN) in 2011. The party was a center-right environmentalist party, originally meant to attract environmentalist politician Marina Silva in case her party didn't get the authorization to take part in the 2014 Brazilian general election. But this proposal failed and the party obtained a small quantity of votes in the 2014 elections, while endorsing then presidential candidate Aécio Neves.\n\nIn 2017, the PEN changed when Jair Bolsonaro announced he would enter the party, in a bid to run for President in the 2018 Brazilian general election. PEN changed its name to Patriota (PATRI) and abandoned its former environmentalist ideals to become a right-wing conservative party pursuing a right-wing populist agenda, influenced by Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit. Patriota has renounced its green and pro-ecologist policies in favor of its conservative and nationalist policies; it has maintained and strengthened its religious opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and other socially progressive policies.\nThe acronym PEN was also seen as an abbreviation of Pentecostalism, the evangelical current of PEN founders, than a coherent ideological current. Since the refoundation as Patriota, the party are making more efforts to appeal for a broader Christian electorate, like socially conservative Catholics and traditional Protestants like baptists and presbyterians, instead to be a mere political arm of a single church. Not only the acronym was changed, but the ideology was changed too, due to the fact that Bolsonaro sees environmentalists as part of a \"conspiracy against Brazil\" while his sons Eduardo Bolsonaro and Flávio Bolsonaro are global warming deniers. These two reasons forced the party to change its name and ideology.\n\nAfter an internal conflict, in January 2018 Jair Bolsonaro gave up on joining Patriota and chose to join the Social Liberal Party. Nevertheless, the party maintained the proposal of change of name and statute and the party have spoken in the possibility of two other members of the party applying for the candidacy to the presidency of the republic, these include Adilson Barroso himself and the plastic surgeon Dr. Roberto M. Rey Jr., affiliated to the party since 2014.\n\nIn 2018, Patriota launched former firefighter and evangelical pastor Cabo Daciolo as their presidential nominee, without partnering any political party. Daciolo is known for his controversial political views, which include turning Brazil into a Christian theocracy.\n\nDue to most members and militants of Patriota being from different Christian branches and racial backgrounds, the party condemns racism and promotes Christian ecumenism, despite this, the party opposes integration with non-Christians, mainly atheists and Muslims.\nThe party follows a deep conservative and fundamentalist orientation, being against secularism, abortion, same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption and pro-gender identity policies while referring to it as \"gender ideology\". But ever since, the party has adopted more controversial stances, including turning Brazil into a theocratic state and replacing the secular 1988 constitution for a religious-oriented one.\n\nThe party has ambiguous economic policies. While embracing economic liberalism, the party opposes foreign interference, mainly by Chinese companies, in the Brazilian economy.\nThe party supports the privatization of most Brazilian state-owned companies, but also promotes more Brazilian government interference in some sectors, like the mining sector, and opposes the privatization of Petrobras. The party's economic policy can be seen as supporting a mixed economy.\n\nPatriota supports a hard approach against crime and drug trafficking, supporting the lowering of the minimum penal age and favoring life imprisonment and capital punishment.\nThe party also supports liberal gun policies, favoring the open carry of weapons and favors large investments on the Brazilian Armed Forces.\n\n"}

The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice. Rodney Stark has defined it as \"(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture\", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably \"The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success \" and \"The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force\". Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital. Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an Episcopalian is more likely to become Catholic than Seventh-day Adventist or Lutheran. More recent work is inclined to define the concept in terms of Bourdieu's conception of 'capital' in relation to a particular (religious) field.\n"}

The diocese comprises the Department of Haute-Garonne. Its see is Toulouse Cathedral, in the city of Toulouse, and the current archbishop is Robert Jean Louis Le Gall, appointed in 2006 and translated from the Diocese of Mende.\n\nThe Archdiocese has 7 suffragan dioceses and archdioceses: Archdiocese of Albi, Archdiocese of Auch, Diocese of Cahors, Diocese of Montauban, Diocese of Pamiers, Diocese of Rodez, Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes.\n\nAs re-established by the Concordat of 1802, it included the departments of Haute-Garonne and Ariège, at which time, the archbishop joined to his own the title of Auch, jurisdiction over Auch being given to the Diocese of Agen, also the title of Narbonne, an archdiocese over which jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the Diocese of Carcassonne, and the title of Albi, over which, though formerly an archdiocese, jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the See of Montpellier. In consequence of the creation of the Archdiocese of Auch and Archdiocese of Albi under the Restoration, the Archbishop of Toulouse only styled himself Archbishop of Toulouse and Narbonne, and when the Diocese of Pamiers was created the limits of the Archdiocese were restricted to the Department of Haute-Garonne. As thus marked off by the Bull \"Paternae Caritatis\", July, 1822, the Archdiocese of Toulouse includes almost the whole of the ancient Diocese of Toulouse, Diocese of Rieux, and Diocese of Comminges, and a few small portions of the ancient Diocese of Montauban, Diocese of Lavaur, Diocese of St-Papoul, Diocese of Mirepoix, and Diocese of Lombez.\n\nToulouse, chief town of the Tectosagi, at the end of the second century B.C. tried to shake off the yoke of Rome during the invasion of the Cimbri, but at the beginning of the empire it was a prosperous Roman civitas with famous schools in which the three brothers of the Emperor Constantine were pupils. In the fourth century it was reckoned the fifteenth town in importance in the empire.\n\nIn 413 it was taken by Astulph, the Goth, and in 419 under Wallia it became the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom. In 508 after conquest by Clovis it became Frankish. Legends of more or less recent date claim that it was evangelized by St. Martial, but as far as historical evidence goes the see seems to have been founded by St. Saturninus (Sernin) in the middle of the third century. The \"Passio Sancti Saturnini\" corroborates this date as that of his incumbency and martyrdom. Subsequent tradition claims that he was a disciple of St. Peter. St. Papoul was his companion and like him a martyr.\n\nSt. Honoratus, given in some lists as St. Saturninus's successor, is recognised as a pre-Schism Western saint by the Orthodox Church and it is therefore wrong to suggest that he seems just to have crept in through error from the fabulous legend of St. Firminus of Amiens.\n\nAmong the bishops of Toulouse may be mentioned: Rhodanius (350-58), exiled by Constantius to Phrygia because of his efforts against Arianism at the Council of Béziers in 356; St. Hilary, whom some historians place before Rhodanius, but who is placed after him by Duchesne; St. Sylvius (360-400); St. Exuperius (c. 400), who drove from his diocese in 405 the heretic Vigilantius, saved Toulouse from the Vandals, and was the friend of St. Jerome; St. Germerius (Germier), whose episcopate (c. 541) is questioned by Duchesne; Magnulphus (c. 585), exiled by King Gundoald; (657), a monk of Fontenelle who returned to his monastery to die.\n\nFrom being the capital of the Duchy of Aquitaine, from 631, Toulouse became in 778 the capital of the County of Toulouse created by Charlemagne, and which in the tenth century was one of the main fiefs of the crown. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, known as Raymond de Saint Gilles (1042–1105), was one of the leaders of the First Crusade.\n\nRaymond VI and Raymond VII, Counts of Toulouse, had leanings towards the Cathars. Simon of Montfort in 1218 died under the walls of Toulouse, At this time Toulouse had as bishop Fulk of Marseilles (1206–1231), who fought against Raymond VI and protected the Friars-Preachers in their early days. The marriage (1249) of Jeanne, daughter of Raymond VII, with Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of Louis IX of France, led to the uniting in 1271 of the County of Toulouse to the Crown of France, and Toulouse became the capital of the Province of Languedoc.\n\nThe See of Toulouse was for a time made famous by St. Louis (1296–97), son of Charles II, King of Naples and the Two Sicilies, and of Mary, daughter of the King of Hungary: he was nephew of St. Elizabeth of Hungary and grand-nephew of St. Louis, King of France. Louis had resigned to his brother Robert all rights over the Kingdom of Naples, and had accepted from Pope Boniface VIII the See of Toulouse after becoming a Franciscan friar. His successor was Peter de la Chapelle Taillefer (1298–1312) who was created cardinal in 1305.\n\nTo this epoch belongs a change that took place in the history of the Diocese of Toulouse. It decreased in size but increased in dignity. Before 1295 the Diocese of Toulouse was very extensive. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Bishop Fulk had wished to divide it into several dioceses. In 1295 a portion of territory was cut off by Boniface VIII to form the Diocese of Pamiers. Then in 1319 John XXII cut off the Diocese of Toulouse from the metropolitan church of Narbonne and made it a metropolitan with the Sees of Montauban, Saint-Papoul, Rieux, and Lombez as suffragans; a little later Lavaur and Mirepoix also became suffragans of Toulouse. The majority of these sees were composed of territory cut off from the ancient See of Toulouse itself. According to Pope John XXII, not only was the diocese too large and too populated for a single bishop to carry out all of his necessary functions, but also it was immensely rich and did not spend its wealth for the growth of the faith, but on luxuries and disspation of every sort.\n\nPope John XXII offered the See of Riez in Provence to Gaillard de Preyssac, Bishop of Toulouse since 1305, whom he suspected of having conspired against him with Hugues Giraud, Bishop of Cahors. Gaillard refused the offer, and retired to Avignon where he died in 1327.\n\nThe first archbishop was Raymond de Comminges, Bishop of Maguelonne from 1309, who, when created cardinal in 1327, resigned the See of Toulouse in order to take up his duties at the Papal Curia in Avignon, where he died in 1348. He left a book on the \"Passion of the Saviour\", and some \"Sermons for Festival Days\". Among his successors were: the Dominican William de Laudun (1327–1345), previously bishop of Vienne; Raymond de Canillac (1345–50), who resigned upon being named a cardinal in 1350; Cardinal Francis de Gozie (1391–92); Bernard du Rosier (1451–1474), author of two treatises on the temporal power of the pope and on the liberty of the Church, and who founded at Toulouse the College de Foix for the support of twenty-five poor scholars, where he collected one of the first libraries of the period; John of Orléans (1503–1533), cardinal in 1533.\n\nProtestantism entered Toulouse in 1532 through foreign students. As early as 1563 the Catholics of Toulouse founded a league to uphold the prerogatives of Catholicism, protected by the Parlement but jeopardized by certain Protestant town-councillors. From 1586 to 1595 the League party under Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, and the Duc de Joyeuse held control in Toulouse. The rule of Henry IV of France was definitively recognized there in 1596. During this period of religious unrest Toulouse had many notable archbishops: Gabriel de Gramont (1533–34), cardinal in 1530; Odet de Châtillon, Cardinal de Coligny (1534–1550), who became a Calvinist, married in 1564, and died in 1571; Anthony Sanguin (1550–1559), Cardinal de Meudon in 1539; Georges d'Armagnac (1562–1577), cardinal in 1544; François de Joyeuse (1584–1605), cardinal in 1583 and who conducted the negotiations between Henry IV and the Holy See.\n\nAmong subsequent archbishops we may mention: Louis de Nogaret (1614–1627), Cardinal de Lavalette in 1621, but who never received orders and from 1635 to 1637 led part of the French troops in the Thirty Years War; Charles de Montchal (1628–1651), who in 1635 upheld the decision of the Holy See, against the opinion of the majority of the Assembly of Clergy, that the marriages of princes of blood contracted without royal consent were not null; Pierre de Marca (1652–1662), who under Louis XIII aided largely in the re-establishment of Catholicism in Béarn, in 1621 became president of the Parlement of Béarn, was afterwards made Councillor of State by Louis XIII, and wrote a work of Gallican tendency \"De concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii\", a voluminous work on Spain and especially on the Province of Tarragona, and a commentary on the Psalms; he was secretary to the Assembly of the Clergy of France of April, 1656, which drew up a formula condemning the Five propositions drawn from the \"Augustinus\", and he died in 1662 just as he was about to take possession of the See of Paris; Pierre de Bonzy (1672–1673), cardinal in 1672; Charles Antoine de Laroche Aymon (1740–1752), cardinal in 1771; Etienne Charles de Lomenie (1763–1789), Cardinal de Brienne in 1788; Anne de Clermont Tonnerre (1820–1830), cardinal in 1822; Paul d'Astros (1830–1851), cardinal in 1850; Julien Desprez (1859–1895), cardinal in 1879; François-Désiré Mathieu (1896–1899), cardinal in 1899, was a member of the French Academy, wrote the history of Lorraine under the ancien regime, of the Concordat of 1801–2, and of the conclave of 1903; he died in 1908.\n\n\n"}

Egypt is listed on an official Scientology website as being a country \"in which Dianetics and Scientology services are ministered\". Narconon, an organization which promotes Hubbard's drug abuse treatment, has a branch in Fayoum.\n\nOn December 24, 2001, Egyptian authorities arrested two members of the Church of Scientology: Mahmoud Massarwa, a 28-year-old Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin, and his Palestinian wife Wafaa Ahmad.

{"id": "20766599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20766599", "title": "Shinbutsu kakuri", "text": "Shinbutsu kakuri\n\nThe term in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency in medieval and early modern Japan to keep some \"kami\" separate from Buddhism. While some \"kami\" were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same \"kami\" in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism. This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole. It should not be confused with \"shinbutsu bunri\" (\"separation of \"kami\" and buddhas\") or with haibutsu kishaku (\"abolish Buddhas and destroy Shākyamuni\"), which are phenomenons recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.\n\nWhen foreign Buddhism arrived in Japan it became necessary to harmonize it with local \"kami\" beliefs. This was done in a number of ways, among them \"shinbutsu shūgō\", or \"syncretism of \"kami\" and buddhas\", and its opposite, \"shinbutsu kakuri\".\n\nAfter Buddhism arrived in Japan, the Japanese developed a syncretism of local \"kami\" beliefs and foreign Buddhism called shinbutsu shūgō. When Buddhism was introduced through China in the late Asuka period (6th century), rather than discard the old belief system the Japanese tried to reconcile it with the new, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples were attached to local Shinto shrines and vice versa; both were devoted to both \"kami\" and Buddha. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on the local religion can be seen for example in the fact that the type of shrine we see today, with a large worship hall and images, is itself of Buddhist origin. The influential theory, common in Japan until the Meiji period, even states that Buddhist gods choose to appear to the Japanese as native \"kami\" in order to save them.\n\nWhile in popular practice \"kami\" and buddhas were both mixed and combined in a \"common religion\", they were at the same time isolated and separated in various ways elsewhere. The two religions never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity inside a difficult, largely unsystematized and tense relationship. This relationship was, rather than between two systems, between particular \"kami\" and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides \"shinbutsu shugo\" there was always the other side of the coin, the \"shinbutsu kakuri\". For example, at Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū some rites were \"kami\" rites, other were Buddhist, and were therefore conducted by different people. There was in the Japanese a strong resistance to the complete assimilation of their \"kami\" with foreign gods.\n\nThis visible resistance to Buddhism can be traced all the way back to the Nihon shoki's sixth-century account of the first introduction of Buddhism to Japan. Later history is dotted with accounts of friction between some \"kami\" and Buddhist temples that lie in their territories.\n\nAt Ise Jingū, for example, the shrine-temple was moved twice because of the incessant rain caused by the \"kami\" angered by its excessive proximity to the shrines. An 804 book, the , stipulates that on Ise lands some Buddhist words (buddha, sūtra, gojūnotō, monk, temple or vegetarian food) cannot be uttered and must be replaced with others. The book even specifies these replacement words () to be used instead of proscribed ones: \"nakago\" (\"middle child\") for a buddha, \"kawarabuki\" (\"tile-roofed building\" for \"temple,\" and \"somegami\" (\"stained paper\") for \"sūtra\".\n\nThere was therefore a conscious desire to keep the \"kami\" away from Buddhism. Toward the end of the ninth century the practice spread to other shrines. The Jōgan shiki (871) prohibits all Buddhist rites at court offices and at all province offices during the imperial enthronement period, or . Also, monks and nuns couldn't enter the imperial palace during the abstinence before, during and after some \"kami\" rituals at court. The Engi shiki says that, in some periods of the year, monks and nuns may not enter the imperial palace. In the Heian period this kind of separation became a common practice with many well-attested practical consequences. This taboo was rigorously observed at the imperial palace for centuries. It not only lasted, but gained new force during the Edo period under the Tokugawa. It is important to note that Buddhism was proscribed only insofar as the emperor was concerned and during the periods prescribed by the rites, but otherwise the usual mixing of \"kami\" and \"buddhas\" would take place.\n\nThe precise origin of the phenomenon does not appear to be related to the Buddhist special relationship with death. Direct contact with death was forbidden in temples too, and Buddhism was not outlawed at most shrines. \"Shinbutsu kakuri\" originated within rituals and shrines like Ise Jingū with deep ties which had profound ties with the emperor, and always remained strictly tied to him and to the ceremony of his enthronement. It later spread to other official ceremonies. It has been argued that it was a reaction against Buddhist political interference that peaked with the Dōkyō incident of 768 in which empress Shotoku wanted to give the throne to monk Dōkyō. It seems therefore that imperial ritual was isolated from Buddhism to protect the principle of hereditary imperial rule.\n\nThe practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of \"kami\" practices into Buddhism. Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and Kamo Shrines allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of \"kami\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2456155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2456155", "title": "Taegeuk", "text": "Taegeuk\n\nTaegeuk (, ) is the Korean form of the Chinese term \"Taiji\" (old spelling \"Taichi\"), meaning \"supreme ultimate\".\nThe Korean term more specifically refers to the graphical symbol (\"taijitu\") composed of interlocking semi-circles composing a sinusoid design.\nThe symbol was chosen for the design of the national flag in the 1880s, known as \"\" (Hangul: , with \"gi\" meaning \"flag\"). The Taegeuk is commonly associated with Korean Taoist philosophical values as well as Korean shamanism.\n\nThe Taegeuk has been in use for the majority of written history of Korea.\nThe origins of the interlocking-sinusoid design can be traced to as early as the Goguryeo or Silla period, e.g. in the decoration of a sword, dated to the 5th or 6th century, recovered from the grave of Michu of Silla, or an artifact with the a Taegeuk pattern of similar age found in the Bogam-ri tombs of Baekje at Naju, South Jeolla Province in 2008.\nIn the compound of Gameunsa, a temple built in AD 628 during the reign of King Jinpyeong of Silla, a stone object, perhaps the foundation of a pagoda, is carved with the Taegeuk design. \n\nIn Gojoseon, that is the ancient kingdom of Joseon, the design was used to represent Daoism in Korea and to express the hope for harmony of yin and yang.\n\nThe Taegeuk symbol is most prominently displayed on South Korea's national flag, called the \"taegeukgi\" (along with four of the eight trigrams used in divination). Because of the Taegeuk's association with the national flag, it is often used as a patriotic symbol, as are the colors red, blue, and black. The “geon” trigram (☰) represents the heaven, spring, east, and justice. The “gon” trigram (☷) symbolizes the earth, summer, west, and vitality, the “gam” trigram (☵) the moon, winter, north, and wisdom, and the “ri” trigram (☲) the sun, autumn, south, and fruition. The four trigrams supposedly move in an endless cycle from “geon” to “ri” to “gon” to “gam” and back to “geon” in their pursuit of perfection. The white background symbolizes the homogeneity, integrity and peace-loving nature of the Korean people. Traditionally, Koreans often wore white clothing, earning the nickname “white-clothed people” and therefore the color white epitomizes the Korean people.\n\nA popular variant in Korea is the tricolor Taegeuk (\"samsaeguitaegeuk\" or \"samtaegeuk\" ), which adds a yellow lobe or \"pa\" ( ).\nThe yellow is taken as representing humanity, in addition to the red and blue representing earth and heaven respectively. This version is related to the Buddhist symbol of Gankyil.\n\nA rendition of the tricolored Taegeuk also appeared in the official logo of the 1988 Summer Olympics accompanied by the five Olympic rings. A similar symbol is used by the Miss Asia Pacific World Beauty Pageant, which was hosted in South Korea from its inception in 2011 until 2014, and most recently hosted in Australia in 2018.\n\nTaeguk is a Legendary Gem in Diablo III. It can only be socketed into Amulets and Rings, and drops from Greater Rift Guardians.\nThis gem gradually increases damage as the player casts channeled skills (even if they do not hit anything), although for a very brief time, stacking multiplicatively with other similar modifiers. The buff stacks up to 10 times. Upgrading only increases the damage bonus per stack.\nAt rank 25, it also causes adds an Armor bonus for every active stack.\nDue to the way this gem works, it is mostly useful to builds with channeled skills. Note that Electrocute and Blood Siphon are not affected. The following skills are empowered: Whirlwind, Rapid Fire, Strafe, Tempest Rush, Firebats, Arcane Torrent, Disintegrate, and Ray of Frost.\n\nThe first designated Paralympic logo, created for the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, was based on the traditional \"pa\" ( ), the spiral or sinusoid components making up the Taegeuk symbol.\nIn March 1992, the Paralympic symbol was changed to a version utilizing only three \"pa\". This was not fully adopted until after the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer, Norway, since the Lillehammer Paralympic Organizing Committee had by then already started a marketing program based on the five-pa version. The three-\"pa\" version remained in place from the close of the Lillehammer Games through the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a co-production among Belgium, France, and Luxembourg. The film was screened at the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It was selected as the Belgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, making the December shortlist of nine films, but was not nominated. \"The Brand New Testament\" received ten nominations at the 6th Magritte Awards, winning four awards, including Best Film and Best Director for Van Dormael. The film has become a cult movie. \n\nGod lives in an apartment in Brussels which he shares with his meek wife and his 10-year-old daughter Ea, to whom he is emotionally and physically abusive. God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well. \n\nThe first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, when he discovered he had only days left to live, decided to live them as a girl. Ea encourages him to live each day as the equivalent of one month. \n\nGod is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world He suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations He created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and He is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.\n\nEa and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune. God reaches Uzbekistan where he works on an assembly line manufacturing washing machines. He keeps on searching without success for the washing machine with the escape hatch that will take him back to his apartment.\n\n\"The Brand New Testament\" received generally favorable reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82%, based on 74 reviews with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Brand New Testament\" takes a surreal, subversive, and funny look at Biblical themes through a modern — and refreshingly original — lens.\" At Metacritic, the film received an average score of 70 out of 100, based on 17 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\n"}

Published by Sort of Books, the original edition's dimensions are comparatively small, and the pages have wide margins; it is stylised to appear like an actual visitors book - in keeping with the first, nominal story in the collection - with the inside cover and first page providing columns for names, addresses, comments, etc.\n\nIn promoting the book, Hannah described how the inspiration for the nominal story came from an incident where, visiting a friend at her home, she was asked to sign a visitors book, a request she found strange given the everyday surroundings.\n\nA young woman's boyfriend calls her a snob when she questions the validity of him owning a visitors book, as he lives in an average terraced house. Flicking through the book, the comments left don't seem to match the surroundings.\n\nAfter holding a birthday party for her son in the family's new house, an exhausted mother is preparing to relax when she notices that one child still hasn't been picked up.\n\nA woman is stunned when, stopping her car at a red light, she sees what she knows against logic to be a ghost.

{"id": "20396733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20396733", "title": "Tęgoborze Prophecy", "text": "Tęgoborze Prophecy\n\nTegoborze Prophecy (Polish: \"Przepowiednia z Tegoborza\") is a verse composition, which describes post-World War One and post-World War Two fate of Poland. Its origins date back to late 19th century, however, its author and exact date of creation have not been confirmed so far.\n\nThe history of the prophecy begins in 1893 in Tegoborze, a village located in southern Lesser Poland. The village belonged to Count Wladyslaw Wieloglowski, who was keenly interested in paranormal activities, occultism and clairvoyance. Wieloglowski frequently invited there various fortune tellers and other persons who claimed magical abilities. \n\nOn September 23 of that year, a mysterious woman appeared in Wieloglowski’s house. She stated she was a medium and offered to foresee future. Apparently, she got into touch with a ghost, which left her a message concerning Poland’s fate. Wieloglowski, who was present during the session, wrote everything in his diary.\n\nA few years later, after the Count’s death, the house was inherited by his relative Aleksander Wieloglowski, who decided to remodel the complex and found an archive, with words of the prophecy. Since he was not interested in it, he decided to hand it to the Ossolineum library in Lwow, where it was carefully stored as the Tegoborze Prophecy. \n\nAt first, the composition did not raise interest and was not taken seriously. In 1912, the Gazeta Narodowa newspaper published it, together with a Russian translation. In the following years, the prophecy was forgotten, but this changed on March 27, 1939, a few months before German and Soviet invasion on Poland. The popular Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny daily published the text, together with an article about its history. Thousands of readers got to know the composition, and it became extremely popular during the war, when Poland was occupied by the two powers - Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. It raised spirits of the oppressed Poles, giving them hope for a better future of their homeland.\n\nCurrent whereabouts of the original text of the prophecy are not known. It was lost during the war and has not been found.\n\nName of the author of the prophecy is not known. In the Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny, it was signed as an anonymous medium, while the 1912 Gazeta Narodowa wrote that it was written by a ghost of Adam Mickiewicz, which appeared in the house of Count Wieloglowski in 1893. \n\nStanislaw Hadyna, a journalist and composer, came up with a different author. According to him, the author of the prophecy is Agnieszka Pilchowa, a popular interbellum period clairvoyant. However, considering Pilchowa’s date of birth, it is not likely.\n"}
