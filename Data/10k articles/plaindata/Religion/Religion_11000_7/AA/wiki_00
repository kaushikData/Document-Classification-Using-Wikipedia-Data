It is north of Kayenta and is visible from U.S. Route 163. The English designation \"Agathla\" is derived from the Navajo name \"\" meaning 'much wool', apparently for the fur of antelope and deer accumulating on the rock. The mountain is considered sacred by the Navajo.\n\nAgathla Peak is an eroded volcanic plug consisting of volcanic breccia cut by dikes of an unusual igneous rock called minette. It is one of many such volcanic diatremes that are found in Navajo country of northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico. Agathla Peak and Shiprock in New Mexico are the most prominent. These rocks are part of the Navajo Volcanic Field, in the southern Colorado Plateau. Ages of these minettes and associated more unusual igneous rocks cluster near 25 million years.\n\n"}
{"id": "211125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211125", "title": "All Gas and Gaiters", "text": "All Gas and Gaiters\n\nAll Gas and Gaiters is a British television ecclesiastical sitcom which aired on BBC1 from 1966 to 1971. It was written by Pauline Devaney and Edwin Apps, a husband-and-wife team who used the pseudonym of \"John Wraith\" when writing the pilot. \"All Gas and Gaiters\" was also broadcast on BBC Radio from 1971 to 1972.\n\n\n\"All Gas and Gaiters\", predominantly farcical in nature, was set in the close of the fictional St Ogg's Cathedral and concerned various intrigues and rivalries among the clergy. The \"gaiters\" in the title refers to part of the traditional dress of bishops and archdeacons. The title itself, however, is a reference to a well-known phrase from Charles Dickens' 1839 novel \"Nicholas Nickleby\", later used by P. G. Wodehouse and by Powell and Pressburger (spoken in the film \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\"), although it had at that time a different meaning. The bishop was easygoing; his friend the archdeacon was elderly, tippling, and still appreciative of attractive women; and the bishop's chaplain was naïve and accident-prone. Their wish to live a quiet bachelor life was continually threatened by the overbearing dean, who tried to bring by-the-book rule to the cathedral.\n\nThe series initially aroused some controversy because of its portrayal of senior clergy as bungling incompetents, although some clergy enjoyed it. In the opening credits, St Albans Cathedral was shown as the fictional St Ogg's, but with the twisted spire of Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield added to the central tower. The background to the opening credits was the headmaster's garden of St. Albans School. The name \"St. Ogg's\" may have been taken from a fictional village in George Eliot's novel \"The Mill on the Floss\".\n\nIt proved to be the first of a series of comedies starring Derek Nimmo in similar bumbling clerical roles—(\"Oh, Brother!\", \"Oh, Father!\" and \"Hell's Bells\")—but is regarded as the best, partly because of a strong supporting cast (particularly the experienced \"farceur\" Robertson Hare as the archdeacon) and partly because it included some elements of gentle satire.\n\nAll 11 surviving episodes were released on DVD by DD Home Entertainment in 2004, originally accompanied by a detailed behind-the-scenes booklet, written by Andy Priestner in consultation with the show's writers, Edwin Apps and Pauline Devaney, but later released without. Cinema Club have since bought the DVD rights.\n\nEight scripts of the lost episodes were published in 2015: \"All Gas and Gaiters, the Lost Episodes: Tome 1\" (): \"Only Three Can Play\", \"The Dean Goes Primitive\", \"The Bishop Goes To Town\", \"The Bishop Learns the Facts\", \"The Bishop is Hospitable\", \"The Bishop Takes a Holiday\", \"The Affair at Cookham Lock\" and \"The Bishop Gives a Shove\".\n\nThe pilot and first three series were videotaped in black-and-white. The third series was taped in colour, but originally broadcast in monochrome. The fourth and fifth series were made and shown in colour. Only 11 episodes still exist in the archive, owing to the wiping policy of the BBC in this era. Two of the colour episodes from series 5 are preserved as black and white 16mm film recordings only (three earlier episodes were always black and white). Only six colour episodes are preserved in their original colour videotape format.\n\n\"Christmas Night with the Stars\" was a programme screened annually on Christmas night, when the top stars of the BBC appeared in short versions of their programmes, typically five to ten minutes long. \"All Gas and Gaiters\" appeared once alongside its sitcom spin-off \"Oh, Brother!\" in 1968. This telerecording no longer exists in the BBC's film and videotape archives.\n\nA radio version of \"All Gas and Gaiters\" was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 5 January 1971 to 4 December 1972 for 33 episodes. The radio show used the same cast as the television series with the exception of Derek Nimmo, who left after the first series and was succeeded by Jonathan Cecil. Although seven radio episodes were thought to have been wiped, these were later found and all are available through radio enthusiasts. Some episodes were rebroadcast on BBC 7 in October and November 2006, and again a year later and in early 2009. They continued to be broadcast on the station, now renamed BBC Radio 4 Extra, in August 2011 and again in early 2017.\n\n\n\nIn April 2016 the radio drama based on the story behind the making of the series, \"All Mouth and Trousers\" by Mark Burgess, was aired by BBC Radio 4. The production featured John Sessions as Frank Muir, Nicholas Boulton as Stuart Allen, Gareth Williams as William Mervyn, Trevor Littledale as Robertson Hare, Zeb Soanes as Derek Nimmo and David Collings as John Barron.\n\n"}

K. Chesterton, and a close associate of Hilaire Belloc. While the ideas of distributism came from all three, and Arthur Penty, he was the most ideological and combative by temperament. His death, according to his widow, removed the theorist of the movement.\n\nHe was born in Kensington, London, and educated at St Paul's School, then worked for a small publisher for a time. He then qualified as surveyor and estate agent, with a view to entering his father's business, which is still flourishing today. In 1901 he joined the Fabian Society, with which he was closely involved for about six years. From 1907 he wrote for A. R. Orage's \"The New Age\". In 1908 he published an anonymous biography of his better-known brother, \"G. K. Chesterton, a Criticism\", but his authorship was quickly discovered.\n\nHe had been one of the 'Anti-Puritan League' of the 1890s, with Stewart Headlam (who stood bail for Oscar Wilde), Edgar Jepson and his brother; and then a member of Henry Holland's Christian Social Union. While Chesterton was writing from a socialist point of view for Orage, he was also moving to an Anglo-Catholic religious stance. In 1911 he started editorial work for Belloc, with whom he wrote in \"The Party System\", a criticism of party politics. In 1912 he formally became a Roman Catholic.\n\nThat same year he bought Belloc's failing weekly \"Eye-Witness\"; Charles Granville who published it had been made bankrupt. He renamed it \"The New Witness\", editing it for four years before enlisting in the army, and turning it into a scandal sheet. His persistent attacks on prominent political figures involved in the Marconi scandal (such as Lloyd George), and his public defence of his position in terms of a 'Jewish problem', have left him with a reputation as an anti-Semite. He was successfully brought to court by Godfrey Isaacs, one of those attacked, although the damages awarded were nominal. A government investigation revealed that high government officials had engaged in insider trading in the stock of Marconi's American subsidiary, but the quantity of stocks they were known to have purchased was relatively small.\n\nIn 1916 he married journalist Ada Elizabeth Jones, later known as a writer, after a long courtship. He joined the Highland Light Infantry as a private soldier. His brother Gilbert took over the paper, with Ada as Secretary and Business Manager. Eventually in 1925 Gilbert, with great reluctance, allowed it to be renamed \"G. K.'s Weekly\" because his name was very well-known and likely to attract interest.\n\nHe was three times wounded fighting in France, and died there in a hospital of nephritis on 6 December 1918. His wife Ada had rushed to his bedside and she arrived just before he died. She was his only relative at his funeral. Although sick, he had refused to leave his post until the Armistice. On 13 December, G. K. Chesterton would report his death in the \"New Witness\", noting that \"He lived long enough to march to the victory which was for him a supreme vision of liberty and the light.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "473463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473463", "title": "Chasse-galerie", "text": "Chasse-galerie\n\nLa Chasse-galerie also known as \"The Bewitched Canoe\" or \"The Flying Canoe\" is a popular French-Canadian tale of \"Coureurs des bois\" who make a deal with the devil, a variant of the Wild Hunt. Its best-known version was written by Honoré Beaugrand (1848–1906). It was published in \"The Century Magazine\" in August 1892.\n\nThe story can be traced back to a French legend about a rich nobleman named Gallery who loved to hunt. He loved it so much that he refused to attend Sunday mass. As punishment for this sin he was condemned to fly forever through the night skies, chased by galloping horses and howling wolves, in a fashion reminiscent of the Wild Hunt.\n\nWhen French settlers arrived in Canada, they swapped stories with the natives and the tale of Gallery was combined with a First Nations legend about a flying canoe.\n\nAfter a night of heavy drinking on New Year's Eve, a group of voyageurs working at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues away (300 miles). The only way to make such a long journey and be back in time for work the next morning is to run the \"chasse-galerie\". Running the \"chasse-galerie\" means making a pact with the devil so their canoe can fly through the air to their destination quickly. However, the travellers must not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they whisk by in the flying canoe. If either of these rules is broken during the voyage, then the devil will take their souls. To be safe, the men promise not to touch another drop of rum to keep their heads clear. The crew took their places in the canoe which then rises off the ground, and they start to paddle. Far below they see the frozen Gatineau River, many villages, shiny church steeples and then the lights of Montreal. The bewitched canoe eventually touches down near a house where New Year's Eve festivities are in full swing. No one wonders at the trappers'/loggers' sudden arrival. They are embraced with open arms and soon are dancing and celebrating as merrily as everyone else. Soon it is late and the men must leave if they are to get back to camp in time for work. As they fly through the moonless night, it becomes apparent that their navigator had been drinking as he steers the canoe on a dangerously unsteady course. While passing over Montreal they just miss running into a church steeple, and soon after the canoe ends up stuck in a deep snowdrift. At this point the drunken navigator begins swearing and taking the Lord's name in vain. Terrified the devil will take their souls, the men bind and gag their friend and elect another to steer. The navigator soon breaks his bonds and begins swearing again. The crew become more and more shaken at the possibility of losing their souls, and they eventually steer the bewitched canoe right into a tall pine. The men spill out and are knocked unconscious. The ending of the story changes from version to version. Sometimes the men are condemned to fly the canoe through hell and appear in the sky every New Year's Eve, but in all but one version all escape the terms the devil (Lucifer) made.\n\nSeveral different versions of this tale exist. An Acadian version involves an axe handle. It stretches to accommodate as many as climb on.\n\nAnother variation has the devil himself steering and deliberately trying to break the rules on the return journey, at which point they throw him out of the canoe to save themselves.\n\nIn English this particular legend is known as \"The Canoe\", or \"The Wild Hunt Bewitched\". The second name is used to translate precisely \"chasse-galerie\" as it is known in Canadian French; the other term is much broader.\n\nIn Quebec, the best-known version is written by Honoré Beaugrand. This is the story of the Gatineau loggers who make a pact with the devil in order to steal a boat so they can visit their women. They are warned, however, not to blaspheme during the voyage, or touch crosses atop church steeples, and they must be back before six o'clock the next morning. Otherwise they would lose their souls. In his version, the devil (Lucifer) is rather generous, and allows the men to return unhurt and undamaged.\n\nThe tale appeared in a book of French-Canadian folktales called \"Legends of French Canada\" by Edward C. Woodley, published in 1931, republished in 1938. The tale is told as a recollection of one of the men who made \"chasse-galerie\". The men travel from St. Maurice to St. Jeanne. The return accident is credited to \"whiskey-blanc\".\n\nAn earlier volume in English, entitled \"The Flying Canoe (La Chasse-Galerie)\" was written by J.E. LeRossignol, by McLelland and Steward Publishers in 1929. In it, thanks is given (with no further publication information) to \"the Toronto \"Star Weekly\", and the \"Canadian Home Journal\" for their courteous permission to republish certain stories which appeared originally in these journals.\"\n\nIn 2015, a musical theatre version of the story was performed at the Storefront Theatre in Toronto, and won two Dora Awards and two Toronto Theatre Critics Awards. A larger production was mounted in 2016 by Soulpepper Theatre.\n\nA Canadian 40¢ postage stamp was issued in 1991 (as the Witched Canoe), illustrating this legend (Canadian Scott #1334 or #1445), which forms part of a series on Canadian folktales.\n\nOne of the oldest rides at Montreal's La Ronde amusement park, La Pitoune, uses this legend as inspiration. It is a basic sawmill log ride, but overhead is a representation of the flying canoe, with the devil perched behind the terrified men. The high bench at the back of the log-cars is therefore referred to as \"the devil-seat.\"\n\nThe legend serves as the label motif for Maudite, an ale produced by the Unibroue brewery of Quebec.\n\nThe National Film Board of Canada produced a short animated film of this \"The Legend of the Flying Canoe (La Chasse-galerie)\".\n\nClaude Dubois sings a song called \"Chasse Galerie\" on album \"Rencontre de rêves live (1992).\"\n\nThe Quebec folk band La Bottine Souriante published a song on this tale, \"Martin de la Chasse-Galerie\", in their album La Mistrine in 1994.\n\nMontreal folk metal band Blackguard use an image of the flying canoe on the cover of their 2009 album \"Profugus Mortis\". Included on the album is a song called \"The Last We Wage\", whose lyrics are based on this legend.\n\nDuring the Opening Ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, a canoe containing fiddler Colin Maier was lowered from the ceiling in an allusion to the legend.\n\nThe Flying Canoe also appears in Fredric Back's 1981 animated film \"Crac\".\n\nThe radio program \"C'est la Vie\" retold the story on December 28, 2001, narrated by storyteller Marylyn Peringer.\n\nThe first feature film adaptation, \" (Chasse-Galerie: La Légende)\", was released in February 2016. It was written by Guillaume Vigneault and directed by Jean-Philippe Duval.\n\n"}

The word \"Chhatri\" means \"canopy\" or \"umbrella.\" In the context of architecture, the word is used to refer to two different things. The usual and more widely understood meaning is of a memorial, usually very ornate, built over the site where the funeral (cremation) of an important personage was performed. Such memorials usually consist of a platform girded by a set of ornate pillars which hold up a stone canopy. The word \"chhatri\" is also used to refer to the small pavilions that mark the corners and roof of the entrance of a major building. These pavilions are purely decorative and have no utility, but are a classic folly displaying the status and wealth of the owner.\n\nChhatris are commonly used to depict the elements of pride and honour in Rajput, Maratha and Jat architecture. They are widely used in palaces, in forts, or to demarcate funerary sites. Originating in Rajasthani architecture where they were memorials for royalty, they were later adapted as a standard feature in all buildings in Maratha-ruled states, Rajasthan, and most importantly in Mughal architecture. The most notable surviving examples today are to be found at Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and the Taj Mahal in Agra. \n\nChhatris in Shekhawati may consist of a simple structure of one dome raised by four pillars to a building containing many domes and a basement with several rooms. In some places, the interior of the chhatris is painted in the same manner as the Havelis (Mansions) of the region.\n\nMany other chhatris exist in other parts of Rajasthan. Their locations include:\n\n\nSome of the best-known chhatris in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan are located at the following cities and towns:\n\n\nThe region of Madhya Pradesh is the site of several other notable chhatris of its famous Maratha rulers:\n\nChhatris can also be found in the outskirts of Bhuj city belonging mainly to Jadeja rulers of Kutch. The chhatri of Rao Lakhpatji is very famous for its intricate designs & carvings. Most of them but have been destroyed in the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. The restoration work is going on.\n\nThere are two notable chhatris in the United Kingdom, a country with strong historical links to India. One is a cenotaph in Brighton, deadicated to the Indian soldiers who died in the First World War. \n\nThe other is in Arnos Vale Cemetery near Bristol and is a memorial to the distinguished Indian reformer Ram Mohan Roy, who died in that city.\n\n\n"}

The term can be translated as \"master of passion\". They are sometimes referred to more generally as \"Bairagis\" or \"Sannyasis\".\n\nThe Gosains were powerful nomadic and mercenary trading groups who undertook pilgrimages across significant areas of land. While early British colonists in Bengal Presidency considered them to be marauding robbers, similar to the Banjaras, they were also important to urban economies and the development of wider trade networks. These itinerant religious mendicant groups could be very large in number, with figures in excess of 50,000 being probable for those headed by figures such as Umrao Giri and Himmat Bahadur in the late 1700s. Their numerical strength enabled them to be self-protecting and also to protect the trade routes that they used, regardless of who might have titular power in any given place. Their movements were often dictated by religious festivals, both of a localised village nature and of a more widely celebrated type, such as Holi. As these festivals were also occasions for seasonal markets, so the Gosains were able to move and trade goods between areas.\n\nThe Nawabs of Awadh, who ruled Oudh State in the 18th and 19th centuries and were Muslim successors to the Mughal empire, recruited from Gosain martial brotherhoods as a way to assimilate influential Hindu elements of society and buttress their own sources of power. This attempt at creating a plural society was in sharp contrast to the zealotry that had characterised their predecessors.\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "26745888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26745888", "title": "Gurjaras of Lata", "text": "Gurjaras of Lata\n\nThe Gurjaras of Lata, also known as Gurjaras of Nandipuri or Bharuch Gurjaras, was a dynasty which ruled Lata region (now South Gujarat, India) as a feudatory of different dynasties from c. 580 CE to c. 738 CE.\n\nAll the available information regarding the Bharuch Gurjaras comes from copperplates, all obtained from South Gujarat. Like the grants of the contemporary Chalukyas all the genuine copperplates are dated in the Traikúṭaka era which begins in 249–50 CE. The Gurjara capital seems to have been Nāndīpurī or Nāndor, the modern Nandod near Bharuch. Two of their grants issue Nāndīpurītaḥ that is 'from Nāndīpurī’, a phrase which seems to show the place named was the capital since in other Gurjara grants the word \"vāsaka\" or camp occurs.\n\nThese copperplates limit the regular Gurjara territory to the Bharuch district between the Mahi and the Narmada rivers, though at times their power extended north to Kheḍā and south to the Tāpti river.\n\nThough the Gurjaras held a considerable territory in South Gujarat their plates seem to show they were not independent rulers. The general titles are either \"Samadhigata-panchamahāśabada\" 'He who has attained the five great titles,’ or \"Sāmanta\" Feudatory. In one instance Jayabhaṭa III who was probably a powerful ruler is called \"Sāmantādhipati\" Lord of Feudatories. It is hard to say to what suzerain these Broach Gurjaras acknowledged fealty. Latterly they seem to have accepted the Chalukyas on the south as their overlords. But during the greater part of their existence they may have been feudatory of the Maitraka dynasty.\n\nThe origin of dynasty is not known. They probably originated from the neighboring dynasty, Gurjaras of Mandor or Bhinmal.\n\nA grant made by Nirihullaka, the chieftain of a forest tribe in the lower valley of the Narmada, shows that towards the end of the sixth century CE that region was occupied by forest tribes who acknowledged the supremacy of the Kalachuri dynasty; a fact which accounts for the use of the Chedi or Traikúṭaka era in South Gujarāt. Nirihullaka names with respect a king Śaṅkaraṇa, identified with Śaṅkaragaṇa (r. c. 575-600 CE) of Kalachuri dynasty and the Gurjara conquest must be subsequent to this date. Another grant, which is only a fragment and contains no king’s name, but which on the ground of date (Samvat 346 = 594–5 CE) and style may be safely attributed to the Gurjara dynasty, shows that the Gurjaras were established in the country within a few years of Śaṅkaragaṇa’s probable date.\n\nA still nearer approximation to the date of the Gurjara conquest is suggested by the change in the titles of Dharasena I of Maitraka dynasty, who in his grants of Saṃvat 252 (571 CE) calls himself Mahārāja, while in his grants of 269 and 270 (588 and 589 CE), he adds the title of Mahāsāmanta, which points to subjection by some foreign power between 571 and 588 CE. It seems highly probable that this power was that of the Gurjaras of Bhīnmāl; and that their successes therefore took place between 580 and 588 CE or about 585 CE.\n\nThe above-mentioned anonymous grant of the year 346 (CE 594–95) from Sankheda is ascribed with great probability to Dadda I. who is known from the two Kheḍā grants of his grandson Dadda II. (C. 620–650 CE) to have “uprooted the Nāga” who may be the same as the forest tribes ruled by Nirihullaka (possibly later represented by the Nāikdās of the Panchmahāls and the Talabdas or Locals of Bharuch).\n\nThe northern limit of Dadda’s kingdom seems to have been the Vindhya, as the grant of 380 (CE 628–29) says that the lands lying around the feet of the Vindhya were for his pleasure. At the same time it appears that part at least of Northern Gujarāt was ruled by the Mahāsāmanta Dharasena of Maitraka dynasty, who in Val. 270 (589–90 CE) granted a village in the \"āhāra\" (province) of Kheṭaka (Kheḍā). Dadda is always spoken of as the Sāmanta, which shows that while he lived his territory remained a part of the Gurjara kingdom of Bhīnmāl. Subsequently, North Gujarāt fell into the hands of the Mālava kings, to whom it belonged in Hiuen Tsiang’s time (c. 640 CE). In Tsiang's accounts, Po-lu-ka-cha-po (Bharigukacchapa or Bhrigukaccha, i.e., Bharuch) is mentioned. Dadda I. is mentioned in the two Kheḍā grants of his grandson as a worshipper of the sun: the fragmentary grant of 346 (594–95 CE) which is attributed to him gives no historical details.\n\nDadda I was succeeded by his son Jayabhaṭa I who is mentioned in the Kheḍā grants as a victorious and virtuous ruler, and appears from his title of \"Vītarāga\" the Passionless to have been a religious prince.\n\nJayabhaṭa I. was succeeded by his son Dadda II who bore the title of \"Praśāntarāga\", the Passion-calmed. Dadda was the donor of the two Kheḍā grants of 380 (628–29 CE) and 385 (633–34 CE), and a part of a grant made by his brother Raṇagraha in the year 391 (639–40 CE) has been recorded. Both of the Kheḍā grants relate to the gift of the village of Sirīshapadraka (Sisodra) in the Akrúreśvara (Ankleshwar) \"vishaya\" to certain Brāhmans of Jambusar and Bharuch. In Raṇagraha's grant the name of the village is lost.\n\nDadda II’s own grants describe him as having attained the five great titles, and praise him in general terms: and both he and his brother Raṇagraha sign their grants as devout worshipers of the sun. Dadda II heads the genealogy in the later grant of 456 (704–5 CE), which states that he protected \"the lord of Valabhi [Dhruvasena II] who had been defeated by the great lord the illustrious Harshadeva.\" The event referred to must have been some expedition of Harsha of Kanauj (Vardhana dynasty) (607–648 CE), perhaps the campaign in which Harsha was defeated on the Narmada by Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty (which took place before 634 CE). The protection given to the Valabhi king is perhaps referred to in the Kheḍā grants in the mention of \"strangers and suppliants and people in distress.\" If this is the case the defeat of Valabhi took place before 628–29 CE, the date of the earlier of the Kheḍā grants. On the other hand, the phrase quoted is by no means decisive, and the fact that in Hiuen Tsiang’s time Dhruvasena II of Valabhi was son-in-law of Harsha’s son, makes it unlikely that Harsha should have been at war with him. It follows that the expedition referred to may have taken place in the reign of Dharasena IV who may have been the son of Dhruvasena by another wife than Harsha’s granddaughter.\n\nTo Dadda II’s reign belongs Hiuen Tsiang’s notice of the kingdom of Bharuch (C. 640 CE). He says \"all their profit is from the sea\" and describes the country as salt and barren, which is still true of large tracts in the west and twelve hundred years ago was probably the condition of a much larger area than at present. Hiuen Tsiang does not say that Broach was subject to any other kingdom, but it is clear from the fact that Dadda bore the five great titles that he was a mere feudatory. At this period the valuable port of Bharuch, from which all their profit was made, was a prize fought for by all the neighbouring powers. With the surrounding country of Lāṭa, Bharuch submitted to Pulakeśin II. (610–640 CE), it may afterwards have fallen to the Mālawa kings, to whom in Hiuen Tsiang’s time (640 CE) both Kheḍā (K’i.e.-ch’a) and Ánandapura (Vadnagar) belonged; later it was subject to Valabhi, as Dharasena IV made a grant at Bharuch in VS 330 (649–50 CE).\n\nThe knowledge of the later Gurjaras is derived exclusively from two grants of Jayabhaṭa III dated respectively 456 (704–5 CE) and 486 (734–5 CE). The later of these two grants is imperfect, only the last plate having been preserved. The earlier grant of 456 (704–5 CE) shows that during the half century following the reign of Dadda II the dynasty had ceased to call themselves Gurjaras, and had adopted a Purāṇic pedigree traced from Karna of \"Mahabharata\". It also shows that from Dadda III onward the family were Śaivas instead of sun-worshipers.\n\nThe successor of Dadda II was his son Jayabhaṭa II who is described as a warlike prince, but of whom no historical details are recorded.\n\nJayabhaṭa’s son, Dadda III \"Bāhusahāya\" is described as waging wars with the great kings of the east and of the west (probably Mālava and Valabhi). He had received title of \"Bāhusahāya\" to for showing valour of his arms in fights with suzerain of east and west. He was Śaiva. Like his predecessors, Dadda III was not an independent ruler. He could claim only the five great titles, though no hint is given who was his suzerain. His immediate superior may have been Jayasimhavarma, who received the province of Lāṭa from his brother Vikramaditya I of Chalukya dynasty. During his rule Jayasimhavarma had defeated Vajjada between Mahi and Narmada rivers. Vajjada may be another name of Dadda III or another king of that name had invaded his state and was defeated by Jayasimhavarma.\n\nThe son and successor of Dadda III was Jayabhaṭa III whose two grants of 456 (704–5 CE) and 486 (734–5 CE) must belong respectively to the beginning and the end of his reign. He attained the five great titles, and was therefore a feudatory, probably of the Chālukyas: but his title of \"Mahāsāmantādhipati\" implies that he was a chief of importance. He is praised in vague terms, but the only historical event mentioned in his grants is a defeat of a Maitraka ruler of Valabhi, noted in the grant of 486 (734–5 CE). The Maitraka king referred to must be Śīlāditya IV (691 CE).\n\nJayabhata III was succeeded by Ahirole. He ruled till c. 720 CE.\n\nAhirole's son Jayabhata IV's copperplate states that he defeated the Arabs fighting for the Ummayad Caliphate at Valabhi, the capital of his probable overlords, the Maitrakas, in the year 735-36 CE. He assumed title of \"Mahasamanradhipati\". He must be fuedatory of Maitraka ruler Shiladitya IV or Shiladitya V as he had helped his suzerain Maitrakas in battle. Majumdar had suggested that he may have helped as a feudatory of Chalukyas. Bharuch may have finally destroyed by the Arabs and the Gurjara principality overtaken by them. The Arab were severely defeated and repulsed by Chalukya governor Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin in 738-39 at Navsari. He may have annexed the Gurjara kingdom to the Chalukya territory after evicting the Arabs. Alternatively, the state may have been absorbed under Dantidurga of Rashtrakuta dynasty.\n\nThe rulers till Dadda III were worshipers of Surya (sun) but after Dadda III they are identified as Shaiva. Jayabhata I and Dadda II, are given the epithets 'Vitarāga' and 'Prasāntarāga’ in their grants—words which indicate that they may have patronized Jainism though they themselves were not converts.\n\n"}

The guru-shishya tradition is a sacred one in Hinduism and appears in other religious groups in India, such as Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The word is a combination of the Sanskrit words ('teacher' or 'master') and ('family' or 'home'). Before the British rule, they served as South Asia's primary educational system. The term is also used today to refer to residential monasteries or schools operated by modern gurus. The proper plural of the term is , though \"gurukulas\" and \"gurukuls\" are also used in English and some other Western languages.\n\nIn a , the students living together are considered as equals, irrespective of their social standing. They learn from the guru and help the guru in his everyday life, including carrying out of mundane daily household chores. However, some scholars suggest that the activities are not mundane and very essential part of the education to inculcate self-discipline among students. Typically, a guru does not receive or accept any fees from the studying with him as the relationship between a guru and the shishya is considered very sacred.\n\nAt the end of one's education, a offers the guru before leaving the gurukula. The is a traditional gesture of acknowledgment, respect and thanks to the guru, which may be monetary, but may also be a special task the teacher wants the student to accomplish.

Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj and Swami Shraddhanand, were the pioneers of the modern system, who in 1886 founded now-widespread Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Public Schools and Universities.\nIn 1948, Shastriji Maharaj Shree Dharamjivan das Swami followed suit and initiated first Swaminarayan in Rajkot in Gujarat state of India.

The institutions in Najaf, Iraq and Qom, Iran, are the preeminent seminary centers for the training of Shi'a clergymen. However, several smaller hawzas exist in other cities around the world, such as at Karbala, Iraq, Isfahan and Mashhad in Iran, Beirut, Lebanon, Lucknow, India, Lahore, Pakistan, Europe and North America.\n\nHawza 'Ilmiyya in Najaf, Iraq was established in 430 AH (the 11th century AD) by Shaykh al-Tusi (385 AH/995 CE – 460 AH/1067 CE), and continued as a center of study until the establishment of modern Iraq in 1921. At present Ayatollah Sistani heads Hawza 'Ilmiyya Najaf, which includes three other Ayatollahs - Mohammad Ishaq Al-Fayyad, Mohammad Saeed Al-Hakim and Bashir al-Najafi. After witnessing a peak of some 20,000 students in the 60s, then around 3000 because of the State repression, since 2003, the Najaf hawza has now more than 13,000 students, while the curriculum has been updated to include many modern subjects as well as inter faith and inter sectarian initiatives.\n\nAlthough big Shi'a academies existed in Qom dating back as early as 10th century CE, the hawza of the city became prominent at the time of the Safavids when Shi'a Islam became the official religion of Iran. The famous teachers of that era included Mulla Sadra and Shaykh Bahai. The modern Qom hawza was revitalized by Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi and Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi and is barely a century old. There are nearly three hundred thousand clerics in Iran’s seminaries.\n\nThere are also a number of women's hawza, mostly located in Iran. Already in the early 1800s, the Salehiyya madrasa in Qazvin ran a women's section where several female mujtahids were trained. In Qom, the earliest seminary for women was established by the grand ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, who in 1973 added a women's section to his hawza Dar al-Tabligh, called Dar al-Zahra. Next, the Haghani school opened a women's wing in 1974/75, called Maktab-e Tawhid.\n\nOutside Qom, women's seminaries included Maktab-e Fatema of Fasa (opened in 1961), Maktab-e Zahra of Shiraz (opened in 1964), Maktab-e Fatimah of Isfahan (opened by Lady Amin in 1965), Zahra-i Athar of Tehran (opened in 1966), and Madrase-ye ‘Elmīyya Narges of Mashhad (opened in 1966).\n\nAfter the 1979 revolution in Iran, the state began to centralize the women's hawza system. The women's seminaries in Qom were centralized into one large school, the Jamiat al-Zahra. In Khorasan with its clerical center of Mashhad, the women's maktabs came under the aegis of the state-run Centre for Management of Women’s Seminaries of Khorasan. In the rest of the country, women's seminaries were integrated into the Centre for Management of Women’s Seminaries (Markaz-e Modiriat-e Ḥawzahā-ye ʿElmiyya Khwaharān). Since the mid-1990s the latter center has established more than 300 seminaries across Iran (before the revolution less than a dozen existed in the entire country).\n\nHawza students begin their studies by learning fiqh, kalam, hadith, tafsir, philosophy, natural and abstract sciences as well as Arabic and Arabic literature. Once these studies have been completed, they may begin preparation to become a mujtahid by studying advanced old textbooks known as \"sat'h\", and research courses known as \"kharij\".\n\nSubjects studied at the Haza may include the following:\n\n\nOnce the basic studies have been completed, students may begin preparation to become a mujtahid by studying advanced ancient textbooks known as \"sat'h\", and research courses known as \"kharij\".\n\nTo be a mujtahid one has to excel in the advanced levels of the Hawza including \"Muqad'dim'maat\", \"Sotooh\", \"Sotooh 'Ulya\", \" 'Uloom ukhra\" and \"Bahath Kharij\". \n\n\"Bahath e Kharij\" is the last level of hawzah and this level leads to Marja'iya, to become a marja' one has to teach \"dars e khaarij\" for considerable amount of time, publish collection of juridical edicts (\"risala ‘amaliyya\") and recognised as one (by established \"Maraji\").\n\n\n"}

In March 2006 the \"Stiftung Europaplatz\" foundation was founded, which raised the necessary funds for the project, including sacred spaces, among others for Hindu and Buddhist communities, of the Alevis and the Council of Christian Churches in the canton of Bern (AKB). In the beginning, the Jewish community of Bern and the Bahá'í Faith community did not wish to set up own rooms, but ideally supported the project. The cantonal Islamic \"Umma\" association has withdrawn from the project after initial concessions, but the Muslim association Hochfeldstrasse, however, was interested to participate.\n\nThe building includes, besides the house of religions, 88 apartments, shops, catering services and offices on a floor area of approximately . The location \"Europaplatz\" is situated in Bern-Ausserholligen, and served by S-Bahn, Tram Bern West, bus lines and the motorway junction. The Bern main train station and the city centre are accessible in a few minutes. \n\nThe city of Bern granted planning permission for the project in April 2007 with a cost of about 50 million Swiss Francs, of which about 15 million Swiss Francs were related to the \"Haus der Religionen\". The construction was delayed several times, but the ground-breaking ceremony took place on 27 June 2012. On 14 December 2014 the building was inaugurated and opened for the public use.\n\nChristians, Alevis, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists in their church, Dargah, mosque, temples and centre now celebrate their cults. The religious communities celebrated the indentation in the newly built glass building on the \"Europaplatz\" square in the west of Bern on 14 December 2014 with thousands of visitors. \"While religious wars play anywhere in the world, we here get the opportunity to get to know other religions\", a Sikh visitor told, and a Krishna monk tells in the Mosque, \"that Muslims pray daily five times, is discipline for my own religion\". A young Albanian Muslim family is pleased with the open setting in the house: \"I'm hip-hopper, my wife wears a headscarf. No reasons to condemn a people are both\". And the non-denominational fellow hopes, \"the House can help to break down stereotypes\".\n\nSome of these religious communities lived so far in back yards or basements. The foundation provided funding to the (as of December 2014) five religious communities, and had to provide for the interior fittings and payments of the rental fees. Also the Bernese Jews, Bahá'i, and Sikhs are members of the association, which operates the house.\n\nThe House of religions is used by cultural and religious communities of the city and the canton of Bern that previously had no rooms adapted to their needs. They represent Alevi, Christian, Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu faiths. Partners in the dialogue are also the Jewish community, the Baha'is and Sikhs. A dialogue of cultures, access to experience, knowledge and spirituality of other cultures and religions are taught, as they have been found in the Bern region their home. Haus der Religionen will provide a center of excellence for dialogue its services. Everyone involved in the project knows the inviolable dignity of the human being, the idea of tolerance and mutual respect obliged. \"We were dreamers, utopians, do-gooders far from any reality\", said Guido Albisetti, president of the association. But now the \"Haus der Religionen\" is built, and past experience showed that the common dialog is possible and fruitful.\n\nAccording to the operators, the architecture of the building allows the various communities to engage with each other, but also to withdraw. The building's design enables that the sacred spaces on either side of a so-called \"dialog area\" are accessible to everyone, and therefore are arranged on two floors.\n\nImmediately after the opening ceremony the versatile cultural program was launched, lasting until March 2015 opening events. The restaurant \"Vanakam\" is the central meeting place, where every day different delicacies are prepared, so also an Ayurveda vegetarian lunch. Of the eight religions, five have set up own prayer rooms, connected by \"dialog zones\".\n\nThe two largest facilities will be the mosque with about and the Hindu temple with about . Alevis, Christians and Buddhists claim space in the size of to . The public part with infrastructure, cafeteria, exhibition, course and event spaces comprise about .\n\n\"Förderverein Alevitische Kultur\" represents the Alevite faith. Primarily important is that people feel comfortable, and the ritual small fire pit will be a symbol of purity. In addition to the meeting and prayer room with seating for about 70 people, a children's corner. a library and a room for religious instruction and a kitchenette are provided, based on budget and furnishings collected amount.\n\nA member of the community told in an interview of the pitfalls when setting up the Buddhist rooms, which take place at least in the common building. In the entrance area is tiny temple, besides a small information room and a room with kitchen, where a teacher may also temporarily reside. The main room is kept simple: oiled oak floors, yellow walls and a -high scultpre of the Buddha from Thailand. So Buddhists of all currents should feel addressed. Aimed is a beautiful space, in which people in any way recognize and feel comfortable. The finances were decisive for the size of the room. Each square meter costs 110 Swiss Francs ia year, the monthly costs amount to approximately 2,000 Swiss Francs, which are paid with donations.\n\nInterested Christians, church communities, are involved since 2009 in the Club \"Kirche im Haus der Religionen\".\n\nThe Hindu temple of the \"Saivanerikoodam\" association was not yet finished in December 2014, but the interior rooms are shaped after the 'typical' South Indian temple architecture. For ten Hindu deities shrines are to be built, integrated into a temple of about . There are also rooms for seminars, yoga, meditation, and for cultural and language training for children and adolescents. Of central importance will be the vegetarian cuisine, which come into contact with either meat or animal products. For the entire interior decoration, the Hindu community expects costs of two million Swiss Francs.\n\nThe Muslims community is represented by \"Muslimischer Verein\", needing about as the second largest community.

Jaya and Vijaya, the gate keepers of the Vaikuntha interrupt the Kumaras at the gate, thinking them to be children. They also tell the Kumaras that Sri Vishnu is resting and that they cannot see him now. The enraged Kumaras replied Jaya and Vijaya that Vishnu is available for his devotees any time, and cursed both the keepers Jaya and Vijaya, that they would have to give up their divinity, be born as mortals on Earth (\"bhuloka\", or physical plane), and live like normal human beings. Vishnu appeared before them, and the gatekeepers requested Vishnu to lift the curse of the Kumaras. Vishnu said that the curse of the Kumaras cannot be reversed. Instead, he gives Jaya and Vijaya two options. The first option is to take seven births on Earth as a devotee of Vishnu, while the second is to take three births as his enemy. After serving either of these sentences, they can re-attain their stature at Vaikuntha and be with him permanently. Jaya and Vijaya cannot bear the thought of staying away from Vishnu for seven lives. As a result, they choose to be born three times on Earth even though it would have to be as enemies of Vishnu. (This story is also used as a metaphor about the cost of committing transgressions in \"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\".)\n\nIn the first life, they were born as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha in the Krita Yuga, to Diti (daughter of Daksha Prajapathi) and sage Kashyapa who were killed by Vishnu Varaha avatar (a boar) and Narasimha avatar (a man-lion) in the Satya Yuga.\n\nIn their second life, they were born as Ravana and Kumbhakarna and were killed by Vishnu's Rama avatar in the Treta Yuga.\n\nIn their third life, they were born as Shishupala and Dantavakra who were killed by Vishnu's Krishna avatar in the Dwapara Yuga.\n\nIt has been noted by many that the strengths of Jaya and Vijaya gradually declined with each subsequent birth. Vishnu needed one avatar each to kill Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. Born as Rama he was able to vanquish both Ravana and Kumbhakarna. In his Krishna avatar the killing of Shishupala and Dantavakra is not the main focus but more to reduce the 'Bhoobhara\" (The burden on mother earth by too many sinners).\n\nIn the modern era, known in Sanskrit as the Kali Yuga, Jaya and Vijaya are free from their curse, and they can be seen as gatekeepers in Vishnu temples and temples affiliated with Vaishnavism. Statues of Jaya-Vijaya stand in the temple of Venkateswara in Tirumala, the temple of Jagannath in Puri, and the temple of Ranganatha in Srirangam. \n\nAs Hirakyakasipu and Hiranyaksha in Satya-yuga, as Ravana and Kumbhakarna in the Treta-yuga, and as Shishupala and Dantavakra at the end of Dvapara-yuga.\n\n"}

Whitcomb\n\nJohn Clement Whitcomb, Jr. (born June 22, 1924 in Washington, D.C.) is an American theologian and young Earth creationist. He is well known as the co-author with Henry M. Morris of \"The Genesis Flood\", which influenced many conservative American Christians to adopt flood geology.\n\nWhitcomb was the son of an army officer. He lived in northern China between the ages of 3 and 6, and later attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His education at Princeton University was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the United States Army and served in Europe during World War II. While at Princeton, he converted to evangelical Christianity through the ministry of Donald B. Fullerton and the Princeton Christian Fellowship. He studied historical geology and paleontology for a year and graduated in 1948 with honors in ancient and European history. Thereafter he enrolled at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana, where he earned a B.D. degree in 1951, and remained at the seminary, teaching Old Testament and Hebrew, along with Young Earth Creationism.\nIn 1953, the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) held its annual conference at Grace. Whitcomb was especially impressed by Dr. Henry M. Morris' presentation defending Flood geology against day-age, ruin-restoration and pictorial-day views. The two found that they shared a belief in a literal six-day creation and a global Flood. Bernard Ramm's book \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\", which was published in 1954 and led to ASA rejection of Flood geology, impelled Whitcomb to devote his doctoral dissertation to rebutting Ramm and defending a literal interpretation of Genesis 6-9. Whitcomb polled Old Testament, archeology and apologetics scholars at evangelical schools, but although he found a wide range of viewpoints, he found little support for Flood geology. Whitcomb completed his dissertation on 'The Genesis Flood' in 1957.\n\nWhitcomb set about preparing his dissertation for publication, and sought somebody with a PhD in science to check or write the chapters on the scientific aspects of the Flood, but found himself unable to find any \"Ph.D.s in geology today who take Genesis 6-9 seriously.\" His work was viewed with disfavour even by Douglas A. Block, reputedly the only scientist at Wheaton College who held to the idea of a global Flood, who stated:\n\nWhitcomb accepted this criticism, being already aware that his inability to deal effectively with objections raised to Flood geology by ASA scientists was his \"greatest weakness\". He agreed to put off publication of the book to allow Morris to co-author chapters on scientific issues (including radioactivity, stratification and uniformitarianism).\n\n\"The Genesis Flood\", published by Whitcomb and Morris in 1961, \"became a best-seller in the Fundamentalist world and polarized Evangelical opinion\", though it was ignored by university scientists and liberal Christians. It was followed by the launch of the Creation Research Society in 1963 and of Morris' Institute for Creation Research in 1972. Ken Ham, the founder of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum near Cincinnati, credited \"The Genesis Flood\" for \"really launch[ing] the modern creationist movement around the world.\" \n\nWhitcomb taught at Grace Theological Seminary's Old Testament and Christian Theology departments from 1951 to 1990. He was dismissed amid several theological controversies. Whitcomb attributes his dismissal to Dave Plaster prohibiting him attending a meeting of Conservative Grace Brethren Association (of which Whitcomb was a member) in Orrville, Ohio, in January 1990. Whitcomb went, and upon his return was fired. He had shared concerns about theological drifts within the Seminary, especially in regards to Genesis 1).\n\nIn 1992, he was part of a split from the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, the denominational home both of himself and Grace Seminary, forming the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International. This occurred after the Conservative Grace Brethren Association (CGBA) had been denied a request to be a recognized as a Cooperating Agency with the FGBC at National Conference. Whitcomb held no official title within the organization.\n\nWhitcomb and his wife Norma reside in Indianapolis. He serves as President Emeritus of Whitcomb Ministries, Inc., and as a speaker for Answers in Genesis.\n\n"}

Each person has to decide for themselves whether to have this thing in their lives or not. I value love and connection and friendship and community. I want to encourage more creativity, joy, and peace in my life. Porn is opposed to all of that. I stand strong with anyone choosing to get porn out of their lives.\"\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film \"The Seeker\" in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out.

{"id": "23151106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23151106", "title": "Lakas–CMD", "text": "Lakas–CMD\n\nLakas–CMD (Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats) is a center-right political party in the Philippines, with influence of Christian democracy and Islamic democracy. The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the original Lakas–CMD party with the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI); it was known as Lakas–Kampi–CMD until 2012. The party produced one president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.\n\nWith Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the 2010 presidential election with Gilberto Teodoro as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two senators, both incumbents, in the Senate election and became a part of the Liberal Party-led majority coalition; in the House of Representatives election, it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the National Unity Party, and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition. Lakas–CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition. In 2013, Sen. Bong Revilla assumed the new chairman of Lakas party. He is supposed to be the standard bearer of the party in the 2016 Presidential Election prior to his detainment at PNP custodial center at Camp Crame due to pork barrel allegations.\n\nLakas–CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the United States, creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present presidential system to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with Muslim separatists and communist rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.\n\nLakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the 1992 elections as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, Fidel V. Ramos and former Cebu Governor Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osmeña were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker Ramon Mitra.\n\nThe party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD) of Raul Manglapus. As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-National Union of Christian Democrats, with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.\n\nIn 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the 1995 legislative elections. This coalition, dubbed the \"Lakas-Laban Coalition\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. of Pangasinan after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary Renato de Villa as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President Joseph Estrada in the 1998 elections. By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (UMDP) of former ambassasor to Egypt and Oman Sanchez A. Ali to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (Lakas-NUCD-UMDP).\n\nSecretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma (Democratic Reform Party) for the 1998 elections. Lakas also nominated then-Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of Pampanga as its candidate as vice president. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\n\nIn the 2004 elections, the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas–CMD. However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng EDSA\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\" This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition. President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President Joseph Estrada, was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily Fernando Poe, Jr. and Senator Panfilo Lacson.\n\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas–CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President Fidel V. Ramos. Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\n\nThere are no official results available of the 2007 elections released by the party but according to the Philippine House of Representatives, the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel Raul Lambino stated that Lakas–CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators Ramon Revilla, Jr. and Lito Lapid, former senator Ralph Recto and former Congressman Prospero Pichay as among those considered.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Jose de Venecia, Jr. (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas–CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president Fidel Ramos to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House Prospero Nograles (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas–CMD party and former Speaker of the house Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.\n\nPresident Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical merger of the Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas–CMD) and the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the \"equity of the incumbent\" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of 2010 elections victory. Prospero Nograles, Lakas President and Kampi Chair Ronaldo Puno signed the covenant at the Davao City regional caucus. Former President and Lakas–CMD Chairman Emeritus Fidel V. Ramos announced on February 6, 2008 that Lakas–CMD would be the surviving entity after its merger with KAMPI.\n\nOn August 9, 2009, Former House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. and Former President Fidel V. Ramos led fifty members from the Lakas Kampi CMD in objecting to its merger with Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI) on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as the Chairman Emeritus of the new party, Ramos refused the offer of Chairman Emeritus of Lakas-Kampi after being named in interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the Commission on Elections to declare \"null and void\" the merger. However, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the legality of the merger, citing the failure of de Venecia \"to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Commission on Elections in rendering the challenged resolution.\"\n\nSince Benigno Aquino III was sworn in as President of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, the majority of the former legislative member of Lakas-Kampi were sworn as a members of the reborn Liberal Party. In 2011, the legislators led by Pablo P. Garcia established the neutral National Unity Party, which has many similarities with the Nationalist People's Coalition. In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due to the arrest of the party's matriarch, Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the United Nationalist Alliance, with candidates from among its former members such as Migz Zubiri, Richard Gordon and Mitos Magsaysay.\n\nIn the 2016 Presidential Elections, Lakas supports the candidacy of Rodrigo \"Rody/Digong\" Duterte and Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr. for President and Vice President respectively, which Duterte won and Marcos lost to Liberal Party candidate Ma. Leonora \"Leni\" Robredo. In July 2017, Revilla was sworn into Duterte's party PDP-Laban, and in October, Macapagal Arroyo and her allies, also joins PDP-Laban, as a result Lakas has been dissolved.\n\nIn September 2018 House Minority Leader and Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez announced that Lakas-CMD is rebuilding and \"will soon regain the political dominance it lost after Arroyo stepped down as president in 2010.\"\n\n\n\nSenatorial Slate (6)\n\nSenatorial Slate\n\nThis chart shows the electoral performance of the Lakas Kampi CMD in Senate elections since 2010.\nThis chart shows the electoral performance of the Lakas Kampi CMD in House of Representatives elections since 2010.\n"}

These deities can have a variety of functions and traditions depending upon the culture, but they are often related. Some form of moon worship can be found in most ancient religions.\n\nThe monthly cycle of the moon, in contrast to the annual cycle of the sun's path, has been implicitly linked to women's menstrual cycles by many cultures, as evident in the links between the words for menstruation and for moon in many resultant languages. Many of the most well-known mythologies feature female lunar deities, such as the Greek goddesses Phoebe, Artemis, Selene, and Hecate as well as the Chinese goddess Chang'e.\n\nMale lunar gods are also frequent, such as Sin of the Mesopotamians, Mani of the Germanic tribes, and the Japanese god Tsukuyomi. These cultures usually featured female Sun goddesses. There are also many lunar deities that were prevalent in Greek and Egyptian civilizations. For example, Ibis and Chonsu of Thebes were both lunar deities. Thoth was also a lunar deity, but his character is considerably more complex than Ibis and Chonsu. Set represented the Moon in the Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of papyrus Cairo 86637.\n\nThe original Proto-Indo-European lunar deity appears to have been a male god. Several goddesses, like Artemis or Hecate, did not originally have lunar aspects, and only acquired them late in antiquity, due to syncretism with Selene/Luna, the de facto Greco-Latin lunar deity. In traditions with male gods, there is little evidence of such syncretism, though the Greco-Roman Hermes has been equated with male Egyptian lunar gods like Thoth. In Greece proper, remnants of male moon gods are also seen with Menelaus.\n\nAlso of significance is that many religions and societies are oriented chronologically by the moon, as opposed to the sun. One common example is Hinduism in which the word Chandra means \"moon\" and has religious significance during many Hindu festivals (e.g. Karwa Chauth, Sankasht Chaturthi, and during the eclipses).\n\nThe moon is also worshipped in witchcraft, both in its modern form, and in medieval times (e.g. in the cult of Madonna Oriente). The moon features prominently in art and literature, and also has a purported influence in human affairs, a belief that consistently remains a feature of astrology and theology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The story is sometimes called The Return of Lugalbanda or Lugalbanda II being the second of two stories about the hero Lugalbanda. The first story is known as \"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave\", or sometimes \"Lugalbanda in the Wilderness\". They are part of a four-story cycle that describes the conflicts between Enmerkar, king of Unug (Uruk), and the king of Aratta. The texts are believed to be composed during the Ur III Period (21st century BCE), but almost all of the extant copies come from Isin-Larsa period (20th-18th centuries BCE). Nevertheless, a few fragmentary bilingual copies (Sumerian and Akkadian) from Nineveh suggest that the texts were still known during the first millennium.\n\nThis story starts with Lugalbanda alone in the highlands of Lullubi. He finds the chick of the giant Anzu (or Anzud) bird, which is described as a lion-headed eagle, and decides to feed the chick. When the Anzu bird returns, it is first startled by the chick not responding to its call, but once it finds out what happened, it is very pleased with Lugalbanda and in appreciation grants him the ability to travel at super speeds. With his newly gained super power Lugalbanda catches up with his comrades who are laying siege to the city of Aratta. But his king Enmerkar is facing problems with the siege and after a year of setbacks without success, decides to seek the advice of the goddess Inana who is back in Uruk (in the story referred to as Unug or Kulaba), pleading for her to assist him once more, as she had assisted in building a wall against the encroaching Martu in the 50th year of his reign. Finally Lugalbanda volunteers for the trip. Lugalbanda is able to travel the incredible distance over seven mountain ranges within a day's time. Inanna responds with a parable instructing Enmerkar how to wrest control of Aratta and its resources.\n\n"}

Manikeswari is also the primary deity associated with the royal family of Paralakhemundi in Gajapati. Chhatar Jatra is one of the most popoular festival of Manikeswari at Bhawanipatna. Khandasadhaka is a festival associated with Manikeswari in Paralakhemundi.\n\nThe deity of Chakrakotamandala comprising present days Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar was Manikya debi or Manikeswari around 10th century A.D. Later on Kalahandi king Harichandra Deo struggled and died because of which his pregnant queen left for her father’s house in Gadapur, Phulbani. Some part of Phulbani was part of Mahakantara in ancient time and Chakrakota Mandala. Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala, another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala. Later on, queen along with her son, Ramchandra Deo returned with Manikya Debi or Manikeswari as per Kalahandi’s public request that time. Manikeswari was brought from Gadapur (Phulbani) around 1200 A.D and it was located in Kalahandi. Manikeswari was also popularized by Suryabansi Gajapati in 15th -16th century in Puri region. Purushottam Dev Gajapati considered Manikeswari as consort of Lord Jagannath and made a shrine of Manikeswari at Chilika, now doesn’t exist. Manikeswari is royal family deity of Parlakhemundi. Manikeswari was installed in Bhawanipatna much later around 1849 AD during shifting of the capital from Junagarh. Some people also mention Manikeswari in Thumaul Rampur as Adipitha and Devi was brought to Bhawanipatna from there. Uditnarayan Deo laid the foundation of the present modern temple in Bhawanipatna and it was completed in 1947 by Brajamohan Deo. Manikeswari was associated with Kalahandi history as a goddess of wealth, Manik, since 10th century. There is some debate to relate Manikeswari with Stambeswari temple in Asurgarh-Narla around 5-6th century as well as Maningeeswari in Banapur in Puri. There are many Manikeswari worshiping locations in many place of Orissa and Chhattisgarh, especially in undivided districts of Koraput, Phulbani-Boudh, Bolangir-Sonepur, Ganjam-Gajapati, Angul-Dhenkanal, Keonjhar, Sundergarh, etc. due to influence by various rulers. Though Manikeswari has lots of historical significance in Orissa and Chhattisgarh, it is not yet fully come to lime light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year a festival called “Chhatar Jatra” at a particular time is organised and many people who have fulfilled wishes come and sacrifice animals in the name of goddess.\nChatar jatra is celebrated during September–October, Durga Puja, in Bhawanipatna.\n"}

Another word for mystagogue is hierophant.\n\nIn ancient mystery religions, a mystagogue would be responsible for leading an initiate into the secret teachings and rituals of a cultus. The initiate would often be blindfolded, and the mystagogue would literally \"guide\" him into the sacred space.\n\nIn the early Christian church, this same concept was used to describe role of the bishop, who was responsible for seeing to it that the catechumens were properly prepared for baptism. Mystagogical homilies, or homilies that dealt with the Church's sacraments, were given to those in the last stages of preparation for full Church membership. Sometimes these mystagogical instructions were not given until after the catechumen had been baptized. The most famous of these mystagogical works are the \"Mystagogical Homilies\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, and the work, \"On the Mysteries\" by St. Ambrose of Milan.\n\nIn various organizations, it is the role of the mystagogue to \"mystify\" pledges. The term is sometimes used to refer to a person who guides people through religious sites, such as churches, and explains the various artifacts. This branch of theology is at times called mystagogy. \n\nIn the United States versions of mystagogical legends predate European contact. Early Native American tribes around the Great Lakes region, taught that the mystagogue was a spiritual leader, and upon death would transform into a beast with many heads. The mystagogue would reappear in his beastly form and feed on those who strayed from the tribe if it was not in keeping with their religious customs.\n\nThe historical tradition of the mystagogue has carried on today in one way through the fraternity system in American universities, that have historically held a position for a mystagogue at either the chapter or the national level. The mystagogue is a person of great respect, and his knowledge concerning both the physical and spiritual matters of the organization is not questioned. In a way similar to that of some Native American traditions, the mystagogue in the fraternity system has the power to shut down parts of the fraternity which are not in keeping with customs or tradition.\n\nMax Weber, considered to be one of the founders of the modern study of sociology, described the mystagogue as part magician and part prophet, and as one who dispensed \"magical actions that contain the boons of salvation.\" \n\nAccording to Roy Wallis, \"The primary criterion that Weber had in mind in distinguishing the \"prophet\" from the \"mystagogue\" was that the latter offers a largely magical means of salvation rather than proclaiming a radical religious ethic or an example to be followed.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "320696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320696", "title": "Radclyffe Hall", "text": "Radclyffe Hall\n\nMarguerite Radclyffe Hall (12 August 1880 – 7 October 1943) was an English poet and author. She is best known for the novel \"The Well of Loneliness\", a groundbreaking work in lesbian literature.\n\nMarguerite Radclyffe Hall was born in 1880 at \"Sunny Lawn\", Durley Road, Bournemouth, Hampshire (now Dorset), to a wealthy philandering father, Radclyffe Radclyffe-Hall, and an unstable mother, Mary Jane Diehl. Her stepfather was the professor of singing Albert Visetti, whom she did not like and who had a tempestuous relationship with her mother. Hall was a lesbian and described herself as a \"congenital invert\", a term taken from the writings of Havelock Ellis and other turn-of-the-century sexologists. Having reached adulthood without a vocation, she spent much of her twenties pursuing women she eventually lost to marriage.\n\nIn 1907 at the Bad Homburg spa in Germany, Hall met Mabel Batten, a well-known amateur singer of lieder. Batten (nicknamed \"Ladye\") was 51 to Hall's 27, and was married with an adult daughter and grandchildren. They fell in love, and after Batten's husband died they set up residence together. Batten gave Hall the nickname John, which she used the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1915 Hall fell in love with Mabel Batten's cousin Una Troubridge (1887–1963), a sculptor who was the wife of Vice-Admiral Ernest Troubridge, and the mother of a young daughter. When Batten died in 1916, Hall had Batten's corpse embalmed and a silver crucifix blessed by the pope laid on it. Hall, Batten and Troubridge were \"undeterred by the Church's admonitions on same-sex relationships. Hall's Catholicism sat beside a life-long attachment to spiritualism and reincarnation.\" In 1917, Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge began living together. From 1924 to 1929 they lived at 37 Holland Street, Kensington, London.\n\nThe relationship would last until Hall's death. In 1934 Hall fell in love with Russian émigrée Evguenia Souline and embarked upon a long-term affair with her, which Troubridge painfully tolerated. Hall became involved in affairs with other women throughout the years.\n\nHall lived with Troubridge in London and, during the 1930s, in the tiny town of Rye, East Sussex, noted for its many writers, including her contemporary the novelist E. F. Benson. Hall died at age 63 of colon cancer, and is interred at Highgate Cemetery in North London at the entrance of the chamber of the Batten family, where Mabel is buried as well.\n\nIn 1930, Hall received the Gold Medal of the Eichelbergher Humane Award. She was a member of the PEN club, the Council of the Society for Psychical Research and a fellow of the Zoological Society. Radclyffe Hall was listed at number sixteen in the top 500 lesbian and gay heroes in \"The Pink Paper\".\n\nHall's first novel was \"The Unlit Lamp\", the story of Joan Ogden, a young girl who dreams of setting up a flat in London with her friend Elizabeth (a so-called Boston marriage) and studying to become a doctor, but feels trapped by her manipulative mother's emotional dependence on her. Its length and grimness made it a difficult book to sell, so she deliberately chose a lighter theme for her next novel, a social comedy entitled \"The Forge\". While she had used her full name for her early poetry collections, she shortened it to M. Radclyffe Hall for \"The Forge\". The book was a modest success, making the bestseller list of \"John O'London's Weekly\". \"The Unlit Lamp\", which followed it into print, was the first of her books to give the author's name simply as Radclyffe Hall.\n\nThere followed another comic novel, \"A Saturday Life\" (1925), and then \"Adam's Breed\" (1926), a novel about an Italian headwaiter who, becoming disgusted with his job and even with food itself, gives away his belongings and lives as a hermit in the forest. The book's mystical themes have been compared to Hermann Hesse's \"Siddhartha\". It sold well, was critically acclaimed, and won both the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize, a feat previously achieved only by E. M. Forster's \"A Passage to India\".\n\nHall's best-known work was \"The Well of Loneliness\", the only one of her eight novels to have overt lesbian themes. Published in 1928, \"The Well of Loneliness\" deals with the life of Stephen Gordon, a masculine lesbian who, like Hall herself, identifies as an \"invert\".\n\nAlthough \"The Well of Loneliness\" is not sexually explicit, it was nevertheless the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK, which resulted in all copies of the novel being ordered destroyed. The United States allowed its publication only after a long court battle. It is currently published in the UK by Virago, and by Anchor Press in the United States. \"The Well of Loneliness\" was number seven on a list of the top 100 lesbian and gay novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.\n\nAn anonymous verse lampoon entitled \"The Sink of Solitude\" appeared during the controversy over \"The Well\". Although its primary targets were James Douglas, who had called for \"The Well\"s suppression, and the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks, who had started legal proceedings, it also mocked Hall and her book. One of the illustrations, which depicted Hall nailed to a cross, so horrified her that she could barely speak of it for years afterward. Her sense of guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, \"The Master of the House\".\n\nAt Hall's insistence, \"The Master of the House\" was published with no cover blurb, which may have misled some purchasers into thinking it was another novel about \"inversion\". Advance sales were strong, and the book made No. 1 on \"The Observer\"s bestseller list, but it received poor reviews in several key periodicals, and sales soon dropped off. In the United States reviewers treated the book more kindly, but shortly after the book's publication, all copies were seized—not by the police, but by creditors. Hall's American publisher had gone bankrupt. Houghton Mifflin took over the rights, but by the time the book could be republished, its sales momentum was lost.\n\nBritish composer and \"bon vivant\" Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners, wrote a \"roman à clef\" girls' school story entitled \"The Girls of Radcliff Hall\", in which he depicts himself and his circle of friends, including Cecil Beaton and Oliver Messel, as lesbian schoolgirls at a school named \"Radcliff Hall\". The novel was written under the pseudonym \"Adela Quebec\" and published and distributed privately; the indiscretions to which it alluded created an uproar among Berners's intimates and acquaintances, making the whole affair highly discussed in the 1930s. Cecil Beaton attempted to have all the copies destroyed. The novel subsequently disappeared from circulation, making it extremely rare. The story is, however, included in Berners' \"Collected Tales and Fantasies\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26037", "title": "Reconstructionist Judaism", "text": "Reconstructionist Judaism\n\nReconstructionist Judaism ( or ) is a modern Jewish movement that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization and is based on the conceptions developed by Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983). The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, before it seceded in 1955 and established a rabbinical college in 1967.\n\nThere is substantial theological diversity within the movement. \"Halakha\", the collective body of Jewish Law, is not considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. The movement also emphasizes positive views toward modernity, and has an approach to Jewish custom which aims toward communal decision-making through a process of education and distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources.\n\nReconstructionism was developed by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983) and his son-in-law, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein (1906–2001), over a period of time spanning from the late 1920s to the 1940s. After being ridiculed by Orthodox rabbis for his focus on issues in the community and the sociopolitical environment, Kaplan and a group of followers founded the Society for the Advancement of Judaism (SAJ) in 1922. Its goal was to give rabbis the opportunity to form new outlooks on Judaism in a more progressive manner. Kaplan was the leader of the SAJ until 1945, when Eisenstein took over. In 1935, Kaplan published his book, \"Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American Jewish Life\". It was this book that Kaplan claimed was the beginning of the Reconstructionist movement. \"Judaism as a Civilization\" suggested that historical Judaism be given a \"revaluation… in terms of present-day thought.\" Reconstructionism was able to spread with several other forms of literature, most notably the \"New Haggadah\" (1941) which for the first time blended Kaplan's ideologies in Jewish ceremonial literature.\n\nAlthough Kaplan did not want Reconstructionism to branch into another Jewish denomination, it was on the inevitable track of becoming one. At the Montreal conference in 1967, Reconstructionist leaders called for a rabbinical school in which rabbis could be ordained under the Reconstructionist ideology and lead Reconstructionist congregations. By the fall of 1968, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College was opened in Philadelphia. Along with the establishment of the college, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association formed, which gave rabbis a strong network in the religious leadership of Reconstructionism. The founding of these institutions were great strides in its becoming the fourth movement in North American Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative and Reform being the other three).\n\nReconstructionist Judaism is the first major movement of Judaism to originate in North America; the second is the Humanistic Judaism movement founded in 1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine.\n\nKaplan believed that, in light of advances in philosophy, science and history, it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's traditional theological claims. In agreement with Orthodox theology (articulated by prominent medieval Jewish thinkers including Maimonides), Kaplan affirmed that God is not anthropomorphic in any way. As such, all anthropomorphic descriptions of God are used metaphorically. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that God is not personal, in that God is not a conscious being nor can God in any way relate to or communicate with humanity. Furthermore, Kaplan's theology defines God as the sum of all natural processes that allow people to become self-fulfilled.\n\nTo believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.\n\nMost \"classical\" Reconstructionist Jews (those agreeing with Kaplan) reject traditional forms of theism, though this is by no means universal. Many are deists, and a small number accept Kabbalistic views of God or the concept of a personal God.\n\nKaplan's theology, as he explicitly stated, does not represent the only Reconstructionist understanding of theology and theology is not the cornerstone of the Reconstructionist movement. Much more central is the idea that Judaism is a civilization, and that the Jewish people must take an active role in ensuring its future by participating in its ongoing evolution.\n\nConsequently, a strain of Reconstructionism exists which is distinctly non-Kaplanian. In this view, Kaplan's assertions concerning belief and practice are largely rejected, while the tenets of an \"evolving religious civilization\" are supported. The basis for this approach is that Kaplan spoke for his generation; he also wrote that every generation would need to define itself and its civilization for itself. In the thinking of these Reconstructionists, what Kaplan said concerning belief and practice is not applicable today. This approach may include a belief in a personal God, acceptance of the concept of \"chosenness\", a belief in some form of resurrection or continued existence of the dead, and the existence of an obligatory form of \"halakha\". In the latter, in particular, there has developed a broader concept of \"halakhah\" wherein concepts such as \"Eco-Kashrut\" are incorporated.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism holds that contemporary Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law and theology. It does not ask that its adherents hold to any particular beliefs, nor does it ask that halakha be accepted as normative. Unlike classical Reform Judaism, Reconstructionism holds that a person's default position should be to incorporate Jewish laws and tradition into their lives, unless they have a specific reason to do otherwise. The most important distinction between Reconstructionist Judaism and traditional Judaism is that Reconstructionism concludes that all halakha should be categorized as \"folkways\" and not as religious law.\n\nReconstructionism promotes many traditional Jewish practices. Thus, the commandments have been replaced with \"folkways\", non-binding customs that can be democratically accepted or rejected by the congregations. Folkways that are promoted include keeping Hebrew in the prayer service, studying Torah, daily prayer, wearing \"kippot\" (\"yarmulkes\"), \"tallitot\" and \"tefillin\" during prayer, and observance of the Jewish holidays.\n\nIn practice, Kaplan's books, especially \"The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion\" and \"Judaism as a Civilization\" are \"de facto\" statements of principles. In 1986, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) and the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) passed the official \"Platform on Reconstructionism\". It is not a mandatory statement of principles, but rather a consensus of current beliefs. Major points of the platform state that:\n\nMost Reconstructionists do not believe in revelation (the idea that God reveals his will to human beings). This is dismissed as supernaturalism. Kaplan posits that revelation \"consists in disengaging from the traditional context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology…the rest may be relegated to archaeology\".\n\nMany writers have criticized the movement's most widely held theology, religious naturalism. David Ray Griffin and Louis Jacobs have objected to the redefinitions of the terms \"revelation\" and \"God\" as being intellectually dishonest, and as being a form of \"conversion by definition\"; in their critique, these redefinitions take non-theistic beliefs and attach theistic terms to them. Similar critiques have been put forth by Rabbis Neil Gillman, Milton Steinberg, and Michael Samuels.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism is egalitarian with respect to gender roles. All positions are open to all genders; they are open to lesbians, gay men, and transgender individuals as well.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism allows its rabbis to determine their own policy regarding officiating at intermarriages. Some congregations accept patrilineal as well as matrilineal descent, and children of one Jewish parent, of any gender, are considered Jewish by birth if raised as Jews. This contrasts with the traditional interpretations of Jewish law of both Rabbinical Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its mother was Jewish; and of Karaite Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its \"father\" was Jewish.\n\nThe role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is a matter of ongoing debate. Practices vary between synagogues. Most congregations strive to strike a balance between inclusivity and integrity of boundaries. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately decided by local lay leadership. Mixed Jewish/Non-Jewish couples, however, are welcome in Reconstructionist congregations.\n\nIn 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners. In making the decision, the movement considered that “many younger progressive Jews, including many rabbis and rabbinical students, now perceive restrictions placed on those who are intermarried as reinforcing a tribalism that feels personally alienating and morally troubling in the 21st century.” In April 2016 nineteen Reconstructionist rabbis announced they will form an offshoot group in part to protest the decision to allow rabbis to have non-Jewish partners.\n\nOver 100 synagogues and \"havurot\", mostly in the United States and Canada, were affiliated with the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. As of June 3, 2012 the Reconstructionist movement has been restructured. A joint institution consisting of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and the congregational organization is now the primary organization of the movement. The movement's new designation was first \"Jewish Reconstructionist Communities,\" and in 2018 became \"Reconstructing Judaism.\" Rabbi Deborah Waxman was inaugurated as the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and Jewish Reconstructionist Communities on October 26, 2014. As the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary. Waxman is a 1999 graduate of RRC.\nThe Reconstructionist Rabbinical College educates rabbis. The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association is the professional organization of Reconstructionist rabbis. The Jewish Reconstructionist youth organization is named No'ar Hadash.\n\nOriginally an offshoot of Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionism retains warm relations with Reform Judaism. Orthodox Judaism, however, considers Reconstructionism to be in violation of proper observance of interpretation of Jewish law. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation is a member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, in which it gained an observer status in 1990.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49050369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49050369", "title": "Religion and video games", "text": "Religion and video games\n\nThe study of religion and video games is a subfield of digital religion, which the American scholar of communication, Heidi Campbell, defines as \"Religion that is constituted in new ways through digital media and cultures.\" (Campbell, 2012, p. 3). Video games once struggled for legitimacy as a cultural product, today, however, they are both business and art. Video games increasingly turn to religion not just as ornament but as core elements of their video game design and play.\n\nReligion has several definitions. Religions that are organized can be seen as cultural systems, with corresponding behavior and practice. They often have sacred texts and holy places. A religious experience, however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.\n\nThemes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are existential in nature; while they are not immediately understood as \"religious\", they are about the meaning of life.\n\nVideo game developers use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game. Video game developer Shigeru Miyamoto, who used to play outside as a child, used his experiences and memories of exploring the forest and discovering a Buddhist temple in the design of his video games. Canadian developer BioWare (\"Mass Effect\", \"Dragon Age\") has in its offices several encyclopedias on religion, as well as the Book of the Dead.\n\nThe negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.\n\nReligious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other. Religion in \"Mass Effect\", for instance, can be understood as an \"unseen character\".\n\nAn explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring. These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, motifs and names of characters from religious texts are used as reference points.\n\nAncient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like ancient Greek religion. In the real-time strategy game \"Age of Mythology\" the player has to choose a \"major god\", which gives certain gameplay benefits. In \"Prince of Persia\" the nameless Prince has to fight Ahriman, an evil deity from Zoroastrianism.\n\nReal world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while \"Assassin's Creed\" (2007) is fictional, it is set during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land; the player takes on the role of the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims. While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a \"sanitized manner\".\n\nReligion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the \"Megami Tensei\" series involve a religion, or a cult.\n\nIn the action role-playing game \"\" (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks. The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood. The Empire suffered a defeat against the powerful Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of Elves who have made the worship of Talos illegal. It is up to the player to help in the conflict.\n\nThe stories of action-adventure and role-playing games often involve world-saving quests. The player, as the protagonist, takes on the role of the hero. The player character is often destined to save the world, which in itself is a prophecy.\n\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" uses religious elements and motifs like the Triforce.\n\nPlayers and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like \"Journey\" (2012). Developer Jenova Chen said that \"I feel that \"Journey\" is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with \"Journey\"—this is because many religions partly share a common structure\". Chen said \"Journey\" is based upon Joseph Campbell's book on comparative mythology \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" and the \"Hero's Journey\" narrative structure.\n\nAfter the death of Leonard Nimoy, \"Star Trek Online\" added two statues in his honor, and \"World of Warcraft\" added a non-player character (NPC) based upon Robin Williams after his death. Developer Gearbox Software honored a late fan of \"Borderlands\", cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, by adding a NPC named after him in the sequel. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character Claptrap. For their game \"MechWarrior Online\", developer Piranha Games sold a custom in-game unit called a Jenner, honoring the daughter of a player of the game. CAD122,210 was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society. Losing his wife Pauline to ovarian cancer, \"Minecraft\" player \"GasBandit\" built a memorial for her. When players of the online game \"Final Fantasy XIV\" heard that fellow gamer \"Codex Vahla\" was in the hospital on life support, they held a digital wake.\n\nSome religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game \"\".\nIn May 2012, the Exeter Cathedral used \"Flower\" during its Sunday service.\n\nOpinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are banned for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like \"Journey\" Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment. As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series \"Final Fantasy\" were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's PlayStation with \"Final Fantasy VII\" (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact. Ubisoft's \"Assassin's Creed\" series show a disclaimer: \n\nDespite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games. The German video game rating board USK gave \"The Binding of Isaac\" a 16+ rating, considering it \"blasphemous\".\n\nThe game \"BioShock Infinite\" is heavily based on the notion of American exceptionalism at the turn of the 19th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of baptism. One developer on Irrational Games staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, Ken Levine, that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet. At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from Steam. The scene was otherwise well received by critics as less a commentary on Christianity but on as a representation of themes such as free will, evil, rebirth and redemption that were central to the game.\n\nOn October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that \"Fallout 3\" would not be released in India on the Xbox 360 platform. Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason. Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that Brahmin is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of Hindu priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of brahman, a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of Zebu, are revered by Hindus.\n\nThe action game \"Hanuman: Boy Warrior\" was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity Hanuman. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. \"Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration\", said Zed. \"Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India.\" He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that \"Hanuman: Boy Warrior\" sold beyond their expectations.\n\nZed was also critical of the use of Hindu deities in the MOBA game \"Smite\". In response, developer Hi-Rez Studios COO Todd Harris said that \"Smite\" would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that \"the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay\".\n\n\"LittleBigPlanet\" (2008) had a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack, after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licensed songs in the game included passages from the Qur'an and could therefore be offensive to Muslims. However, no actual complaints regarding the music were made. The song, entitled \"Tapha Niang\", was by Malian artist Toumani Diabaté, himself a devout Muslim. The game was patched twice, the day before its release for players who had received the game early, before its intended release date. The first update did not affect the song, whilst the second updated the game to remove the vocals from the track, leaving only an instrumental. Some American Muslims responded to the recall and stated that they were offended by the restriction of freedom of speech. M. Zuhdi Jasser M.D., head of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, was quoted as saying, \"Muslims cannot benefit from freedom of expression and religion and then turn around and ask that anytime their sensibilities are offended that the freedom of others be restricted.\"\n\nThe fighting game \"\" was temporarily banned in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Originally, the title of the game was rebranded as \"Injustice: The Mighty Among Us\" for promotional uses in those areas. It is speculated that \"Injustice\" was banned because of the inclusion of the word 'Gods' in the title, the cleavage exposed in the outfits of some female characters, and overall bloodiness. Eventually, the ban in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was lifted.\n\n\"\" (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of Sikhs within a depiction of their most holy site, the Harmandir Sahib, where hundreds of Sikhs were massacred in 1984. An altered version of \"Silent Assassin\" was eventually released with the related material removed from the game.\n\nA study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion. Researcher Greg Perreault said \"It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines\".\n\nFor many years video games were seen as mere entertainment, a form of \"low culture\". Playing video games was seen as a form of escapism and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To \"play\" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as \"ludicrous\". It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study. Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an object, while actor-focused research looks at the player.\n\nVideo games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as \"texts\". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created. By \"reading\" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games. This can be done in several ways.\n\n\nVideo games are interactive; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game \"happen\". As such, it is up to individual player to give meaning to their experience.\n\nVideo games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters. Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character Commander Shepard of the \"Mass Effect\" series an atheist, while others thought of him/her as a Christian. As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.\n\n"}

Along with sacramental wine, it is one of two \"elements\" of the Eucharist. The bread may be either leavened or unleavened (appearing as a wafer), depending on tradition. Eastern and Western traditions both require that it be made from wheat.\n\nRoman Catholic theology generally teaches that at the Words of Institution the bread is changed into the Body of Christ (see transubstantiation), whereas Eastern Christian theology generally views the epiclesis as the point at which the change occurs. Some Protestants believe transignification occurs at the Words of Institution.\n\nThe word \"host\" is derived from the Latin \"hostia\", which means \"sacrificial victim.\" The term can be used to describe the bread both before and after consecration, though it is more correct to use it after consecration. Prior to consecration, the term \"altar bread\" is preferred. The sacrifice of Jesus according to Christian theology puts an end to the need for animal sacrifice as had been practiced in the Jerusalem Temple and all blood sacrifice once-for-all. However the word was retained to describe the bread of Eucharist as a liturgical representation of the Christ's sacrifice.\n\nWith the exception of Churches of the Armenian Rite, Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist. Thus, the sacramental bread symbolizes the Resurrected Christ. The \"hostia\" or sacramental bread, known as \"prosphorá\" or a πρόσφορον (\"prósphoron\", \"offering\") may be made out of only four ingredients: fine (white) wheat flour, pure water, yeast, and salt. Sometimes holy water will be either sprinkled into the dough or on the kneading trough at the beginning of the process.\n\nBecause leaven is symbolic of sin, the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church traditionally offer unleavened bread (although it is distinctively different from the kind used by the Roman Catholic Church) to symbolize the sinlessness of Christ.\n\nThe baking may only be performed by a believing Orthodox Christian in good standing—having preferably been recently to Confession, and is accompanied by prayer and fasting. Before baking, each loaf is formed by placing two disks of dough, one on top of the other, and stamping it with a special liturgical seal. The prosphora should be fresh and not stale or moldy when presented at the altar for use in the Divine Liturgy. Often several prosphora will be baked and offered by the faithful, and the priest chooses the best one for the Lamb (Host) that will be consecrated. The remaining loaves are blessed and offered back to the congregation after the end of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist); this bread is called the \"antidoron\" (Greek: αντίδωρον, \"antídōron\"), i.e. a \"gift returned,\" or \"in place of the gifts.\"\n\nThe Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches (like the Eastern Orthodox Church) use leavened bread for Prosphora (the Greek word for Eucharistic altar bread).\n\nThe Syro-Malabar Church and the Maronite Church have adopted the use of unleavened bread due to Liturgical Latinisation.\n\nA Host is a portion of bread used for Holy Communion in many Christian churches. In Western Christianity the host is often a thin, round unleavened wafer.\n\nIn the Roman Rite, unleavened bread is used as in the Jewish Passover or Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Code of Canon Law, Canon 924 requires that the hosts be made from wheat flour and water only and recently made so that there is no danger of spoiling.\n\nHosts are often made by nuns as a means of supporting their religious communities. However, in New Zealand, the St Vincent de Paul Society hires individuals with intellectual disabilities to bake, cut out and sort the bread, thereby offering paid employment to those who wouldn't have that option otherwise.\n\nThe General Instruction of the Roman Missal §321 recommends that \"the eucharistic bread ... be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful. ... The action of the fraction or breaking of bread, which gave its name to the Eucharist in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters.\"\n\nIn 1995 Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, then Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, wrote a letter to the Episcopal Conferences in which he expanded the Code of Canon Law, stating that low-gluten bread would be considered “valid matter” for hosts as long as no additional substances “alter[ed] the nature of the substance of the bread.” Since the 2000s, hosts with low gluten content have been manufactured in the United States, especially in parts of Missouri and New York. Hosts are one of the causes of lack of recovery for people with celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet, which must be strict and maintained for life to allow the recovery of the intestinal mucosa and reduce the risk of developing severe health complications.\n\nIn the varying Protestant denominations, there is a wide variety of practices concerning the sacramental bread used. Some, such as the Christian Congregation use leavened loaves of bread, others, such as Lutherans, continue to use unleavened wafers like the Roman Catholics, and some use matzo. Reformed Christians use rolls which are broken and distributed to symbolize their belief that Christ is . Among those who use the unleavened wafers, there is a great deal of variation: some are square or triangular rather than round, and may even be made out of whole wheat flour.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) has no strict rules on the type of bread used for sacramental purposes. Latter-day Saint scriptures state: \"For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory—remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 27:2) Different congregations may use either commercial bread or homemade bread prepared by members of the congregation. It is permissible to substitute rice cakes or other gluten-free breads for members who suffer from food allergies. The bread is broken into fragments just prior to being blessed by one of the officiating priests.\n\nIn Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, sacramental bread (referred to as sacred communion wafers) is used to ward off vampires.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2605527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2605527", "title": "T. C. Lethbridge", "text": "T. C. Lethbridge\n\nThomas Charles Lethbridge (23 March 1901 – 30 September 1971), better known as T. C. Lethbridge, was an English archaeologist, parapsychologist, and explorer. A specialist in Anglo-Saxon archaeology, he served as honorary Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology from 1923 to 1957, and over the course of his lifetime wrote twenty-four books on various subjects, becoming particularly well known for his advocacy of dowsing.\n\nBorn in Somerset to a wealthy family, Lethbridge was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, during the course of which he attended an expedition to Jan Mayen island, becoming part of the first group to successfully climb the Beerenberg. After a failed second expedition to the Arctic Circle, he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of Iron Age hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in Cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.\n\nAfter resigning from the university museum in 1957, Lethbridge moved with his wife to Branscombe, Devon. There he devoted himself to researching paranormal phenomena, publishing a string of books on the subject aimed at a popular rather than academic audience. Most of this involved his research into the use of pendulums for dowsing, although in other publications he championed the witch-cult hypothesis of Margaret Murray, articulated the Stone Tape theory as an explanation for ghost sightings, and argued that extraterrestrial species were involved in shaping human evolution; in this he came to embrace and perpetuate the esoteric ideas of the Earth mysteries movement. Although his work in parapsychology was derided and ignored as pseudo-scientific by the academic establishment, he attracted a cult following, and his work was posthumously championed by esotericists like Colin Wilson and Julian Cope. In 2011 he was made the subject of a biography by Terry Welbourn.\n\nThomas Charles Lethbridge was born on 23 March 1901. His parents, Violet Lethbridge (née Murdoch) and her husband Ambrose Lethbridge, were wealthy and lived at Knowle House in Timberscombe, Somerset in south-west England, where they employed seven servants. The family's fortune stemmed from Ambrose's father Charles Lethbridge, who had married the wealthy coal heiress Susan Anne Yarburgh. Neither Charles nor Ambrose had to earn a living, and as gentlemen of \"independent means\" spent their time engaged in rural hobbies. By 1907 the Lethbridge family had moved to Lewell Lodge, Dorchester in Dorset, where Violet gave birth to daughter Jacintha in June. They then moved to a house named Trevissome in Flushing, Cornwall, where a second son, Ambrose \"Bill\" William Speke Lethbridge, was born. Thomas' father Ambrose contracted tuberculosis at the end of the decade, resulting in the family moving into Charles' house in Heytesbury, Wiltshire, where Ambrose died in September 1909, aged 34.\n\nAround this time, Thomas developed an interest in archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At the outbreak of the First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill as a result of a flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.\n\nIn October 1921 Lethbridge enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, intent on studying geology and geography. Finding geology to be \"crushingly dull\", he rarely attended lectures and took little interest in his studies, instead spending much of his time shooting, fishing, and sailing. He graduated with a third class BA in June 1923.\n\nDuring his studies Lethbridge decided to join an expedition to visit Jan Mayen island in the Arctic Circle, alongside fellow Cambridge students James Chaworth-Musters and William Syer Bristowe and a don from St. John's College, Cambridge, the geologist James Wordie. Although initially planning to travel independently, they decided to join a Norwegian expedition led by Hagbord Ekerold and accompanied by Swiss mountaineer and glaciologist Paul Louis Mercanton. The expedition set sail from Bratvaag aboard two ships in August 1921, and upon arriving at Jan Mayen they became the first team to successfully climb the Beerenberg. During the expedition, Lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by excavating at an abandoned Eskimo settlement. \"The Times\" recognised the expedition as the mountaineering event of the year.\n\nAt Cambridge, Lethbridge had entered into a romantic relationship with Sylvia Robertson, a clergyman's daughter, and they were engaged to be married in March 1922.\nIn mid-1922 he went on a sailing voyage around the Hebrides in Scotland with his fellow Trinity student Geoffrey Walford.\nIn summer 1923 Lethbridge was part of a second expedition led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of Greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat Edward Sabine's pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from Newcastle, they stopped first at Bergen and then Jan Meyen before getting stuck in pack ice. With food reserves running low, the crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.\n\nDuring his student years, Lethbridge had frequented the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, where he had befriended its curator, Louis Clarke. Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary position of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances. There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist Cyril Fox, aiding in Fox's excavation of the Devil's Dyke in Cambridgeshire. Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers. In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by how long it took them to accept what he deemed to be \"facts\", and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be instinct and common sense. There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with T. D. Kendrick, an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the British Museum in London. Over the course of his career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the excavation process.\n\nIn February 1924, Lethbridge married Sylvia Robertson in a ceremony held at Salisbury Cathedral. Together they moved into a house known as The Lodge in Waterbeach. There, their first two sons were born: Christopher John in March 1925 and Hugh Periam in July 1926. In 1927, they moved to Mount Blow, a house in Shelford designed by architect Edwin Lutyens. It was there that Sylvia gave birth to a daughter, Belinda Mary, in April 1930. Sylvia suffered from mental illness however, resulting in repeated hospitalisation. Lethbridge meanwhile devoted much of his time to yachting around the British Isles, sometimes taking family members with him. Over the course of the 1930s he self-published a series of books featuring his own sketches and engravings of maritime scenes. He also deepened his interest in the paranormal during this period, coming to believe that an acquaintance of his was a genuine psychic and observing an unidentified flying object in Bracknell.\n\nIn 1937, Wordie organised an expedition to North West Greenland to investigate cosmic radiation at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists. Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at Rhyder Island, Cary Island, North West Island, and Isbjörn Island. On returning home in October 1937, it was decided that various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on Baffin Island were named the Lethbridge Lakes. During the trip, Lethbridge became particularly interested in the design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, \"Umiak – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat\"', in 1937. He followed this with a second book, \"The Fishermen of Durness\" (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.\n\nAs the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty commissioned Lethbridge to undertake a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending much of the time visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, \"News from Tili\". As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.\n\nMeanwhile, Lethbridge's wife Sylvia had been having affairs with various men, and he himself had begun an affair with Sylvia's younger cousin Mina, who was a secretary at the museum. The couple divorced in June 1943, and in November Lethbridge sold Mount Blow to pay a settlement to Sylvia. He married Mina in July 1944 at Oban, and together they moved from Cambridge to a farm on the Scottish island of Kerrera, where Lethbridge excavated some local caves. But the couple found life on Kerrera too isolated and soon returned to Cambridge, despite Lethbridge's dislike of the place and most of the university staff whom he worked alongside. He nevertheless continued his archaeological investigations, excavating an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Lackford on Cavenham Heath, and involving himself in the investigation of the newly unearthed Mildenhall Treasure, being the individual responsible for locating its probable discovery spot. He was among the first to take an interest in the cemeteries of the Mid Anglo-Saxon period, believing that the lack of 'pagan' objects such as weapons reflected the fact that those buried in two seventh-century cemeteries were among the earliest Anglo-Saxon Christians. In January 1948, Lethbridge received word that his son Hugh had committed suicide after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder during his time in the armed forces.\n\n1948 also saw the publication of Lethbridge's first major book, \"Merlin's Island: Essays on Britain in the Dark Ages\", a collection of six essays on various elements of Early Medieval Britain. Representing Lethbridge's unorthodox and eclectic approach, it was aimed at a popular rather than academic audience, and although some academic reviewers were critical, it received much qualified praise. This was followed in 1950 by \"Herdsman and Hermits: Celtic Seafarers in the Northern Sea\", in which he returned to his interest in seafaring and boats. Containing a foreword by Kendrick, it was published by Bowes and Bowes. In 1952, Lethbridge published \"Coast Wise Craft\", which again looked at boat building but was aimed at a general rather than specialist readership. That same year, Thames and Hudson published Lethbridge's \"Boats and Boatmen\" as part of their \"The Past in the Present\" series edited by archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes. In 1954, Andrew Melrose published Lethbridge's \"The Painted Men\", a book about the Picts of Northern Britain. It was deemed to be his last conventional book within the archaeological and academic community. As part of his increasing public profile, the BBC invited him to give the third talk in their second series of \"Myth or Legend?\", which he devoted to the question of whether Europeans had arrived in the Americas prior to Christopher Columbus; in particular he looked at the claims that St. Brendan and Thorfinn Karlsefni had made the journey across the Atlantic. Over several seasons he also carried out excavations of wheelhouses at South Uist, and on one occasion was visited at the site by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nLethbridge's next project focused on searching for a chalk hill figure that was reported to have once existed on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. Towards the end of 1954 he began investigating the site, inserting metal rods into the ground to determine where he believed the turf had once been removed to expose the chalk below. He believed that he had revealed three large figures, a warrior, a hooded goddess, and a sun god, asserting them to be likely 3000 years old, and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures. Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery, reporting on it to \"The Times\" and being interviewed by the \"London Evening News\". However, many archaeologists were sceptical of Lethbridge's methodology and the existence of the hill figures; they believed that the soft patches of chalk were the result of chalk solifluction and were only interpreted as human-made figures through Lethbridge's vivid imagination. The Council for British Archaeology brought together a committee to assess Lethbridge's findings, composed of I. W. Cornwall, W. F. Grimes, Christopher Hawkes, and Stuart Piggott. With the aid of geologist F. E. Zeuner, the committee concluded that the shapes Lethbridge had discovered were natural, having been formed during the last Ice Age. However, Hawkes disagreed with his colleagues, and believed that while not proven, Lethbridge's conclusions could not be disproved. Lethbridge stuck by his original ideas, and wrote a book aimed at a general audience, \"Gogmagog – The Buried Gods\" on the basis of them. It was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1957, but received no supportive reviews.\nIn May 1957, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray involved herself in the Gogmagog debate, championing Lethbridge's ideas against the academic fraternity in a letter she sent to \"The Times\". W. F. Grimes responded by claiming that she was out of touch with contemporary scholarship.\n\nAs a result of the widespread rejection of his \"Gogmagog\" claims, Lethbridge became increasingly critical of the academic and professional archaeological community, believing that an attitude of what he called \"trade unionism\" had caused most archaeologists to reject independent thought. As a result, he decided to resign and move away from Cambridge in late 1957. Relocating to Branscombe in southern Devon, he and Mina set up home in Hole House, a fortified building that dated to the Early Modern period, and angered some of the locals by banning fox hunters from crossing his land. Lethbridge came to believe that Hole House was haunted, describing unexplained noises and smells there; this increased his interest in the paranormal, and he decided to devote much of his time to investigating such phenomena in what he deemed to be a scientific manner. Lethbridge believed that ghosts were projections stored in rock and other material substances and which echoed particularly emotional or traumatic events that either happened in the past or will happen in the future. He focused many of his experiments on dowsing using a pendulum, coming to believe that the length of string used and the number of oscillations could be used to determine the type of object being detected.\n\nHis first book on the subject of what he often termed \"the odd\" was \"Ghost and Ghoul\", published in 1961 by Routledge and Kegan Paul. In this work he argued that the mind was separate from the brain; he believed that the mind was connected to an ancestral collective mind which everyone inherited. Many of the ideas expressed in the work were akin to those of Carl Jung, Richard Semon, and Amy Warburg, although it is not clear if Lethbridge had been aware of this beforehand. An extract was subsequently published in the January 1963 edition of \"Fantastic Stories of Imagination\". He followed this work with \"Witches – Investigating an Ancient Religion\" (1962), which articulated a form of Murray's witch-cult hypothesis but also contained many digressions and anecdotes unrelated to that topic. Returning to the themes present in \"Ghost and Ghoul\", Lethbridge published \"Ghost and Divining Rod\" in 1963, in which he discussed his progress with his pendulum experiments. On the basis of this, the BBC filmed a short documentary titled \"Ghost Hunting with T.C. Lethbridge\" in May 1964, in which Lethbridge was filmed repeating his pendulum experiences in his garden.\n\nLethbridge's next book was \"ESP – Beyond Time and Distance\", published in 1965. It dealt with the theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, and that they could be detected using pendulum dowsing. In 1966 he published \"A Step in the Dark\", which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.\n\nIn 1969, Lethbridge published \"The Monkey's Tail\", in which he discussed Darwinian evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued that there was a blueprint for existence and that genetic memory was a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, \"The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?\", Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in \"Chariots of the Gods\" (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.\n\nLethbridge's heart condition worsened, to the extent that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interred at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as \"The Power of the Pendulum\".\n\nArchaeologist Niall Finneran asserted that Lethbridge had a \"distinguished if fairly unspectacular reputation\" within British archaeology prior to his adoption of fringe theories. Various colleagues expressed critical praise of his work in this field; for instance, Lethbridge's fellow Anglo-Saxon archaeologist Audrey Meaney noted that his \"observations on features in the cemeteries he excavated around Cambridge were perspicacious but in advance of his time\". Another Anglo-Saxon archaeologist, Sam Lucy, later noted that Lethbridge's observation that those buried with Anglo-Saxon material culture need not have been ethnically descended from continental migrants was – while largely ignored by his contemporaries – widely accepted in scholarship by the end of the 20th century. However, his embrace of unorthodox and pseudo-scientific views later led to professional archaeologists becoming increasingly critical of his work; as his biographer Terry Welbourn noted, Lethbridge's peers came to view him as being \"too radical ... a loose cannon and maverick\".\n\nOn his death, Glyn Daniel described Lethbridge as \"a colourful, stimulating, provocative and often controversial figure in British archaeology\", who represented \"one of the last of that invaluable band of dilettante scholars and devoted amateurs of whom we have had so many in Britain\". Although stating that Lethbridge only emerged as a \"semi-professional\" for a \"short time\", he praised much of Lethbridge's writing for its \"freshness and an eager restless sense of enquiry\". An anonymously authored obituary in \"The Antiquaries Journal\" referred to \"the strength and honesty of Lethbridge's character as a man, and the singleness of purpose that united all his work, as experimental testing of what he found by observation\", seeing these as the unifying characteristics behind his divergent research interests. According to the historian Ronald Hutton, as a result of both his unorthodox ideas and his \"contempt for professionalism in all fields\", Lethbridge's \"status as a scholar never really rose above that of an unusually lively local antiquary\". His books continue to be largely ignored by academics into the 21st century.\n\nDescribing Lethbridge as \"one of the most compelling\" figures in 20th-century British archaeology, Finneran believed that at the start of the 21st century, Lethbridge was best known for his advocacy of dowsing. As such, Finneran asserted that Lethbridge's \"true legacy\" lay outside of \"conventional archaeology\", and could instead be located within the Earth mysteries movement. Lethbridge's work continued to attract interest from parapsychologists after his death. The author M.B. Devot drew heavily on Ghost and Ghoul in his \"Spirits of Field and Hearth\". In 1978, the author Colin Wilson devoted part one of his book \"Mysteries\" to a discussion of Lethbridge's ideas. In 2003, a group of admirers of his work calling themselves \"The Sons of T.C. Lethbridge\" (Doggen Foster, Kevlar Bales and Welbourn Tekh), with the aid of Wilson and Julian Cope, released \"A Giant: The Definitive T.C. Lethbridge\", a set comprising a booklet and two CDs containing music accompanying discussions of Lethbridge's work.\nWelbourn subsequently published a biography of Lethbridge in 2011, titled \"T.C. Lethbridge: The Man who Saw the Future\"; in it, he expressed his view that the archaeologist was \"one of the most remarkable, yet overlooked men of the twentieth century\".\n\nA full bibliography of Lethbridge's published books and academic papers is provided in Welbourn's biography.\n"}

They are associated to a main deity who is generally ascribed as Kuladeivam by various sects of community and clan groups as part of the tracing their generation through centuries.\n\nMost of these village deities have their shrines on the periphery (border or outskirts) of the village as a representation of their Village Guardian position. Hence they are referred as \"Peripheral Folk Deity\". 21 associate deities and 61 servant deities are located in either the same premises or located in different places of the locality, for e.g.: Amman deities may be installed in the centre of the village but the Sonai, Sudalai or the Formless Nadukkal deities may be installed close to graveyards (cemeteries or burial and sometimes, also near memorial centres).\n\nThese Village deities are either represented in the form of a huge, fierce statue or as a simple stone. Most of these temples are not closed premises but are simple and small worship areas. Weapons such as a trident or a lance or sickles are also associated with these shrines.\n\nWe also see lots of terracotta horses, elephants, clay dolls and birds and bells (very similar to Indus Culture). Most officiating priests are pandarams and derive from the local ancestral lineages that had initiated the religious centres generations ago. In ancient times most of the City priests were pandarams.\n\nThe worship pattern is non-vedic through Folk tale, Folk Song and Folk arts (Villupattu, Karakattam, Koothhu, etc.). The local priest might offer flowers or Vibhuthi (holy ash) or Holy flowers to the worshippers and may play the oracle role for shamanism.\n\nThe village deities in Tamil Nadu have interesting stories behind them. Mainly these village gods come under one of the three categories:\nThere are other various Natural energy worship in the form of Muthaaramman, Muthalamman, Pachai Thanni Amman, Pachaiyamman, Pal Pazhakkari amman, Solai amman.\n\nHero stones (Nadukkal or Veerakkal) are the stones provided for the males who sacrifice their life for good causes. Sati stones are the stones provided for females who sacrificed their life for certain specific purpose, especially for chastity and purity.\n\nThis category includes people who lived and lost their lives for their community and hence their community members still remember them and worship them. This group also includes persons who were killed by injustice and hence were worshipped in order to save the village from their wrath. The worship for the fallen brave warriors is one of the popular forms of worship. The early Tamil poetry 'Tolkappiyam' gives an elaborate description in six stages in the planting of such a stone: beginning with looking for a suitable stone, until the institution of formal worship.\n\nThe portrait of the hero is often decorated with peacock feathers. Some poems refer to spears and shields erected around the planted stones. Offering of Naravam (toddy = alcohol) to the spirit of the fallen hero, represented in the planted stone, is mentioned in some verses. In time these “nadukals” became Ayyanar shrines. Other warrior gods include Madurai Veeran (who lived near Madurai), Kaathavarayan (who lived near Tanjavore) and Annammar swamigal (who lived near karur).\n\nThe \"Thee paanch amman\" temples in the northern part of Tamil Nadu were basically built to worship widows who were burnt along with their husbands' funeral pyre as part of the \"Sathi\" or \"Saathi\" or \"Sati\".\n\nThe “Maachani amman” temple at Polaachi was built to worship a young girl who was killed by a “Kongu” king since she unknowingly ate a mango from his garden.\n\nThe “Palayanoor Neeli” was a girl who was betrayed and cunningly killed by her husband and who took revenge by killing him in her next birth. Further, several love pairs who have lost their lives due to caste animosity are also being worshipped as village deities in several villages.\n\nSeelakari amman in various parts of South Tamil Nadu and Kannagi worship are considered as a part of Sati stone worship system. These goddess are most revered female deities for their purity and chastity as they are considered as the prime focus of the way of Tamil women. Kanni amman and Pachai Amman are more common variants of female deities representing the characteristics of Purity and Chastity.\n\nIn general, Sati stones have not become part of the 21 sub-deities of Ayynar but at some places Seelakari amman is considered as part of 21 sub deities. A more detailed research is required to identify clear clarity on various sub-deities including Isakki Amman, Sonai or Sonai Karuppu and others.\n\nAny person who stood for justice and valiantly fought for justice or lost life for the cause of justice have become part of Hero Stone worship. The more prominent are Pandian Nedunchezhian of Silappadhikaram fame,becoming Pandi Muneeswar along with the support of Samayakaruppu. Madurai veeran and so many other stories run parallel to becoming Folk Deities worshipped by large following and becoming part of Kuladeivam.\n\nThere were Forces or elements which the people were scared of.\n\nMunishwaran or Muniappan in olden days was associated with protecting people, drinking devil's blood, doing good things, bringing in good-effect, etc.\n\nPeichi amman (“Pei” means devil) also covered under this form.\n\nThese legends include social suppression stories such as Kannagi, Nallathangal - out of which various worships were created to remind the people not to commit or repeat the same social mistakes of the past. Purity and Chastity of women were given more reverence and prominence. Chitra Pournami is celebrated grandly in memory of Sati women and Kannagi. Nallathangal and similar stories represent the poor familial support leading to the suicide of womenfolk & children. These emphasize moral stories and not to repeat such mistakes again.\n\nThe third category contains certain less spoken characters in the great epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. For example, there are many temples dedicated to Draupadi (Panchali) and Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) in the Northern parts of Tamil Nadu. Temples dedicated Gandhari (mother of the Kauravas), Kunti (mother of Pandavas) and Aravan (the son of Arjuna and the serpent princess Ulupi) are found in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Vedic and non-Vedic poeople assimilated from each other. The Vedic Priests followed 'Let knowledge come from all directions of the universe' and the non-Vedic Priests followed 'everyone is our own people and every land is our own'. Even though there are diversified characteristics between the Vedic and the folk tradition, various communities inducted these deities in their spectrum; they created various sthalapuranas which emphasized the relation between these gods and goddesses from differing traditions. For example, a male deity called Kuttandavar is worshipped in many parts of the Tamil country, especially in South Arcot district. The image consists of a head like a big mask with a rubicund face and lion’s teeth projecting downwards outside the mouth from the angles of the upper jaw. According to legend the creation of Kuttandavar, the god of Indra, is for the crime of murdering a Vedic priest, became incarnated in the form of Kuttandavar, and a curse was laid upon him that his body leaving only the head. These types of stories need to be carefully examined, because they are regarded as the kuladevatas by the oppressed and downtrodden people. In these circumstances they also altered the structure of these deities into either elated or cursed form.\n\nThe popular deities have evolved significantly over time. For example, Mariamman, another deity of subalterns, is highly influenced by the Vedic rituals. She is usually garlanded with skulls. But recently, the skull garland has been replaced by the lemon garland. Her poor outlook has been altered into a pleasant one. Sometimes these restructuring processes led to the degradation of the deities. When they stress the holiness of the deities of Vedic tradition at the same time they denied the holiness of the deities of the folk tradition. They described the gods and goddesses of folk tradition either as watching deities to the deities of Vedic religion or they venertaed these deities as capable of curing most potent contagious diseases.\n\nThe process of inclusivism can also be seen in the popular temples dedicated to the deities of folk religion. For example, the increase in the number of devotees to Samayapuram, Punnainallur, Vazhangaiman Mariamman temples in Tamil Nadu boosted the financial position. It attracts the Vedic priests to switch over their interest to Mariamman on account of the financial benefits. They not only dominate during the time of worship, but also on various other occasions. They have introduced the custom of Kumbhabhishekam. In addition to this, they have made Mariamman as a Suddhadevatas (non-vegetarian deity). With regard to the temples of folk tradition Vinayakar, Murugan, Iyyappan and others, Vedic deities are replaced by the deities of folk tradition such as Aiyanar, Madurai Viran and Karuppannasamy. Even the people of the folk tradition have begun to follow some customs and habits of higher castes in order to raise their social status and that is eroding some of Hinduism's colossal Diversity.\n\nThese deities are always found in the outskirts of the village. The maintenance of the temple of these deities is taken care by the whole of the village. It is believed that these Gods shoo away all evils and devils from entering the village. Certain temples on the highway attracts vehicles on the road, there is a practice of visiting such places before undertaking a journey.\n\nThese temples are usually in the open space and will not have traditional Gopurams like any other temples but in some villages like Sholanganallur and Puthur In Tiruchi district have Gopurams of their Kaval Deivangal for Kulumayee Amman and Ondi karuppannasamy. You can see big statues of Gods with weapons like bow and arrow, swords, knives and other protective weapons. There also will be statues of Goddesses, and animals in these temples.\n\nDuring the recent decade or so the Jathara(Thiru Vizha in Tamizh or Festival in English) of Sammakka Saralamma the village deities in the Telangana has become very popular among the locals,which is now in fact the largest tribal festival in the world.Many Telugus and the neighbouring Marathis worship the village deities of Sammakka and Saralamma.\n\nThis shows the traces of worship of native Dravidian deities,not only in Tamil Nadu but also in Andhra Pradesh,Telangana and other south Indian states.\n\nDuring the Tamil month of Masi and Panguni, Kulumayee Amman Festival is celebrated in Puthur and Sholnganallur villages in Tiruchi District of Tamil Nadu. During that time Marulali of the respective village suck the blood of the Goats with the blessings of Ondi Karuppu.\nDuring the Tamil Months of Karthikai (Sokka Paanai during Karthigai Dheepam); Thai (Thai poosam, Makar Jyothi of Ayyappan); Masi (Masi Kalari - Shivarathiri); Panguni (Panguni Uthiram considered as the auspicious birthday of Ayyanar); Aadi (Aadi Perukku) and Vaigasi (Vaigasi Visakam), festivals will be conducted in these temples. Generally, a mass convention assembly of large number of related family member gathering is organized during the spring season for a period of 2 to 3 days. For the annual mass convention festival, the tradition is that the commencement of the festival will be with that of a hoisting of the flag and tying \"Kappu.\" After this time, villagers neither can go out of the village to different village or come into the village from a different village.\n\nMayana Pujai is mostly practiced in midnight during the worship of Irulappasamy or Sadalaisamy.\n\nOf special mention is that of the traditional \"Theru Koothu\" and “Villu Pattu”; it is a dance-drama (Koothu) enacted on the street (Theru). The Koothu performers dance and recite songs/ narrations which often end with moral quotes. Through these kind of performances, the villagers are told what is good and what is bad; also the do's and don'ts.\n\nSince the earlier days, these were the only means of media that took messages to the people.\n\nPeople who always had greater belief in God agreed with the decisions that was taken by the committee members. More importantly, it is the belief of the village people that the Karuppu samy God is being disguised in the form of the man who predicts the future. This belief system about Karuppu samy is called the \"Arul vaaku\" in several parts of Tamil Nadu. The social issues will be discussed through the temple fore-tellers (Kodangi) whom the people usually consider as the voice of the Karuppa sami deity. When Lord Karuppa sami addresses the people in different villages through Kodangi, different issues and dimensions on social, cultural and psychological aspects of people and society are reviewed for possible solutions.\n\nWorship of Goddess ANKAMMA: Ankamma is also known as Angamma, Ankalamma, Angalamma, Ankali, Angali, Ankala Parameswari, Angala Parameswari. She is worshipped with these names in Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu. Ankali and Kali are one and the same goddess. Ankamma is considered to be the mother of Trimurtis. The most important part of Ankamma Kolupu is that a midnight puja was performed with the help of ballads by making a colorful Rangoli with wheat flour, turmaric powder, kumkum, black charcoal powder, etc. At the end of the puja, the devotees sacrifice a goat. The devara kolupu / veerla kolupu is normally performed on some special occasions by individuals or by community as a whole. During the worship singers recite historical stories about warrior ancestors.\n\n\n"}

The term \"volkhv\" is a cognate of Old Norse \"völva\".\n\nIn contemporary Slavic Native Faith, the volkhvs are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, the lesser order being that of the \"zhrets\". The latter are not necessarily shamans, and their function is merely to hold sacrifices (the word \"zhrets\" literally means \"sacrificer\", from Proto-Slavic *\"žьrti\", and is cognate of Slavic words for \"offering\"). Though the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of \"zhritsa\" and \"vedunya\" (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, Halyna Lozko from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.\n\nIn 2012, three Russian Rodnover organisations, the Union of Slavic Rodnover Communities, the Circle of the Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an \"Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests\", instituting a common priesthood and the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests.\n\nVolkhvs are attested among the early Rus' people. Volkhvs were believed to possess mystical powers, particularly the ability to predict the future. The first literary reference to a volkhv occurs in the Primary Chronicle under the year 912; there, the priest-soothsayer predicts Prince Oleg's death. With the adoption of Christianity, the pagan priests came under persecution and sometimes tried to channel social discontent against the Christian church.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3760018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3760018", "title": "Wahy", "text": "Wahy\n\nWaḥy (, ; also spelled wahi) is the Arabic word for revelation or inspiration. In Islamic belief, revelations are God's Word delivered by his chosen individuals – known as Messenger prophets – to mankind. In Islam, the Quran is considered a wahy given to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The word \"awha\" ( \"\") occurs in a number of shades of meaning in the Quran, each of them indicating the main underlying idea of directing or guiding someone or something. For example, \"And inspired in each heaven its command,\" (Fussilat-12). \"And your lord inspired to the bee,\" (An Nahl-68). \"And we inspired to the mother of Mosses,\" (Al Qasas-7). Islamic scholars say that there is a clear difference between these kind of \"wahy \"and \"wahy\" to the Messenger Prophet. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. The word \"wahy\" (revelation) is derived from \"awha\".\n\nIn Islamic tradition, the verse of the Quran serves as the basis of understanding for \"wahy\". It says \"It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills\". Based on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in which God's revelation can reach His chosen individuals, especially prophets. An inspired message – not a word but an idea – can enter the heart of the chosen individuals either in the state of consciousness or in dream. The second mode, it is said, is the word heard by the person spoken to, like, from behind a veil. In the third mode, the revelation is sent from God through archangels like Gabriel and is delivered to the prophets. It is the highest form of revelation, and Muslims believe the whole Quran was revealed in this mode.\n\nAccording to Islamic scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani, God has created three media through which humans receive knowledge: men’s senses, the faculty of reason, and the divine revelation; and it is the third one that addresses the liturgical and eschatological issues, answers the questions regarding God's purpose behind creating mankind, and acts as a guidance for the mankind as to choosing the correct way. In Islamic belief, the sequence of divine revelation came to an end with Muhammad.\n\nAs regard to revelation received by Muhammad, Muslim sources mention various modes in which they believe revelation came to him. Muslim scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani has summarized five modes of descent. The common mode was that Muhammad would hear sound like \"the ringing of a bell\" after which he found the message committed to his memory. Sometimes, the arch angel would come in human shape, most often of Dahya al-Kalbi. In two cases, Gabriel appeared in his real form. Once, on the night of Miraj, Muhammad is believed to have had a direct conversation with God. In the fifth mode, Gabriel would let the revelation enter into Muhammad’s heart.\n\nAnnemarie Schimmel states that most recent studies of Muhammad indicate that Muhammad devoutly believed that he was God's instrument. William Montgomery Watt argues that only Muhammad's sincerity can explain his \"readiness to endure hardship and persecution during the Meccan period when from a secular point of view there was no prospect of success. To carry on in the face of persecution and hostility would have been impossible for him unless he was fully persuaded that God had sent him. \"\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt presents the following possibilities for the sources of Qur'an:\n\nSometimes he [Muhammad] may have heard the words being spoken to him, but for most part he seems simply to have \"found them in his heart\". Whatever the precise \"manner of revelation\"-and several different 'manners' were listed by Muslim scholars- the important point is that the message was not the product of Muhammad's conscious mind. He believed he could easily distinguish between his own thinking and these revelations. His sincerity in this belief must be accepted by the modern historian, for this alone makes credible the development of a great religion. The further question, however, whether the messages came from Muhammad's unconscious, or the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source, is beyond the competence of the historian.\n\nAccording to historian Welch, \nThe really powerful factor in Muhammad's life and the essential clue to his extraordinary success was his unshakable belief from beginning to end that he had been called by God. A conviction such as this, which, once firmly established, does not admit of the slightest doubt, exercises an incalculable influence on others. The certainty with which he came forward as the executor of God's will gave his words and ordinances an authority that proved finally compelling.\n\nA number of Western historians have addressed the question of whether Muhammad was sincere when he reported receiving revelations. Around a hundred years ago, Thomas Carlyle in his lectures, \"On Heroes\", vigorously defended Muhammad arguing that one can only accuse him of insincerity if one fails to understand Islam and its worldwide success. Carlyle's view has been increasingly influential ever since and contemporary historians tend to say that as far as can be ascertained Muhammad did believe that he was hearing the word of God.\n\nWatt notes, \"To say that Muhammad was sincere does not imply that he was correct in his beliefs. A man maybe sincere but mistaken. The modern Westerner has not difficulty in showing how Muhammad may have been mistaken. What seems to a man to come from 'outside himself' may actually come from his unconscious.\"\n\n\n"}

It is over long. The lake is surrounded by many snow-capped mountains and is fed by numerous small streams. The lake has an outlet stream at its far western end and means turquoise in English due to its color.\n\nAround 90 km to the west of the lake lies the Tibetan town of Gyantse and Lhasa is a hundred km to the northeast. According to local mythology, Yamdok Yumtso lake is the transformation of a goddess.\n\nThe Yamdrok Hydropower Station was completed and dedicated in 1996 near the small village of Baidi at the lake’s western end. This power station is the largest in Tibet.\n\nThe lake (638 km² in area, 30 meters average depth and 60 meters at its deepest) is fan-shaped, spreading to the south but narrowing up to the north. The mountainous lakeshore is highly crenellated, with numerous bays and inlets. Lake Yamdrok freezes in winter.\n\nYamdrok Lake has a cold steppe climate (\"BSk\") with long, cold, very dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. It is also bordering on an alpine tundra climate (\"ET\") and on a subarctic climate (\"Dwc\"). The differences between day and night are great.\nLike mountains, lakes are considered sacred by Tibetan people, the principle being that they are the dwelling places of protective deities and therefore invested with special spiritual powers. Yamdrok Lake is one of four particularly holy lakes, thought to be divinatory; everyone from the Dalai Lama to local villagers makes pilgrimages there. It is considered sacred as one of the four \"Great Wrathful Lakes\" guarded by the goddess Dorje Gegkyi Tso. The others such lakes are Lhamo La-tso, Namtso and Manasarovar. The lake is revered as a talisman and is said to be part of the life-spirit of Tibet. The largest lake in southern Tibet, it is said that if its waters dry, Tibet will no longer be habitable.\n\nThe lake, its islands, and the surrounding area are closely associated with Padmasambhava, the Second Buddha, who brought Buddhism to Tibet in 8th century AD. The lake is home to the famous Samding Monastery which is on a peninsula jutting into the lake. This monastery is the only Tibetan monastery to be headed by a female re-incarnation. Since it is not a nunnery, its female abbot heads a community of about thirty monks and nuns. Samding Monastery is where Samding Dorje Phagmo, the most important female incarnate Lama in Tibet, stayed and presided, and stands to the south of Lake Yamdrok Yumtso.\n\nToday, both pilgrims and tourists can be seen walking along the lake's perimeter. One of the lake's islands contains an old fort or castle called Pede Dzong.\n\nThere are shoals of fish living in Yamdrok Lake, which are commercially exploited by local population. From April to October, fish caught from this lake are sold at markets in Lhasa, Tibet's capital.\n\nAdditionally, the lake's islands serve as rich pasture land to local herdsmen.\n\n"}
