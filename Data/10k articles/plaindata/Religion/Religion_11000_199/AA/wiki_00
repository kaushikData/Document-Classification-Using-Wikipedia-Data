The town is 5 km south of Tripoli and is also the first town south of Tripoli.\n\nDuring Greco-Roman times Al-Qalamoun was known as Kalamos or Kalomo, while during the Crusades the town was known as Calmont or Calamón.\n\nOther modern day names for Al-Qalamoun include: El-Qalmoun, Al-Qalamun, El-Qalmoûn, Al-Qalamūn and El-Qalamoûn.\n\nAl-Qalamoun has a history spanning 5000 years and during its history was an agricultural village.\n\nIn modern times it has become a center for metal smiths working in copper, brass and bronze. This occurred after metal workers and artisans from Tripoli's Souk an-Nahhassine (the traditional market of Tripoli) moved to Al-Qalamoun several decades ago.\n\nIn Al-Qalamoun there exists an old mosque known as the Bahr Mosque (mosque of the sea). As circulated among the citizens of the town, the mosque dates back to about 800 years ago. This is ascertained by a three-line tablet pasted on the wall besides the pulpit (527 A.H./1132 C.E.). This date coincides with the time during which Tripoli was under the Crusaders' rule. The mosque was restored by Sheikh Ali al-Baghdadi (d. 1192 A.H./1778 C.E.). The mosque is composed of two large halls. It was constructed using sandstone, as in the case of the mosques in Tripoli. The upper side of the wall has adorned cornices and above the mosque is a new minaret.\n\nSouth from the Bahr Mosque is the Ayn el-Jami'i prayer house. As circulated among the citizens of the city, the mosque dates back to the Crusaders. Muslims constructed this place near a water source, then it developed into a prayer house, then became the Ayn Mosque. A charitable association transformed the mosque into a theological school.\n\nThe table below displays average monthly climate indicators in Al-Qalamoun based on 8 years of historical weather readings.\n\nThe main street (avenue) in the town is lined with small workshops and showrooms where brass bowls, candlesticks and other objects are produced (hammered out) in the old traditional way. A good look around these shops can reveal interesting antique pieces as well. Roadside stands also sell olive oil products and fruit juices and syrups made from cranberry, mulberry, lemon, orange and other juices. Al-Qalamoun is also famous for distilled flower and rose essences, that are used to add a nice flavor and smell to sweets. The town is also known for the Jazariyyeh (a kind of sweet made of pumpkin ).\n\nThe residents of Al-Qalamoun are Sunni Muslims and number a few thousand people of different religions as Christianity.\n\nSome notable people born in or descending from Al-Qalamoun include:\n\n"}

He was a son of King Antiochus III the Great. His original name was Mithradates (alternative form \"Mithridates\"); he assumed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne. Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt, his persecution of the Jews of Judea and Samaria, and the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees.\n\nAntiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by the Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Antiochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included \"manifest god\", and, after his defeat of Egypt, \"bringer of victory\". However, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some of his contemporaries to call him \"Epimanes\" (\"The Mad One\"), a word play on his title \"Epiphanes\".\n\nAntiochus was a member of the Greek-speaking Seleucid dynasty and was the son and potential successor of Antiochus III the Great, and as such he became a political hostage of the Roman Republic following the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC. His older brother Seleucus IV Philopator followed his father onto the throne in 187 BC, and Antiochus was exchanged for his nephew Demetrius I Soter, the son and heir of Seleucus.\n\nSeleucus was assassinated by the usurper Heliodorus in 175 BC, but Antiochus in turn ousted him. Seleucus' legitimate heir Demetrius I Soter was still a hostage in Rome, so Antiochus seized the throne for himself with the help of King Eumenes II of Pergamon, proclaiming himself co-regent with another son of Seleucus, an infant named Antiochus (whom he then murdered a few years later).\n\nThe guardians of King Ptolemy VI Philometor demanded the return of Coele-Syria in 170 BC, but Antiochus launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, conquering all but Alexandria and capturing King Ptolemy. To avoid alarming Rome, Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue ruling as a puppet king. Upon Antiochus' withdrawal, the city of Alexandria chose a new king, one of Ptolemy's brothers, also named Ptolemy (VIII Euergetes). The Ptolemy brothers agreed to rule Egypt jointly instead of fighting a civil war.\n\nIn 168 BC, Antiochus led a second attack on Egypt and also sent a fleet to capture Cyprus. Before he reached Alexandria, his path was blocked by a single elderly Roman ambassador named Gaius Popillius Laenas who delivered a message from the Roman Senate directing Antiochus to withdraw his armies from Egypt and Cyprus or consider himself in a state of war with the Roman Republic. Antiochus said he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the Roman envoy drew a line in the sand around Antiochus and said: \"Before you leave this circle, give me a reply that I can take back to the Roman Senate.\" This implied Rome would declare war if the King stepped out of the circle without committing to leave Egypt immediately. Weighing his options, Antiochus decided to withdraw. Only then did Popillius agree to shake hands with him.\n\nThe Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a mild suzerainty over Judea: they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV, resulting in harsh persecutions and a revolt against his rule, the Maccabean Revolt.\n\nAccording to the authors of the \"Books of the Maccabees\", while Antiochus was busy in Egypt, a rumor spread that he had been killed. In Judea, the deposed High Priest Jason gathered a force of 1000 soldiers and made a surprise attack on the city of Jerusalem. Menelaus, the High Priest appointed by Antiochus, was forced to flee Jerusalem during a riot. King Antiochus returned from Egypt in 168 BC, enraged by his defeat; he attacked Jerusalem and restored Menelaus, then executed many Jews.\n\nAntiochus decided to side with the Hellenized Jews in order to consolidate his empire and to strengthen his hold over the region. He outlawed Jewish religious rites and traditions kept by observant Jews and ordered the worship of Zeus as the supreme god (2 Maccabees 6:1–12). This was anathema to the Jews and they refused, so Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree. The city of Jerusalem was destroyed because of the resistance, many were slaughtered, and Antiochus established a military Greek citadel called the Acra.\n\nThe date of Antiochus's persecution of the Jews in Jerusalem is variously given as 168 or 167 BC. In their commentary on the \"Book of Daniel\", Newsom and Breed argue for 167, although they state that good arguments can be made for either chronology.\nTraditionally, as expressed in the First and Second Books of the Maccabees, the Maccabean Revolt was painted as a national resistance to a foreign political and cultural oppression. In modern times, however, scholars have argued that the king was instead intervening in a civil war between the traditionalist Jews in the country and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem. According to Joseph P. Schultz: Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.\n\nIt seems that the traditionalists, with Hebrew/Aramaic names such as Onias, contested with the Hellenizers, with Greek names such as Jason and Menelaus, over who would be the High Priest of Israel. Other authors have pointed to the possibility of socioeconomic motives, as well as religious ones, as having been primary drivers of the civil war.\n\nWhat began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Coele-Syria sided with Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists. As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices around which the traditionalists had rallied. This could explain why the king banned the traditional religion of a whole people, in a total departure from typical Seleucid practice in other settings.\n\nKing Mithridates I of Parthia took advantage of Antiochus' western problems and attacked from the east, seizing the city of Herat in 167 BC and disrupting the direct trade route to India, effectively splitting the Greek world in two.\n\nAntiochus recognized the potential danger in the east but was unwilling to give up control of Judea. He sent a commander named Lysias to deal with the Maccabees, while the King himself led the main Seleucid army against the Parthians. Antiochus had initial success in his eastern campaign, including the reoccupation of Armenia, but he died suddenly of disease in 164 BC.\n\nAccording to the scroll of Antiochus, when Antiochus heard that his army had been defeated in Judea, he boarded a ship and fled to the coastal cities. Wherever he came the people rebelled and called him \"The Fugitive,\" so he drowned himself in the sea.\n\nAccording to the Second Book of Maccabees, he was horrifically injured in the following manner, which eventually led to his death:\nAntiochus IV ruled the Jews from 175 to 164 BC. He is remembered as a major villain and persecutor in the Jewish traditions associated with Hanukkah, including the books of Maccabees and the \"Scroll of Antiochus\". Rabbinical sources refer to him as הרשע \"harasha\" (\"the wicked\"); the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" concluded that \"[s]ince Jewish and heathen sources agree in their characterization of him, their portrayal is evidently correct\", summarizing this portrayal as one of a cruel and vainglorious ruler who tried to force on all the peoples of his realm a Hellenic culture, \"the true essence of which he can scarcely be said to have appreciated\". Whether Antiochus's policy was directed at extermination of Judaism as a culture and a religion, though, is debatable on the grounds that his persecution was limited to Judea and Samaria (Jews in the diaspora were exempt), and that Antiochus was hardly an ideologically motivated Hellenizer. Erich S. Gruen suggests that, instead, he was driven more by pragmatics such as the need to gather income from Judea.\n\n\n"}

Hincmar refers to this official as a \"summus cancellarius\" in \"De ordine palatii et regni\" and an 864 charter of King Lothair I refers to Agilmar, Archbishop of Vienne, as archchancellor, a word which also begins appearing in chronicles about that time. The last Carolingian archchancellor in West Francia was Archbishop Adalberon of Reims (969-988), with the accession of Hugh Capet the office was replaced by a \"Chancelier de France\".\n\nAt the court of Otto I, then King of Germany, the title seems to have been an appanage of the Archbishop of Mainz. After Otto had finally deposed King Berengar II of Italy and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962, a similar office was created for the Imperial Kingdom of Italy. By the early eleventh century, this office was perennially held by the Archbishop of Cologne. Theoretically, the archbishop of Mainz took care of Imperial affairs for Germany and the Archbishop of Cologne for Italy, though the latter often used deputies, his see being outside of his kingdom. A third office was created about 1042 by Emperor Henry III the recently acquired Kingdom of Burgundy. He initially bestowed it on Archbishop Hugh I of Besançon. It only appears in the hands of the Archbishop of Trier in the twelfth century as the chancellory of Arles, as Burgundy was then known.\n\nBy the Golden Bull of 1356, Emperor Charles IV confirmed the threefold division of the archchancellory among the three ecclesiastical Prince-electors of the Empire. Actual governmental functions like calling the Imperial elections, however, were carried out by the Mainz archbishops alone. The office in this form was part of the constitution of the Empire until the German Mediatisation in 1803, when Mainz was secularised. The last elector, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, however, retained the title of archchancellor until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. There was a marked resemblance between the medieval archchancellor and the later chancellors of the German Empire, the Weimar Republic,\n\nIn France the title of \"Archchancellor of the Empire\" was given to Napoleon I's chief legal advisor, Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès.\n\n\n\n"}

Following growth across West Africa a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1956. As the community multiplied across cities and became diverse in its engagements, it elected its own National Spiritual Assembly by 1979. Estimates of membership vary widely - a 2001 estimate by Operation World showed 1000 Bahá'ís in 2001 while the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 38,000 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nRichard St. Barbe Baker lived and worked in some of the southern provinces of Nigeria in 1927-29, extending his Men of the Trees project of environmental conservation, and as a Bahá'í since 1925. In 1941 Nigerian Kingsley MBadiwe spoke at the New York Bahá'í center.\n\nWide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and accelerated in the 1960s. In 1953, Shoghi Effendi, the head of the religion, planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade. During the teaching plan, Mr. and Mrs. Ali Nakhjavani drove by car with two African pioneers from Uganda to open new countries to the religion. The first pioneer settled in what was then French Equatorial Africa, and later Enoch Olinga went on to British Cameroon. By 1954, growth in the Bahá'í Faith in Cameroon resulted in five young Bahá'ís who pioneered surrounding areas, each becoming a Knight of Bahá'u'lláh including Ghana, and Togo. Meanwhile, a Bahá'í book belonging to Olinga, Paris Talks, became the basis of a Baha'i Church in Nigeria, in Calabar, which operated in 1955-56. Concurrently in 1956 there were over 1000 Bahá'ís across North-West Africa, resulting in a regional National Spiritual Assembly including Nigeria with Olinga as the chairman with its seat in Tunis.\nThe church was disconnected from the Bahá'í community, but it applied the Bahá'í teachings with virtually all of the Cameroonian men on one large palm plantation. The church was established, flourished, and then collapsed utterly unrecognized and unknown to the Bahá'í pioneers and to the international Baha'i community until one of the founders tried to return the book. Both leaders of the church later officially joined the religion, and they helped form the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Calabar in 1957 and served in other positions.\n\nBy 1964, while associated with the regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa, Nigeria had a Local Spiritual Assembly in Aba (Nigeria), Afikpo, Akpabuyo, Aningeje, Asata Enugu(?), Calabar, Ibadan, Lagos, Nyaje, Owom, and Sapele, and smaller groups of Bahá'ís in Ebute Metta, Ikot Okriba, Ojok, Old Ndebeji, Onitcha, and Oron, and isolated Bahá'ís in Abakaliki, Abeokuta, Kontagura, Kwa Falls, Mbeban Village, and Umuahia. Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organize the Bahá'í communities of Africa by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies, from 1967 though the 1990s. From January to March 1970 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum crossed Africa from east to west visiting many of these country's communities including Nigeria meeting with individuals and institutions both Bahá'í and civic.

Neihardt, an American poet and writer, who relates the story of Black Elk, an Oglala Lakota medicine man. Black Elk spoke in Lakota and Black Elk's son, Ben Black Elk, who was present during the talks, translated his father's words into English. Neihardt made notes during these talks which he later used as the basis for his book.\n\nThe prominent psychologist Carl Jung read the book in the 1930s and urged its translation into German; in 1955, it was published as Ich rufe mein Volk (I Call My People). \n\nReprinted in the US in 1961, with a 1988 edition named Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux, as told through John G. Neihardt (Flaming Rainbow) and a State University of New York Press 2008 Premier Edition annotated by Lakota scholar Raymond DeMallie, the book has found an international audience. However, the book has come under fire for what critics describe as inaccurate representations of Lakota culture and beliefs. \n\nIn the summer of 1930, as part of his research into the Native American perspective on the Ghost Dance movement, the poet and writer John G. Neihardt, already the Nebraska poet laureate, received the necessary permission from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to go to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Accompanied by his two daughters, he went to meet an Oglala holy man named Black Elk. His intention was to talk to someone who had participated in the Ghost Dance. For the most part, the reservations were not then open to visitors. At age 13, Black Elk had also been part of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and he survived the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre.\n\nNeihardt recounts that Black Elk invited him back for interviews. Flying Hawk served as their translator. Neihardt writes that Black Elk told him of his visions, including one in which he saw himself as a \"sixth grandfather\" - the spiritual representative of the earth and of mankind. Neihardt also states that Black Elk shared some of the Oglala rituals which he had performed as a healer, and that two men developed a close friendship. Neihardt's daughter, Hilda Neihardt, says Black Elk adopted her, her sister, and their father as relatives, giving each of them Lakota names.\n\nThough Black Elk was Oglala Lakota, the book was written by Neihardt, a non-Native. While the book is lauded by non-Native audiences, and has been inspirational to many New Age groups, traditional Lakota people and Native American scholars do not consider the book to be representative of Lakota beliefs. They have debated the accuracy of the account, which has elements of a collaborative autobiography, spiritual text, and other genres. The Indiana University professor Raymond DeMallie, who has studied the Lakota by cultural and linguistic resources, published \"The Sixth Grandfather\" in 1985 including the original transcripts of the conversations with Black Elk, plus his own introduction, analysis and notes. He has questioned whether Neihardt's account is accurate and fully represents the views or words of Black Elk.\n\nThe primary criticism made by DeMallie and similar scholars is that Neihardt, as the author and editor, may have exaggerated or altered some parts of the story to make it more accessible and marketable to the intended white audience of the 1930s, or because he did not fully understand the Lakota context. Late twentieth-century editions of the book by Nebraska University Press have addressed this issue by entitling the book as \"Black Elk Speaks, as told through John G. Neihardt (aka \"Flaming Rainbow\")\".\n\nAfter serving as translator for his father in 1931, and increasingly after his father's death in 1950, Ben Black Elk visited local schools on the Pine Ridge Reservation to tell the traditional stories of the Lakota history and culture.\n\n\nThe book was adapted into a play by Christopher Sergel, \"John G. Neihardt's Black Elk Speaks\", in the 1970s where it was staged by the Folger Theatre in Washington, D.C. and then taken on a national tour in 1978, and later restaged in 1992 with a revised version. \n\n\n\n"}

In 1912, aged 15, she married her first cousin, Baron Boris de Hueck (1889–1947).\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Baroness de Hueck became a Red Cross nurse at the front, experiencing the horrors of battle firsthand. On her return to St. Petersburg, she and Boris barely escaped the turmoil of the Russian Revolution with their lives, nearly starving to death as refugees in Finland. Together they made their way to England, where de Hueck was received into the Catholic Church on November 27, 1919.\n\nEmigrating to Canada with Boris, de Hueck gave birth to their only child, George, in Toronto in 1921. To make ends meet, she took various jobs, eventually travelling across the United States, giving talks on the Chautauqua lecture circuit.\n\nProsperous now, but deeply dissatisfied with a life of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, de Hueck began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped to her eyes every time she opened the Bible: \"Arise — go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow Me.\" Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the diocese, she began her lay apostolate among the poor.\n\nIn 1932, she gave up all her possessions, lived among the multitude of poor people in downtown Toronto and established Friendship House with its soup kitchen. She gave food to them when she had none for herself – and offered Catholic education and fellowship, too. She was tagged as a communist sympathizer and, beleaguered by her own organization, Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating Catholic Action. On her return, she established the Friendship House at 34 West 135th Street in Harlem in 1937. The interracial charity center, in addition to distributing goods to the poor, conducted lectures and discussions to promote racial understanding.\n\nIn 1943, having received an annulment of her first marriage, as she had married her cousin, which is forbidden in the Roman Catholic Church, she married Eddie Doherty, an American journalist, whom she had met when he was writing a story about her.\n\nSerious disagreements arose between the staff of Friendship House and its foundress, particularly surrounding her marriage. When these could not be resolved, Doherty and Eddie moved to Combermere, Ontario, on May 17, 1947 to retire. As she recovered, she started to serve the needs of the community. What eventually blossomed was a new rural apostolate called Madonna House that now numbers approximately 200 staff workers with 18 missionary field-houses throughout the world. \n\nBaroness Catherine de Hueck Doherty died on December 14, 1985, in Combermere at the age of 89. Since then, the cause for her canonization as a saint has been officially opened in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"I considered Nazareth to be the center of my vocation. Only by being hidden would I be a light to my neighbor’s feet in the\nslums,\" Doherty wrote. She believed that activism should be rooted in prayer and that faith should be brought to every aspect of daily life.\n\nThe core of Doherty's spirituality is summarized in a \"distillation\" of the Gospel which she called \"The Little Mandate\" — words which she believed she received from Jesus Christ and which guided her life. It reads:\n\nThe spirituality expressed in The Little Mandate is also known as \"the Madonna House way of life\".\n\nA central theme in Doherty's spirituality is \"the duty of the moment\". As she herself put it:\n\nThe duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in whatever place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but you may have a little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it to the best of your ability, with great love for both God and that child... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.\n\nDoherty is perhaps best known for having introduced the concept of poustinia to Roman Catholicism through her best-selling book \"Poustinia\", first published in 1975. A poustinia is a small sparsely furnished cabin or room where a person goes to pray and fast alone in the presence of God for 24 hours.\n\n\nDoherty's cause for canonization as a saint was opened by Pope John Paul II in 2000, and she has been given the official title Servant of God — the first step on the way to being declared Venerable, then Blessed, and finally Saint. At the current stage in the process, a diocesan tribunal, as well as a historical commission, are examining Doherty's life and writings under the supervision of the bishop of the Diocese of Pembroke. Her file in the Vatican is titled (in English) \"Pembroke: Cause of the Beatification and Canonization of Servant of God Catherine de Hueck Doherty, lay faithful and foundress of the Apostolate called 'Madonna House'\".\n\n\n"}

The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named William Sayle, had been expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and were searching for a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize the Bahamas.\n\nThe mid-17th century was a period of constant religious & political turmoil in England and in Europe which culminated in the English Civil War, a series of conflicts, the first of which was fought between King Charles I and Parliament, and led ultimately to the Protectorship of the Puritan general, Oliver Cromwell. This conflict spread to Bermuda where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the Loyalist party in the English Civil War. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the Bermudian Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island.\n\nNevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named Eleutheria, from the Greek word for \"freedom\", although the name later became Eleuthera. The island's original inhabitants, the Lucayans, had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially smallpox, that followed.\n\nWilliam Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the \"William\". During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an argument with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, Sayle left Captain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of Spanish Wells. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others. More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their cause and collected £800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable Braziletto wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to Harvard University.\n\nAnother source of trouble for the colony was dissent within its ranks from the beginning. Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authority, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New Providence'. The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy. This episode is thought to be the historical source of Andrew Marvell's poem \"Bermudas,\" written in praise of the Puritan settlers of the New World, and one of the earliest statements of the so-called \"American Dream\". According to the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\" (7th ed., p. 1686), \"The poem was probably written after 1653, when Marvell took up residence in the house of John Oxenbridge, who had twice visited the Bermudas.\"\n\nThe new colony was to be governed by the Articles and Orders of 1647, drawn up by William Sayle. The articles reflect the ambiguities of the English Civil War taking place at that time between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Therefore, while the preamble refers to the \"Raign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Defender of the Faith, &c\", the articles themselves make clear that the new settlement was to be effectively independent, making no further mention of the Crown. On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing the \"Members of the Republick\" and the \"Magistracie or officers of the Republicke\". The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas \"the first democratic state in the New World\", some 130 years before the American Revolution.\n\n"}
{"id": "5500682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5500682", "title": "Evangelical counsels", "text": "Evangelical counsels\n\nThe three evangelical counsels or counsels of perfection in Christianity are chastity, poverty (or perfect charity), and obedience. As Jesus of Nazareth stated in the Canonical gospels, they are counsels for those who desire to become \"perfect\" (τελειος, cf. , see also Strong's G5046 and Imitatio dei). The Catholic Church interprets this to mean that they are not binding upon all and hence not necessary conditions to attain eternal life (heaven). Rather they are \"acts of supererogation\" that exceed the minimum stipulated in the Commandments in the Bible. Catholics that have made a \"public\" profession to order their life by the evangelical counsels, and confirmed this by a \"public\" religious vow before their competent church authority (the act of religious commitment called \"profession\"), are recognised as members of the consecrated life.\n\nThere are early forms of religious vows in the Christian monastic traditions. The Rule of Saint Benedict (ch. 58.17) stipulates for its adherents what has come to be known as the \"Benedictine vow\", which to this day is made by the candidates joining Benedictine communities, promising \"stability, conversion of manners and obedience\". Religious vows in the form of the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience were first made in the twelfth century by Francis of Assisi and his followers, the first of the mendicant orders. These vows are made now by the members of all Roman Catholic religious institutes founded subsequently (cf. Code of Canon Law, can. 573) and constitute the basis of their other regulations of their life and conduct.\n\nMembers of religious institutes confirm their intention to observe the evangelical counsels by making a \"public\" vow, that is, a vow that the superior of the religious institute accepts in the name of the Church. Outside the consecrated life Christians are free to make a \"private vow\" to observe one or more of the evangelical counsels; but a \"private\" vow does not have the same binding and other effects in church law as a \"public\" vow and does not bestow the spiritual benefits that spiritual teachers such as Dom Columba Marmion (cf. \"Christ the Ideal of the Monk\", ch. VI) attribute to the religious \"profession\".\n\nA young man in the Gospel asked what he should do to obtain eternal life, and Jesus told him to \"keep the commandments\", but when the young man pressed further, Christ told him: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor\". (It is from this passage that the term \"counsel of perfection\" comes.) Again in the Gospels, Jesus speaks of \"eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\", and added \"He that can receive it, let him receive it\". St. Paul presses home the duty incumbent on all Christians of keeping free from all sins of the flesh, and of fulfilling the obligations of the married state, if they have taken those obligations upon themselves, but also gives his \"counsel\" in favor of the unmarried state and of perfect chastity (Celibacy), on the ground that it is thus more possible to serve God with an undivided allegiance.\n\nIndeed, the danger in the Early Church, even in Apostolic times, was not that the \"counsels\" would be neglected or denied, but that they should be exalted into commands of universal obligation, \"forbidding to marry\" (), and imposing poverty as a duty on all.\nThese counsels have been analyzed as a way to keep the world from distracting the soul, on the grounds that the principal good things of this world easily divide themselves into three classes. There are the riches which make life easy and pleasant, there are the pleasures of the flesh which appeal to the appetites, and, lastly, there are honors and positions of authority which delight the self-love of the individual. These three matters, in themselves often innocent and not forbidden to the devout Christian, may yet, even when no kind of sin is involved, hold back the soul from its true aim and vocation, and delay it from becoming entirely conformed to the will of God. It is, therefore, the object of the three counsels of perfection to free the soul from these hindrances. The love of riches is opposed by the counsel of poverty, the pleasures of the flesh (even the lawful pleasures of holy matrimony) are excluded by the counsel of chastity, while the desire for worldly power and honor is met by the counsel of holy obedience. Abstinence from unlawful indulgence in any of these directions is expected of all Christians as a matter of precept. The further voluntary abstinence from what is in itself lawful is the subject of the counsels, and such abstinence is not in itself meritorious, but only becomes so when it is done for the sake of Christ, and in order to be more free to serve him.\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia article ends with the following summary:\nIn a 1523 essay, Martin Luther criticized the Church for its doctrine that the evangelical counsels were supererogatory, arguing that the two-tiered system was a sophistic corruption of the teaching of Christ, intended to accommodate the vices of the aristocracy:\nYou are perturbed over Christ's injunction in Matthew 5, \"Do not resist evil, but make friends with your accuser; and if any one should take your coat, let him have your cloak as well.\" ... The sophists in the universities have also been perplexed by these texts. ... In order not to make heathen of the princes, they taught that Christ did not demand these things but merely offered them as advice or counsel to those who would be perfect. So Christ had to become a liar and be in error in order that the princes might come off with honor, for they could not exalt the princes without degrading Christ—wretched blind sophists that they are. And their poisonous error has spread thus to the whole world until everyone regards these teachings of Christ not as precepts binding on all Christians alike but as mere counsels for the perfect.\n\nDietrich Bonhoeffer argues that the interpretation of the evangelical counsels as supererogatory acquiesces in what he calls \"cheap grace,\" lowering the standard of Christian teaching:\nThe difference between ourselves and the rich young man is that he was not allowed to solace his regrets by saying: \"Never mind what Jesus says, I can still hold on to my riches, but in a spirit of inner detachment. Despite my inadequacy I can take comfort in the thought that God has forgiven me my sins and can have fellowship with Christ in faith.\" But no, he went away sorrowful. Because he would not obey, he could not believe. In this the young man was quite honest. He went away from Jesus and indeed this honesty had more promise than any apparent communion with Jesus based on disobedience.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24051486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24051486", "title": "Gurung shamanism", "text": "Gurung shamanism\n\nGurung Shamanism is one of the oldest religions in Nepal. It describes the traditional shamanistic religion of the Gurung people of Nepal.\n\nGurung shamanism has been often cited in scholarly texts as well as Hindu world of thought as \"Gurung dharma\", but the latter term is considered inaccurate as it is not considered a form of dharma by its adherents, but rather an ancient shamanistic belief system.\n\nGurung villages have their own local deities. Gurung shamanism ascribes fundamental symbolic significance to death. The rites, called \"pae\" (also \"pai\" and \"pe\"), are often shamanistic analogs or compliments to Tibetan Buddhist rituals. The funerary rite is the central ceremony, entailing three days and two nights of rituals to send souls to the Land of the Ancestors. These rituals may be officiated by either Klehpri, Pachyu, or Bonpo Lamas (pre-Buddhist lamas). Among the Gurung, death involves the dissolution of bodily elements – earth, air, fire, and water. These elements are released in a series of rituals, nine for men and seven for women. One ritual in the freeing of souls involves a \"Klehpri\" injecting the spirit of the deceased through a string into a bird, which then appears to recognize family members and otherwise act unnaturally. The bird is symbolically sacrificed with the plucking of a few feathers, received by family members, after which the bird is released. Once in the Land of the Ancestors, life continues much as in this world, however the spirit is able to take other incarnations. From the Land of the Ancestors, spirits continue to take an interest in their surviving kinsmen, able to work good and evil in the realm of the living.\n\nAccording to Gurung shamanism, the dead are either cremated or buried. After the cremation or burial, the family of the deceased constructs a small shrine on a hill to offer food to the spirit, which remains and may cause misfortune. Sons of the deceased observe mourning for six to twelve months, during which they fast from meat and alcohol. A final funerary ceremony takes places a year or more after death, for which an expensive funeral rite is performed. This rite includes an effigy (called a \"pla\") of the deceased, draped in white cloth and decorated with ornaments. The death rituals close as \"klehpri\" addresses the spirit and sends it to its resting place, after which the hilltop shrine is dismantled. Further rites ensue, during which the priest recites supplications to the \"spirits of the four directions\" for kind treatment as the deceased makes his way to the spirit realm, advises the departing soul on its choice between reincarnation and remaining in the Land of Ancestors, and admonishes it to stay away from its worldly cares and not to return prematurely.\n\nGurungs employ three categories of priesthood – Ghyapri, Pachyu and Bon Lama – each following different practices\n\nThe \"ghyabri\" are involved with funerary rituals and play drums and large brass cymbals. The \"ghyabri\" have no sacred literature, learning all prayers and rituals by heart over several years. These sacred oral scriptures are called \"Pye tan Lu tan\". The sacred language, Gurung-kura, is no longer understood by laity nor practitioners, and may be derived from an ancient religion.\n\nShamans called \"pachyu\" operate in Gurung communities and in tribal and Hindu communities of Nepal, being most numerous in the Modi Valley. Their practice is largely in the realm of interpreting the supernatural. While their ritual language is also archaic, it is more readily understood by practitioners and laity. Practices of \"pachyu\" have been influenced by Buddhist teaching, and they are often associated in various rites with lamas. They are also believed to communicate with spirits and local deities and are often employed by persons suffering illnesses or misfortunes to draw up horoscopes.\n\nBoth \"pachyu\" and \"ghyabri/klehpri\" are called upon to exorcise possessed people, perform mortuary rites, and officiate ancestor worship.\n\nCenturies of cultural influence from Tibet resulted in many Gurungs gradually embracing Tibetan Buddhism over the centuries, especially the Nyingma school, and particularly among Gurungs in the Manang region. Gurungs generally believe in Buddha and bodhisattvas. Mainstream Tibetan Buddhist lamas harbor ambivalent opinions about Gurung Dharma (Pye Ta Lu Ta) practices, and syncretic Gurung Dharma may be reluctant to disclose their practices to outsiders.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Nepal Census, 69.03% of the ethnic Gurung identified as Buddhists, 28.75% as Hindus, and 0.66% as Christians.\n\n"}

He also runs a blog on Patheos, Friendly Atheist, in which he and his associates publish articles several times a day.\n\nHemant Mehta was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1983. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2004 with a double degree in math and biology and began teaching in 2007. He acquired a master's degree in math education from DePaul University in 2010 and a national board certification in teaching in 2012. He taught high school math at Neuqua Valley High School until 2014 when he announced on Facebook and his blog that he had submitted his resignation to the school, citing that \"As much as I love being in the classroom, the opportunities online are just a lot greater right now, and I don’t want to have any regrets down the road about not taking this chance while I have it.\" After his resignation, he stayed on as the head coach of the school's speech team.\n\nMehta was raised in the Jain faith, which purportedly led to his current vegetarian diet. He became an atheist as a teenager. Seeking to learn more about what motivated many Americans to be religious, he decided to attend and take notes at a number of churches across the United States. He based his choice of churches to attend on the results of an eBay auction in which he offered his bidders, ”I am an atheist. You can bid on where I go to church or a temple or a mosque, etc.\" Mehta's experiences at the churches became the basis for his book, \"I Sold My Soul on eBay\". He is the father of two children.\n\nHemant Mehta established a secular student group, Students WithOut Religious Dogma (SWORD), at the University of Illinois at Chicago while earning dual degrees there. Later, still in college, he served as board chair for the Secular Student Alliance. He interned at the Center for Inquiry where he became familiar with a lot of the national organizations and leaders in the activist world at that time. Now, he serves on the board of directors for the Foundation Beyond Belief, a non-profit charitable organization. \nMehta is a regular speaker at freethought and skeptical events around the U.S. He attempts to build bridges of understanding between believers and non-believers through his blog, \"The Friendly Atheist\". Due in part to his positive message, he is also invited to speak at atheist events such as the one he presented at The Reason Rally or at the American Atheists Annual Convention in March 2012.\n\nA vocal advocate of building an atheist community, Mehta's activism includes fundraising for charitable causes. He helped establish and serves on the board of the Foundation Beyond Belief, which has raised more than $2,400,000 since it launched in 2010. He also established a church cleanup fund in response to reports of church vandalism in Bend, Oregon, in 2012. The vandals tagged the church with allusions to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and Mehta's readers contributed nearly $3,000 in one day to help clean up the damage.\n\nMehta writes for the \"On Faith\" column in the \"Washington Post\" and has been featured in a \"New York Times\" debate on prayer.\n\nWhen asked about his beliefs his response is clear: \"Simply put, I have never seen any evidence of 'God's work' in action. I've seen what people think is God's work, but which actually has perfectly natural explanations. I believe that most people are good, even when nobody's looking. I believe our best path to discovering the truth lies in science, not religion.\"\n\nHemant Mehta continues to challenge religious believers with straight talk in a non-confrontational fashion. In June 2013 he wrote for the \"Room for Debate\" series in the \"New York Times\", where he argued that \"There’s a very real downside to praying. It lulls believers into a false sense of accomplishment.\" In July 2013 he held an open discussion at the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he explained his frustration at being confronted time and again with the same arguments for believing in God. He also commented that \"Many Christians had negative stereotypes about atheists that prevented fruitful conversation.\"\n\nMehta was a guest on CNN on August 20, 2013 to discuss the rise of atheism among the millennial generation. Also in 2013 he began publishing \"The Atheist Voice\" series of video discussions on YouTube, which had over 190,000 subscribers in October 2017.\n\nIn January 2006, Hemant Mehta posted an auction on eBay where he explained his background in atheism and offered to go to the worship services of the winning bidder's choosing. The auction ended on February 3, 2006 with a final bid of $504 from Jim Henderson, a minister from Seattle, Washington. Mehta later donated that money to the Secular Student Alliance, a non-profit organization for which he served as chair of the board of directors.\n\nNearly a month after the auction, an article about Mehta's experiences appeared on the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\", leading to a flurry of media coverage. He was featured in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", the \"Seattle Times\", and the \"Village Voice\", and on National Public Radio. Henderson asked Mehta to visit a variety of churches and write about the experiences on Henderson's website, offthemap.com. Mehta eventually wrote about his visits at nine different churches as well as two additional pieces dealing with atheist conventions and Christian media. \"I Sold My Soul on eBay\" contains Mehta's observations and critiques of the churches along with background on how he became an atheist.\n\nOther published works include \"The Young Atheist's Survival Guide\" published in 2012 and \"The Friendly Atheist: Thoughts on the Role of Religion in Politics and Media\" published in 2013. The former is aimed at students, teachers, and parents who may face ostracism due to their lack of religious belief. The latter is intended as a study guide for the many things written by Mehta.\n\nIn August 2014, Mehta announced his latest project, \"He is an Abusive Boyfriend (and you should break up)\", based on his YouTube series, The Atheist Voice.

The Brahmins (Hindu priests class) of ancient South India (Tamilakam, Telengana, Karnataka) were classified as Pancha-Dravida (The Five Dravidians). The Hindus in South India are followers of various Hindu branches such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Brahmanism and others. Hinduism was the state religion of most of the South Indian kingdoms. During the Ancient and Middle Ages were built in South India one of the greatest Hindu temples. South Indian kings such as the Cholas spread Hinduism overseas to parts of Southeast Asia. The activities of South India across the Palk Strait led to survival of Hinduism in Sri Lanka. The Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka are followers of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta, which is mainly practiced in parts of South India. Some Hindu festivals are celebrated mostly or exclusively in South India and Sri Lanka. In South India are also numerous Hindu pilgrimage site that is visited annually by thousands of devotees. The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh is considered to be the most-visited holy place in the world. The Cauvery river that flows through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is also known as the \"Ganges of South\" and is one of the most sacred river of the Hindus.\n\nThe Vedic culture in South India has been in some respects the best preserved of ancient Vedic culture and traditions. In North India during late ancient and medieval periods, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam flourished alongside the Hindu majority. Every intermixing influenced North Indian culture, in particular Islam. The influence of Islam, specifically Sufism, and Sikhism are widespread in the modern-day North Indian society, clearly palpable in linguistics, music, attire, etc. Much of this influence can be attributed to close to a millennium of Muslim rule across North India. Unlike in the North, South India had less outside influence until the advent of European imperialists. As such the original Hindu traditions are relatively better preserved in South India than in North India.\n\nTamil literature and Tamil epics and classics have many references to Vedic gods and culture. The Tolkaappiyam, 1st century BCE grammar book, mentions non-Vedic, early-Vedic (Indra, Varuna) and Puranic (Vishnu) gods. The Paripadal (8; 3; 9 etc.), one of the \"Eight Anthologies\" of poetry (or ettuttokai), has homages to Vishnu, Lakshmi, Brahma, the twelve Adityas, the Ashvins, the Rudras, the Saptarishis, Indra, the Devas etc. The Kural, written by Tiruvalluvar, mentions gods like Indra (25) and Lakshmi (e.g. 167).\n\nThe Sangam Tamil epic Silappathikaram, begins with invocations to Chandra, Surya, and Indra, and has homages to Agni, Varuna, Shiva, Subrahmanya, Vishnu-Krishna, Uma, etc. The epic states that “Vedic sacrifices [are] being faultlessly performed” and has many references to Vedic culture and Vedic texts. In the Buddhist work Manimekhalai, the submersion of the city Puhar in Kumari Kandam is attributed to the neglect of the worship to Indra.\n\nAccording to the Puranas, the Dravidians are descendants of the Vedic Turvasha people. According to the Matsya Purana, Manu is considered as a south Indian king. In Hindu tradition the creation of the Tamil language is credited to the Rig Vedic sage Rishi Agastya.\n\n\n"}

It usually consists of two round mochi (rice cakes), the smaller placed atop the larger, and a daidai (a Japanese bitter orange) with an attached leaf on top.

It sits on a stand called a over a sheet called a , which is supposed to ward off fires from the house for the following years. Sheets of paper called folded into lightning shapes similar to those seen on sumo wrestler's belts are also attached.\n\nThe \"kagami mochi\" first appeared in the Muromachi period (14th–16th century). The name \"kagami\" (\"mirror\") is said to have originated from its resemblance to an old-fashioned kind of round copper mirror, which also had a religious significance. The reason for it is not clear. Explanations include \"mochi\" being a food for special days, the spirit of the rice plant being found in the mochi, and the mochi being a food which gives strength.\n\nThe two mochi discs are variously said to symbolize the going and coming years, the human heart, \"yin\" and \"yang\", or the moon and the sun. The \"daidai\", whose name means \"generations\", is said to symbolize the continuation of a family from generation to generation.\n\nTraditionally the kagami mochi was placed in various locations throughout the house. Nowadays it is usually placed in a household Shinto altar, or kamidana. It has also been placed in the tokonoma, a small decorated alcove in the main room of the home. \n\nContemporary kagami mochi are often pre-moulded into the shape of stacked discs and sold in plastic packages in the supermarket. A mikan or a plastic imitation daidai is often substituted for the original \"daidai\".\n\nVariations in the shape of kagami mochi are also seen. In some regions, three layered kagami mochi are also used. The three layered kagami mochi are placed on the butsudan or on the kamidana. There is also a variant decoration called an \"okudokazari\" placed in the centre of the kitchen or by the window which has three layers of mochi.\n\nIt is traditionally broken and eaten in a Shinto ritual called \"kagami biraki\" (mirror opening) on the second Saturday or Sunday of January.

There were 55 women that Young was sealed to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were \"for eternity\" (i.e., in the afterlife), some were \"for time only\" (until death). However, it is suspected that not all of the 55 marriages were conjugal, and Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on numbering. A book published in 1887 gives brief biographical sketches and photos of a total of 26 wives.\n\nOf his 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.\n\nAt the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him, with the status of four unknown.

{"id": "1082730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1082730", "title": "Madhvacharya", "text": "Madhvacharya\n\nMadhvacharya (; ; ; CE 1238–1317 ), sometimes anglicised as Madhva Acharya, and also known as Pūrna Prajña Tīrtha and Ānanda Tīrtha, was a Hindu philosopher and the chief proponent of the \"Dvaita\" (dualism) school of Vedanta. Madhva called his philosophy \"Tatvavāda\" meaning \"arguments from a realist viewpoint\".\n\nMadhvacharya was born on the west coast of Karnataka state in 13th-century India. As a teenager, he became a Sanyasi (monk) joining Brahma-sampradaya guru Achyutapreksha, of the Ekadandi order. Madhva studied the classics of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Principal Upanishads, the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the Brahma Sutras (\"Prasthanatrayi\"). He commented on these, and is credited with thirty seven works in Sanskrit. His writing style was of extreme brevity and condensed expression. His greatest work is considered to be the \"Anuvyakhyana\", a philosophical supplement to his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras composed with a poetic structure. In some of his works, he proclaimed himself to be an avatar of Vayu, the son of god Vishnu.\n\nHe was a critic of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta teachings. He toured India several times, visiting places such as Bengal, Varanasi, Dwarka, Goa and Kanyakumari, engaging in philosophical debates and visiting Hindu centres of learning. Madhva established the Krishna Mutt at Udupi with a murti secured from Dwarka Gujarat in CE 1285.\n\nMadhvācārya's teachings are built on the premise that there is a fundamental difference between Atman (individual soul, self) and the Brahman (ultimate reality, God Vishnu), these are two different unchanging realities, with individual soul dependent on Brahman, never identical. His school's theistic dualism teachings disagreed with the monist teachings of the other two most influential schools of Vedanta based on Advaita's nondualism and Vishishtadvaita's qualified nondualism. Liberation, asserted Madhva, is achievable only through the grace of God. The Dvaita school founded by Madhva influenced Vaishnavism, the Bhakti movement in medieval India, and has been one of the three influential Vedānta philosophies, along with Advaita Vedanta and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Madhva's historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive.\n\nThe biography of Madhvacharya is unclear. Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period, but some place him about the 1199-1278 period.\n\nMadhvācārya was born in Pajaka near Udupi, a coastal district in the present day Indian state of Karnataka. Traditionally it is believed that Naddantillaya (Sanskrit: Madhyageha, Madhyamandira) was the name of his father and Vedavati was Madhvācārya's mother. Born in a Tulu speaking Vaishnavite Brahmin household, he was named Vāsudeva. Later he became famous by the names Purnaprajna, Anandatirtha and Madhvacarya (or just Madhva). Pūrnaprajña was the name given to him at the time of his initiation into \"sannyasa\" (renunciation), as a teenager. The name conferred on him when he became the head of his monastery was \"Ānanda Tīrtha\". All three of his later names are found in his works. Madhvācārya or Madhva are names most commonly found in modern literature on him, or Dvaita Vedanta related literature.\n\nMadhva began his school after his Upanayana at age seven, became a monk or \"Sannyasi\" in his teenage. He joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat), accepted his guru to be Achyutrapreksha, who is also referred to as Achyutraprajna in some sources. Madhva studied the Upanishads and the Advaita literature, but was unconvinced by its nondualism philosophy of oneness of human soul and god, had frequent disagreements with his guru, left the monastery, and began his own Dvaita movement based on dualism premises of \"Dvi\" – asserting that human soul and god (as Vishnu) are two different things. Madhva never acknowledged Achyutrapreksha as his guru or his monastic lineage in his writings.\n\nAccording to Dehsen, perhaps there were two individuals named Madhvacharya in 13th century India, with Anandatirtha – the younger Madhva being the most important early disciple of the elder Madhvacharya, and their works and life overlapped in Udupi, \"Tattvavada\" being the name adopted for Dvaita Vedanta by Anandatirtha. Madhvacharya established a \"matha\" (monastery) dedicated to Dvaita philosophy, and this became the sanctuary for a series of Dvaita scholars such as Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Vadiraja Tirtha and Raghavendra Tirtha who followed in footsteps of Madhva.\n\nA number of hagiographies have been written by Madhva's disciples and followers. Of these, the most referred to is the sixteen cantos Sanskrit biography \"Madhvavijaya\" by Nārāyana Panditācārya – son of Trivikrama Pandita, who himself was a disciple of Madhva.\n\nIn several of his texts, state Sarma and other scholars, \"Madhvacharya proclaims himself to be the third avatar or incarnation of Vayu, wind god, the son of Vishnu\". He, thus, asserted himself to be like Hanuman – the first avatar of Vayu, and Bhima – a Pandava in the Mahabharata and the second avatar of Vayu. In one of his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras, he asserts that the authority of the text is from his personal encounter with Vishnu. Madhva, states Sarma, believed himself to be an intermediary between Vishnu and Dvaita devotees, guiding the latter in their journey towards Vishnu.\n\nThirty seven Dvaita texts are attributed to Madhvacharya. Of these, thirteen are bhasya (review and commentary) on earliest Principal Upanishads, a \"Madhva-bhasya\" on the foundational text of Vedanta school of Hinduism – Brahma Sutras, another \"Gita-bhasya\" on Bhagavad Gita, a commentary on forty hymns of the Rigveda, a review of the Mahabharata in poetic style, a commentary called \"Bhagavata-tatparya-nirnaya\" on Bhagavata Purana, plus stotras, poems and texts on bhakti of Vishnu and his avatars. The \"Anu-Vyakhyana\", a supplement to Madhvacharya's commentary on Brahma Sutras, is his masterpiece, states Sharma.\n\nWhile being a profusely productive writer, Madhvacharya restricted the access to and distribution of his works to outsiders who were not part of Dvaita school, according to Sarma. However, Bartley disagrees and states that this is inconsistent with the known history of extensive medieval Vedantic debates on religious ideas in India which included Dvaita school's ideas.\n\nThe premises and foundations of Dvaita Vedanta, also known as \"Dvaitavada\" and \"Tattvavada\", are credited to Madhvacharya. His philosophy championed unqualified dualism. Madhva's work is classically placed in contrast with monist ideas of Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta.\n\nMadhva calls epistemology as \"Anu pramana\". It accepts three \"pramāna\", that is three correct means of knowledge, in contrast to one of Charvaka and six of Advaita schools of Hindu philosophies:\n\nMadhva and his followers introduced \"kevala-pramana\" as the \"knowledge of an object as it is\", separate from \"anu-pramana\" described above.\n\nMadhva's Dvaita school holds that Vishnu as God, who is also Hari, Krishna, Vasudeva and Narayana, can only be known through the proper \"samanvaya\" (connection) and \"pramana\" of the Vedic scriptural teachings. Vishnu, according to Madhvacharya, is not the creator of the Vedas, but the teacher of the Vedas. Knowledge is intrinsically valid, states Madhva's school, and the knower and the known are independently real. Both the ritual part (\"karma-kanda\", Mimamsa) and the knowledge part (\"jnana-kanda\", Upanishadic Vedanta) in the Vedas, asserted Madhvacharya, are equally valid and interconnected whole. As asserted by the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy, Madhvacharya held that the Vedas are author-less, and that their truth is in all of its parts (i.e. the , , and )...\n\nThe metaphysical reality is plural, stated Madhvacharya. There are primarily two \"tattvas\" or categories of reality — ' (independent reality) and ' (dependent reality). Ishvara (as God Vishnu or Krishna) is the cause of the universe and the only independent reality, in Madhvacharya's view. The created universe is the dependent reality, consisting of ' (individual souls) and \"Jada\" (matter, material things). Individual souls are plural, different and distinct realities. 's are sentient and matter is non-sentient, according to Madhvacharya.\n\nMadhva further enumerates the difference between dependent and independent reality as a fivefold division (\"pancha-bheda\") between God, souls and material things. These differences are:\n(1) Between material things;\n(2) Between material thing and soul;\n(3) Between material thing and God;\n(4) Between souls; and\n(5) Between soul and God.\n\nThis difference is neither temporary nor merely practical; it is an invariable and natural property of everything. Madhva calls it \"Taratamya\" (gradation in pluralism). There is no object like another, according to Madhvacharya. There is no soul like another. All souls are unique, reflected in individual personalities. The sea is full; the tank is full; a pot is full; everything is full, yet each fullness is different, asserted Madhvacharya.\n\nEven in liberation (moksha), states Madhvacharya, the bliss is different for each person, based on each's degree of knowledge and spiritual perfection. This liberation, according to him, is only achievable with grace of God Krishna.\n\nMadhva conceptualised Brahman as a being who enjoys His own bliss, while the entire universe evolves through a nebulous chaos. He manifests, every now and then, to help the evolution process. The four primary manifestation of Him as the Brahman are, according to Madhva, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarasana, which are respectively responsible for the redemptive, creative, sustaining and destructive aspects in the universe. His secondary manifestations are many, and all manifestations are at par with each other, it is the same infinite no matter how He manifests. Brahman is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter. For liberation, mere intellectual conceptualization of Brahman as creator is not enough, the individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and devotional surrender to Him, and only His grace leads to redemption and liberation, according to Madhva.\n\nThe Vishnu as Brahman concept of Madhvacharya is a concept similar to God in major world religions. His writings led some early colonial-era Indologists such as George Abraham Grierson to suggest the 13th-century Madhva was influenced by Christianity, but later scholarship has rejected this theory.\n\nOne of the Mahavakyas (great sayings) in Hinduism is \"Tat tvam asi\", or \"Thou art That\", found in verse 6.8.7 of the ~700 BCE text Chandogya Upanishad. This section of Chandogya Upanishad is credited to sage Uddalaka and the text considered central in Vedanta and the Brahma Sutras, interpreted to mean that there is no difference between the soul within (Thou) and the Brahman (That). The Dvaita school led by Madhva reinterpreted this section, by parsing the Sanskrit text as \"Atat tvam asi\" or \"Thou are not That\", asserting that there is no Sanskrit rule which does not allow such parsing. He accepted that the tradition and prior scholars had all interpreted the text to be \"Tat tvam asi\", but then asserted that there is no metaphysical or logical requirement that he should too.\n\nMadhvacharya considered Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga to be insufficient to the path of liberation without Bhakti. Narayana or Vishnu was the supreme God to Madhva, who can only be reached through Vayu – the son of God; further, states Madhva, faith leads to the grace of God, and grace leads to the liberation of soul.\n\nThe knowledge of God, for Madhvacharya, is not a matter of intellectual acceptance of the concept, but an attraction, affection, constant attachment, loving devotion and complete surrender to the grace of God. He rejects monist theories that knowledge liberates, asserting instead that it is Divine grace through Bhakti that liberates. To Madhva, God obscures reality by creating Maya and Prakriti, which causes bondage and suffering; and only God can be the source of soul's release. Liberation occurs when, with the grace of God, one knows the true nature of self and the true nature of God.\n\nEvil and suffering in the world, according to Madhvacharya, originates in man, and not God. Every \"Jiva\" (individual soul) is the agent of actions, not \"Jada\" (matter), and not \"Ishvara\" (God). While Madhva asserts each individual self is the \"Kartritva\" (real agency), the self is not an absolutely independent agent to him. This is because, states Madhva, the soul is influenced by sensory organs, one's physical body and such material things which he calls as gifts of God. Man has free will, but is influenced by his innate nature, inclinations and past karma.\n\nMadhvacharya asserts, \"Yathecchasi tatha kuru\", which Sharma translates and explains as \"one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk\". Madhva does not address the problem of evil, that is how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. According to Sharma, \"Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil\". According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God \"could change the system, but chooses not to\" and thus sustains the evil in the world. This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.\n\nMoral laws and ethics exist, according to Madhva, and are necessary for the grace of God and for liberation.\n\nMadhvacharya was a fierce critic of competing Vedanta schools, and other schools of Indian philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. He wrote up arguments against twenty one ancient and medieval era Indian scholars to help establish the foundations of his own school of thought.\n\nMadhvacharya was fiercest critic of Advaita Vedanta, accusing Shankara and Advaitins for example, as \"deceitful demons\" teaching Buddhism under the cover of Vedanta. Advaita's nondualism asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are blissful and identical, unchanging transcendent Reality, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. Madhva in contrast asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. Madhva criticized Advaita as being a version of Mahayana Buddhism, which he regarded as nihilistic. Of all schools, Madhva focussed his criticism on Advaita most, and he wrote four major texts, including \"Upadhikhandana\" and \"Tattvadyota\", primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.\n\nMadhvacharya disagreed with aspects of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita. Vishishtadvaita school, a realist system of thought like Madhvacharya's Dvaita school, also asserts that Jiva (human souls) and Brahman (as Vishnu) are different, a difference that is never transcended. God Vishnu alone is independent, all other gods and beings are dependent on Him, according to both Madhvacharya and Ramanuja. However, in contrast to Madhvacharya's views, Vishishtadvaita school asserts \"qualified non-dualism\", that souls share the same essential nature of Brahman, and that there is a universal sameness in the quality and degree of bliss possible for human souls, and every soul can reach the bliss state of God Himself. While the older school of Vishishtadvaita asserted \"qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls\", states Sharma, Madhvacharya asserted both \"qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls\".\n\nShankara's Advaita school and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.\n\nMadhvacharya's style of criticism of other schools of Indian philosophy was part of the ancient and medieval Indian tradition. He was part of the Vedanta school, which emerged in post-Vedic period as the most influential of the six schools of Hindu philosophy, and his targeting of Advaita tradition, states Bryant, reflects it being the most influential of Vedanta schools.\n\nMadhvacharya views represent a subschool of Vaishnavism, just like Ramanuja's. Both championed Vishnu, often in the \"saguna\" form of Vishnu's avatar Krishna. However, 11th-century Ramanuja's ideas have been most influential in Vaishnavism.\n\nMadhvacharya's ideas led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism in Karnataka, also referred to as \"Vyasakuta\", \"Dasakuta\" or \"Dasa Dasapantha\", known for their devotional songs and music during the Bhakti movement.\n\nOther influential subschools of Vaishnavism competed with the ideas of Madhvacharya, such as the Chaitanya subschool, whose Jiva Gosvami asserts only Krishna is \"Svayam Bhagavan\" (original form of God), in contrast to Madhva who asserts that all Vishnu avatars are equal and identical, with both sharing the belief that emotional devotion to God is the means to spiritual liberation. According to Sharma, the influence of Madhva's Dvaita ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of Bengal Vaishnavism, and in Assam.\n\nA subsect of Gaudiya Vaishnavas from Orissa and West Bengal claim to be followers of Madhvacharya. Madhva established in Udupi Krishna Matha attached to a god Krishna temple. Gaudiya Vaishnavas also worship Krishna, who is in the mode of Vrindavana.\n\nMadhvacharya was misperceived and misrepresented by both Christian missionaries and Hindu writers during the colonial era scholarship. The similarities in the primacy of one God, dualism and distinction between man and God, devotion to God, the son of God as the intermediary, predestination, the role of grace in salvation, as well as the similarities in the legends of miracles in Christianity and Madhvacharya's Dvaita tradition fed these stories. Among Christian writers, GA Grierson creatively asserted that Madhva's ideas evidently were \"borrowed from Christianity, quite possibly promulgated as a rival to the central doctrine of that faith\". Among Hindu writers, according to Sarma, SC Vasu creatively translated Madhvacharya's works to identify Madhvacharya with Christ, rather than compare their ideas.\n\nModern scholarship rules out the influence of Christianity on Madhvacharya, as there is no evidence that there ever was a Christian settlement where Madhvacharya grew up and lived, or that there was a sharing or discussion of ideas between someone with knowledge of the Bible and Christian legends, and him.\n\nMadhvacharya established eight \"mathas\" (monasteries) in Udupi. These are referred to as \"Madhva mathas\", or \"Udupi ashta matha\", and include Palimaru matha, Adamaru matha, Krishnapura matha, Puttige matha, Shirur matha, Sodhe matha, Kaniyooru matha and Pejavara matha. These eight surround the \"Anantheswara\" Krishna Hindu temple. The matha are laid out in a rectangle, the temples on a square grid pattern. The monks in the matha are sannyasis, and the tradition of their studies and succession (Paryaya system) were established by Madhvacharya.\n\nThere are Madhva mathas set up all over India. Including those in Udupi, there are twenty four Madhva mathas in India. The main center of Madhva's tradition is in Karnataka. The monastery has a pontiff system, that rotates after a fixed period of time. The pontiff is called \"Swamiji\", and he leads daily Krishna prayers according to Madhva tradition, as well as annual festivals. The process and Vedic mantra rituals for Krishna worship in Dvaita monasteries follow the procedure written by Madhvacharya in \"Tantrasara\". The Krishna worship neither involves \"bali\" (sacrifice) nor any fire rituals.\n\nThe succession ceremony in Dvaita school involves the outgoing Swamiji welcoming the incoming one, then walking together to the icon of Madhvacharya at the entrance of Krishna temple in Udupi, offering water to him, expressing reverence then handing over the same vessel with water that Madhvacharya used when he handed over the leadership of the monastery he founded.\n\nThe monastery include kitchens, \"bhojan-shala\", run by monks and volunteers. These serve food daily to nearly 3,000 to 4,000 monks, students and visiting pilgrims without social discrimination. During succession ceremonies, over 10,000 people are served a vegetarian meal by Udupi \"bhojan-shalas\".\n\nIn 1986 a film directed by G. V. Iyer named \"Madhvacharya\" was premiered, it was one of the films made entirely in Sanskrit language in which all of Jagadguru Madhvacharya's works were compiled.\n\n\n\n"}

He was lifelong editor of the works of St. Ambrose. At the request of Pope Pius XII, he contributed to the preparation of the dogma of the assumption of Mary and organized new Papal charity and Papal refugee offices during World War II.\n\nOtto Faller was born on 18 February 1889 in Saig, a small village in the Black Forest. He entered the Jesuit Order in 1910. As Jesuits had been outlawed in Germany since the time of the Kulturkampf, he studied theology in Tisis, Austria, and Valkenburg, Holland. After his philosophical and theological studies, he studied classical languages in Vienna and Münster, Germany. Otto Faller obtained two doctorates, in theology and philosophy. In 1918 he was ordained priest and in 1924 he began teaching at the prestigious Kolleg Stella Matutina in Feldkirch, Austria.\n\nAt first educator, then teacher, he was named director (dean) of the Stella Matutina Kolleg in Feldkirch, Austria. After the Nazis passed the \"1000 Mark law\" in 1933, which de facto prohibited any German entering Austria without prior payment of the tax and thus excluded German students from attending Austrian schools, he helped in the foundation of Kolleg St. Blasien in the Black Forest and became its dean. Five years later, the National Socialist forced the closing of the school, which was to become an Adolf Hitler school. Like several other Jesuits, he was asked to leave Germany, despite an ardent protest by the local bishop.\n\nOtto Faller went to Rome, where the General of the Jesuit Order Wlodimir Ledochowski named him Professor at the Gregorian University and Father Superior at the Scriptorium, then the residence of Jesuit scholars in Rome. Together with Monsignor Ferdinando Baldelli, he was asked in 1943 by Pope Pius XII to develop a Papal charity Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza from scratch. This was developed quickly in cooperation with the charity efforts of Sister Pascalina Lehnert and Monsignore Giovanni Battista Montini. In 1944 the Pope asked him to form a new Papal refugee office to assist the tens of thousands of displaced persons in Italy.\n\nIn this capacity he was involved in the organisation of charities, especially food items, clothing and shelter for Italians and displaced persons, the negotiation of the transfer of all portable religious art from Monte Cassino, prior to its destruction. Much effort was devoted behind the scenes to a plan by the Pope, to create a Papal fleet in order to allow refugees to leave Europe for the Americas and to bring in badly needed food shipments from there; safe conduct could not be obtained by the war parties.\n\nAfter the war in 1946 he returned to the Black Forest and reopened Kolleg St. Blasien against the initial advice of his superiors, but with significant material assistance of Pope Pius XII via Madre Pascalina Lehnert. In 1949, he initiated the formation of a nationwide Jesuit alumni association.\n\nAs a leading educator and Dean, Faller had experienced the State, to determine content and orientation of education on a local and national level at the expense of private educational institutions. In 1949, he formed an alliance of Catholic, Protestant and secular non-governmental schools to assure some freedom for private educational institutions especially in the State of Baden-Württemberg. They succeeded in influencing relevant legislation in several State parliaments and on the national level. On 24 September 1967, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany awarded him the pour le merite first class for his effort.\n\nIn 1950, the Jesuit general Jean-Baptiste Janssens named Father Otto Faller the head the German Jesuit Province, which included in those days the province of Kerala in India and parts of Indonesia. As Provincial, he continued pushing for the interests of private schools in Germany. In 1951, he forwarded all necessary documentation for the beatification of Rupert Mayer to Rome, and successfully supported it: Only five years later, in 1956, Pope Pius XII declared Rupert Mayer a Servant of God. Otto Faller was considered to be intelligent, compassionate, caring but also strict as superior. In 1970, he referred apologetically to this: \"Do not remind me of the time of my youthful transgressions.\" After a heart attack in 1956, he stepped down and continued his publications of Ambrose for the Commission for Editing the Corpus of the Latin Church Fathers (CSEL) in Vienna, Austria. He died at Kolleg St. Blasien on 16 May 1971.\nMany of the writings of Faller are in various Journals. In \"Stimmen der Zeit\", Otto Faller published a number of articles on patristic topics. Aside from his book on the assumption, his main focus was St. Ambrose.\n\nWhile in Rome, preparations for the dogma of the Assumption of Mary were underway. Because the early centuries of Christianity were silent on this, the Church had a problem of explanation. Pope Pius XII asked Otto Faller, then a patristic scholar at Gregorian University, to research this issue. Faller published his book in 1946, \"On the Silence of the Early Centuries\" in Latin. The publication, while getting the praises of Pope Pius XII and Pope Paul VI, did not put all questions to rest and he did not continue this line of thought after 1946.\n\nEarlier, Otto Faller began research on the writings of Ambrose of Milan, one of only four Church Fathers and a Doctor of the Church. His publications focused on the authenticity of several writings attributed to Ambrose. At the expressed wish of Pope Pius XI, a devoted Ambrose scholar and former head of the Ambrosian Library, he began research with a text critical edition of the works of Ambrose underway for the Academy of Science in Vienna since 1860. He published Ambrose works on the sacraments, explanation of symbols, the mysteries, confession, fath, Holy Spirit, and the death of emperors Theodosius and Valentinian. The letters of Ambrose he completed shortly before his death, but without, the all important prolegomina, which would have explained his apparatus and methods. Therefore, his last Ambrose publication Epistulae et acta raised some methodological questions.\n\n"}

Thus, in English, the Marian shrine can be called, Our Lady of Light.\n\nThe story of Our Lady of Light shrine and monastery is celebrated throughout Lebanon, a country where Christianity has existed since Jesus first evangelized in Tyre and Sidon, and therefore, Lebanon is often considered part of the “Holy Land.” Some of the first Christian communities were set up in Lebanon during the time of the apostles.\n\nIt is believed that two sailors built the shrine in the 4th century. One winter night, on a very stormy sea, the two sailors found themselves in peril. They began praying, and the Virgin appeared to them as a light and guided them gently to the shore of Theoprosopon near modern-day Chekka in North Lebanon. The grateful sailors carved a cave in the cliff and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary, and called the shrine, Our Lady of Light. A Greek Orthodox monastery was built in the 17th century. The miraculous icon of the Theotokos has been venerated for centuries for having glowed with light to attract wayward ships.\n\nThe shrine is a popular Christian pilgrimage site in Lebanon, and tourists and pilgrims alike enjoy the beautiful view of the bay from atop historic Cape Theoprosopon.\n"}

A theory suggested by David Hackett Fischer in his book \"Albion's Seed\" indicated early Quakers in the US preferred \"practical study\" to the more traditional studies of Greek or Latin popular with the elite. Another theory suggests their avoidance of dogma or clergy gave them a greater flexibility in response to science.\n\nDespite those arguments a major factor is agreed to be that the Quakers were initially discouraged or forbidden to go to the major law or humanities schools in Britain due to the Test Act. They also at times faced similar discriminations in the United States, as many of the colonial universities had a Puritan or Anglican orientation. This led them to attend \"Godless\" institutions or forced them to rely on hands-on scientific experimentation rather than academia.\n\nBecause of these issues it has been stated that Quakers are better represented in science than most religions. Some sources, including Pendlehill and Encyclopædia Britannica, indicate that for over two centuries they were overrepresented in the Royal Society. Mention is made of this possibility in studies referenced in religiosity and intelligence and in a book by Arthur Raistrick. Regardless of whether this is still accurate, there have been several noteworthy members of this denomination in science. The following names a few.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48949005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48949005", "title": "Sects of Sikhism", "text": "Sects of Sikhism\n\nSects of Sikhism are sub-traditions within Sikhism that believe in an alternate lineage of Gurus, or have a different interpretation of the Sikh scriptures, or believe in following a living guru, or other concepts that differ from the orthodox. The major historic sects of Sikhism, states Harjot Oberoi, have included Udasi, Nirmala, Nanakpanthi, Khalsa, Sahajdhari, Namdhari Kuka, Nirankari and Sarvaria.\n\nThe early Sikh sects were Udasis founded by Sri Chand – the elder son of Guru Nanak, and the Minas Prithi Chand – the elder son of Guru Ram Das respectively, in parallel to the official succession of the Sikh Gurus. Later on Ram Rai – son of Guru Har Rai formed his own sect at Dehradun and his followers are called Ram Raiyass. Many splintered Sikh communities formed during the period between the death of Guru Har Krishan and the coronation of Guru Tegh Bahadur. These sects have had considerable differences. Various other Sikh sects emerged over the Sikh history. Some of these sects were financially and administratively supported by the Mughal Empire in the hopes of gaining a more favorable and compliant citizenry.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sanatan Sikhs, Namdharis and Nirankaris sects were formed in Sikhism, seeking to reform and return to what each believed was the pure form of Sikhism. They also accepted the concept of living Gurus such as Guru Baba Dyal Singh. The Nirankari sect though unorthodox was influential in shaping the views of Tat Khalsa and the contemporary era Sikh beliefs and practices. Another significant Sikh sect of the 19th century was the Radhasoami movement in Punjab led by Baba Shiv Dyal. Other contemporary era Sikhs sects include the 3HO Sikhism, also referred to as Sikh Dharma Brotherhood formed in 1971. See also Dera (organization), non-Sikh Deras, for more examples of Sikh sects.\n\nRavidassia is considered a Sikh sect around the world.Their gurdwara services and beliefs are somewhat similar to mainstream Sikhism, although its followers do not necessarily need to keep uncut hair or Kesh. They also believe that Ravidas is a guru.\nUntil 2009, Ravidassias considered themselves a part of mainstream Sikhism. They decided to split themselves into a separate sect when there religious leader Ramanand Dass was shot dead by extremists in Vienna, Austria.\n\nUdasi has been an early sect based on the teachings of Sri Chand (1494–1643), the son of Guru Nanak, the founder and the first Guru of Sikhism. The Udasis do not reject the Sikh Gurus, but attach greater importance to the line of succession from Guru Nanak through Sri Chand to the Udasi mahants. They interpret the message of Guru Granth Sahib in Vedantic terms. They do not abide by the Khalsa's Rehat Maryada.\nUdasis are known for their \"Akharas\" along with the Nirmala sect of Sikhism. They accept asceticism and monastic traveler lifestyle. \"Udasi\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Udasin\", it literally means \"detached, journey\", and that reflects their approach to spiritual and temporal life. They were key in preserving Sikhism from extinction in the 18th century, after the death of Guru Gobind Singh and during the Mughal persecution, particularly in the decades between the martyrdom of Banda Singh Bahadur in 1716 and the rise of Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Empire. The Udasi ascetic \"akharas\" managed Gurdwaras, rebuilt them and preserved the Sikh scriptures. They were respected and patronized by Ranjit Singh through land grants and responsibility of temples. \n\nThe Udasis were key interpreters of the Sikh philosophy and the custodians of important Sikh shrines until the Singh Sabha movement. They brought a large number of people in the Sikh fold during the 18th and the early 19th centuries. Their religious practices are a syncretism of Sikhism and Hinduism. They accept images and statues of Sikh Gurus inside temples, as well as Hindu iconography. They greet each other with \"Om namo Brahmane\", and they practice Hatha yoga like the Hindus. When the Singh Sabha movement, dominated by Khalsa Sikhs, redefined the Sikh identity in the early 20th century, the Udasi mahants were expelled from the Sikh shrines. Since then, the Udasis have increasingly regarded themselves as Hindus rather than Sikhs.\n\nThe Miharvan sect followed Baba Prithi Chand (1558–1618), the eldest son of Guru Ram Das after the younger brother Guru Arjan was officially made the next Guru. They were called Minas by the orthodox Sikhs, a derogatory term meaning of \"scoundrels\". An alternate non-derogatory term for them has been the Miharvan Sikhs, after the son of Prithi Chand. This sect was shunned by orthodox Sikhs, declared by Guru Gobind Singh as one of the five \"Panj Mel\" that a Sikh must avoid.\n\nThey emerged in a period of religious persecution and inner dispute within the Sikh tradition during the 17th-century on the appropriateness of violence and non-violence in the pursuit of religious freedoms and spiritual matters. According to Hardip Syan and Pritam Singh, Miharvans emphasized more of the non-militant approach of Guru Nanak and earlier Gurus in theological pursuits, while the Guru Hargobind followers pursued the \"miri-piri\" approach and began militarizing the Sikh tradition to resist the Mughal persecution. The Miharvan-Minas controlled Amritsar and Harmandir Sahib built under Guru Arjan for much of the 17th-century. They are now nearly extinct.\n\nRam Raiyas are a sect of Sikhism who followed Ram Rai, the eldest son of Guru Har Rai. He was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (\"Asa ki Var\") that stated, \"the clay from a Musalman's grave is kneaded into potter's lump\", considering it an insult to Islam. Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting \"Musalman\" with \"Beiman\" (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved. The willingness to change a word led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a jagir (land grant) in Garhwal region (Uttarakhand). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after \"Dehra\" referring to Ram Rai's shrine. Many Sikhs settled with Ram Rai, they followed Guru Nanak, but orthodox Sikhs have shunned them. They were one of the Panj Mel, the five reprobate groups that orthodox Sikhs are expected to shun with contempt. The other four are the Minas, the Masands, the Dhirmalias, the Sir-gums (those Sikhs who accept Amrit baptism but subsequently cut their hair).\n\nA Nanakpanthi is a follower of the teachings of Guru Nanak, the first guru of Sikhism. The community transcends the boundaries of Sikhism and Hinduism, and was also a reference to the early Sikh community. Most Sindhi Hindu people are Nanakpanthi, and during the 1881 and 1891 censuses, the community could not decide whether to self-identify as Hindu or Sikh. In 1911, Shahpur District (Punjab) reported 12,539 Hindus (20% of the total Hindu population) identifying themselves as Nanakpanthi, in addition to 9,016 Sikhs (22% of the total Sikh population). The institutional focus of Nanakpanthi social life was around a \"dharamsala\", playing the same role before the 20th century as the Gurdwara has played thereafter under Khalsa dominated period. The beliefs and practices of the Nanakpanthis overlapped with those of Sahajdhari and Udasi Sikhs in pre-20th century period, as evidenced by documents dated to that period. In 1891 Census of British India, which was the first to categorize Sikhs into sects, 579,000 people identified themselves as \"Hindu Nanakpanthi\" and another 297,000 as \"Sikh Nanakpanthi\". The other major Sikh categories were \"Sikh Kesdhari\" and \"Gobind Singhi Sikhs\" in this census.\n\nNamdharis are a sect of Sikhism, also known as \"Kuka Sikhs\". They believe that the line of Sikh Gurus did not end with Guru Gobind Singh because he did not die in Nanded, he escaped and lived in secret. This sect claims he nominated Balak Singh to be the 11th Guru, a tradition that was continued through the Namdhari leaders.\n\nTheir 12th guru was Ram Singh, who moved the sects center to Bhaini Sahib (Ludhiana). They have been strictly vegetarian and a strong opponent of cattle slaughter, and retaliated against Muslims for killing cows in 1872. Their leader Ram Singh was arrested by the British and he was exiled to Rangoon Myanmar. Dozens of Namdharis were arrested by the British and executed without trial in Ludhiana and Ambala. They consider \"Guru Granth Sahib\" and \"Dasam Granth\" as equally important, and compositions from the \"Chandi di Var\" are a part of their daily Nitnem. Like Hindus, they circumambulate the fire (havan) during their weddings, but they differ in that the hymns are those from the \"Adi Granth\".\n\nThe Namdharis wear homespun white turbans, which they wrap around their heads (\"sidhi pagri\"). They are called \"Kuka\", which means \"crier, shouter\", for their ecstatic religious practices during devotional singing. They also meditate, using \"mala\" (rosary). Some texts refer to them as \"Jagiasi\" or \"Abhiasi\".\n\nThe Nirankari movement was founded by Baba Dyal Das, as a Sikh reform movement around the middle of 19th century, in the later part of Ranjit Singh's reign. Nirankari means \"without form\", and reflects their belief that God cannot be represent in any form and true Sikh faith is based on \"nam simaran\".\n\nNirankari have opposed any form of ritualism in Sikhism, emphasizing the need to return to the teachings of their founder Guru Nanak. They were the first sect to demand major changes in how Sikh temples are operated, the Sikh ceremonies. They also disagreed with the orthodox Sikhs on only 10 Gurus and the scripture as the living Guru. Nirankaris believe that human guru to interpret the scripture and guide Sikhs is a necessity.\n\nThe Nirankari sect diverged into two in 1940s, when \"Sant Nirankaris\" emerged as a separate group. They believe that scripture is open and therefore added works of their leaders into the Guru Granth Sahib. This led to increasingly conflicts with the orthodox Sikhs. In late 1970s, Jarnail Singh Bhindranvale repeatedly denounced their practices. In 1978, the orthodox Sikhs and Sant Nirankaris had an armed confrontation in Amritsar which resulted in many deaths. In 1980, the leader of Sant Nirankari tradition, Gurbachan Singh, was assassinated.\n\nThe Akhand Kirtani Jatha emerged in the early 20th century. They interpret Guru Gobind Singh's 5Ks differently than the orthodox Sikhs. They believe the requirement is \"keski\", not \"kes\". This means that male and female Sikhs must wear a small turban. The males also wear a full turban on top of it. They also give much importance to devotional singing of kirtans, often organizing all night group singing sessions.\n\nThe Radhasoami Satsang (lit. \"True association of the Lord of the Soul\") or Radha Soami movement derives its name from the gopi Radha and Soami which means Lord Krishna's soul, ideas also found in the Vaishnavism tradition. This movement was started by Baba Shiv Dayal in the 19th century, who is also known as Soamiji. The sect has been headquartered in Beas, with branches elsewhere such as Agra. It also believes that living gurus are necessary for a guided spiritual life. They do not install the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the satsang (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth as well as sing hymns together. They believe in social equality, forbid caste distinctions and have attracted Dalits to their tradition. They are active outside India, and attracted converts to their movement.\n\nThe Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered as an offshoot of Sikhism in Punjab. In the context of Dharma, states Juergensmeyer, they can be considered also as a part of Hinduism because they share their cultural outlook, some practices and theological concepts such as Karma, Yoga (Shabd) and Guru. However, they are also different from Hindus and Sikhs because they reject the concept of a sacred scripture, rituals such as \"karha prasad\" and pilgrimage gatherings and ceremonies. The Radhasoamis accept saints and living gurus from anywhere, and their history is traceable since about early 1860s. To the Radhsoamis, six elements form the framework of their faith: a living \"guru\" (someone as locus of trust and truth), \"bhajan\" (remembering \"Sat Nam\", other practices believed to be transformative), \"satsang\" (fellowship, community), \"seva\" (serve others without expecting anything in return), \"dera\" (community organization, shrine) and \"bhandara\" (large community gathering).\n\nThe Radhasoami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve \"karah prasad\" (offering) at the end of prayers. According to Pierluigi Zoccatelli, there were an estimated 3 million Radhasoami followers worldwide in 2004, with many subsects based on the Guru. Of these, the Beas headquartered group had 2 million followers. Other subsects and movements influenced by Radhasoami include Divine Life Mission, Eckankar, Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, Science of Spirituality and others.\n\nSanatan Sikhs emerged as a significant group of conservative Sikhs who opposed the orthodox Sikhs in their interpretation of Sikhism, particularly during the Singh Sabha Movement. They campaigned for an inclusive interpretation that accepted wide range of beliefs drawn from Hinduism and Islam. Sanatan Sikhs affirmed that they are a tradition within Hinduism, that Sikhs and Hindus are indivisible. They founded the Singh Sabha in 1873, led by Khem Singh Bedi – a direct descendant of Guru Nanak, Avtar Singh Vahiria and others.\n\nSanatan Sikhs accept beliefs and practices such as the belief in the teachings of the Vedas and Puranas, Hindu epics and Sufi Pirs.\n\nThe 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa. They also known call themselves the \"Sikh Dharma movement\" and \"Khalsa Dharma movement\" and are called \"Gora Sikhs\" by the mainstream adherents of Sikhism. Their name 3HO, stands for Healthy Happy Holy Organization. This Sikh sect emphasizes meditation and Yoga. The sect started and grew a number of international business brands such as Yogi tea. The orthodox Khalsa does not consider them as Sikhs. The 3HO sect has a strict rahit, the code of conduct expectation.\n\nSikh identities within orthodox Khalsa varies significantly in terms of their practices and beliefs. They are generally classified as:\n\n"}

Some orders are monastic (Quanzhen orders), while the majority are not (Zhengyi orders).\n\nSome of the monastic orders are hermitic, and their members practice seclusion and ascetic lifestyles in the mountains, with the aim of becoming \"xian\", or immortal beings. Non-monastic priests live among the populace and manage and serve their own temples or popular temples.\n\nThe activities of the Taoists tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the \"Daozang\", or Daoist Canon; however, Taoists generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.\n\nTaoist orders are conventionally categorised into two main branches: Quanzhen and Zhengyi.\n\nQuanzhen Taoism, which is present almost exclusively in the north of China, includes all Taoist orders which have a monastic institution. Their lifestyle is comparable to that of the Buddhist monks in that they are celibate, vegetarian, and live in monasteries. The White Cloud Temple in Beijing is the main monastery of the Longmen school of Quanzhen, and is also the main headquarters of mainland China's official Taoist Church.\n\nThe other main priesthood is Zhengyi Taoism, in which the priests can marry, eat meat, live in their own homes, and found and manage their own temples or serve in folk religious temples. They are mostly priests part-time and can hold other jobs. Their lineages are transmitted through training and ordination by another priest, although historically they received a formal confirmation in their role by the Celestial Master, the highest priest. Fragmentation of the lineage of the Celestial Masters has made Zhengyi priests more independent. In mainland China the Taoist Church has in theory taken over the power to regulate them (although only a minority of them are registered with the Church). Zhengyi orders are present all over China, although with different names according to the local lineages. For example, in northern China there are the \"yinyang\" masters of the Lingbao sub-tradition.\n\n\n"}

However, unlike the other texts of the Avesta, the \"Vendidad\" is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual.\n\nThe name of the texts is a contraction of the Avestan language \"Vî-Daêvô-Dāta\", \"Given Against the \"Daeva\"s (Demons)\", and as the name suggests, the \"Vendidad\" is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. According to the divisions of the Avesta as described in the Denkard, a 9th-century text, the \"Vendidad\" includes all of the 19th \"nask\", which is then the only \"nask\" that has survived in its entirety.\n\nThe \"Vendidad\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s different parts vary widely in character and in age. Although some portions are relatively recent in origin, the subject matter of the greater part is very old. In 1877, Karl Friedrich Geldner identified the texts as being linguistically distinct from both the Old Avestan language texts as well as from the Yashts of the younger Avesta. \nToday, there is controversy over historical development of the Vendidad. The Vendidad is classified by some as an artificial, young Avestan text. Its language resembles Old Avestan. The Vendidad is thought to be a Magi (Magi-influenced) composition. It has also been suggested that the Vendidad belongs to a particular school, but \"no linguistic or textual argument allows us to attain any degree of certainty in these matters.\"\n\nThe Vendidad consists of 22 fargards containing fragments of discussions between Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster. The arrangement does not suggest it was composed by the prophet's contemporaries.\n\nHowever, some consider the Vendidad a link to ancient early oral traditions, later written as a book of laws for the Zoroastrian community.\n\nIn addition, as with the Yashts, the date of composition of the final version does not exclude the possibility that some parts of the Vendidad may consist of very old material. Even in this modern age, Zoroastrians are continually rewriting old spiritual material.\n\nThe first chapter is dualistic creation myth, followed by the description of a destructive winter comparable with the great floods of various other mythologies. The second chapter recounts the legend of \"Yima\" (Jamshid). Chapter 19 relates the temptation of Zoroaster, who, when urged by Angra Mainyu to turn from the good religion, turns instead towards Ahura Mazda. The remaining chapters cover diverse rules and regulations, through the adherence of which evil spirits may be confounded. Broken down by subject, these fargards deal with the following topics (chapters where a topic is covered are in brackets):\n\n\nThere is a degree of moral relativism apparent in the Vendidad, and the diverse rules and regulations are not always expressed as being mystical, absolute, universal or mandatory. The Vendidad is mainly about social laws, mores, customs and culture. In some instances, the description of prescribed behaviour is accompanied by a description of the penances that have to be made to atone for violations thereof. Such penances include:\n\nMost of the Zoroastrians continue to use the Vendidad as a valued and fundamental cultural and ethical moral guide, viewing their teachings as essential to Zoroastrian tradition and see it as part of Zoroastrianism original perspectives about the truth of spiritual existence. They argue that it has origins on early oral tradition, being only later written.\n\nThe emergent reformist Zoroastrian movement reject the later writings in the Avesta as being corruptions of Zarathustra's original teachings and thus do not consider the Vendidad as an original Zoroastrian scripture. They argue that it was written nearly 700 years after the death of Zarathustra and interpret the writing as different from the other parts of the Avesta.\n\nAn article by Hannah M. G. Shapero sums up the refomist perspective:\n\n\"How do Zoroastrians view the Vendidad today? And how many of the laws of the Vendidad are still followed? This depends, as so many other Zoroastrian beliefs and practices do, on whether you are a \"reformist\" or a \"traditionalist.\" The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe are not against the original spirit of the Gathas.\"\n\nAlthough the \"Vendidad\" is not a liturgical manual, a section of it may be recited as part of a greater \"Yasna\" service. Although such extended \"Yasna\"s appears to have been frequently performed in the mid-18th century (as noted in Anquetil-Duperron's observations), it is very rarely performed at the present day. In such an extended service, \"Visparad\" 12 and \"Vendidad\" 1-4 are inserted between \"Yasna\" 27 and 28. The \"Vendidad\" ceremony is always performed between nightfall and dawn, though a normal \"Yasna\" is performed between dawn and noon.\n\nBecause of its length and complexity, the \"Vendidad\" is read, rather than recalled from memory as is otherwise necessary for the \"Yasna\" texts. The recitation of the \"Vendidad\" requires a priest of higher rank (one with a \"moti khub\") than is normally necessary for the recitation of the \"Yasna\".\n\nThe \"Vendidad\" should not be confused with the \"Vendidad Sadé\". The latter is the name for a set of manuscripts of the \"Yasna\" texts into which the \"Vendidad\" and \"Visperad\" have been interleaved. These manuscripts were used for liturgical purposes outside the yasna ceremony proper, not accompanied by any ritual activity. The expression \"sadé\", \"clean\", was used to indicate that these texts were not accompanied by commentaries in Middle Persian.\n\n"}

Dushkova has written approximately 60 books which have been published in both Russia and Ukraine and translated into seven languages. Dushkova's philosophy is influenced by Blavatsky's Theosophy.\n\nZinovia Dushkova was born on July 19, 1953 in the village of Congaz in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (currently the Republic of Moldova). Her father, Vasily Ivanovich Dushkov (1925–1957), was the chairman of the collective farm \"Russia\" in Moldova. Her mother, Antonina Ivanovna Dushkova (1927–1980), was a land surveyor who participated in geological expeditions. Dushkova's father held a senior position, and for this reason, during Soviet times, he was not permitted to baptize his children. But her grandmother secretly brought the newborn child into a church and had her baptized. Since during the rite of baptism there was no one present except a priest and the grandmother, she became Dushkova's godmother and the child was named after her. As Dushkova's parents were absorbed in their work, she spent her entire early childhood with her grandmother. After her father's death in 1957 from fulminant tuberculosis, her grandmother became fully responsible for Dushkova's upbringing. After her grandmother's death in 1964, Dushkova's mother Antonina along with her 11-year old daughter, moved to the village of Staroye Sheptakhovo in the Chuvash Republic. In 1970, Dushkova returned to Moldova, but then moved to work in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1971; from there, in 1972, she moved to the Russian Far East, where she spent the following 27 years. Dushkova moved to Moscow in 1999.\n\nZinovia Dushkova has two sons: Andrey (born 1972), graduated Lomonosov Moscow State University, a linguist, and Sergey (born 1979), graduated Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, a social worker.\n\nDushkova studied at a secondary school in Cheboksary and at the school located in the village of Bolshoe Yanikovo. In 1986, Dushkova matriculated in the Far Eastern State University in Vladivostok with a specialization in history. Upon graduation, she worked as a teacher of history in a school.\n\nDushkova was promoted to PhD in Philosophy in 2009 with a thesis called, \"Rol' lichnosti v istorii: istoriosofskiy analiz\" (\"The Role of Personality in History: A Historiosophical Analysis\"), at the philosophy department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.\n\nZinovia Dushkova lived in monasteries located in the mountains, deserts, and caves of Tibet, Mongolia, Nepal, and India. As a result of her long travels and studies, she wrote nearly 60 books. They have been published in Russia and Ukraine and have been translated into seven languages.\n\nSome of them are works of fiction, while she regards others as having been handed down by the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\", or \"Mahatmas\", and as being based on the \"knowledge of the heart\" and \"enlightenment\". Dushkova claims that these books were written not through mediumship or channeling, but were the result of what she calls the \"Fiery Experience\", and she explains it as divine inspiration. She says that writing books in this way requires many years of training, which adversely affects one's physical health and demands one's isolation from society.\n\nDushkova had studied the history of Christianity and the lives of Orthodox saints since early childhood. Later, while living in Vladivostok, she started to be interested in other world religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, and she studied the work of Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich. As a historian, she also studied the sacred texts in terms of their moral and ethical teachings. \n\nThis whole experience inspired her to write her first work of fiction, \"Probuzhdenie Istoka\" (\"Awakening of the Source\"), in 1992. There followed poetry collections and more fiction: \"Melodii Dushi\" (\"Melodies of the Soul\"), \"Latyn' nevospetaya\" (\"Unsung Latin\"), \"Grani Sveta\" (\"Facets of Light\"), \"Preodolenie\" (\"Overcoming\"), and \"Epopeya\" (\"Epopee\").\n\nIn 1995 Dushkova took her first trip to India, during which she wrote the book \"Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel\"' (\"Brotherhood: The Ethereal Abode\"). Work on it began in the study at Helena Roerich's estate in Naggar. According to the author, it is a continuation of the teaching of \"Agni Yoga\" and its logical conclusion. It is said that, during that trip, Dushkova also met with Master Morya in the Buddhist Ghoom Monastery, where his meetings with Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich had presumably taken place before. Additionally she states that she gained access to the \"Book of Dzyan\", from which she translated a new fragment from the Senzar language and published it in \"The Book of Secret Wisdom\".\n\nThe most significant work by Dushkova is \"The Teaching of the Heart\", consisting of a series of books which were written while she traveled across India, Russia, Egypt, Israel, and Japan. The series was begun at Helena Roerich's estate in Kalimpong in October 1997 and its books were later written in places such as the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, Magdala, Mount Carmel, the Kremlin in Moscow, and Vladivostok.\n\nOther books by Dushkova include \"Ognennaya Bibliya\" (\"The Fiery Bible\"), \"Evangelie ot Sofii – Sily i Premudrosti Bozhiey\" (\"The Gospel of Sophia – the Power and Wisdom of God\"), and \"Taynaya Doktrina Lyubvi\" (\"The Secret Doctrine of Love\"). She also wrote books intended for children and youth: \"Skazki dlya Messii\" (\"Fairy Tales for the Messiah\"), \"Skazki kotorye rastut vmeste s nami\" (\"Fairy Tales which Grow Together with Us\"), \"77\" \"Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni\" (\"77 Pearls Shining on the Beads of Time\"), and \"Kniga Pritchey\" (\"The Book of Parables\").\n\nSince 2004, Dushkova has ceased to meet with her readers in Russia and Ukraine, having bidden them farewell at the last meeting held in Moscow on March 24, and has focused on trips abroad. \n\nFrom 2004 to 2016, Dushkova worked on the \"Dialogi\" (\"Dialogues\") trilogy in which she discusses the inner organization of Shambhala. The first two volumes were published in Russian in 2012, and the third in 2017.\nAccording to the 12-year research by Lyudmila Grigoryeva, the Head of the Department of Religious Studies of Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, and Tatyana Simanzhenkova, the teaching of Zinovia Dushkova, being the continuation of the Theosophical tradition and occult-mystical in its nature, develops this religious orientation and devises new worldviews of the social and cosmic evolution of humanity in the transitional period. This teaching develops one of the fundamental ideas of the Roerichs' doctrine, outlined in the book \"Heart\" of the \"Agni Yoga\" series, considering it the most important in the modern social and cultural situation.\n\nThe study showed that, among a wide variety of teachings in modern Russia and Ukraine, \"The Teaching of the Heart\" is distinguished by its ethical and humanistic orientation, an unusual way of thinking, and a vivid form of exposition.\n\nDushkova identifies the primary role of the heart in the spiritual development of individuals. All of her books have in common the idea of cultivating the qualities of the heart, such as love, compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and gratitude, which, according to the author, contribute to the spiritual and moral formation of the individual. Her first published book \"Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel\"' formulates this basic idea of the teaching by saying: \"Go by the way of the Heart.\" She believes that \"one religion\" for modern humanity must be love, and therefore Dushkova's main appeal throughout her books is to \"open the heart\".\n\nThe central postulate of the teaching is the idea that there is one divine source of all religions. This idea is presented by Dushkova as a combination of two world religions in three images of the one deity: \"The time of Maitreya, Buddha, and Christ has come; at their essence, they are One. Three times are merging, erasing the borders between them. The Past has intersected with the Future at point of the Present. The Great Buddha of the North appeared in the Image of Maitreya, bearing the features of the Resurrected Christ.\" This syncretic idea is developed in all other Dushkova's writings, as well.\n\nContinuing the Theosophical tradition, Christ, according to the teaching, is one of the \"cosmic hierarchs\", who incarnate themselves on the Earth in order to help humanity. Dushkova develops \"Agni Yoga\"'s fundamental idea of \"cosmic hierarchy\" by introducing the concept of the \"hierarchy of the heart\" that includes the \"heart of infinity\", the \"heart of the planet\", and the \"heart of the human being\". The latter is presented as a \"small cell of the heart of infinity\", serving as a connecting link between worlds and as the container of the \"fire of love\".\n\nJust as in \"Agni Yoga\", Great White Brotherhood in \"The Teaching of the Heart\" directs the evolution of humanity, preserving society from regression and decay. Essentially the brotherhood in Dushkova's teaching is the organizing and uniting principle which gives an impulse of high evolutionary frequency that maintains the stability of the social system and establishes the conditions for further improvement.\n\nAs in the Eastern tradition, Dushkova's teaching speaks of the one energy of the Cosmos, Nature, and human beings and relies on the Theosophical version of Cosmogenesis, in which the Absolute is seen as the primary fiery energy that during evolution turns into spirit and matter. According to the teaching, there are certain historical periods during which this energy, or \"spatial fire\", is intensified in order to influence the evolution of humanity, bringing matter into a more subtle state; Dushkova calls such periods \"fiery baptism\".\n\n\"The Teaching of the Heart\" says it is through the human heart that the evolutionary wave of these transformative fiery energies will pass at the end of the \"great cycle\", which coincides with present times. Therefore, according to Dushkova, the primary focus of attention should be shifted to the heart, because it is the \"main transmuter\" of these energies.\n\n\"The Teaching of the Heart\" explains that modern civilization has come to a dividing line in its development when all the quality parameters of life are to change. Since the human being is involved not only in processes occurring on the Earth, but also in the Cosmos as a whole, Dushkova calls upon people to coordinate their actions with global world processes and to recognize responsibility for every step in life, saying that humanity can proceed further only through love.\n\nBeing social and optimistic in nature, the teaching rejects the dramatic concepts of the end of the world and promotes a more peaceful path to salvation, which occurs through a gradual familiarization with the \"divine reality\". Although natural disasters cannot be avoided, they are described as \"natural ways of purification\", providing the opportunity to establish \"a new heaven and a new earth\" to be inhabited by a transfigured humanity.\n\nAccording to \"The Teaching of the Heart\", the periods of the greatest manifestation of the \"spatial fire\" are also connected with the beginning of a new \"Messianic\" cycle when Maitreya, the Lord of Shambhala, should arrive in order to unite humanity and to build together a new society after the purification of the Earth.\n\nFollowing the Theosophical tradition, the teaching shows that the coming era will be the era of the \"Mother of the World\". Dushkova presents woman and man as the two cosmic principles that are destined to acquire their equal rights and stand side by side as colleagues.\n\nAfter its publication in 1998, \"The Teaching of the Heart\" rapidly gained readers in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in Kazakhstan and Moldova, marking the beginning of a movement which organized festivals of spiritual culture, exhibitions, musical evenings, and round tables for different types of activity: pedagogical, educational, and artistic. The first large-scale forum took place in Kiev in 1999 and was held every year afterward in cities such as Cheboksary, Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, and Vladivostok. In August 2001, in Kemerovo, participants of this movement created \"Zvezda Vostoka\" (\"Star of the East\"), an interregional public organization for supporting science, culture, and art. It aimed \"to unite all who advocate moral values, who contribute to the evolutionary development of society through cooperation in the domains of science, economics, education, and culture.\" Later, branches of \"Zvezda Vostoka\" were opened in many cities of Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Religious scholars regarded this organization as one of the three largest centers of Roerichism in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe followers of \"The Teaching of the Heart\" believe that it, Helena Roerich's \"Agni Yoga\", and Helena Blavatsky's \"The Secret Doctrine\" represent the three parts of the \"one revelation\" handed down to humankind by the \"Masters of Wisdom\". \n\nIn 2005, Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University published a book intended for teachers, parents, high school students, and professionals in the field of pedagogy and psychology, which recommended \"77 Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni\" for use in education and used excerpts from \"The Teaching of the Heart\" and other Dushkova's books from the standpoint of a person's moral upbringing.\n\nIn the same year, Auezov Semipalatinsk University in Kazakhstan published methodological recommendations on using the book and audiobook \"Skazki dlya Messii\" in secondary schools, orphanages, and other children's educational establishments. According to these recommendations, \"The book is a significant phenomenon in the contemporary literary process, and in terms of the purity of its moral lessons it is comparable to \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.\" They also noted the highly psycho-corrective and psychotherapeutic effect of these fairy tales in comparison with others, because they are based on replacing a destructive style of behavior with a constructive one.\n\nIn various cities of Russia and Ukraine, teachers and parents who used \"Skazki dlya Messii\" for reading in orphanages, boarding schools, detention centers, and classrooms noted the positive impact of the tales on the psycho-emotional state of children, especially those who were considered \"difficult\". Pankaj Malviya used \"Skazki dlya Messii\" in the process of teaching students at the Department of Russian Language of Punjab University in Chandigarh, India. The Japanese researcher of Russian fairy tales, Professor Yoshikazu Nakamura, included \"Skazki dlya Messii\" in a course for students of Russian language and literature at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. \n\nAfter a competitive selection process in 2006 by the children's and educational publisher Nathan in Paris, \"Le Beau Soleil et autres contes\" (\"The Red Sun and Other Fairy Tales\"), the French edition of \"Skazki dlya Messii\", was reviewed by the professional magazine for teachers \"Journal des Instituteurs et Professeurs des écoles\" (JDI) with recommendations as to how to use the book in the educational process. By the decision of the competitive board, packages with 30 copies of the book each were sent to many schools of France. During the 2006–2007 academic year the teachers at these schools studied the psychological and pedagogical impact of the fairy tales on their students.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church categorically rejects the teachings of Blavatsky and the Roerichs. In 1994, the Council of Bishops declared that they were \"incompatible with Christianity\" and people who shared and promoted these teachings had \"excommunicated themselves from the Orthodox Church\". Patriarchate representatives at a 2004 Novosibirsk conference once again testified to the \"antichristian and destructive nature\" of various New Age teachings, including those of Helena Blavatsky, Helena Roerich, and Zinovia Dushkova.\n\nHowever, among the followers of the Roerichs' teachings, the publication of \"Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel\"' in 1997 also caused controversy as to whether it came from the same source as \"Agni Yoga\". Thus, Lyudmila Shaposhnikova, the director of the International Center of the Roerichs (ICR) in Moscow, made disparaging remarks on the book and its author, stating that \"Bratstvo\" was given by the \"dark forces\" because no new teachings would be given \"in the next 200 years, as well as in the future\". Then the Council of the Siberian Roerich Society, which itself was the former branch of ICR, denounced Dushkova as a \"false teacher\". In response to these accusations, Dushkova's supporters quoted Helena Roerich's letters in which Roerich herself predicted the appearance of \"Agni Yoga in new conditions\" at the very end of the 20 century.\n\nIn 2003, an exhibition entitled \"Geography of Travels\" was organized, at which 60 photographs as well as the author's videos were presented. They had been made during Dushkova's travels to places that are regarded as holy in countries such as Egypt, Israel, India, Italy, China, Mongolia, Tibet, France, and Japan. The exhibition was first displayed in Moscow, and then in other cities in Russia, Ukraine, and France. \n\nIn 2009, Moscow hosted an international exhibition of children's drawings called \"Create Your Fairy Tale\", organized by Dushkova Publishing and the A.P. Bogolyubov Library of the Arts. The exhibition featured drawings based on \"Fairy Tales for the Messiah\" by children from different cities in Russia and France.\n\nIn 2015, Dushkova was awarded the \"20 Years of Gagauzia\" Medal which was established by Gagauzian People's Assembly. In 2017, \"The Call of the Heart\", the first book of \"The Teaching of the Heart\" series, was awarded a silver medal by the Nautilus Book Awards in the United States.\n\nZinovia Dushkova has written approximately 60 books in Russian. The following have been published in English:\n\n\n"}
