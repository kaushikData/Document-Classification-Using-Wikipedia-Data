In the Sasanian period it was one of the three Great Fires and was associated with the farmer class; the other two were Adur Farnbag in Persis which belong to the priest class, and Adur Gushnasp in Media, which belong to the warrior class. Its establishment can be dated to the late 5th or early 4th century BC. \"Adur\" means \"Holy Fire\", and \"Burzēn-Mihr\" is a Parthian personal name literally meaning \"Exalted is Mihr\", thought to be the name of the temple's founder. \n\nThis Fire is described in \"Bundahishn\". Its location is given as Mount Rēvand (in Avestan: Raēvant), probably a spur of the Nishapur mountains in the district formerly known as Rēvand in Khurasan. An element of the name is preserved in the name of the nearby village Borzinan may. Another identification is Mount Mehr, five miles from the village Mehr on the Shahrud–Sabzevar Highway.\n\nThe Fire is mentioned several times in \"Shahnameh\" as Mehr-Barzīn (مهر برزین), Mehr (مهر), and Barzīn (برزین), and is used also as a simile for fiery fierceness.\n\nThe Fire is thought to have been a major center of pilgrimage, even after the Arsacids' fall. In the Sasanian period, although its name was always placed third in texts and the fire was associated with the lowliest class of the society, (farmers; the other two being warriors and priests), it still maintained its importance. Its history in the Islamic period is not known.\n\n"}

{"id": "488563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488563", "title": "Ashura", "text": "Ashura\n\nYom Ashura or Ashura ( \"\") is the tenth day of Muḥarram, the first month in the Islamic calendar. For the majority of Shia Muslims Ashura marks the climax of the Remembrance of Muharram, and commemorates the death of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, at the Battle of Karbala on 10Muharram in the year 61AH (in AHt: October 10, 680CE). Sunni Muslims have the same accounts of these events, but ceremonial mourning did not become a custom - although poems, eulogizing and recounting the events were and continue to be common. Mourning for the incident began almost immediately after the Battle of Karbala. Popular elegies were written by poets to commemorate the Battle of Karbala during the Umayyad and Abbasid era, and the earliest public mourning rituals occurred in 963CE during the Buyid dynasty.\nIn Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh and Pakistan, Ashura has become a national holiday, and many ethnic and religious communities participate in it.\n\nIn Sunni Islam, Ashura also marks the day that Moses and the Israelites were saved from Pharaoh by God creating a path in the Sea, and is the Islamic equivalent to Yom Kippur. Other commemorations include Noah leaving the Ark and Prophet Muhammad's arrival in Medina.\n\nThe root of the word \"Ashura\" has the meaning of \"tenth\" in Semitic languages; hence the name of the remembrance, literally translated, means \"the tenth day\". According to the orientalist A.J. Wensinck, the name is derived from the Hebrew ʿāsōr, with the Aramaic determinative ending. The day is indeed the tenth day of the month, although some Islamic scholars offer up different etymologies. In his book \"Ghuniyatut Talibin\", Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani writes that Islamic scholars differ as to why this day is known as Ashura, some of them suggesting that it is the tenth most important day with which God has blessed Muslims.\n\nThe Battle of Karbala took place within the crisis environment resulting from the succession of Yazid I. Immediately after succession, Yazid instructed the governor of Medina to compel Husayn and a few other prominent figures to pledge their allegiance (Bay'ah). Husayn, however, refrained from making such a pledge, believing that Yazid was openly going against the teachings of Islam and changing the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad. He, therefore, accompanied by his household, his sons, brothers, and the sons of Hasan left Medina to seek asylum in Mecca.\n\nOn the other hand, the people in Kufa, when informed of Muawiyah's death, sent letters urging Husayn to join them and pledging to support him against the Umayyads. Husayn wrote back to them saying that he would send his cousin Muslim ibn Aqeel to report to him on the situation, and that, if he found them supporter as their letters indicated, he would speedily join them because an Imam should act in accordance with the Quran and uphold justice, proclaim the truth, and dedicate himself to the cause of God. The mission of Muslim was initially successful and according to reports, 18,000 men pledged their allegiance. But the situation changed radically when Yazid appointed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad as the new governor of Kufa, ordering him to deal severely with Ibn Aqeel. Before news of the adverse turn of events had reached Mecca, Husayn set out for Kufa.\n\nOn the way, Husayn found that his messenger, Muslim ibn Aqeel, had been killed in Kufa. Husayn encountered the army of Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad along the route towards Kufa. Husayn addressed the Kufan army, reminding them that they had invited him to come because they were without an Imam. He told them that he intended to proceed to Kufa with their support, but if they were now opposed to his coming, he would return to where he had come from. In response, the army urged him to proceed by another route. Thus, he turned to the left and reached Karbala, where the army forced him not to go further and stop at a location that was without water.\nUbaydullah ibn Ziyad, the governor instructed Umar ibn Sa'ad, the head of the Kufan army, to offer Ḥusayn and his supporters the opportunity to swear allegiance to Yazid. He also ordered Umar ibn Sa'ad to cut off Husayn and his followers from access to the water of the Euphrates. On the next morning, Umar ibn Sa'ad arranged the Kufan army in battle order.\n\nThe Battle of Karbala lasted from morning to sunset on October 10, 680 (Muharram10, 61AH). Husayn's small group of companions and family members (in total around 72 men and the women and children) fought against a large army under the command of Umar ibn Sa'ad and were killed near the river (Euphrates), from which they were not allowed to get water. The renowned historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī states:\nOnce the Umayyad troops had murdered Husayn and his male followers, they looted the tents, stripped the women of their jewelry, and took the skin upon which Zain al-Abidin was prostrate. Husayn's sister Zaynab was taken along with the enslaved women to the caliph in Damascus when she was imprisoned and after a year eventually was allowed to return to Medina.\n\nAccording to Ignác Goldziher,\n\nThe first assembly (\"majlis\") of the Commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali is said to have been held by Zaynab in prison. In Damascus, too, she is reported to have delivered a poignant oration. The prison sentence ended when Husayn's 3-year-old daughter, Sakina, died in captivity. She would often cry in prison to be allowed to see her father. She is believed to have died when she saw her father's mutilated head. Her death caused an uproar in the city, and Yazid, fearing a potential uprising, freed the captives.\n\nImam Zayn Al Abidin said the following:\n\nHusayn's grave became a pilgrimage site among Shia Muslims only a few years after his death. A tradition quickly developed of pilgrimage to the Imam Husayn Shrine and the other Karbala martyrs, known as \"Ziarat ashura\". The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs tried to prevent construction of the shrines and discouraged pilgrimage to the sites. The tomb and its annexes were destroyed by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 850–851 and Shia pilgrimage was prohibited, but shrines in Karbala and Najaf were built by the Buwayhid emir 'Adud al-Daula in 979–80.\n\nPublic rites of remembrance for Husayn's martyrdom developed from the early pilgrimages. Under the Buyid dynasty, Mu'izz ad-Dawla officiated at public commemoration of Ashura in Baghdad. These commemorations were also encouraged in Egypt by the Fatimid caliph al-'Aziz. With the recognition of Twelvers as the official religion by the Safavids, Mourning of Muharram extended throughout the first ten days of Muharram.\n\nThe words \"Azadari\" (Persian: عزاداری) which mean mourning and lamentation; and Majalis-e Aza have been exclusively used in connection with the remembrance ceremonies for the martyrdom of Imam Hussain. Majalis-e Aza, also known as Aza-e Husayn, includes mourning congregations, lamentations, matam and all such actions which express the emotions of grief and above all, repulsion against what Yazid stood for.\n\nThese religious customs show solidarity with Husayn and his family. Through them, people mourn Husayn's death and express regret for the fact that they were not present at the battle to fight and save Husayn and his family.\n\nAfter almost 12 centuries, five types of major rituals were developed around the battle of Karbala. These rituals include the memorial services (\"majalis al-ta'ziya\"), the visitation of Husayn's tomb in Karbala particularly on the occasion of the tenth day of Ashura and the fortieth day after the battle (Ziyarat Ashura and ziyarat al-Arba'in), the public mourning processions (al-mawakib al-husayniyya or the representation of the battle of Karbala in the form of a play (the shabih), and the flagellation (tatbir). Some Shia Muslims believe that taking part in Ashura washes away their sins. A popular Shia saying has it that \"a single tear shed for Husayn washes away a hundred sins\".\n\nFor Shia Muslims, the commemoration of Ashura is not a festival but rather a sad event, while Sunni Muslims view it as a victory God gave to Moses. For Shia Muslims, it is a period of intense grief and mourning. Mourners congregate at a mosque for sorrowful, poetic recitations such as \"marsiya\", \"noha\", \"latmiya\", and \"soaz\" performed in memory of the martyrdom of Husayn, lamenting and grieving to the tune of beating drums and chants of \"Ya Hussain\". Also, Ulamas give sermons with themes of Husayn's personality and position in Islam, and the history of his uprising. The Sheikh of the mosque retells the Battle of Karbala to allow his listeners to relive the pain and sorrow endured by Husayn and his family and they read Maqtal Al-Husayn. In some places, such as Iran, Iraq, and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, passion plays known as Ta'zieh are performed, reenacting the Battle of Karbala and the suffering and martyrdom of Husayn at the hands of Yazid.In the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica Ahsura, known locally as 'Hussay' or Hosay is commemorated for the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, but its celebration has adopted influence from other religions including Roman Catholic, Hindu, and Baptists, making it a mixture of different cultures and religion. The event is attended by both Muslims and non-Muslims depicting an environment of mutual respect and tolerance. For the duration of the remembrance, it is customary for mosques and some people to provide free meals (\"nazri\") on certain nights of the month to all people..\n\nCertain traditional flagellation rituals such as Talwar zani (\"talwar ka matam\" or sometimes \"tatbir\") use a sword. Other rituals such as \"zanjeer zani\" or \"zanjeer matam\" involve the use of a \"zanjeer\" (a chain with blades). This is not without controversy however as some Shia clerics have denounced the practice saying \"it creates a backward and negative image of their community.\" Believers are instead encouraged to donate blood to those in need.On Ashura, very few Shia Muslims observe mourning with a blood donation, which is called \"Qame Zani\", and flailing. This mourning is considered to be a shameless way for most Shia Muslims and most of them are against this kind of mourning.In some areas, such as in the Shia suburb of Beirut, Shia communities organize blood donation drives with organizations like the Red Cross or the Red Crescent on Ashura as a replacement for self-flagellation rituals like \"tatbir\" and \"qame zani\".\n\nOn the 10th of the month of MuharremThe Ashure DayHuseyn bin Ali was murdered at Karbala Remembrance by Jafaris, Qizilbash Alevi-Turks, and Bektashis together in Ottoman Empire\n\nThis day is of particular significance to Twelver Shia and Alawites, who consider Husayn (the grandson of Prophet Muhammad) Ahl al-Bayt, the third Imam to be the rightful successor of Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAccording to Kamran Scot Aghaie, \"The symbols and rituals of Ashura have evolved over time and have meant different things to different people. However, at the core of the symbolism of Ashura is the moral dichotomy between worldly injustice and corruption on the one hand and God-centered justice, piety, sacrifice and perseverance on the other. Also, Shiite Muslims consider the remembrance of the tragic events of Ashura to be an important way of worshipping God in a spiritual or mystical way.\"\n\nShia Muslims make pilgrimages on Ashura, as they do forty days later on Arba'een, to the Mashhad al-Husayn, the shrine in Karbala, Iraq, that is traditionally held to be Husayn's tomb. On this day Shia is in remembrance, and mourning attire is worn. They refrain from listening to or playing music since Arabic culture generally considers music impolite during death rituals. It is a time for sorrow and for showing respect for the person's passing, and it is also a time for self-reflection when one commits oneself completely to the mourning of Husayn. Shia Muslims do not plan weddings and parties on this date. They mourn by crying and listening to recollections of the tragedy and sermons on how Husayn and his family were martyred. This is intended to connect them with Husayn's suffering and martyrdom, and the sacrifices he made to keep Islam alive. Husayn's martyrdom is widely interpreted by Shia Muslims a symbol of the struggle against injustice, tyranny, and oppression. Shia Muslims believe the Battle of Karbala was between the forces of good and evil, with Husayn representing good and Yazid representing evil.\n\nShia Imams strongly insist that the day of Ashura should not be celebrated as a day of joy and festivity. The day of Ashura, according to Eighth Shia Imam Ali al-Rida, must be observed as a day of rest, sorrow, and total disregard of worldly matters.\n\nSome of the events associated with Ashura are held in special congregation halls known as \"Imambargah\" and Hussainia.\n\nSunnis regard fasting during Ashura as recommended, though not obligatory, having been superseded by the Ramadan fast. Sahih Muslim, (Hadith-2499) According to hadith record in Sahih Bukhari, Ashura was already known as a commemorative day during which some Makkah residents used to observe customary fasting. Prophet Muhammad fasted on the day of Ashura, 10th Muharram, in Makkah. When fasting during the month of Ramadan became obligatory, the fast of Ashura was made non-compulsory.\n\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Jews also fasted on the tenth day. According to Sunni Muslim tradition, Ibn Abbas narrates that Prophet Muhammad came to Medina and saw the Jews fasting on the tenth day of Muharram. He asked, \"What is this?\" They said, \"This is a good day, this is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy and Musa (Moses) fasted on this day.\" He said, \"We have more claim over Musa than you.\" So he fasted on the day and told the people to fast.\nThis tenth in question is believed to be the tenth of the Jewish month of Tishri, which is Yom Kippur in Judaism. The Torah designates the tenth day of the seventh month as holy and a fast (Lev.16, Lev.23, Num.29). The word \"tenth\" in Hebrew is \"Asarah\" or \"Asharah\" (), which is from the same Semitic root A-SH-R. According to this tradition, Prophet Muhammad continued to observe the veneration of Ashura modeled on its Jewish prototype in late September until shortly before his death, which the verse of Nasi' was revealed and the Jewish-type calendar adjustments of the Muslims became prohibited. From then on, Ashura became distinct from its Jewish predecessor of Yom Kippur.\n\nCommemoration of Ashura has great socio-political value for the Shia, who have been a minority throughout their history. According to the prevailing conditions at the time of the commemoration, such reminiscences may become a framework for implicit dissent or explicit protest. It was, for instance, used during the Islamic Revolution of Iran, the Lebanese Civil War, the Lebanese resistance against the Israeli military presence and in the 1990s Uprising in Bahrain. Sometimes the Ashura commemorations associate the memory of Al-Husayn's martyrdom with the conditions of Islam and Muslims in reference to Husayn's famous quote on the day of Ashura: \"Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala\".\n\nFrom the period of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911) onward, mourning gatherings increasingly assumed a political aspect. Following an old established tradition, preachers compared the oppressors of the time with Imam Husayn's enemies, the umayyads.\n\nThe political function of commemoration was very marked in the years leading up to the Islamic Revolution of 1978–79, as well as during the revolution itself. In addition, the implicit self-identification of the Muslim revolutionaries with Imam Husayn led to a blossoming of the cult of the martyr, expressed most vividly, perhaps, in the vast cemetery of Behesht-e Zahra, to the south of Tehran, where the martyrs of the revolution and the war against Iraq are buried.\n\nOn the other hand, some governments have banned this commemoration. In the 1930s Reza Shah forbade it in Iran. The regime of Saddam Hussein saw this as a potential threat and banned Ashura commemorations for many years. In the 1884 Hosay massacre, 22 people were killed in Trinidad and Tobago when civilians attempted to carry out the Ashura rites, locally known as Hosay, in defiance of the British colonial authorities.\n\nTerrorist attacks against Shia Muslims have occurred in several countries, on the day of Ashurra. The repeated experience of violence at Ashura has produced an \"interesting\" feedback effect in Shia history.\n\nWhile Ashura is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year due to differences between the two calendars, since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. Furthermore, the appearance of the crescent moon that is used to determine when each Islamic month begins varies from country to country due to the different geographic locations.\n\nEvery year on 10th Muharram hundreds take part in procession downtown for Muslim holiday of mourning. Many from Chicago’s Islamic communities donning black garb as a sign of mourning, turn out each year for the anniversary. The message of Ashura is universal and It is about standing up for what is right. At the Loop police blocked off streets for the procession of Ashura, which began and ended at the Thompson Center. Mosque leaders sang poems of mourning, and others carried colorful flags and banners, some bearing the names of those who died alongside Hussein.\n\nMany Muslims took off school for the holiday, as did many others marching down Randolph Street. After the yearly procession, many families go to pray at a mosque or gather at houses, where they often pray and reflect. Over the years, Chicagoans have dealt with all sorts of weather for the procession because the Islamic calendar, based on a lunar system, shifts relative to the standard Julian calendar\n\n\n\n"}

Later, in the 21st (\"Supernatural Powers\") chapter, Shakyamuni passes on to them the responsibility to keep and propagate the Lotus Sutra in the feared future era of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nIn the 15th (\"Emerging from the Earth\") chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the vast number of bodhisattvas from other realms who had appeared to hear Shakyamuni preach in the \"Ceremony in the Air\" hoped to receive the Buddha's permission to be the ones to propagate the Dharma in the perilous era to come. To their great chagrin, Shakyamuni refused their request, deferring this honor to unnamed bodhisattvas who already existed in the empty space underneath the \"sahā-world\" [tr: \"world of endurance of suffering, any world of transmigration\"]. Right after he made this statement the earth shook and a mighty fissure appeared. Dramatically, and in a single instant, bodhisattvas whose numbers are described in the sutra as \"immeasurable, boundless, beyond anything that can be known through calculation, simile or parable\" arose from the earth. All of them are \"golden in hue, with the thirty-two features [of the Buddha] and an immeasurable brightness.\"\n\nThese bodhisattvas had four leaders and guiding teachers: Superior Practices (the leader of the four), Boundless Practices, Pure Practices, and Firmly Established Practices. The four leaders have been interpreted to represent the four bodhisattva vows as practiced by the Mahayana traditions of China, Japan, and Korea and are said to represent the four characteristics of Nirvana or Buddhahood as taught in the Lotus Sutra: true self, eternity, purity, and joy.\n\nAccording to Tao Sheng (ca. 360–434), the splitting of the earth and the welling forth of the bodhisattvas is indicative that \"living beings inherently possess an endowment for enlightenment, and it cannot remain concealed; they are bound to break the earth of defilements and emerge to safeguard the Dharma.” \n\nThe allegory of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth in the 15th-21st chapters of the Lotus Sutra has affected the outlooks and practices of numerous Buddhist schools. Although interpretations vary school by school, Thich Nhat Hanh provides a generalized reference: by rejecting the entreaties of bodhisattvas from other realms of the universe to propagate the Lotus Sutra after his death and by summoning countless bodhisattvas from under the earth, the Buddha affirms that he is from the world and the people of the world can rise to be its caretakers. In addition, he thus affirms the infinite universality of his life and the lives of all beings.\n\nThe welling forth of innumerable bodhisattvas from the earth has also been used as a metaphor for the emergence of a grassroots Buddhist movement. The metaphor of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth is also being used in secular and ecumenical writing.\n\nWhereas Nichiren Buddhists regard the first fourteen chapters as the transient or theoretical \"Imprinted Gate,\" the \"Emerging from the Earth\" chapter (ch 15) is regarded as the opening of the Lotus Sutra's essential teachings (chapters 15-28), or the \"Original Gate.\" The emergence of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth thus holds great significance. According to Kyōtsū Hori, \"they are also called honge no bosatsu meaning bodhisattvas guided by the Original Buddha in the eternal past.\" Nichiren (1222–1282) self-identified himself as Bodhisattva Superior Practices, in several of his writings such as \"The Opening of the Eyes.\" He claimed to qualify for this designation as the one who first grasped and taught the Mystic Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in the Latter Day.\n\nThe four leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth are represented on the top row of the Gohonzon, the calligraphic mandala inscribed by Nichiren, flanking the characters for Shakyamuni and Taho (Many Treasures) Buddhas.\n\nIn his letter \"The True Aspect of All Phenomena,\" Nichiren clearly stated that followers of his who spread and promote his teachings are fellow Bodhisattvas of the Earth: \"There should be no discrimination among those who propagate the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo in the Latter Day of the Law, be they men or women. Were they not Bodhisattvas of the Earth, they could not chant the daimoku. At first only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Propagation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not signify 'emerging from the earth'?\"\n\nThe importance of the appearance of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth is underscored in most Nichiren schools: Soka Gakkai, Nichiren Shū, and Nichiren Shoshu. The differing interpretations of how the Bodhisattvas of the Earth correspond to contemporary people are described below:\n\nNichiren Shu states that its members aspire to the status of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai holds that all people who propagate the ideals of the Lotus Sutra are Bodhisattvas of the Earth. This realization is traced back to Josei Toda's vision while imprisoned during World War II under the charge of lèse-majesté in which he recognized himself as one of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth. Daisaku Ikeda, president of the Soka Gakkai International, often describes Soka Gakkai members as the present-day Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\n\nNichiren Shoshu refers to its believers as \"associates of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth,\" \"sharing karmic bonds with the Bodhisattvas of the Earth,\" or as \"followers of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\" There are occasional references to the laity and priests of Nichiren Shoshu being the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\n\nAccording to the Risshō Kōsei Kai, the appearance of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth represent a shift from teachings of theory in the first half of the Lotus Sutra to teachings about conduct and human action, teachings that are applicable to life today. Reeves suggests that the massive emergence of the Bodhisattvas from the Earth, born from the ground of daily life, is an ongoing process, not a one-time story.\n\nNikkyo Niwano describes a humanistic tone to the ways the emerging bodhisattvas greet the Buddha, inquiring about his health and the receptions of people to his teachings. The implication is that the Buddha, as a religion founder, is not a godhead or the recipient of a divine revelation. Rather, his enlightenment stemmed from his own personal efforts.\n\nDōgen, the founder of the Japanese Sōtō Zen school, made more references to the Lotus Sutra in his commentaries than any other sutras. His commentaries focused primarily on the 15th (Emerging from the Earth) and 16th (Life Span) Chapters of the Lotus Sutra. Dōgen made numerous speculations about the significance of the bodhisattvas who emerged from the underground.\n\nAs conceived by Dōgen, the stories of the underground bodhisattvas and the Buddha's inconceivable life-span serve as a fundamental shift in the development of East Asian Mahayana understanding of Buddhahood, an immediate attainment based on fundamental awakening rather than an achievement based on lifetimes of arduous practice. This can be conceived as \"Shortening the Path\" or a transition from a \"progress philosophy\" to a \"leap philosophy.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "5341431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5341431", "title": "Carmen (verse)", "text": "Carmen (verse)\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the term \"carmen\" was generally used to signify a verse; but in its proper sense, it referred to a spell or prayer, form of expiation, execration, etc. Surviving examples include the \"Carmen Arvale\" and the \"Carmen Saliare\".\n\nSpells and incantations were used for a variety of purposes. If a spell was intended to harm someone, the State could interfere to protect him. For instance, it was not unusual for a farmer whose crops had failed to accuse another farmer of having, by a \"carmen\", lured the crops away. Tibullus, in a poem in which he complains that an old woman has bewitched Marathus, takes the opportunity to recount various feats of witches, such as transferring crops from one field to another. Similarly, Pliny the Elder records in \"Naturalis Historia\" (XVIII. 8) that a certain freedman, Furius, by using better implements and better methods than his neighbor, obtained richer crops from a smaller strip of land. A neighbor compelled Furius to go before the tribes and accused him of having bewitched his field. But when the tribes saw his sturdy slaves and his implements of witchcraft—hoes, rakes, and ploughs—they acquitted him.\n\nThat incantations were chanted is a matter of common observance and scarcely needs illustration. For example, in magic rites, the purpose of which was to induce a dislocated or broken bone to come together, the incantation was sung (\"cantare\"). Tibullus writes that a witch composed a charm for him, to be chanted three times, after which he had to spit; then Delia's husband would believe gossip about other lovers of Delia, but not about her and Tibullus.\n\nThe two oldest prayers of the Romans which are still known—the \"Carmen Arvale\" and the \"Carmen Saliare\"—were both chanted. Livy writes that \"the leaping priests went through the city chanting their hymns.\" There is reason to believe that the old prayers which Cato has preserved in his treatise on agriculture were originally in metrical form; but in the directions given to the worshiper, the verb \"dicito\", and not \"cantato\", precedes the prayer, showing that, in Cato's time at least, such prayers were \"spoken\" rather than sung. However, these prayers, even in the form in which they are found in Cato, are predominantly spondaic, in keeping with the slow movement of the chant and with the solemn religious character of the rites. In ceremonies intended to bring thunderbolts down from the sky, incantations were used.\n\nRepetition characterized the magic incantation. For instance, the incantation of the lover in Virgil's eighth \"Eclogue\", already referred to, was repeated nine times; the incantation which the witch formulated for Tibullus had to be uttered three times. At the conclusion of the prayer to Pales is the following: \"With these words the goddess must be appeased. So do you, facing the east, utter them four times...\" The verses of the \"Carmen Saliare\" were each chanted three times, as the Leaping Priests of Mars danced in threefold measure. W. Warde Fowler, who on the whole is not inclined to identify spell and prayer, writes in \"The Religious Experience of the Roman People\" (1911) that the verses \"seem certainly to belong rather to the region of magic than of religion proper.\" Repetition was also characteristic of the \"Carmen Arvale\" and the prayer of the Fratres Attiedii.\n\n\"Carmen\" is derived from the root \"canere\" (meaning \"to sing\") with the passive nominal ending -\"men\" (therefore \"a thing sung,\" cf. \"flumen\" from \"fluere\" or \"numen\" from \"nuere\").\n"}
{"id": "537894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=537894", "title": "Clergy reserve", "text": "Clergy reserve\n\nClergy Reserves were tracts of land in Upper Canada and Lower Canada reserved for the support of \"Protestant clergy\" by the Constitutional Act of 1791. One-seventh of all surveyed Crown lands were set aside, totalling and respectively for each Province, and provision was made to dedicate some of those reserved lands as glebe land in support of any parsonage or rectory that may be established by the Church of England. The provincial legislatures could vary or repeal these provisions, but royal assent could not be given prior to such passed bills having been laid before both houses of the British Parliament for at least thirty days.\n\nThe first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, interpreted \"Protestant clergy\" to mean the clergy of Church of England only. However, in 1823 the Law Officers of the Crown held that the Church of Scotland was also entitled to a share of the revenues under the 1791 Act. Although Lt-Governor Maitland attempted to suppress the publication of that decision, the Legislature passed resolutions the following year that recognized that church's status.\n\nComplications in establishing leasing procedures prevented the reserve lands from being leased before 1803. Until 1819, the reserve lands were managed by the Province, and in most years they earned revenues that were barely sufficient to cover their expenses. After the Rev. John Strachan was appointed to the Executive Council of Upper Canada in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England's autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. The Clergy Corporation, of which Strachan became the chairman, was subsequently incorporated in 1819 to manage the Clergy Reserves.\n\nThe 1819 charter (drafted by Strachan's former student, Attorney General John Beverly Robinson) provided for the Bishop of Quebec to become the perpetual Principal and Director (as he was for the Lower Canada body), who, with twelve other directors, constituted the Board. The Bishop's Official (named by the Bishop) and the rectors of Niagara and York could each serve as acting chairman.\n\nOther perpetual directors were:\n\nAny two directors, together with the Principal or an acting chairman, constituted a quorum, but, because of the poor network of roads, most clergy members were generally unable to attend Corporation meetings. This effectively meant that Strachan (as rector of York), together with the Inspector General and Surveyor General, controlled the Board. These three members were part of the Family Compact, of which Strachan was the leader.\n\nThe reserves were allotted in lots of , generally intermixed with other lots sold to individuals within each surveyed township. Except in the Talbot Settlement (where they were located off the main roads), they were generally arranged in a checkerboard pattern within each township, and were a serious obstacle to economic development as they were effectively wasteland, either being abandoned by lessees after the timber had been fully harvested, or unattractive because of the availability of cheap freehold land. This was recognized by the Legislative Assembly in 1817 when it passed resolutions that condemned the lands as \"insurmountable obstacles\" and called on Westminster to authorize their sale.\n\nUntil 1827, no reserve lands were sold. They were leased for terms of twenty-one years, with rents on a sliding scale:\n\nEven with higher rates being charged from 1819, total annual revenues were still only £1200 in 1824, and only one-third could be collected without pursuing legal action.\n\nIn 1826, the Canada Company was formed to sell off the remaining crown and clergy reserves in the province. However, because of opposition from Strachan, the Company received in the Huron Tract, in substitution for the originally contemplated of clergy reserve lands. As the provincial policy of free land grants had come to an end, Strachan lobbied for and secured an Act from the British Parliament granting authority to sell up to one-fourth of all reserve lands, up to each year, from which there would be income sufficient to support 200300 Anglican clergymen.\n\nIn 1836, before Sir John Colborne was succeeded by Sir Francis Bond Head as lieutenant-governor, he created 57 rectories for the Church of England, with glebe land totalling . This action created significant political dissent, and was subsequently declared illegal in 1837, but was later held in 1856 to have been lawful. In the interim, it became one of the issues in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 (and subsequently identified as such in the 1838 report written by Lord Durham), where William Lyon Mackenzie exclaimed to the crowd outside Montgomery's Tavern:\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada passed a law to sell the reserves in 1840, but it was disallowed and displaced by an Imperial Act passed later in that year. Although considered to be more favourable to the Church of England, the Act as passed provided that only one-half of future sales would be dedicated on a 2:1 basis to the Churches of England and Scotland, with the remaining half being distributed to all other churches according to their respective strengths. The administration of the reserve lands was transferred to the Crown Lands Department, where it was handled in a more professional manner.\n\nUnlike the distribution of lots that was pursued by Simcoe in Upper Canada, Alured Clarke, lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada, instituted a policy of setting aside large blocks of land apart from either current or contiguous settlement.\n\nThe Clergy Corporation in Lower Canada, more formally known as the \"Corporation for Superintending, Managing and Conducting the Clergy Reserves within the Province of Lower-Canada\", was constituted with the Bishop of Quebec (initially the Right Rev. Jacob Mountain) as perpetual Principal and Director, and with rectors of four parishes within the diocese constituted as perpetual directors. In 1828, a British parliamentary committee reported that leases were being granted on certain terms:\n\nThe reserve lands generated little income in Lower Canada, with the average annual profit from such activity amounting to only £3 between 1791 and 1837.\n\nPressure arose to reform the entire structure of the reserves, but the government of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine chose not to proceed on such a course, because of the resistance of the established churches and the roadblocks presented by the 1791 Act. However, such caution eventually came to be seen as inflexibility, which would be overcome by the rise of the Grit movement in 1850.\n\nEven as late as 1853, Strachan was still campaigning to ensure the Church of England's dominance in the matter. As he stated in a letter to Lord Newcastle:\n\nFollowing the victory of Augustin-Norbert Morin and Allan MacNab in the 1854 general election, in conjunction with the abolition of seigneurial tenure in Lower Canada, the lands were finally removed from church control and secularized under an Act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, under which:\n\nReform of the Clergy Reserves was a major issue in Canadian politics from its creation until its abolition. The controversy stemmed from the fact that many supporters of the religious endowment were part of the Tory ruling class. Even Robert Baldwin, who was the leader of the struggle for Responsible Government did not advocate for complete abolition and chose to resign his seat rather than tackle the question.\n\nIn 1867, the Municipalities Funds for Upper and Lower Canada were declared to be part of the joint property of the new provinces of Ontario and Quebec, subject to division and adjustment at a later date by arbitrators appointed under s. 142 of the \"British North America Act, 1867\". The funds were awarded to each province respectively in September 1870, and the award itself was held to be valid by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in March 1878. In Ontario, the Fund continued to be accounted for separately until the passage of an Act in 1908, where all special funds were declared to form part of the province's Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\n"}

{"id": "1961924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961924", "title": "Dean (Christianity)", "text": "Dean (Christianity)\n\nA dean, in a church context, is a cleric holding certain positions of authority within a religious hierarchy. The title is used mainly in the Anglican Communion, the Roman Catholic Church, and many Lutheran denominations. A dean's assistant is called a subdean.\n\nLatin \"decanus\" has various meanings related to the most important of ten parts, perhaps originally in astrology. In the military, it was the head of a group of ten, and by the 5th century CE, it was the head of a group of ten monks. It came to refer to various civil functionaries in the later Roman Empire.\n\nBased on the monastic use, it came to mean the head of a chapter of canons of a collegiate church or cathedral church.\n\nBased on that use, deans in universities now fill various administrative positions.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, the Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Cardinal Vice-Dean are the president and vice-president of the college. Both are elected. Except for presiding and delegating administrative tasks, they have no authority over the cardinals, acting as \"primus inter pares\" (first among equals).\n\nIn the universities that grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, a university dean came to be an official with various administrative duties.\n\nIn the Church of England and elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, the dean is the chief resident cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches, and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.\n\nIn some parts of the Communion (particularly in the Scottish Episcopal Church and, formerly in some cathedrals in England), the senior resident cleric in a cathedral is a provost. Each diocese of the Scottish Episcopal Church has a \"dean of the diocese\": this is a cleric who, rather than heading the cathedral staff, assists the bishop in the administration of the diocese. In this way, a Scottish Episcopal dean is similar to an archdeacon in the other member churches of the Communion (a post that does not exist in the Scottish church). In the Anglican Church of Canada, the roles of senior cleric of the cathedral are combined in one person who is referred to as \"Rector of Cathedral and Dean of Diocese\". Thus, Peter Elliott is Rector of Christ Church Cathedral and Dean of New Westminster.\n\nThe style \"The Very Reverend\" distinguishes a cleric as a dean (or a cathedral provost). For example, the Very Reverend June Osborne was Dean of Salisbury Cathedral. The legal act by which a cathedral dean in the Church of England takes up his or her role is the \"institution\", which is invariably followed in the same service by the installation (into his/her \"stall\" in the cathedral church); an \"institution and installation\" are very often referred to simply as an installation. In consideration of the high status of a Dean, the Very Reverend title is normally a permanent title preferment.\n\nSome important deans include the deans of St Paul's, Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. Westminster Abbey is a royal peculiar, not the seat of any bishop or a cathedral, but is led by a dean. The deans of Washington National Cathedral and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin are likewise important clerics in their churches.\n\nIn many parts of the Anglican Communion, parishes are grouped together to form deaneries, each being a constituent administrative district of the diocese. Usually, a deanery is led by one of the incumbents of the deanery's parishes, who is called a \"rural dean\", but in more urban areas this has often been replaced by the title \"area dean\" or \"regional dean\". Such a dean chairs the meeting of the deanery's clergy (which, like a cathedral, is called a chapter), and may also chair a deanery synod. Rural Deans (and those known by alternative titles) rank as primi inter pares of their chapters, and do not have the seniority of cathedral or diocesan deans.\n\nThe head of an Anglican theological college or seminary may also be called a dean (in common with its use in education).\n\nThe title \"dean\" is conferred upon a pastor of a parish who serves as a senior figure, though usually without specific jurisdictional authority, over a section of a diocese. These are sometimes referred to as \"rural deans\", and are expected to show a degree of leadership among the pastors of the region, known as a deanery. This function is sometimes titled \"vicar forane\". An episcopal vicar serves a similar function, but has more formal authority and specific powers under canon law.\n\nIn recent years, the Catholic Church in England and Wales has introduced the custom of designating cathedral deans, formerly known as cathedral administrators. However, the term differs slightly from the Anglican usage as Catholic deans do not necessarily preside over the cathedral chapter (this function belonging to the office of Provost), and are not necessarily required even to be a member of the chapter. More commonly, in places throughout the world where a cathedral chapter has not been erected (as for instance, in the United States, where there are no chapters at all), the term rector is used for the priest who serves as chief administrator of a cathedral church.\n\nAnother important use of the term within the Catholic Church is in the office of the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who serves as senior member of that body. Cardinal Angelo Sodano is the current dean.\n\nWithin the Lutheran tradition, particularly in the Nordic and Baltic tradition of evangelical episcopal Lutheranism, senior clergy bear the title 'Dean'. Each diocese usually has a cathedral Dean, in charge of the cathedral church, and a series of area deans to supervise the clergy in a given geographical area. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, there are also deans in charge of leading the administrative work and personnel of the Chapters. \n\nUnited Methodist Christians often speak of a \"dean\" in terms of the dean of the cabinet. Every annual conference has a bishop's cabinet made up of the district superintendents under the bishop's appointment, as well as occasionally a few other conference officials. One of these superintendents is chosen by his or her colleagues to serve as the dean, usually for one year. This dean then has certain administrative and leadership responsibilities, and is accountable to the bishop.\n\nIn various other religious denominations, the title \"dean\" may be used informally in its wider sense of a senior or venerated member of a congregation. The title may also used in its academic sense in parochial schools.\n\n"}

{"id": "58593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58593", "title": "El (deity)", "text": "El (deity)\n\nSpecific deities known as \"ʾEl\" or \"ʾIl\" include the supreme god of the ancient Canaanite religion and the supreme god of East Semitic speakers in the Early Dynastic Period.\n\nCognate forms are found throughout the Semitic languages. They include Ugaritic , pl. ; Phoenician pl. ; Hebrew , pl. ; Aramaic ; Akkadian , pl. .\n\nIn northwest Semitic use, \"El\" was both a generic word for any god and the special name or title of a particular god who was distinguished from other gods as being \"the god\".\nEl is listed at the head of many pantheons. In some Canaanite and Ugaritic sources, El played a role as father of the gods or of creation.\n\nHowever, because the word sometimes refers to a god other than the great god Ēl, it is frequently ambiguous as to whether Ēl followed by another name means the great god Ēl with a particular epithet applied or refers to another god entirely. For example, in the Ugaritic texts, \"ʾil mlk\" is understood to mean \"Ēl the King\" but \"ʾil hd\" as \"the god Hadad\".\n\nThe Semitic root \"ʾlh\" (Arabic \"\", Aramaic \"ʾAlāh\", \"ʾElāh\", Hebrew \"ʾelōah\") may be \"ʾl\" with a parasitic h, and \"ʾl\" may be an abbreviated form of \"ʾlh\". In Ugaritic the plural form meaning \"gods\" is , equivalent to Hebrew \"powers\". In the Hebrew texts this word is interpreted as being semantically singular for \"god\" by biblical commentators. However the documentary hypothesis developed originally in the 1870s, identifies these that different authors - Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and the Priestly source - were responsible for editing stories from a polytheistic religion into those of a monotheistic religion. Inconsistencies that arise between monotheism and polytheism in the texts are reflective of this hypothesis.\n\nThe stem \"ʾl\" is found prominently in the earliest strata of east Semitic, northwest Semitic, and south Semitic groups. Personal names including the stem \"ʾl\" are found with similar patterns in both Amorite and Sabaic—which indicates that probably already in Proto-Semitic \"ʾl\" was both a generic term for \"god\" and the common name or title of a single particular god.\n\nThe Egyptian god Ptah is given the title \"ḏū gitti\" 'Lord of Gath' in a prism from Tel Lachish which has on its opposite face the name of Amenhotep II (c. 1435–1420 BCE). The title \"ḏū gitti\" is also found in Serābitṭ text 353. Cross (1973, p. 19) points out that Ptah is often called \"the Lord (or one) of eternity\" and thinks it may be this identification of ʼĒl with Ptah that lead to the epithet \"’olam\" 'eternal' being applied to ʼĒl so early and so consistently. (However, in the Ugaritic texts, Ptah is seemingly identified rather with the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis.)\n\nA Phoenician inscribed amulet of the seventh century BCE from Arslan Tash may refer to ʼĒl. The text was translated by Rosenthal (1969, p. 658) as follows:\n\nHowever, Cross (1973, p. 17) translated the text as follows:\n\nIn some inscriptions, the name \"’Ēl qōne ’arṣ\" meaning \"ʼĒl creator of Earth\" appears, even including a late inscription at Leptis Magna in Tripolitania dating to the second century. In Hittite texts, the expression becomes the single name \"Ilkunirsa\", this Ilkunirsa appearing as the husband of Asherdu (Asherah) and father of 77 or 88 sons.\n\nIn a Hurrian hymn to ʼĒl (published in \"Ugaritica V\", text RS 24.278), he is called \"’il brt\" and \"’il dn\" which Cross (p. 39) takes as 'ʼĒl of the covenant' and 'ʼĒl the judge' respectively.\n\nAmorite inscriptions from Sam'al refer to numerous gods, sometimes by name, sometimes by title, especially by such titles as \"Ilabrat\" 'God of the people'(?), \"ʾil abīka\" \"God of your father\", \"ʾil abīni\" \"God of our father\" and so forth. Various family gods are recorded, divine names listed as belonging to a particular family or clan, sometimes by title and sometimes by name, including the name \"ʾil\" \"God\". In Amorite personal names, the most common divine elements are \"ʾil\" \"God\", \"Hadad\"/\"Adad\", and \"Dagan\". It is likely that \"ʾil\" is also very often the god called in Akkadian texts \"Amurru\" or \"ʾil ʾamurru\".\n\nFor the Canaanites and the ancient Levantine region as a whole, Ēl or Il was the supreme god, the father of mankind and all creatures. He also fathered many gods, most importantly Hadad, Yam, and Mot, each sharing similar attributes to the Greco-Roman gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades respectively.\n\nAs recorded on the clay tablets of Ugarit, El is the husband of the goddess Asherah.\n\nThree pantheon lists found at Ugarit (modern —, Syria) begin with the four gods \"’il-’ib\" (which according to Cross; is the name of a generic kind of deity, perhaps the divine ancestor of the people), Ēl, Dagnu (that is Dagon), and Ba’l Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or Hadad). Though Ugarit had a large temple dedicated to Dagon and another to Hadad, there was no temple dedicated to Ēl.\n\nĒl is called again and again \"Tôru ‘Ēl\" (\"Bull Ēl\" or \"the bull god\"). He is \"bātnyu binwāti\" (\"Creator of creatures\"), \"’abū banī ’ili\" (\"father of the gods\"), and \"‘abū ‘adami\" (\"father of man\"). He is \"qāniyunu ‘ôlam\" (\"creator eternal\"), the epithet \"‘ôlam\" appearing in Hebrew form in the Hebrew name of God \"’ēl ‘ôlam\" \"God Eternal\" in Genesis 21.33. He is \"ḥātikuka\" (\"your patriarch\"). Ēl is the grey-bearded ancient one, full of wisdom, \"malku\" (\"King\"), \"’abū šamīma\" (\"Father of years\"), \"’El gibbōr\" (\"Ēl the warrior\"). He is also named \"lṭpn\" of unknown meaning, variously rendered as Latpan, Latipan, or Lutpani (\"shroud-face\" by \"Strong's Hebrew Concordance\").\n\n\"El\" (Father of Heaven / Saturn) and his major son: \"Hadad\" (Father of Earth / Jupiter), are symbolized both by the bull, and both wear bull horns on their headdresses.\n\nIn Canaanite mythology, El builds a desert sanctuary with his children and his two wives, leading to speculation that at one point El was a desert god.\n\nThe mysterious Ugaritic text \"Shachar and Shalim\" tells how (perhaps near the beginning of all things) Ēl came to shores of the sea and saw two women who bobbed up and down. Ēl was sexually aroused and took the two with him, killed a bird by throwing a staff at it, and roasted it over a fire. He asked the women to tell him when the bird was fully cooked, and to then address him either as husband or as father, for he would thenceforward behave to them as they called him. They saluted him as husband. He then lay with them, and they gave birth to \"Shachar\" (\"Dawn\") and \"Shalim\" (\"Dusk\"). Again Ēl lay with his wives and the wives gave birth to \"the gracious gods\", \"cleavers of the sea\", \"children of the sea\". The names of these wives are not explicitly provided, but some confusing rubrics at the beginning of the account mention the goddess Athirat, who is otherwise Ēl's chief wife, and the goddess Raḥmayyu (\"the one of the womb\"), otherwise unknown.\n\nIn the Ugaritic Ba‘al cycle, Ēl is introduced dwelling on (or in) Mount Lel (\"Lel\" possibly meaning \"Night\") at the fountains of the two rivers at the spring of the two deeps. He dwells in a tent according to some interpretations of the text which may explain why he had no temple in Ugarit. As to the rivers and the spring of the two deeps, these might refer to real streams, or to the mythological sources of the salt water ocean and the fresh water sources under the earth, or to the waters above the heavens and the waters beneath the earth.\n\nIn the episode of the \"Palace of Ba‘al\", the god Ba‘al Hadad invites the \"seventy sons of Athirat\" to a feast in his new palace. Presumably these sons have been fathered on Athirat by Ēl; in following passages they seem be the gods (\"’ilm\") in general or at least a large portion of them. The only sons of Ēl named individually in the Ugaritic texts are Yamm (\"Sea\"), Mot (\"Death\"), and Ashtar, who may be the chief and leader of most of the sons of Ēl. Ba‘al Hadad is a few times called Ēl's son rather than the son of Dagan as he is normally called, possibly because Ēl is in the position of a clan-father to all the gods.\n\nThe fragmentary text R.S. 24.258 describes a banquet to which Ēl invites the other gods and then disgraces himself by becoming outrageously drunk and passing out after confronting an otherwise unknown Hubbay, \"he with the horns and tail\". The text ends with an incantation for the cure of some disease, possibly hang-over.\n\nThe Hebrew form (אל) appears in Latin letters in Standard Hebrew transcription as El and in Tiberian Hebrew transcription as ʾĒl. \"El\" is a generic word for \"god\" that could be used for any god, including Hadad, Moloch, or Yahweh. \n\nIn the Tanakh, \"’lōhîm\" is the normal word for a god or the great god (or gods, given that the 'im' suffix makes a word plural in Hebrew). But the form \"’El\" also appears, mostly in poetic passages and in the patriarchal narratives attributed to the Priestly source of the documentary hypothesis. It occurs 217 times in the Masoretic Text: seventy-three times in the Psalms and fifty-five times in the Book of Job, and otherwise mostly in poetic passages or passages written in elevated prose. It occasionally appears with the definite article as \"hā’Ēl\" 'the god' (for example in ).\n\nThe theological position of the Tanakh is that the names \"Ēl\" and \"’Ĕlōhîm\", when used in the singular to mean the supreme god, refer to Yahweh, beside whom other gods are supposed to be either nonexistent or insignificant. Whether this was a long-standing belief or a relatively new one has long been the subject of inconclusive scholarly debate about the prehistory of the sources of the Tanakh and about the prehistory of Israelite religion. In the P strand, YHWH says in :\nI revealed myself to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Ēl Shaddāi, but was not known to them by my name, YHVH.\n\nBefore El's revelation with the name of Yahweh, it is said in that Abraham accepted the blessing of El, when Melchizedek, the king of Salem and high priest of its deity El Elyon blessed him. One scholarly position is that the identification of Yahweh with Ēl is late, that Yahweh was earlier thought of as only one of many gods, and not normally identified with Ēl. Another is that in much of the Hebrew Bible the name El is an alternate name for Yahweh, but in the Elohist and Priestly traditions it is conceived as an earlier name than Yahweh. Mark Smith has argued that Yahweh and El were originally separate, but were considered synonymous from very early on. The name Yahweh is used in the Bible Tanakh in the first book of ; and says that at that time, people began to \"call upon the name of the LORD\".\n\nIn some places, especially in , Yahweh is clearly envisioned as a storm god, something not true of Ēl so far as we know (although true of his son, Ba'al Hadad). It is Yahweh who is prophesied to one day battle Leviathan the serpent, and slay the dragon in the sea in . The slaying of the serpent in myth is a deed attributed to both Ba’al Hadad and ‘Anat in the Ugaritic texts, but not to Ēl.\n\nSuch mythological motifs are variously seen as late survivals from a period when Yahweh held a place in theology comparable to that of Hadad at Ugarit; or as late henotheistic/monotheistic applications to Yahweh of deeds more commonly attributed to Hadad; or simply as examples of eclectic application of the same motifs and imagery to various different gods. Similarly, it is argued inconclusively whether Ēl Shaddāi, Ēl ‘Ôlām, Ēl ‘Elyôn, and so forth, were originally understood as separate divinities. Albrecht Alt presented his theories on the original differences of such gods in \"Der Gott der Väter\" in 1929. But others have argued that from patriarchal times, these different names were in fact generally understood to refer to the same single great god, Ēl. This is the position of Frank Moore Cross (1973). What is certain is that the form ’El does appear in Israelite names from every period including the name \"Yiśrā’ēl\" (\"Israel\"), meaning \"El strives\" or \"struggled with El\".\n\nAccording to \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\",\n\nIt seems almost certain that the God of the Jews evolved gradually from the Canaanite El, who was in all likelihood the \"God of Abraham\"... If El was the high God of Abraham—Elohim, the prototype of Yahveh—Asherah was his wife, and there are archaeological indications that she was perceived as such before she was in effect \"divorced\" in the context of emerging Judaism of the 7th century BCE. (See .)\n\nThe apparent plural form \"’Ēlîm\" or \"’Ēlim\" \"gods\" occurs only four times in the Tanakh. , understood as an enthronement psalm, begins:\n\nTraditionally \"bnê ’ēlîm\" has been interpreted as 'sons of the mighty', 'mighty ones', for \"’El\" can mean 'mighty', though such use may be metaphorical (compare the English expression \"[by] God awful\"). It is possible also that the expression \"’ēlîm\" in both places descends from an archaic stock phrase in which \"’lm\" was a singular form with the \"m\"-enclitic and therefore to be translated as 'sons of Ēl'. The \"m\"-enclitic appears elsewhere in the Tanakh and in other Semitic languages. Its meaning is unknown, possibly simply emphasis. It appears in similar contexts in Ugaritic texts where the expression \"bn ’il\" alternates with \"bn ’ilm\", but both must mean 'sons of Ēl'. That phrase with \"m\"-enclitic also appears in Phoenician inscriptions as late as the fifth century BCE.\n\nOne of the other two occurrences in the Tanakh is in the \"Song of Moses\", :\n\nWho is like you among the Gods (\"’ēlim\"), Yahweh?\n\nThe final occurrence is in :\n\nAnd the king will do according to his pleasure; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself over every god (\"’ēl\"), and against the God of Gods (\"’El ’Elîm\") he will speak outrageous things, and will prosper until the indignation is accomplished: for that which is decided will be done.\n\nThere are a few cases in the Tanakh where some think \"’El\" referring to the great god Ēl is not equated with Yahweh. One is in , in the taunt against a man who claims to be divine, in this instance, the leader of Tyre:\n\nSon of man, say to the prince of Tyre: \"Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because your heart is proud and you have said: \"I am \"’ēl\" (god), in the seat of \"’lōhîm\" (\"gods\"), I am enthroned in the middle of the seas.\" Yet you are man and not \"’El\" even though you have made your heart like the heart of \"’lōhîm\" ('gods').\n\nHere \"’ēl\" might refer to a generic god, or to a highest god, Ēl. When viewed as applying to the King of Tyre specifically, the king was probably not thinking of Yahweh. When viewed as a general taunt against anyone making divine claims, it may or may not refer to Yahweh depending on the context.\n\nIn we find \"’Ēl Brît\" 'God of the Covenant', seemingly the same as the \"Ba‘al Brît\" 'Lord of the Covenant' whose worship has been condemned a few verses earlier. See Baal for a discussion of this passage.\n\nThis could mean that Yahweh judges along with many other gods as one of the council of the high god Ēl. However it can also mean that Yahweh stands in the Divine Council (generally known as the Council of Ēl), as Ēl judging among the other members of the Council. The following verses in which the god condemns those whom he says were previously named \"gods\" (\"Elohim\") and \"sons of the Most High\" suggest the god here is in fact Ēl judging the lesser gods.\n\nAn archaic phrase appears in , \"kôkkbê ’ēl\" 'stars of God', referring to the circumpolar stars that never set, possibly especially to the seven stars of Ursa Major. The phrase also occurs in the Pyrgi Inscription as \"hkkbm ’l\" (preceded by the definite article \"h\" and followed by the \"m\"-enclitic). Two other apparent fossilized expressions are \"arzê-’ēl\" 'cedars of God' (generally translated something like 'mighty cedars', 'goodly cedars') in (in Hebrew verse 11) and \"kharrê-’ēl\" 'mountains of God' (generally translated something like 'great mountains', 'mighty mountains') in (in Hebrew verse 6).\n\nFor the reference in some texts of to seventy sons of God corresponding to the seventy sons of Ēl in the Ugaritic texts, see `Elyôn.\n\nPhilo of Byblos (c. 64–141 AD) was a Greek writer whose account \"Sanchuniathon\" survives in quotation by Eusebius and may contain the major surviving traces of Phoenician mythology. Ēl (rendered \"Elus\" or called by his standard Greek counterpart Cronus) is not the creator God or first God. Ēl is rather the son of Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Ge). Sky and Earth are themselves children of ‘Elyôn 'Most High'. Ēl is brother to the God Bethel, to Dagon and to an unknown god, equated with the Greek Atlas and to the goddesses Aphrodite/’Ashtart, Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (equated with Ba‘alat Gebal). Ēl is the father of Persephone and of Athena (presumably the goddess ‘Anat).\n\nSky and Earth have separated from one another in hostility, but Sky insists on continuing to force himself on Earth and attempts to destroy the children born of such unions. At last, Ēl, with the advice of his daughter Athena and the god Hermes Trismegistus (perhaps Thoth), Ēl successfully attacks his father Sky with a sickle and spear of iron. He and his military allies the \"Eloim\" gain Sky's kingdom.\n\nIn a later passage it is explained that Ēl castrated Sky. One of Sky's concubines (who was given to Ēl's brother Dagon) was already pregnant by Sky. The son who is born of the union, called Demarûs or Zeus, but once called Adodus, is obviously Hadad, the Ba‘al of the Ugaritic texts who now becomes an ally of his grandfather Sky and begins to make war on Ēl.\n\nĒl has three wives, his sisters or half-sisters Aphrodite/Astarte (‘Ashtart), Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (identified by Sanchuniathon with Ba‘alat Gebal the tutelary goddess of Byblos, a city which Sanchuniathon says that Ēl founded).\n\nEl is depicted primarily as a warrior; in Ugaritic sources Baal has the warrior role and El is peaceful, and it may be that the \"Sanchuniathon\" depicts an earlier tradition that was more preserved in the southern regions of Canaan.\n\nEusebius, through whom the \"Sanchuniathon\" is preserved, is not interested in setting the work forth completely or in order. But we are told that Ēl slew his own son Sadidus (a name that some commentators think might be a corruption of \"Shaddai\", one of the epithets of the Biblical Ēl) and that Ēl also beheaded one of his daughters. Later, perhaps referring to this same death of Sadidus we are told:\n\nA fuller account of the sacrifice appears later:\nThe account also relates that Thoth:\nThis is the form under which Ēl/Cronus appears on coins from Byblos from the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BCE) four spread wings and two folded wings, leaning on a staff. Such images continued to appear on coins until after the time of Augustus.\n\nA bilingual inscription from Palmyra dated to the 1st century equates \"Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth\" with the Greek god Poseidon. Going back to the 8th century BCE, the bilingual inscription at Karatepe in the Taurus Mountains equates \"Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth\" to Luwian hieroglyphs read as \"a-a-ś\", this being the Luwian form of the name of the Babylonian water god Ea, lord of the abyss of water under the earth. (This inscription lists Ēl in second place in the local pantheon, following Ba‘al Shamîm and preceding the \"Eternal Sun\".)\n\nPoseidon is known to have been worshipped in Beirut, his image appearing on coins from that city. Poseidon of Beirut was also worshipped at Delos where there was an association of merchants, shipmasters, and warehousemen called the Poseidoniastae of Berytus founded in 110 or 109 BCE. Three of the four chapels at its headquarters on the hill northwest of the Sacred Lake were dedicated to Poseidon, the Tyche of the city equated with Astarte (that is ‘Ashtart), and to Eshmun.\n\nAlso at Delos, that association of Tyrians, though mostly devoted to Heracles-Melqart, elected a member to bear a crown every year when sacrifices to Poseidon took place. A banker named Philostratus donated two altars, one to Palaistine Aphrodite Urania (‘Ashtart) and one to Poseidon \"of Ascalon\".\n\nThough Sanchuniathon distinguishes Poseidon from his Elus/Cronus, this might be a splitting off of a particular aspect of Ēl in a euhemeristic account. Identification of an aspect of Ēl with Poseidon rather than with Cronus might have been felt to better fit with Hellenistic religious practice, if indeed this Phoenician Poseidon really is Ēl who dwells at the source of the two deeps in Ugaritic texts. More information is needed to be certain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This ancient marriage tradition from the Indian subcontinent was based on mutual attraction between two people, with no rituals, witnesses or family participation. The marriage of Dushyanta and Shakuntala was a historically celebrated example of this class of marriage.\n\nMythic beings in Hinduism and Buddhism, Gandharvas are male nature spirits and the masculine counterparts of the Apsaras. They are passionate lovers of women and arouse erotic and romantic passion in women.\n\nThe Smritis of Hinduism recognize eight methods of marriage, one of them being Gandharva marriage. The other seven are: \"Brahma\", \"Daiva\", \"Arya\", \"Prajapatya\", \"Asura\", \"Raksasa\" and \"Paisacha\".\n\nAccording to \"Apastamba Grhyasutra\", an ancient Hindu literature, Gandharva marriage is a method of marriage where the woman chooses her own husband. They meet each other of their own accord, consent to live together, and their relationship is consummated in copulation born of passion. This form of marriage did not require consent of parents or anyone else. According to Vedic texts, this is one of earliest and common forms of marriage in Rig Vedic times.\n\nIn Rig vedic opinions and classical literature, the commonly described marriage method was Gandharva, where the bride and the groom had met each other in their ordinary village life, or in various other places such as regional festivals and fairs, begun to enjoy each other's company, and decided to be together. This free choice and mutual attraction were generally approved by their kinsmen. A passage in the \"Atharvaveda\" suggests that parents usually left the daughter free in selection of her lover and directly encouraged her in being forward in love-affairs. The mother of the girl thought of the time when the daughter's developed youth (\"Pativedanam\", post-puberty), that she would win a husband for herself, it was a smooth and happy sort of affair with nothing scandalous and unnatural about it. The translated version of the \"Atharvaveda\" (Strikaratâni, ii.36) passage is:\n<poem>\nMay (Oh Agni!) a suitor after our own heart come to us;\nmay he come to this maiden with fortune;\nMay she be agreeable to suitors,\n\nAs this comfortable cave (Oh Indra!) furnishing a safe abode\nhath become pleasing to all life,\nthus may this woman be a favourite of fortune,\n\nDo thou ascend the full, inexhaustible ship of fortune\nto bring hither to this woman the suitor who shall be agreeable to thee.\nBring hither by thy shouts (Oh lord of wealth!) the suitor –\n</poem>\nIn Mahabharata, one of two major epics of Hindus, Rishi Kanva, the foster father of Shakuntala, recommends Gandharva marriage with the statement “\"The marriage of a desiring woman with a desiring man, without religious ceremonies, is the best marriage\".” Elsewhere in Mahabharata (iii:190.36), the epic says “\"No man any longer asks for the daughter, nor does a father give away his daughter, they (women) find the man for themselves\".”\n\nGandharva marriage over time became controversial, disputed and debated. Majority of ancient scholars discouraged it on religious and moral grounds. One argument found in the classical literature is that Gandharva marriage originates and sustains from lust, ignores the sacred rituals and vows the groom and bride must make to each other, and it does not consider other aspects of a relationship necessary in a long married life that lasts through the old age. Such a marriage, argued these ancient vedic scholars, may or may not be lasting.\n\nManu argued that Gandharva marriage may be suited for some, but not for most; he argues Gandharva marriage is best suited for males who are warriors, serving in the military, administrators, nobility and rulers (Kshatriyas). Baudhayana, another ancient vedic scholar, disagrees and writes Gandharva marriage is suitable for most people including merchants and farmers and artisans (Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras), but not for the priest families (Brahmin castes). Baudhayana claims that this is so because Gandharva marriage is based on love and free will. Narada, yet another ancient scholar who wrote Nāradasmṛti sometime between 100 BC and 400 AD, suggests Gandharva marriage is best for everyone including the Brahmins, calling it \"sadharna\"; Narada claims the only methods of marriage that are wrong are those that are based on abduction, violence, fraud or purchase.\n\nThere is no consensus theory to explain why Gandharva marriages declined. One theory claims that as prosperity and wealth increased, parents sought greater control of the activities and social life of their children. Another theory claims that after the vedic period when marriageable age for girls was 16 years or higher, social upheavals encouraged child marriages. The social upheavals included those caused by wars between Indian kingdoms, unexpected attacks and attempts to take young women and men as prisoners during waves of attacks from Persia, central Asia and Muslim Sultans/Emperors. With the arrival of Muslim culture and rulers, which itself favored child marriages, the Hindu culture too shifted to child marriages where the girl was not mature. This practice eliminated the girl's desire or ability to seek men on her accord, meet them, choose and enter into Gandharva marriage. In addition to the influence of foreign conquest, claims Pandey, Hindu ideology shifted from diversity of marriage types to where the social pressures compelled the girl's family to seek arranged early marriages. Yet another theory is that the priestly caste of India, who officiated Brahma marriages and religious ceremonies, over time crafted rules that declared Gandharva marriage for most Hindus as inappropriate and disapproved (\"aprasasta\"), because traditional marriages were a source of their income, and Gandharva marriages made them poorer or obsolete.\n\nIn 1817 AD, Gandharva marriages in India were ruled legal for some social groups by the Bengal Saddar Court.\n\nIn 1930, Justice Abdur Rahim held that the marriage in Gandharva form was not valid in India. This ruling came from the Madras High Court, with the statement that amongst the Hindus, the Gandharva form of marriage was obsolete (as of 1930). This was appealed with the note that the fact that the case is in court is proof that Gandharva weddings among Hindus is not obsolete.\n\nIn 1946, the Patna High Court in Kamani Devi v. Kameshwar Singh, ILR 25 Pat 58 = (AIR 1946 Pat 316) held that the relationship of husband and wife, created by Gandharva marriage is binding. The husband, the court ruled, cannot escape his responsiability of financially caring for his wife married in Gandharva form. The Patna High Court went further and held that the celebration of Gandharva form of marriage must be attended with nuptial rites and ceremonies including Homa (invocation before the sacred fire) and Saptapadi (the taking of seven steps by the groom and the bride together) for its validity. This ruling was cited in a decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Bhaurao v. State of Maharashtra.\n\nIn a 1974 case, Justice Mukherji noted, \"Gandharva form of marriage should not be regarded as concubinage or quasi-marital union, more so in the context of the modern Society and in the background of the forward thinking of the present law givers. The possibility of legal validity of this form of marriage in the whole of India in near future even without being backed by custom, is too notorious to be ignored. In a sense, Gandharva form of marriage is trying to come back very fast (in India), pushing parental domination to the background.\"\n\nIn modern India, particularly in urban regions, Gandharva marriage is re-emerging. These type of unions in India are now called \"live in relationship\".\n"}

{"id": "17684228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17684228", "title": "Historical Christian hairstyles", "text": "Historical Christian hairstyles\n\nThe hairstyles adopted in the Christian tradition have been most varied, over history.\n\nThe paintings in the catacombs permit the belief that the early Christians simply followed the fashion of their time. The short hair of the men and the braids of the women were, towards the end of the second century, curled, and arranged in tiers, while for women the hair twined about the head over the brow. Particular locks were reserved to fall over the forehead and upon the temples. \n\nChristian iconography still proceeds in accordance with types created in the beginning of Christianity. Images of Christ retain the long braided locks parted in the middle and flowing to the shoulders. Those of the Blessed Virgin still wear the veil which conceals a portion of the brow and confines the neck. The Orantes, which represent the generality of the faithful, have the hair covered by a full veil which falls to the shoulders. Byzantine iconography differs little as to head-dress from that of the catacombs. Mosaics and ivories portray emperors, bishops, priests and the faithful wearing the hair of a medium length, cut squarely across the forehead. \n\nWomen then wore a round head-dress which encircled the face. Emperors and empresses wore a large, low crown, wide at the top, ornamented with precious stones cut en cabochon, and jeweled pendants falling down to the shoulders, such as may be seen in the mosaics of S. Vitalis at Ravenna and a large number of diptychs. The hair of patriarchs and bishops was of medium length and was surmounted by a closed crown or a double tiara.\n\nThe invading barbarians allowed their hair to grow freely, and to fall unrestrained on the shoulders. After the fall of the Merovingians, and while the invaders were conforming more and more to the prevailing Byzantine taste or fashion, they did not immediately take up the fashion of cutting the hair. Carloman, the brother of Charlemagne, is represented at the age of fourteen with his hair falling in long locked tresses behind. \n\nChurch councils regulated the head-dress of clerics and monks: according to St. Jerome's testimony, the monks were bearded, and the \"Vita Hilarionis\" also states that certain persons considered it meritorious to cut hair each year at Easter. The \"Statuta antiqua Ecclesiae\" (can. xliv) forbade them to allow hair or beard to grow. A synod held by St. Patrick (can. vi) in 456 prescribed that the clerics should dress their hair in the manner of the Roman clerics, and those who allowed their hair to grow were expelled from the Church (can. x). The Council of Agde (506) authorized the archdeacon to employ force in cutting the hair of recalcitrants; the Council of Braga (572) ordained that the hair should be short, and the ears exposed. The Fourth Council of Toledo (633) denounced the lectors in Galicia who wore a small tonsure and allowed the hair to grow immoderately, and two Councils of Rome (721 and 743) anathematized those who should neglect the regulations in this matter. \n\nIn the ninth century there is more distinction between freemen and slaves, as regards the hair. Henceforth the slaves were no longer shorn save in punishment for certain offences. Under Louis the Débonnaire and Charles the Bald the hair was cut on the temples and the back of the head. In the tenth century the hair cut at the height of the ears fell regularly about the head. At the end of twelfth century the hair was shaven close on the top of the head and fell in long curls behind.\n\nFashions changed, from hair smooth on the top of the head and rising in a sudden roll in front, a tuft of hair in the form of a flame, or the more ordinary topknot. Not every one followed these fashions.\n\nThe clergy followed with a sort of timidity the fashion of the wig, but, except prelates and court chaplains, they refrained from the over-luxurious models. Priests contented themselves with wearing the wig in folio, or square, or the wig à la Sartine. They bared the part corresponding to the tonsure. In the religious orders, the tonsure very early interposed an obstacle to hairstyles, but the tonsure itself was the occasion of many combinations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1398551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1398551", "title": "Huron Carol", "text": "Huron Carol\n\nThe \"Huron Carol\" (or \"Twas in the Moon of Wintertime\") is a Canadian Christmas hymn (Canada's oldest Christmas song), written probably in 1642 by Jean de Brébeuf, a Jesuit missionary at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons in Canada. Brébeuf wrote the lyrics in the native language of the Huron/Wendat people; the song's original Huron title is \"Jesous Ahatonhia\" (\"Jesus, he is born\"). The song's melody is based on a traditional French folk song, \"Une Jeune Pucelle\" (\"A Young Maid\"). The well-known English lyrics were written in 1926 by Jesse Edgar Middleton, and the copyright to these lyrics was held by The Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited, but entered the public domain in 2011.\n\nThe English version of the hymn uses imagery familiar in the early 20th century, in place of the traditional Nativity story. This version is derived from Brébeuf's original song and Huron religious concepts. In the English version, Jesus is born in a \"lodge of broken bark\" and wrapped in a \"robe of rabbit skin\". He is surrounded by hunters instead of shepherds, and the Magi are portrayed as \"chiefs from afar\" who bring him \"fox and beaver pelts\" instead of the more familiar gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The English translation uses a traditional Algonquian name, Gitchi Manitou, for God, which is not in the original Wyandot version. The original lyrics are now sometimes modified to use imagery accessible to Christians who are not familiar with aboriginal Canadian cultures.\n\nThe song remains a common Christmas hymn in Canadian churches of many Christian denominations. It is also found in several American hymnals, including \"The Hymnal 1982\" of The Episcopal Church (#114), The United Methodist Hymnal (#244) and Evangelical Lutheran Worship (#284).\n\nBecause the melody spans a modest range, it is ideally suited to instruments that have a limited pitch range, such as the Native American flute.\n\nThe song was included, as \"Jesous Ahatonia\", on Burl Ives's 1952 album \"Christmas Day in the Morning\" and was later released as a Burl Ives single under the title \"Indian Christmas Carol\". Bruce Cockburn has also recorded a rendition of the song in the original Huron. Tom Jackson performed this song during his annual \"Huron Carole\" tour. Crash Test Dummies did it on their 2002 album, \"Jingle all the Way\". A haunting choral arrangement by R. Anderson was included on the 1997 album \"The Mystery of Christmas\", by the Canadian group the Elora Festival Singers. The music has been rearranged by Loreena McKennitt under the title \"Breton Carol\" in 2008. A new recording with a very mystical setting of the Huron Carol was released in 2011 performed by The Canadian Tenors. In 2001, Terry McDade and The McDades recorded a version featuring Indian bansuri on their Free Radio Records release \"Midwinter\".

He was born to a Christian family in a village on Mount Lebanon in 1849 and later studied medicine at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut.\n\nIbrahim George Kheiralla converted to the Bahá'í Faith while living in Egypt in 1889 when he met Hájí `Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tihrání. Kheiralla went through Europe and eventually came to the United States in late 1892 where he joined Anton Haddad, the first Bahá'í to come to America. Initially, Kheiralla settled in New York where he began teaching \"Truth Seeker\" classes. He visited Charles Augustus Briggs and others, as well as the Syrian community in New York.\n\nIn 1894 Kheiralla moved on to Chicago following the interest fostered by the World's Columbian Exposition's World Parliament of Religions. In Chicago he taught \"Truth Seeker\" classes. One of the early converts while Kheiralla was in Chicago was Thornton Chase, who had read the presentation about the Bahá'ís at the Exposition, and is generally considered the first Bahá'í convert in the West. Other individuals had converted, but none remained members of the religion. Researcher Robert Stockman considers Chase's importance as an early North American Bahá’í thinker, publicist, administrator, and organizer is still underappreciated and that in many ways Chase’s death left a gap in the North American Bahá’í community that remained unfilled until the rise to prominence in the early 1920s of Horace Holley, the chief developer of Bahá’í organization in the United States and Canada. Another to join the religion from Kheiralla's early classes was Howard MacNutt, who would later compile \"The Promulgation of Universal Peace\", a prominent collection of the addresses of `Abdu'l-Bahá during his journeys in America. Both men were designated as \"Disciples of `Abdu'l-Bahá\" and \"Heralds of the Covenant\" by Shoghi Effendi. Another student of the classes and \"Disciple\" was Lua Getsinger, designated as the \"mother teacher of the West\". Another who \"passed\" the class and joined the religion was the maverick Honoré Jackson. Kheiralla moved once again, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1895, where a large Bahá'í community soon developed.\n\nBecause of his success promulgating the Bahá'í Faith in North America, `Abdu'l-Bahá titled Kheiralla \"Bahá's Peter,\" \"the Second Columbus\" and \"Conqueror of America.\" `Abdu'l-Bahá would write a \"Tablet to Ibráhím George Kheiralla\".\n\nIn 1898, Kheiralla undertook a Bahá'í pilgrimage to Palestine to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá with other American pilgrims, including Phoebe Hearst, Lua Getsinger and May Boles. In Akka, Kheiralla witnessed first hand the conflict between `Abdu'l-Bahá and his brothers. Upon his return to America in 1899, Kheiralla began to announce his avowed leadership of Western Bahá'ís independent of `Abdu'l-Bahá and authored a book, \"Beha'u'llah\", wherein he states his belief that `Abdu'l-Bahá was equal in rank to his brothers Mírzá Muhammad `Alí, Díyá'u'lláh, and Badi'u'lláh. Early after the return to America, `Abdu'l-Bahá sent, first, Anton Haddad with a letter contesting the definition of leadership, then Khieralla's initial teacher of the religion, `Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tihrání, to confront him. The conflict made the newspapers. Ultimately, in the conflict between `Abdu'l-Bahá and Mírzá Muhammad `Alí, Kheiralla sided with the latter for which he was declared a Covenant-breaker.\n\nKheiralla would go on to form the \"Society of Behaists,\" which would later be led by Shua Ullah Behai and eventually become defunct. Kheiralla had three children, two daughters who were named Nabeeha and Labiba, and a son named George Ibrahim Kheirallah who converted Islam in the 1930s, becoming active in the Islamic Society of New York, and translated and published some poems of Khalil Gibran. Ibrahim George Kheiralla passed away in 1929.\n\n"}

Lalit Shah, its Vice President in 1980, suggested establishment of an umbrella organization of all the Jain organizations in North America. At that time about 15 Jain organizations were in existence, including the Jain Center of America, Jain Meditation International Center founded by Chitrabhanu, International Mahavir Jain Mission founded by Sushil Kumar, and Jain centers in Boston and Chicago. The plan for JAINA was conceptualized at the first Jain Convention held in Los Angeles in 1981, and formalized at the second Jain Convention in New York in 1983, with the advice and approval of Chitrabhanu and Sushil Kumar.\n\nThe conventions are now termed JAINA Conventions, and have been held biennially in Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati, Houston, and Atlanta. JAINA also publishes textbooks on Jainism, a calendar, and a monthly magazine, and operates an online Jain library.\n\nThere are over 70 organizations that are part of JAINA. JAINA represents over 160,000 Jains in USA and Canada. It also has 32 subcommittees involved in different activities, including Young Jains of America(YJA), for ages 14-29.\n\nThe Federation of Jain Associations in North America uses a modified version of the standard Jain symbol, the Jain Prateek Chihna. It replaces the swastika with an om because of the negative connotations associated with the swastika in the western world.\n\nJAINA conventions draw thousands of representatives from Jain communities in the USA and Canada.\n\nThere are over 30 JAINA committees. Based on the needs, these committees are more or less active and are at times retired.\n\nJAINA has been involved in several interfaith actions. It also organizes relief activities.\n\nThe JAINA Ratna Award is the highest recognition awarded by the North American Jain community for major long term contributions. The first one was given in 1989 to Prof. Duli Chandra Jain for his pioneering editing and publication \"Jain Study Circle\" It is awarded irregularly after 2-6 years.

She was worshiped by the Junii, the family of Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger.\nIn 238 BC, before the Second Punic War, Tiberius Gracchus built a temple to Libertas on the Aventine Hill. Census tables were stored inside the temple's atrium. A subsequent temple was built (58–57 BC) on Palatine Hill, another of the Seven hills of Rome, by Publius Clodius Pulcher. By building and consecrating the temple on the site of the former house of then-exiled Cicero, Claudius ensured that the land was legally uninhabitable. Upon his return, Cicero successfully argued that the consecration was invalid and thus managed to reclaim the land and destroy the temple. In 46 BC, the Roman Senate voted to build and dedicate a shrine to Libertas in recognition of Julius Caesar, but no temple was built; instead, a small statue of the goddess stood in the Roman Forum.\n\nLibertas, along with other Roman goddesses, has served as the inspiration for many modern-day symbols, including the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island in the United States. According to the National Park Service, the Statue's Roman robe is the main feature that invokes Libertas and the symbol of Liberty from which the Statue derives its name.\n\nIn addition, money throughout history has borne the name or image of Libertas. Libertas was pictured on Galba's \"Freedom of the People\" coins during his short reign after the death of Nero. The University of North Carolina records two instances of private banks in its state depicting Libertas on their banknotes; Libertas is depicted on the 5, 10 and 20 Rappen denomination coins of Switzerland.\n\nThe Greek equivalent of the goddess Libertas is Eleutheria, the personification of liberty.\n\nAs \"Liberty\", Libertas was depicted on the obverse (heads side) of most coinage in the U.S. into the twentieth century.\n\nThe goddess Libertas is also depicted on the Great Seal of France, created in 1848. This is the image which later influenced French sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi in the creation of his statue of Liberty Enlightening the World.\n\nLibertas was associated with the pileus, commonly worn by the freed slave:\n\nLibertas was also recognized in ancient Rome by the rod (\"vindicta\" or \"festuca\"), used ceremonially in the act of \"Manumissio vindicta\", Latin for \"Freedom by the Rod\" (emphasis added):\n\nThe symbolic characters Columbia who represents the United States and Marianne, who represents France, the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor and many other characters and concepts of the modern age were created, and are seen, as embodiments of Libertas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50924044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50924044", "title": "Liborio Zerda", "text": "Liborio Zerda\n\nLiborio Zerda (Bogotá, Republic of New Granada, 10 July 1834 (other sources state 1830 or 1833) - Bogotá, Colombia, 9 November 1919) was a Colombian physician and Muisca scholar. Zerda has been important in the natural sciences of the late 19th and early 20th century in Colombia, publishing many articles about various topics, from medicine to chemical analysis, radioactivity and the popular drink chicha.\n\nZerda was contemporaneous with other Muisca scholars, and influenced by them; Joaquín Acosta and Ezequiel Uricoechea. He analysed the work done by José Domingo Duquesne on the Muisca numerals and published in 1883 his major work \"El Dorado\" about the mythical \"El Dorado\", that he situated not in Lake Guatavita as is currently accepted to have been the site of the inauguration of the new \"zipa\", but in the Siecha Lakes in the Chingaza Natural National Park.\n\nLiborio Zerda taught at the \"Colegio del Rosario\" in Bogotá for 60 years and died on November 9, 1919 in the Colombian capital.\n\nLiborio Zerda was born on July 10, 1830, 1833 or 1834 in the capital of the then Republic of New Granada, Bogotá. He attended the \"Colegio de San Bartolomé\", a strict school that prohibited their students to walk on the streets at night, enter houses with a bad reputation, playing games or read obscene books. His interest for natural sciences was born at the \"Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario\", where Zerda, as student of Joaquín Acosta, took classes in chemistry, geology and mineralogy. Liborio Zerda studied Medicine at the Universidad Central in the capital, graduating in 1853. He became a medical practitioner in Bogotá right after finishing his studies and in 1854 gained his specialisation in surgery and military medicine.\n\nAfter the foundation of the \"Comisión Corográfica\" in 1850, led by Italian Agustín Codazzi, Zerda founded the \"Sociedad Caldas\" in 1855. In 1859 Zerda joined the \"Sociedad de Naturalistas Neogranadinos\", which was founded by Muisca scholar Ezequiel Uricoechea. In this society, Liborio Zerda analysed mineralogy, while teaching courses on chemistry and physics. In those times, the studies of natural sciences were not yet well developed in Colombia. Zerda published about the \"new\" phenomenon of radioactivity.\n\nIn 1865 Zerda founded the \"Escuela de Medicina Privada\", precursor of present-day private medicine schools. During the first years of this school, Zerda published about coca and opium use in Bogotá (\"Estudios sobre la Coca y el Opio bogotano\"), drinking water analysis (\"Análisis de las aguas potables de Bogotá\") and oils (\"Método para blanquear y purificar los aceites grasos\"). A year later, he published his first book, about horse medicine; \"Hipiátrica, tratado de medicina del caballo\".\n\n1867 was the year of foundation of the Universidad Nacional, that housed a faculty on natural sciences (\"Escuela de Ciencias Naturales\"). Zerda published about the chemical analysis, mainly of salt, common on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, with works titled \"Análisis de sal gema, sal compactada, sal cristalizada y de agua de las principales fuentes salinas de la República\", \"Determinación de la presencia del iodo en el pescado del río Funza\", \"Análisis químico y estudio de las aplicaciones medicinales de varias aguas minerales naturales\" and \"Análisis sobre muestras de hulla de la Sabana de Bogotá, Zipaquirá y Riohacha\". For this publication, Zerda was awarded the \"Medalla de Oro en la Exposición Nacional\". In 1891 Zerda wrote the \"Catálogo de la colección mineralógica\" and published about snake venom.\n\nDuring the later 19th century, Zerda published about chicha, the alcoholic beverage of the Muisca that was popular at the time, with a publication called \"Estudio químico patológico e higiénico de la chicha, bebida popular en Colombia\". He also wrote about ions, electrons and radium (\"El radium y sus propiedades maravillosas\") and the illnesses flies spread (\"Las moscas transmisoras de enfermedad\"). His work on chicha revealed the danger of maize infected with a fungus.\n\nZerda died on November 9, 1919 in his city of birth Bogotá.\n\nThe interests of the intellectual Zerda were not restricted to the natural sciences. He published papers about the history of the Muisca, their habits, traditions and religion. His book \"El Dorado\", published in 1883 and reprinted in 1947, is one of the first anthropological, historical and ethnographical studies on the original inhabitants of the Bogotá savanna and northern areas of the Altiplano.\n\nLiborio Zerda analysed the work by José Domingo Duquesne who in 1795 had written about the language and numerals of the Muisca. The Chibcha language was almost extinct by the late 19th century and the revival of it by Zerda has aided in later analyses of the language.\n\nOn the Muisca numerals, Zerda discovered the importance of frogs in the Muisca culture. He stated that the frog represented the times of draught on the Altiplano. An extended frog or one without legs symbolises rest, happiness and the harvests. Frogs with a human head stand for intelligence. An eagle with a frog in its claws symbolised summer. The frog was known from the Muisca calendar, that was first analysed by Duquesne. Zerda theorised that the well-known publication of Duquesne (\"Disertación sobre el origen del calendario y jeroglíficos de los moscas\") was merely a summary of the larger work \"Anillo astronóomico de los moscas\". Zerda did not analyse the work done on the Muisca calendar by famous naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who met Duquesne in Colombia in the early 19th century. Liborio Zerda wrote about a stone that represented the calendar, a similar stone as the Choachí Stone, which was found later. It has been thought possible by researcher Manuel Arturo Izquierdo Peña that the stone Zerda described was actually a mould used in the famous goldworking of the Muisca, to produce \"tunjos\".\n\nIn the later chapters of \"El Dorado\", Zerda draws comparisons between the origins of the indigenous peoples of the Americas with Africa and Asia, based on metalworking and ceramics. In his work, he described the ritual of \"El Dorado\" in sacred Lake Guatavita, represented in the golden Muisca raft, which was found after Zerda's death in Pasca, Cundinamarca. The book also treats other indigenous tribes of Colombia, such as the Panche and others and formed the basis for the 20th century anthropological studies of the Muisca.\n\nIn the view of Zerda, the Muisca were a neolithic culture and their ancient roads were built by an earlier, superior civilisation. Deeply influenced by the ethnological works of Lubbock, De Mortillet and Broca, Zerda proposed a long chronology of the history of the Muisca. He defended the period of Spanish conquest to educate the primitive Muisca to a higher level. Zerda proposed the sacred Siecha Lakes were the actual site of \"El Dorado\", later found to have been Lake Guatavita.\n\nLiborio Zerda's research revealed the diet of the Muisca people was formed by the deer species \"Cervus virginianus\", \"Cervus mexicanus\" and \"Cervus simplicicomis\", and fish from the Funza and other rivers (\"Eremophilus mutisii\" and \"Grundulus bogotensis\"). The fish provided a source of iodine for the Muisca.\n\nIn 1885, Zerda described a mummy of a young girl, found in a cave on the Toquilla paramo within the municipality of Aquitania, at altitude. The mummy was decorated with golden objects and wrapped in cotton mantles. The body was organised in a squatting position.\n\nHe also wrote about Cuchavira, god of the rainbow of the Muisca.\n\nThis list is a selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Therein, we find an obvious belief in the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). We also find a fourth Supreme Being in the figure of \"Galvah\" (Omega) — who is also called the Mother, Wisdom and \"I AM\" in Dee's journals. This figure is known in Judaism as the Shekhinah — Divine Presence; to the Gnostics as Sophia — Wisdom; and to the Hermetic Qabalah as Aima Elohim — Mother of the gods. Compare Theotokos, Mother of God, in Catholic beliefs.\n\nBeneath these four Divinities are several hierarchies of angels, or intelligent rulers, set over such things as the Planets, the Stars and the four Quarters of the Earth.\n\nThe angels of the four quarters are symbolized by the \"Watchtowers\" — four large magical word-square Tables (collectively called the Great Table of the Earth). Most of the well-known Enochian Angels are drawn from the Watchtowers of the Great Table.\n\nEach of the four Watchtowers is collectively governed by six Seniors (aka Elders) — making a total of 24 Elders as seen in the Revelation of St. John. Each Watchtower is further divided into four sub-quadrants, where we find the names of various Archangels and Angels who govern the quarters of the world. In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with living intelligences.\n\nThe names of the Enochian angels are drawn from a number of enciphered tables, received through the \"spirit actions\" of John Dee, Edward Kelly, and occasionally another scryer. The Watchtower set of angels is one of the larger and better developed sets. A problem arises in that there are several variations on the Watchtowers themselves and several ways of drawing the names therefrom. The four Watchtowers were first received on 25 June 1584. This arrangement and order is reflected in Dee's prayer - The Fundamental Obeisance. They were then rearranged slightly and corrected in the days following: 26 June through 2 July 1584; this arrangement corresponds to the majority of prayers in Sloane MS. 3191 (The Book of Earthly Victory and Science) and is what is given in the published versions of that text, notably Geoffrey James' \"Enochian Evocation\" / \"Magick\" and Robert Turner's \"Elizabethan Magic\". Late in the course of Dee and Kelly's work together, on 19 April 1587, the Archangel Raphael, was said to have appeared, and reformed the Watchtowers, rearranging their order and directions and making some minor corrections. It is this arrangement that is used in the Golden Dawn and subsequent derivatives such as Thelema, Wicca and the Church of Satan. The Golden Dawn also follows a slightly different method of drawing forth some of the names from the Tables. The Golden Dawn method of extracting the names, is heavily influenced by the post Dee text contained in Sloane MS. 307 and published by Stephen Skinner and David Rankine as \"Practical Angel Magic of Dr John Dee's Enochian Tables\". For convenience sake, in identifying these variations when they differ, the received set is labelled Received, the set reflected in Sloane MS. 3191 is labelled Orthodox, the set reformed by Raphael as Reformed and the variations used by the Golden Dawn as GD. The Angelic Hierarchies of the Watchtowers are also set out in several visions of Edward Kelly's and enshrined in a Talisman constructed by John Dee, published in \"A True & Faithful Relation\" and on display in the British Museum collection.\n\nThis is a list of the names of Enochian angels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"John Dee's actions with spirits: 22 December 1581 to 23 May 1583.\" edt. & trans.

However, according to Hill the [[Gospel of the Nazarenes],] adds a clarification to this section stating that it was because of Jesus' sinlessness that John felt he was the one who should be baptized.

It rose to political ascendancy between the world wars and is currently professed by 8.8% of Palau's population.\n\nWhile only about 8% of Palauans practice Modekngei, a large concentration of that figure reside in the same village. Ibobang, a small town with a population of less than 100 in Ngatpang state, is a community devoted to the practice of Modekngei.\n\nModekngei religion is a hybrid of ancient Palauan customs and Christianity. Followers of the religion believe in the Christian God and recognize Jesus Christ as the saviour while simultaneously making appeasements to traditional Palauan deities.\n\nThe origins of Modekngei are unknown, but one belief is that Modekngei began as a nonviolent opposition to the Japanese occupation and is an amalgamation of native animistic and Christian beliefs carried on in an oral tradition of chants called \"keskes\", tending to reinforce the native culture heritage.\n\nA common story told in Ngatpang is that the religion developed from the efforts of Christian missionaries who came to Palau in hopes to convert the islanders to Christianity. Upon arriving in the village of Ibobang, the missionaries were so taken back by the citizens' commitment to traditional customs that the missionaries made an exception and allowed the Palauans to keep their goddess and still partake in Christianity.\n\nThe goal of Modekngei religion is to preserve ancient Palauan traditions in a way that aligns itself with Christian salvation.\n\nModekngei followers in Ibobang practice a traditional lifestyle centered on ancient ideas of family, community, and purity. The religion prohibits followers from all alcohol and drug use, and children in the village are required to be home by dark and abstain from making loud noises in sacred places.\n\nCitizens of Ibobang attend daily church services. The church building is located in the center of the village and is likewise the center of activity. One of the many Modekngei customs requires members of the community to walk silently to church each morning. To speak, especially loudly, before a church service is disrespectful and borderline blasphemous. Women in Ibobang usually dress in western apparel, but when it comes to church they are required to always wear a skirt or dress when either entering or passing the building. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see a woman in Ibobang dressed in pants to take a longer route to her destination to keep from crossing the church grounds without the proper attire.\n\nDaily Modekngei church services are short, consisting mostly of individual and group prayers. However, services celebrating both traditional and religious holidays are more elaborate and can last several days with weeks of communal preparation.\n\nOne custom that most Palauans observe—regardless of religious affiliation—is the prohibition of any alcohol or tobacco within the city limits of Ibobang. According to ancient belief, violating this religious law will bring terrible rainstorms upon the village that won’t go away until the sin has been forgiven by the Modekngei goddess.\n\nEven Palauans who normally partake in such activities will abstain from bringing any banned substances within the city limits. The traditional belief that continuous rain will plague the village is so strong that Modekngei elders will hang fruit and other treats on tree branches throughout the village in hopes of bribing the goddess to be forgiving of outsiders' misconduct.\n\nAnother customary activity that takes place in Ibobang is the blessing of the roads. This particular custom coincides with the moon’s cycle. A few days before each full moon, the community works together to clean the entire village. Lawns are cut, trash is cleaned and houses are scrubbed. Then, the evening before the full moon dawns, everyone who lives in Ibobang waits inside their houses while a village elder walks up and down the streets chanting prayers and blessings over the village. This is a necessary practice in Modekngei because it’s believed that during a full moon, the Modekngei goddess is better able to see the malpractices of her people.\n\nIbobang is the home of Belau Modekngei School (BMS), a boarding school for high school students situated at the far end of the village. In 1974, a handful of Modekngei elders realized their desire to pass on the ancient traditions of the Modekngei religion to future generations.\n\nToday, between 25 and 30 students from the 9th to 12th grade are enrolled at BMS. Students and faculty have the option of living on campus in traditional dormatory-style housing with no electricity or running water, or in the surrounding villages of Ngatpang. Slightly more than half the students live on campus.\n\nThe student body at BMS is diverse. Some of the students attend because they come from families who value a traditional education. Other students enroll at BMS as a last resort option. As one of very few private high schools on Palau, BMS has the option of accepting students who have been expelled from the island's one and only public high school.\n\nStudents at BMS study core academic subjects such as English, Math and Palauan, but they also take Modekngei religion classes, have the opportunity to farm ancient medicinal crops, and practice traditional customs along with the village.\n\nBelau Modekngei's primary goal is to preserve Modekngei religion for future generations of Palauans.\n\n"}

It is given to all saints and is also used before Christian name of bishops. The corresponding feminine form given to women saints is Mart or Mort (, '). The title is placed before the Christian name, as in Mar Aprem/Mor Afrem (Ephrem the Syrian) and Mart/Mort Maryam (Mary, mother of Jesus).\n\nThe variant \"Maran\" or \"Moran\" (, '), meaning \"Our Lord\", is a particular title given to Jesus, either alone or in combination with other names and titles. Likewise, \"Martan\" or \"Mortan\" (, ', \"Our Lady\") is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\nOccasionally, the term \"Maran\" or \"Moran\" has been used of various Eastern Christian patriarchs and catholicoi. The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, the Malankara Orthodox Catholicos use the title \"Moran Mor\". Sometimes the Indian bearers of this title are called \"Moran Mar\", using a hybrid style from both Syriac dialects that reflects somewhat the history of Syrian Christians in Kerala. The Pope of Rome is referred to as \"Mar Papa\" by the Saint Thomas Christians of India.\n\nThe obscure variant \"Marya\" or \"Moryo\" (, \") is used in the Peshitta Old Testament to render the Tetragrammaton. Although this word is clearly a derived form of the above, there is a fanciful derivation found in early Syriac lexica, that the word is an initialism as follows:\nIn Mishnaic Hebrew through to date this Aramaic word is pronounced [mar] (), and it is used as a formal way of addressing or referring to a male person. In the Gemara, Tabyomi is sometimes referred to as Mar. \"Mar\" was also the title of the Exilarch (leader of the Jewish diaspora community in Babylon), with the Aramaic-speaking Jews sharing many cultural attributes with the Syriac Christians. In the Modern Hebrew of contemporary Israel, \"Mar\" is used without distinction for any male person, like \"Mr.\" in English. However, in Rabbanical circles of Jews from the Middle East, the Aramaic variant form מָרָן (Maran, Aramaic: our lord) is still a title to used for highly appreciated Rabbis, such as Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas party.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7949828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7949828", "title": "Myth and ritual", "text": "Myth and ritual\n\nMyth and ritual are two central components of religious practice. Although myth and ritual are commonly united as parts of religion, the exact relationship between them has been a matter of controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is \"the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory,\" held notably by the so-called Cambridge Ritualists, which holds that \"myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual.\" This theory is still disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.\n\nThe \"myth and ritual school\" is the name given to a series of authors who have focused their philological studies on the \"ritual purposes of myths.\" Some of these scholars (e.g., W. Robertson-Smith, James George Frazer, Jane Ellen Harrison, S. H. Hooke) supported the \"primacy of ritual\" hypothesis, which claimed that \"every myth is derived from a particular ritual and that the syntagmatic quality of myth is a reproduction of the succession of ritual act.\"\n\nHistorically, the important approaches to the study of mythological thinking have been those of Vico, Schelling, Schiller, Jung, Freud, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Lévi-Strauss, Frye, the Soviet school, and the Myth and Ritual School.\n\nIn the 1930s, Soviet researchers such as Jakov E. Golosovker, Frank-Kamenecky, Olga Freidenberg, Mikhail Bakhtin, \"grounded the study of myth and ritual in folklore and in the world view of popular culture.\"\n\nFollowing World War II, the semantic study of myth and ritual, particularly by Bill Stanner and Victor Turner, has supported a connection between myth and ritual. However, it has not supported the notion that one preceded and produced the other, as supporters of the \"primacy of ritual\" hypothesis would claim. According to the currently dominant scholarly view, the link between myth and ritual is that they share common paradigms.\n\nOne possibility immediately presents itself: perhaps ritual arose from myth. Many religious rituals—notably Passover among Jews, Christmas and Easter among Christians, and the Hajj among Muslims—commemorate, or involve commemoration of, events in religious literature.\n\nLeaving the sphere of historical religions, the ritual-from-myth approach often sees the relationship between myth and ritual as analogous to the relationship between science and technology. The pioneering anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor is the classic exponent of this view. He saw myth as an attempt to explain the world: for him, myth was a sort of proto-science. Ritual is secondary: just as technology is an application of science, so ritual is an application of myth—an attempt to produce certain effects, given the supposed nature of the world: \"For Tylor, myth functions to explain the world as an end in itself. Ritual applies that explanation to control the world.\" A ritual always presupposes a preexisting myth: in short, myth gives rise to ritual.\n\nAgainst the intuitive idea that ritual reenacts myth or applies mythical theories, many 19th-century anthropologists supported the opposite position: that myth and religious doctrine result from ritual. This is known as the \"primacy of ritual\" hypothesis.\n\nThis view was asserted for the first time by the bible scholar William Robertson Smith. The scholar Meletinsky notes that Smith introduced the concept \"dogmatically.\" In his \"Lectures on the Religion of the Semites\" (1889), Smith draws a distinction between ancient and modern religion: in modern religion, doctrine is central; in ancient religion, ritual is central. On the whole, Smith argues, ancients tended to be conservative with regard to rituals, making sure to pass them down faithfully. In contrast, the myths that justified those rituals could change. In fact, according to Smith, many of the myths that have come down to us arose \"after the original, nonmythic reason [...] for the ritual had somehow been forgotten.\"\n\nAs an example, Smith gives the worship of Adonis. Worshipers mourned Adonis's mythical death in a ritual that coincided with the annual withering of the vegetation. According to Smith, the ritual mourning originally had a nonmythical explanation: with the annual withering of plants, \"the worshippers lament out of natural sympathy [...] just as modern man is touched with melancholy at the falling of autumn leaves.\" Once worshipers forgot the original, nonmythical reason for the mourning ritual, they created \"the myth of Adonis as the dying and rising god of vegetation [...] to account for the ritual.\"\n\nIn his essay \"The Ritual View of Myth and the Mythic,\" (1955) Stanley Edgar Hyman makes an argument similar to Smith's:\nHere Hyman argues against the etiological interpretation of myth, which says that myths originated from attempts to explain the origins (etiologies) of natural phenomena. If true, the etiological interpretation would make myth older than, or at least independent of, ritual—as E.B. Tylor believes it is. But Hyman argues that people use myth for etiological purposes only after myth is already in place: in short, myths didn't originate as explanations of natural phenomena. Further, Hyman argues, myth originated from ritual performance. Thus, ritual came before myth, and myth depends on ritual for its existence until it gains an independent status as an etiological story.\n\nThe famous anthropologist Sir James George Frazer claimed that myth emerges from ritual during the natural process of religious evolution. Many of his ideas were inspired by those of Robertson Smith. In \"The Golden Bough\" (1890; 1906–1915), Frazer famously argues that man progresses from belief in magic (and rituals based on magic), through belief in religion, to science. His argument is as follows.\n\nMan starts out with a reflexive belief in a natural law. He thinks he can influence nature by correctly applying this law: \"In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate for his own ends.\"\n\nHowever, the natural law man imagines—namely, magic—does not work. When he sees that his pretended natural law is false, man gives up the idea of a knowable natural law and \"throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself.\" In other words, when man loses his belief in magic, he justifies his formerly magical rituals by saying that they reenact myths or honor mythical beings. According to Frazer,\nThe classicist Jane Ellen Harrison and the biblical scholar S. H. Hooke regarded myth as intimately connected to ritual. However, \"against Smith,\" they \"vigorously deny\" that myth's main purpose is to justify a ritual by giving an account of how it first arose (e.g., justifying the Adonis worshipers' ritual mourning by attributing it to Adonis's mythical death). Instead, these scholars think a myth is largely just a narrative description of a corresponding ritual: according to Harrison, \"the primary meaning of myth ... is the spoken correlative of the acted rite, the thing done.\"\n\nHarrison and Hooke gave an explanation for why ancients would feel the need to describe the ritual in a narrative form. They suggest that the spoken word, like the acted ritual, was considered to have magical potency: \"The spoken word had the efficacy of an act.\"\n\nLike Frazer, Harrison believed that myths could arise as the initial reason a ritual was forgotten or became diluted. As an example, she cited rituals that center on the annual renewal of vegetation. Such rituals often involve a participant who undergoes a staged death and resurrection. Harrison argues that the ritual, although \"performed annually, was exclusively initiatory\"; it was performed on people to initiate them into their roles as full-standing members of society. At this early point, the \"god\" was simply \"the projection of the euphoria produced by the ritual.\" Later, however, this euphoria became personified as a distinct god, and this god later became the god of vegetation, for \"just as the initiates symbolically died and were reborn as fully fledged members of society, so the god of vegetation and in turn crops literally died and were reborn.\" In time, people forgot the ritual's initiatory function and only remembered its status as a commemoration of the Adonis myth.\n\nNot all students of mythology think ritual emerged from myth or myth emerged from ritual: some allow myths and rituals a greater degree of freedom from one another. Although myths and rituals often appear together, these scholars do not think every myth has or had a corresponding ritual, or vice versa.\n\nThe classicist Walter Burkert believes myths and rituals were originally independent. When myths and rituals do come together, he argues, they do so to reinforce each other. A myth that tells how the gods established a ritual reinforces that ritual by giving it divine status: \"Do this because the gods did or do it.\" A ritual based on a mythical event makes the story of that event more than a mere myth: the myth becomes more important because it narrates an event whose imitation is considered sacred.\n\nFurthermore, Burkert argues that myth and ritual together serve a \"socializing function.\" As an example, Burkert gives the example of hunting rituals. Hunting, Burkert argues, took on a sacred, ritualistic aura once it ceased to be necessary for survival: \"Hunting lost its basic function with the emergence of agriculture some ten thousand years ago. But hunting ritual had become so important that it could not be given up.\" By performing the ritual of hunting together, an ancient society bonded itself together as a group, and also provided a way for its members to vent their anxieties over their own aggressiveness and mortality.\n\nLike William Smith, the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski argued in his essay \"Myth in Primitive Psychology\" (1926) that myths function as fictitious accounts of the origin of rituals, thereby providing a justification for those rituals: myth \"gives rituals a hoary past and thereby sanctions them.\" However, Malinowski also points out that many cultural practices besides ritual have related myths: for Malinowski, \"myth and ritual are therefore not coextensive.\" In other words, not all myths are outgrowths of ritual, and not all rituals are outgrowths of myth.\n\nLike Malinowski, the religious scholar Mircea Eliade thinks one important function of myth is to provide an explanation for ritual. Eliade notes that, in many societies, rituals are considered important precisely because they were established by the mythical gods or heroes. Eliade approvingly quotes Malinowski's claim that a myth is \"a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality.\" Eliade adds: \"Because myth relates the \"gesta\" [deeds] of Supernatural Beings [...] it becomes the exemplary model for all significant human actions.\" Traditional man sees mythical figures as models to be imitated. Therefore, societies claim that many of their rituals were established by mythical figures, thereby making the rituals seem all the more important. However, also like Malinowski, Eliade notes that societies use myths to sanction many kinds of activities, not just rituals: \"For him, too, then, myth and ritual are not coextensive.\"\n\nEliade goes beyond Malinowski by giving an explanation for why myth can confer such an importance upon ritual: according to Eliade, \"when [ritually] [re-]enacted myth acts as a time machine, carrying one back to the time of the myth and thereby bringing one closer to god.\" But, again, for Eliade myth and ritual are not coextensive: the same return to the mythical age can be achieved simply by retelling a myth, without any ritual reenactment. According to Eliade, traditional man sees both myths and rituals as vehicles for \"eternal return\" to the mythical age (see Eternal return (Eliade)):\nRecital of myths and enactment of rituals serve a common purpose: they are two different means to remain in sacred time.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "424038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424038", "title": "Pontifical High Mass", "text": "Pontifical High Mass\n\nIn the context of the Tridentine Mass of the Roman Catholic Church, a Pontifical High Mass, also called Solemn Pontifical Mass, is a Solemn or High Mass celebrated by a bishop using certain prescribed ceremonies. The term is also used among Anglo-Catholic Anglicans. Although in modern English the word \"pontifical\" is almost exclusively associated with the Pope, any bishop may be properly called a pontiff. Thus, the celebrant of a Pontifical High Mass may be any bishop, and not just a pope.\n\nIn the early Church, Mass was normally celebrated by the bishop, with other clergy. In the Roman Rite this evolved into a form of Solemn High Mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by a deacon, subdeacon, assistant deacons, thurifer, acolyte(s) and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts to be said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy or during the entrance procession, were said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sang the Introit.\n\nThe full Pontifical High Mass is carried out when the bishop celebrates the Mass at the throne (or cathedra) in his own cathedral church, or with permission at the throne in another diocese.\n\nA Low Mass celebrated by a bishop is almost identical with one celebrated by a priest, except that the bishop puts on the maniple only after the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, uses the greeting \"Peace be with you\" rather than the priest or deacon's \"The Lord be with you\", and makes the sign of the cross three times at the final blessing, which may be preceded by a formula that begins with \"Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini\" (Our help is in the name of the Lord).\n\nIn contrast to celebration by a priest, a bishop celebrates almost the entire first half of the Solemn High Mass until the offertory at the \"cathedra\", often referred to as his throne, to the left of the altar. Instead of saying \"Dominus vobiscum\" \"The Lord be with you\" as the opening liturgical greeting, a bishop says \"Pax vobis\" \"Peace to you\".\n\nA bishop also wears vestments additional to those of a priest:\n\nWhen the bishop sits at the cathedra, a special silk cloth, called a gremial(e), of the same liturgical colour as the bishop's vestments is placed in his lap.\n\nThe Pope's Pontifical High Mass, when celebrated with full solemnity, was even more elaborate. As is still done in papal Masses on occasions such as the inauguration of a pontificate, the Gospel and Epistle were sung not only in Latin by a Latin-Rite deacon and subdeacon, but also in Greek by Eastern clergy, wearing the vestments of their own rite and observing its customs, such as placing the deacon's stole on the Gospel Book and bowing rather than genuflecting. This custom stresses the unity of the universal Catholic Church, formed by both the Eastern and the Western (Latin Church) Churches in full communion.\n\nAt the elevations of host and chalice, the Silveri symphony was played on the trumpets of the no longer existing Noble Guard. Through a misunderstanding of the name Silveri, English speakers sometimes referred to this as the sounding of silver trumpets. An asterisk – a common eucharistic implement in the Eastern Rites, in which it is shaped differently from the twelve-ray asterisk that was used in Papal Masses - was used to cover the host on the paten, when it was brought to the Pope at his throne for communion. The Pope drank the Precious Blood, the wine having been consecrated, through a golden tube. Even for the laity, the use of a tube is one of the four ways envisaged in the 1970 revision of the Roman Missal for receiving Communion from the chalice, cf. also \"General Instruction of the Roman Missal\", 248-250. It was also customary for some of the bread and wine used at the Mass to be consumed by the sacristan and the cup-bearer in the presence of the Pope at the offertory and again before the Our Father (\"Pater noster\") in a short ceremony called the \"praegustatio\" as a precaution against poison or invalid matter.\n\nIn the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, the term \"Pontifical High Mass\" may refer to a Mass celebrated with the traditional Tridentine ceremonies described above. Liturgical manuals such as \"Ritual Notes\" provide a framework for incorporating Tridentine ceremonial into the services of the Book of Common Prayer. More generally, the term may refer to any High Mass celebrated by a bishop, usually in the presence of his or her throne. The Pontifical High Mass is one of four full-form pontifical functions, the other three being pontifical Evensong, High Mass in the presence of a greater prelate, and Solemn Evensong in the presence of a greater prelate. In its more traditional form, the ministers required at the service are a deacon and subdeacon of the Mass, assistant deacons in dalmatics, and an assistant priest in cope and surplice, who acts as the episcopal chaplain, along with the usual servers.\n"}

Lincoln grew up in a highly religious Baptist family. He never joined any Church, and was a skeptic as a young man and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. He frequently referred to God and had a deep knowledge of the Bible, often quoting it. Lincoln attended Protestant church services with his wife and children, and after two of them died he became more intensely concerned with religion.\n\nAlthough Lincoln never made an unambiguous public profession of Christian belief, several people who knew him personally, such as Chaplain of the Senate Phineas Gurley and Mary Todd Lincoln, claimed that he believed in Christ in the religious sense. However, close friends who had known Lincoln for years, such as Ward Hill Lamon and William Herndon, rejected the idea that he was a believing Christian. During his 1846 run for the House of Representatives, in order to dispel accusations concerning his religious beliefs, Lincoln issued a handbill stating that he had \"never denied the truth of the Scriptures\". He seemed to believe in an all-powerful God, who shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.\n\nLincoln's parents were \"hard shell\" Baptists, joining the Little Pigeon Baptist Church near Lincoln City, Indiana, in 1823. In 1831, Lincoln moved to New Salem, which had no churches.\nHowever, historian Mark Noll states that \"Lincoln never joined a church nor ever made a clear profession of standard Christian belief.\"\nNoll quotes Lincoln's friend Jesse Fell:\n\nNoll argues Lincoln was turned against organized Christianity by his experiences as a young man witnessing how excessive emotion and bitter sectarian quarrels marked yearly camp meetings and the ministry of traveling preachers.\nAs a young man, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of deists such as Thomas Paine. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it. After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private.\n\nThe one aspect of his parents' Calvinist religion that Lincoln apparently embraced wholeheartedly throughout his life was the \"doctrine of necessity\", also known as predestination, determinism, or fatalism.\nIt was almost always through these lenses that Lincoln assessed the meaning of the Civil War.\n\nJames Adams labeled Lincoln as a deist.\nIt has been reported that in 1834 he wrote a manuscript essay challenging orthodox Christianity modeled on Paine's book \"The Age of Reason\", which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule.\nAccording to biographer Rev. William Barton, Lincoln likely had written an essay something of this character, but it was not likely that it was burned in such a manner. William J. Johnson, New Salem schoolteacher Mentor Graham, with whom Lincoln boarded, reported in 1874 that the manuscript was \"a defense of universal salvation.\"\n\nThe existence of the manuscript influenced by Paine was originally described by Herndon in his biography on Lincoln. Harvey Lee Ross, mail carrier who lived in New Salem with Lincoln in 1834, asserts that this was a fictional story by Herndon. He states the following issues with the original biographer's account. Herndon was 16 years old in 1834 and lived 20 miles away in Springfield and did not have contact with Lincoln. There was no stove in Samuel Hill's store in 1834 where the manuscript was allegedly burned. There was not a copy of \"The Age of Reason\" on the bookshelf at the tavern where Herndon said Lincoln had read it. Finally, Ross states he was very well acquainted with everyone in the community of New Salem and he would have known about any conversations regarding a document of this nature. It is a reasonable conclusion that there was never a manuscript written and Paine was not a contributing factor in Lincoln's ideas towards religion.\n\nNoll writes, \"At least early on, Lincoln was probably also a Universalist who believed in the eventual salvation of all people.\"\n\nLincoln was often perplexed by the attacks on his character by way of his religious choices. In a letter written to Martin M. Morris in 1843, Lincoln wrote:\n\nIn 1846, when Lincoln ran for congress against Peter Cartwright, the noted evangelist, Cartwright tried to make Lincoln's religion or lack of it a major issue of the campaign. Responding to accusations that he was an \"infidel\", Lincoln defended himself, publishing a hand-bill to \"directly contradict\" the charge made against him. The declaration was released as follows:\n\nAs Carl Sandburg recounts in \"Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years\", Lincoln attended one of Cartwright's revival meetings. At the conclusion of the service, the fiery pulpiteer called for all who intended to go to heaven to rise. Naturally, the response was heartening. Then, he called for all those who wished to go to hell to stand. Unsurprisingly there were not many takers. Lincoln had responded to neither option. Cartwright closed in. \"Mr. Lincoln, you have not expressed an interest in going to either heaven or hell. May I enquire as to where you do plan to go?\" Lincoln replied: \"I did not come here with the idea of being singled out, but since you ask, I will reply with equal candor. I intend to go to Congress.\"\n\nWilliam Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, stated that Lincoln admired deists Thomas Paine and Voltaire. Herndon, an advocate of Darwin's, said Lincoln thought the works of authors like Darwin and Spencer \"entirely too heavy for an ordinary mind to digest\" but he read and was \"interested ... greatly\" in a book expounding on these ideas, \"Vestiges of Creation\", and he was \"deeply impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law' — evolution... and he became a warm advocate of the new doctrine.\"\n\nLincoln believed in God, but some said he doubted the idea that Christ is God. In a written statement to Herndon, James W. Keyes said Lincoln \n\nbelieved in a Creator of all things, who had neither beginning nor end, who possessing all power and wisdom, established a principal, in Obedience to which, Worlds move and are upheld, and animel and vegatable life came into existence. A reason he gave for his belief was, that in view of the Order and harmony of nature which all beheld, it would have been More miraculouis to have Come about by chance, than to have been created and arranged by some great thinking power.\nKeyes also added that Lincoln once said \n\nAs to the christian theory, that, Christ is God, or equal to the Creator he said had better be taken for granted — for by the test of reason all might become infidels on that subject, for evidence of Christs divinity Came to us in somewhat doubtful Shape — but that the Sistom of Christianity was an ingenious one at least — and perhaps was Calculated to do good.\n\nDuring the White House years, Lincoln and his family often attended the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, where the family pew he rented is marked by a plaque.\n\nOn Monday, March 4, 1861, Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address, after the oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Roger Taney. Lincoln's speech addressed the national crisis of the southern secession from the union. Lincoln had hoped to resolve the conflict peacefully without a civil war. During the address, Lincoln stated \"Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\"\n\nIn 1862 and 1863, during the most difficult days of the Civil War and his presidency, Lincoln's utterances were sometimes marked with spiritual overtones.\n\nOn Thursday, February 20, 1862, at 5:00 p.m., Lincoln's eleven-year-old son, William Wallace Lincoln (\"Willie\"), died at the White House. Historians suggest that this may have been the most difficult personal crisis in Lincoln's life. After the funeral, he attempted a return to his routine but was unable. One week after the funeral, he isolated himself in his office and wept all day. Several people reported that Lincoln told them that his feelings about religion changed at this time. Willie is reported to have often remarked that he wanted to become a minister.\n\nWhen his son died, Lincoln reportedly said, \"May God live in all. He was too good for this earth. The good Lord has called him home. I know that he is much better off in Heaven.\"\n\nSpiritualism, popularly in vogue during this era, was tried by Lincoln's wife. She used the services of mediums and spiritualists to try to contact their dead son. Lincoln allegedly attended at least one seance at the White House at this time with his wife.\n\nWhen Bishop Matthew Simpson gave the address at Lincoln's funeral he quoted him asking a soldier \"Do you ever find yourself talking with the dead? Since Willie's death, I catch myself every day, involuntarily talking with him as if he were with me.\"\n\nAt the same time, the war was not going well for the Union. General George McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign came about within months after Willie's death. Next came Robert E. Lee's impressive victory at the Second Battle of Bull Run, after which he said, \"I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.\"\n\nAccording to Salmon Chase, as he was preparing to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln said, \"I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was driven back from Maryland I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves.\" The differences in interpretation of Lincoln's statement may be due to the belief that \"swearing or vowing\" to God was considered blasphemous by some religious organizations.\n\nAt the same time, Lincoln sat down in his office and penned the following words:\n\nThe will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party -- and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say that this is probably true -- that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere great power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And, having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\n\nThis concept continued to dominate Lincoln's public remarks for the rest of the war. The same theological allegory was to be prominent in Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address in March 1865:\n\nIn late 1862 and early 1863 Lincoln would endure more agonies. The defeat of General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg followed by the defeat of General Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville sent Lincoln into a deep depression. \"If there is a worse place than hell I am in it,\" Lincoln told Andrew Curtin in December 1862.\n\n1863 was to be the year, however, in which the tide turned in favor of the Union. The Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 was the first time that Lee was soundly defeated. Prompted by Sarah Josepha Hale,\nin the fall, Lincoln issued the first Federally mandated Thanksgiving Day to be kept on the last Thursday in November. Reflecting on the successes of the past year, Lincoln said,\n\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.\n\nIn December 1863, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, \"In God We Trust,\" to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.\n\nWhen a pious minister told Lincoln he \"hoped the Lord is on our side,\" the president responded, \"I am not at all concerned about that... But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side.\"\n\nIn November 1863, Lincoln travelled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to participate in the dedication of the cemetery established there for the thousands of soldiers who died during the recent battle. There he gave his celebrated speech, the Gettysburg Address, wherein he hoped that the nation shall, \"under God,\" have a new birth of freedom. The words, \"under God,\" may not have been in his written manuscript, but it is posited by some sources that he added them extemporaneously from the podium.\nAccording to scholars, he may have drawn the expression from George Washington's hagiographer, Parson Weems.\n\nIn 1864, some former slaves in Maryland presented Lincoln with a gift of a Bible. According to one report, Lincoln replied:\nIn regard to this great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.\n\nIn response to the reported speech in Maryland, Lincoln's law partner Herndon remarked \"I am aware of the fraud committed on Mr. Lincoln in reporting some insane remarks supposed to have been made by him, in 1864, on the presentation of a Bible to him by the colored people of Baltimore. No sane man ever uttered such folly, and no sane man will ever believe it.\"\n\nIn September 1864, Lincoln, placing the Civil War squarely within a divine province, wrote in a letter to a member of the Society of Friends, \"The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail accurately to perceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled otherwise...we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains. Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay.\"\n\nOn the day Lincoln was assassinated, he told his wife at Ford's Theatre that he wanted to visit the Holy Land and that \"there was no place he so much desired to see as Jerusalem.\" \n\nFollowing Lincoln's assassination a memory book, \"The Lincoln Memorial Album—Immortelles\", in which people could write their thoughts includes some comments on Lincoln's religion. One entry, written by a well-known Presbyterian minister, the Rev. John H. Barrows, claimed that Lincoln had become a Christian in 1863 but provided no evidence. He said:\nIn the anxious uncertainties of the great war, he gradually rose to the heights where Jehovah became to him the sublimest of realities, the ruler of nations...When darkness gathered over the brave armies fighting for the nation's life, this strong man in the early morning knelt and wrestled in prayer with Him who holds the fate of empires. When the clouds lifted above the carnage of Gettysburg, he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe pastor of a church in Freeport, Illinois, in November 1864, said that a man from Illinois visited Lincoln in the White House and, after conducting other business, asked the president if he loved Jesus. The pastor said that Lincoln buried his face in his handkerchief as tears came to his eyes and then answered:\n\nWhen I left home to take this chair of state, I requested my countrymen to pray for me. I was not then a Christian. When my son died, the severest trial of my life, I was not a Christian. But, when I went to Gettysburg and looked upon the graves of our dead heroes who had fallen in defense of their country, I then and there consecrated myself to Christ. Yes, \"I do love Jesus\".\n\nThis quote appeared on page one of the \"Freeport Weekly Journal\" on December 7, 1864.\n\nThis has been portrayed to have been Lincoln's \"reply\" to this unnamed Illinois minister when asked if he loved Jesus. Some versions of this have Lincoln using the word \"crosses\" instead of \"graves\", and some have him saying \"Christ\" instead of \"Jesus\". William Eleazar Barton quotes this version in \"The Soul of Abraham Lincoln\" (1920), but further writes:\nThis incident must have appeared in print immediately after Lincoln's death, for I find it quoted in memorial addresses of May, 1865. Mr. Oldroyd has endeavored to learn for me in what paper he found it and on whose authority it rests, but without result. He does not remember where he found it. It is inherently improbable, and rests on no adequate testimony. It ought to be wholly disregarded. The earliest reference I have found to the story in which Lincoln is alleged to have said to an unnamed Illinois minister, \"I do love Jesus\" is in a sermon preached in the Baptist Church of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, April 19, 1865, by Rev. W.W. Whitcomb, which was published in the Oshkosh \"Northwestern\", April 21, 1865, and in 1907 issued in pamphlet form by John E. Burton.\n\nFollowing Lincoln's assassination, there were competing biographies, some claiming Lincoln had been a Christian and others that he had been a non-believer. In 1872, Colonel Ward Hill Lamon published his \"Life of Abraham Lincoln; From his Birth to his Inauguration as President\" using interviews and correspondences collected by William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner in Springfield. Lamon had also been a law partner with Lincoln in Illinois, from 1852 until 1857, and later was Lincoln's personal bodyguard in Washington. Lamon's biography stated that Lincoln did not himself believe in the divinity of Jesus, and that several who knew him as a young man described him as an \"infidel\".\n\nRev. James Armstrong Reed, in preparing his 1873 lectures on the religion of Lincoln, asked a number of people if there was any evidence of Lincoln being an \"infidel\" in his later life. The reply from Phineas Gurley, pastor of the same New York Avenue Presbyterian Church while Lincoln was an attender, to Reed's question was:\n\nI do not believe a word of it. It could not have been true of him while here, for I have had frequent and intimate conversations with him on the subject of the Bible and the Christian religion, when he could have had no motive to deceive me, and I considered him sound not only on the truth of the Christian religion but on all its fundamental doctrines and teaching. And more than that: in the latter days of his chastened and weary life, after the death of his son Willie, and his visit to the battle-field of Gettysburg, he said, with tears in his eyes, that he had lost confidence in everything but God, and that he now believed his heart was changed, and that he loved the Saviour, and, if he was not deceived in himself, it was his intention soon to make a profession of religion.\n\nNoah Brooks, a newspaperman, and a friend and biographer of Lincoln's, in reply to Reed's inquiry if there was any truth to claims that Lincoln was an \"infidel\", stated:\n\nIn addition to what has appeared from my pen, I will state that I have had many conversations with Mr. Lincoln, which were more or less of a religious character, and while I never tried to draw anything like a statement of his views from him, yet he freely expressed himself to me as having 'a hope of blessed immortality through Jesus Christ.' His views seemed to settle so naturally around that statement, that I considered no other necessary. His language seemed not that of an inquirer, but of one who had a prior settled belief in the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. Once or twice, speaking to me of the change which had come upon him, he said, while he could not fix any definite time, yet it was after he came here, and I am very positive that in his own mind he identified it with about the time of Willie's death. He said, too, that after he went to the White House he kept up the habit of daily prayer. Sometimes he said it was only ten words, but those ten words he had. There is no possible reason to suppose that Mr. Lincoln would ever deceive me as to his religious sentiments. In many conversations with him, I absorbed the firm conviction that Mr. Lincoln was at heart a Christian man, believed in the Savior, and was seriously considering the step which would formally connect him with the visible church on earth. Certainly, any suggestion as to Mr. Lincoln's skepticism or Infidelity, to me who knew him intimately from 1862 till the time of his death, is a monstrous fiction -- a shocking perversion.\n\nAccording to an affidavit signed under oath in Essex County, New Jersey, February 15, 1928, by Mrs. Sidney I. Lauck, then a very old woman: \"After Mr. Lincoln's death, Dr. Gurley told me that Mr. Lincoln had made all the necessary arrangements with him and the Session of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church to be received into the membership of the said church, by confession of his faith in Christ, on the Easter Sunday following the Friday night when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated.\" Mrs. Lauck was, she said, about thirty years of age at the time of the assassination.\nWhile this is possible, Dr. Gurley did not mention anything about Lincoln's impending membership at the funeral in the White House, in which he delivered the sermon that has been preserved, nor in his reply to Reed (above).\n\nFrancis Bicknell Carpenter, the author of \"Six Months in the White House\", told Reed that he \"believed Mr. Lincoln to be a sincere Christian\" and reported that Lincoln had told a woman from Brooklyn in the United States Christian Commission that he had had \"a change of heart\" and intended \"at some suitable opportunity to make a profession of religion\".\n\nRev. Madison Clinton Peters, in his 1909 biography wrote, \"That he was a true and sincere Christian, in fact, if not in form, is fully proved by many extracts from his letters and public utterances.\"\n\nQuotations attributed to Mrs. Lincoln seem inconsistent. She wrote to Reverend Smith, the pastor in Springfield: \"When too - the overwhelming sorrow came upon us, our beautiful bright angelic boy, Willie was called away from us, to his Heavenly Home, with God's chastising hand upon us - he turned his heart to Christ.\"\n\nBut Ward Lamon claimed that Mary Lincoln said to William Herndon: \"Mr. Lincoln had no hope and no faith in the usual acceptance of these words\".\nand Herndon claimed she told him that \"Mr. Lincoln's maxim and philosophy were, 'What is to be, will be, and no prayers of ours can arrest the decree.' He never joined any church. He was a religious man always, I think, but was not a technical Christian.\"\n\nHowever, Mary Lincoln utterly denied these quotes, insisting that Herndon had \"put those words in her mouth.\" She wrote,\n\nWith very great sorrow & natural indignation have I read of Mr Herndon, placing words in my mouth--never once uttered. I remember the call he made on me for a few minutes at the [St. Nicholas] hotel as he mentions, your welcome entrance a quarter of an hour afterward, naturally prevented a further interview with him. Mr Herndon, had always been an utter stranger to me, he was not considered an habitué, at our house.\n\nHerndon's reply to these accusations was never answered.\n\nJohn Remsburg (1848–1919), President of the American Secular Union in 1897, argued against claims of Lincoln's conversion in his book \"Six Historic Americans\" (1906). He cites several of Lincoln's close associates:\n\nIn a letter dated February 4, 1866, William Herndon wrote that:\n\nMr. Lincoln's religion is too well known to me to allow of even a shadow of a doubt; he is or was a Theist & a Rationalist, denying all extraordinary - supernatural inspiration or revelation. At one time in his life, he was an elevated Pantheist, doubting the immortality of the soul as the Christian world understands that term. He believed that the soul lost its identity and was immortal as a force. Subsequent to this he rose to the belief of a God, and this is all the change he ever underwent. I speak knowing what I say. He was a noble man- a good great man for all this. My own ideas of God- his attributes - man, his destiny, & the relations of the two, are tinged with Mr. Lincoln's religion. I cannot, for the poor life of me, see why men dodge the sacred truth of things. In my poor lectures I stick to the truth and bide my time. I love Mr. Lincoln dearly, almost worship him, but that can't blind me. He's the purest politician I ever saw, and the justest man. I am scribbling- that's the word- away on a life of Mr. Lincoln- gathering known- authentic & true facts of him. Excuse the liberties I have taken with you- hope you won't have a fight with Johnson. Is he turning out a fool - a Tyler? He must go with God if he wants to be a living and vital power.\n\nIn \"Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power\" (2006), Richard Carwardine of Oxford University highlights Lincoln's considerable ability to rally evangelical Northern Protestants to the flag by nourishing the millennial belief that they were God's chosen people. Historian Allen C. Guelzo notes: \"This was no mean feat, coming from a man who had been suspected of agnosticism or atheism for most of his life. Yet by the end, while still a religious skeptic, Lincoln, too, seemed to equate the preservation of the Union and the freeing of the slaves with some higher, mystical purpose.\"\n\nGuelzo, director of Civil War Era Studies at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, published \"Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President\" in 1999. Guelzo argues that Lincoln's boyhood inculcation of Calvinism was the dominant thread running through his adult life. He characterizes Lincoln's worldview as a kind of \"Calvinized Deism\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46518076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46518076", "title": "Sex and the Church", "text": "Sex and the Church\n\nSex and the Church is a British documentary series about how Christianity has shaped western attitudes to sex, gender and sexuality throughout history. It was shown on BBC Two and hosted by historian Diarmaid MacCulloch. \n\nMacCulloch, whose books have won a number of prizes, is not only an Oxford Professor of the History of the Church but also a veteran campaigner for the Gay Christian Movement. \n\nFor the Jews, procreation was the vital aspect of sex, but it was celebrated as part of a polygamous male-centred culture. Celibacy, adultery and homosexuality were outlawed. The Greek culture dominant at the time of Christ celebrated sexuality, particularly the male body and wives had no more rights than slaves. But there was another strand, the world of the spirit being more important to Plato and Aristotle with a denial of the flesh.\n\nJesus decreed monogamy and no divorce but said little else about it and he was not representative of his church in other ways. Paul praised celibacy but was divided: he called one woman an apostle but forbade women from speaking in church.\n\nIn the second century, Anthony of Egypt became the most famous of hermits who brought in the idea of monks and nuns from the Syrian understanding of Buddhism and Hinduism. The apocryphal Gospel of James elaborated Mary's story and introduced the idea of her perpetual virginity and miraculous birth. People began to explain away Jesus's brothers and sisters, so that the most important marriage in the Christian story does not involve sex at all. Clement of Alexandria taught that sex except for procreation is wrong and Origen castrated himself to avoid temptation.\n\nAfter Constantine's vision of the Cross before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge had in his view given him the empire, he aligned Christianity with imperial power. Jerome tried to be a monk but became secretary to the bishop of Rome where he attacked Helvidius who claimed that Mary had enjoyed family life, and claimed that Joseph as well as Mary was a virgin.\n\nAugustine's sexual conflicts lay at the root of his teaching about sex summed up by the biblical exhortation \"make no provision for the flesh\". Holiness demanded control, the opposite of lust which he decided was a consequence of the fall: it explains our conviction that sex is shameful.\n\nWhen Roman power collapsed in the fourth century, Christianity stepped into the power vacuum. Teaching was spread by the monasteries and the penitential laid out endless rules about sex: on only 100 days a year was any sex permitted and years of penitence were decreed for any non-acceptable behaviour such as oral sex or masturbation.\n\nIt was not until Pope Gregory VII in the 11th century that marriage became a Christian ceremony. To ensure inheritance, couples must then be married by a priest and rules including the prohibition of seventh cousins marrying gave large powers to the church who would sell dispensations for marriage or annulment for large sums. Under the Sarum Rite, marriages only took place in the porch of the church, but this ambivalence slowly dissolved. In 1139 priestly marriages were declared invalid and the celibate priests increasingly saw themselves as superior. Women who had learning and a voice through the monasteries, were now excluded from the new universities and some resorted to mysticism, which often had erotic overtones. \n\nExcessive sexual desire even for your own wife was now seen as wrong. But alongside this grew the tradition of courtly love, which celebrated adultery and even homosexuality. Thomas Aquinas said that the greatest castle needed a sewer and the churches allowed brothels—the 'stews'—next to the cathedral.\n\nIn the 16th century Martin Luther rebelled against the church's monopoly. He rejected Augustine's idea of original sin as transmitted through sex, and the sacramental nature of marriage. He decided that all clergy should be married, leading by example and having six children in eight years. The Anabaptists of Münster went a lot further, and John of Leiden even introduced polygamy during the year-long siege of the town by the local bishop. He was captured and tortured with several others and their bodies displayed in a cage on the side of the church.\n\nOne aim of the Counter-Reformation was to put this revolution back in the box. Part of the effort was the establishment of the Pious schools by Joseph Calasanz in Spain in the early 17th century. Unfortunately the headmaster of the school in Naples, Father Stefano Cherubini, was found to be sexually abusing his pupils. Because of his powerful Papal connections, Calasanz didn't sack him but instead promoted him, so that he eventually displaced Calasanz.\n\nAcross Europe, women were accused of witchcraft by both Catholics and Protestants. Many were tortured into confessing sex with the devil in the Würzburg witch trial. In 1590, even bad weather was blamed on witchcraft and 80 of 100 burned at the stake were women.\n\nThe 18th century saw the enlightenment with the Christian authorities losing control of sex. In London's Covent Garden there were all types of prostitutes by 1711 and meeting places for gays called \"Molly houses\" where same-sex marriage was performed. \n\nJohn Wesley's evangelical revival saw a new role for women with the woman preachers such as Sarah Crosby and women started to become the bulk of the congregations. But after Wesley's death, the Methodist conference in 1803 stopped women preachers and a promising start faded out, just as in the early church.\n\nThe French Revolution stripped the church of its wealth and killed 2,000 priests, marriage became secular, divorce was permitted and homosexuality legitimised, though peace with the church was restored by Napoleon. Secular marriage was restored in the 1830s in England by civil registration which spread to all European countries and divorce was permitted from 1857, although the Church of England wouldn't accept the remarriage of divorcees until 2002. \n\nVery often reforming legislation was supported by some within the church. Thus Josephine Butler led the campaign against the Contagious Diseases Act; Bishop Colenso argued in favour of tolerance of polygamy where it was traditional in Africa; in 1930 the Lambeth Conference accepted the need for condoms in specific situations; Derrick Sherwin Bailey argued for the decriminalization of homosexuality.\n\nBut the Catholic church generally battened down the hatches, although scandals forfeited trust, with Pope Benedict resigning at the height of the child sexual abuse scandals.\n\n"}

Over forty years after \"Creator omnium\" and \"Sicut dudum\", Pope Sixtus IV found it necessary to repeat the prohibition in his papal bull \"Regimini gregis\", which threatened the excommunication of all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.\n\nChristianity had gained many converts in the Canary Islands by the early 1430s. The ownership of the lands had been the subject of dispute between Portugal and the Kingdom of Castille. The lack of effective control had resulted in periodic raids on the islands to procure slaves. Acting on a complaint by Fernando Calvetos, bishop of the islands, Pope Eugene IV issued a papal bull, \"Creator omnium\", on 17 December 1434, annulling previous permission granted to Portugal to conquer those islands still pagan. Eugene excommunicated anyone who enslaved newly converted Christians, the penalty to stand until the captives were restored to their liberty and possessions.\n\nSlave raids continued in the islands during 1435 and Eugene issued a further edict (\"Sicut dudum\") that affirmed the ban on enslavement, and ordered, under pain of excommunication, that all such slaves be immediately set free:\nWe order and command all and each of the faithful of each sex, within the space of fifteen days of the publication of these letters in the place where they live, that they restore to their earlier liberty all and each person of either sex who were once residents of said Canary Islands, and made captives since the time of their capture, and who have been made subject to slavery. These people are to be totally and perpetually free, and are to be let go without the exaction or reception of money.\n\nEugene went on to say that, \"If this is not done when the fifteen days have passed, they incur the sentence of excommunication by the act itself, from which they cannot be absolved, except at the point of death, even by the Holy See, or by any Spanish bishop, or by the aforementioned Ferdinand, unless they have first given freedom to these captive persons and restored their goods.\" The specific reference to Spanish bishops and Bishop Ferdinand of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote suggests that the Portuguese were not the only ones engaged in slave raids in the Canaries.\n\nJoel S. Panzer views \"Sicut dudum\" as a significant condemnation of slavery, issued sixty years before the Europeans found the New World.\n\nEugene tempered \"Sicut dudum\" with another bull (15 September 1436) due to the complaints made by King Duarte of Portugal, that allowed the Portuguese to conquer any unconverted parts of the Canary Islands. The king suggested that Portugal be authorized to evangelize and civilize the islands, as other less reputable persons were unlikely to heed the pontiff. Political weakness compelled the Renaissance Papacy to adopt an acquiescent and unchallenging position when approached for requests for privileges in favour of these ventures. Without a navy of his own to police the islands, the Pope opted in favor of the Portuguese as the lesser of two evils.\n\nIn 1476 Pope Sixtus IV reiterated the concerns expressed in \"Sicut dudum\" in his papal bull, \"Regimini gregis\", in which he threatened to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.\n\n\n"}

While attending Chapel Hill, he became a member of the Dialectic Society and the US Communist Party. In 1942, following the entry of the US into World War II—and after his leaving the Communist Party—Rittenberg joined the Army and was sent to Stanford's Army Far Eastern Language and Area School to learn Japanese. Rittenberg did not wish to be assigned to study Japanese, and was able to be assigned to learn Chinese instead. This led to his being sent to China in 1944. Rittenberg said that one of the turning points in his life came shortly after he arrived in China. He was sent to bring a $26 check to the family of a girl who was killed by a drunken US soldier. Despite the family's devastation, they gave Rittenberg $6 for his help. It was at that point that \"something inside Sidney Rittenberg shifted.\" After the end of the war, he decided to stay in China as part of the United Nations famine relief program. This led to his meeting the leaders of the Communist movement at Yan'an in 1946.\n\nAt Yan'an, Rittenberg observed the comradeship of CCP leaders, but ran afoul of the small city's strict moral regimen. Rittenberg's memoirs relay his impressions as a young man seeking the acceptance not accorded to him as a leftist labor organizer in South Carolina. Although isolated in the loess caves of the arid northwest, Yan'an was the site of intense introspection by urban intellectuals like Rittenberg, whose first sustained contact with Chinese communism occurred in Yan'an's uniquely isolated setting. Yan'an was also the site of an ongoing Yan'an Rectification Movement launched by Mao Zedong in the previous year. Artists—cartoonists and novelists in particular—were falling under the influence of Mao, whose nascent personality cult Rittenberg soon began to observe. More immediately than Chairman Mao, however, a young female cadre soon lured Rittenberg into a romantic liaison which was immediately exposed and nearly resulted in his expulsion from Yan'an. With the slow but inexorable march toward civil war in 1946, Rittenberg would be drawn out, and into the next phase of his involvement with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nTwice, Rittenberg interpreted a message for the United States from Mao Zedong. The message was the same both times. Mao said that after the war was over in China, and after Mao became the leader of the country, he wanted to still have a good relationship with the United States. This was for two reasons: first, because the United States was the only country that could supply him with the money he needed to rebuild the country; second, because Mao did not wish to depend on the Soviets. Both times this message was delivered it was rejected by President Truman. Rittenberg believes that had Truman decided to talk to Mao, both the Korean War and the Vietnam War could possibly have been averted.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership sought Rittenberg's assistance in translating their messages into English, including the writings of Mao. Rittenberg also worked for the Xinhua News Agency and Radio Peking.\n\nIn 1949, Rittenberg was thrown into solitary confinement for supposedly being a member of a local spy network connected with an international spy network \"uncovered\" in the Soviet Union. For one year, he was kept in a completely dark room, and was kept for five years after that before he was finally released. Rittenberg attributes his survival in solitary confinement to a poem by Edwin Markham:\n\nRittenberg recalled hearing this poem from his sister when he was sick as a child, and, upon his imprisonment, it came back to him, and he used it to build relationships with the prison guards and managed to convince them to provide him with books and a candle to read.\n\nIn 1955, he was released, which he attributes to Joseph Stalin's death.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Rittenberg was radicalised and in the summer of 1967 headed the \"Norman Bethune - Yan'an rebel group\", which had about seventy members. He led political struggles at China Radio International. Han Suyin at that time said that Rittenberg was in complete control of the radio station. On April 8, 1967, the People's Daily published a long article written by him. On April 10, he represented a faction of foreigners in struggle session against Wang Guangmei at Tsinghua University. He also attacked other foreigners who were living in Beijing at that time, including Ma Haide (George Hatem). Ma Haide had advised Rittenberg not to interfere in Chinese political affairs.\n\nAfter several people were labelled as \"516 elements\" in September 1967, foreigners also became targets of that campaign and were labelled \"516 elements\" and foreign spies. A poster with the title \"How an American seized red power at Radio China International\" was put up at the radio station, and Rittenberg was also criticised in a poster at the Friendship Hotel, where many foreigners were living.\n\nIn February 1968, several members of the \"Norman Bethune - Yan'an rebel group\" were arrested, among them Israel Epstein and his wife Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley, Michael Shapiro and Rittenberg. This time, the reason for his arrest was supposed actions and criticisms against the dictatorship and bureaucracy. He was also charged with maintaining connections with the \"Chinese Nikita Khrushchev\" Liu Shaoqi, whom Rittenberg had strongly criticised in the previous campaigns. His wife, Wang Yulin was sent to a \"May Seventh Cadre School\". During his stay he penned a new Confucian saying: \"Man who climbs out on limb should listen carefully for sound of saw.\" According to him, he did not hear the saw until it was too late.\n\nOn International Women's Day, March 8, 1973, there was a reception for foreign experts in the Great Hall of the People, most of whom had been released by that time. Zhou Enlai spoke and apologised to the foreigners, but also said: \"There are also some foreigners who during the Cultural Revolution participated in a certain organisation, who participated in destructive activities of bad elements. Sidney Rittenberg is one of those people; he was involved in the counterrevolutionary clique of Wang Li, Guan Feng and Qi Benyu.\"\n\nIn November 1977, Rittenberg was released and rehabilitated — probably as the last of all the foreigners. In March 1980, he moved back to the United States.\n\nRittenberg is a faculty member in the Chinese Studies Program at Pacific Lutheran University. He is married to Yulin, and has four children. In 1993, he wrote a book about his experiences in China entitled \"The Man Who Stayed Behind\", with the aid of Amanda Bennett.\n\nRittenberg and his wife operate Rittenberg & Associates, a consulting firm that provides assistance to businesses who work with Chinese companies. Some of their best-known clients included Billy Graham and Mike Wallace. Rittenberg frequently speaks about his experiences in China, and is currently living on Fox Island, Washington. In an interview in 2008, he criticized the neoconservative and the Bush administration's view of China as a threat.\n\nIn 2012, Irv Drasnin, Lucy Ostrander, and Don Sellers produced a documentary about Rittenberg called \"The Revolutionary\". Rittenberg and the producers spoke about his experiences and the film at the USC's US-China Institute in June 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

The book was a popular success and became an international best-seller. Writing in the New York Times, Verlyn Klinkenborg cited its broader relevance as a book \"about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them.\" The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings. Kamenetz popularized the term JUBU or Jewish Buddhist, interviewing poet Allen Ginsberg, vipassana teacher Joseph Goldstein, Ram Dass and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West. The book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the Jewish renewal movement, led by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and Jewish meditation as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. The title is a pun on the Vajrayana mantra \"Om mani padme hum\" which is frequently interpreted as \"hail to the jewel in the lotus\".\n\nFirst published in 1994 by Harper San Francisco, it is now on its 37th reprint. In fall of 2007 the paperback was reissued with an afterword that updated readers on Jewish-Buddhist dialogues.\nThe Jew in the Lotus inspired a PBS documentary of the same name produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, released theatrically in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and subsequently on Independent Lens on September 1, 1999.\n"}

The term is used primarily in the Pan-Indian and New Age communities, and rarely among traditional Indigenous people, who have terms in their own languages for their spiritual ways. Native Americans' spiritual teachings are diverse. While some peoples share common elements in their beliefs, the cultures are highly individualized. The ceremonies and many of the beliefs are unique to the people of these diverse bands, tribes and nations.\n\nIn his book \"Black Elk Speaks,\" John G. Neihardt explored spiritual beliefs as he says they were told to him by Black Elk (1863–1950), an Oglala Lakota. Neihardt is non-Native. In the late 20th century, his work was criticized as diverging from, and misrepresenting, Lakota beliefs and ceremonies. \n\nNeihardt said that Black Elk believed he had an obligation to \"help to bring my people back into the sacred hoop, that they might again walk the red road in a sacred manner pleasing to the powers of the universe that are one power.\"\n\"Hear me, four quarters of the world--a relative I am! Give me the strength to walk the soft earth, a relative to all that is! Give me the eyes to see and the strength to understand, that I may be like you. With your power only can I face the winds.<br>\nGreat Spirit, Great Spirit, my Grandfather, all over the earth the faces of living things are all alike. With tenderness have these come up out of the ground. Look upon these faces of children without number and with children in their arms, that they may face the wind and walk the good road to the day of quiet.<br>\nThis is my prayer; hear me now!\"\n\n- \"Black Elk's Prayer for All Life\"\n\nIn some modern addiction treatment programs, the idea of the Red Road may be part of the recovery process. Some of these programs are primarily for Native populations, but take a Pan-Indian or New Age approach, through \"the Sweat lodge, the Red Road, and the Recovery Medicine Wheel.\" Other \"Red Road to Recovery\" programs are not run by or for Native people, but are groups of predominantly non-Native, New Age adherents. \n\nThe phrase \"The Red Road\" has been picked up by many non-Native adherents of New Age and hippie lifestyles, based on their interpretation of Native American spirituality. Critics have accused such followers of cultural appropriation and misrepresentation.\n\n"}

Vajracharya means \"vajra carrier\". They are also commonly called guru-ju or gu-bhaju (a short form for guru bhaju) which are Nepali terms related to the Sanskrit term guru, and translate as \"teacher\" or \"priest\". The bajracharya is the highest ranking of the Newar castes that are born Buddhist.\n\nThe emergence of vajracharya institution is ascribed to the decline of celibate Buddhist monks in about 13th century, and the emergence of Vajrayana.\n\nTo become a professional Guruju, a person of the bajracharya caste must go through a number of rituals. The bajracharya boy goes through a ritualistic process of initiation known as \"bajravishekha\", including shaving off the head as the buddha and asking for alms, at a minimum of seven houses a day in different places, in the tradition of monks since the time of Gautama Buddha. Sometimes tantric Newar Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism is referred to as \"Vajracharya Buddhism\".\n\nThe writers of \"Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal\" explore the unusual relationship of the vajracharyas and their assistant shakyas with Buddhist monasticism:\n, Unlike Vajracharyas, Shakya men may not be priests for others, but together with Vajracharya men they are the members of the traditional Newar Buddhist monasteries, known honorifically as vihara and colloquially as Baha or Bahi. In so far as Shakya and Vajracharya men filled their roles in the monastery, they were monks. In effect, they were married, part-time monks.\nMany of the modern Buddhist scholars in Nepal belong to the vajracharya tradition.\nThere are several legendary vajracharya priests from different parts of Kathmandu valley. Shatikaracharya, a king who turned into a powerful tantric priest and disappeared inside the cave in Shantipur Swoyambhu is well known for his expertise in vajrayana buddhist practice. He is still believed to be dwelling inside the Shantipura cave performing intense sadhana.\nVajracharya Bandhudutta, who was a disciple of the legendary Shatikaracharya, is credited with bringing lord lokesvara form kamaru kamakhya Askam, in Kathmandu valley. Leela Vajra, a Buddhist priest from sakhu is believed to have built kasthamandap from the wood obtained from kalpabrikshhya ( wish fulfilling tree)\nSimilarly Surata Vajra, Vak Vajra, Sashwot Vajra, Manjuvajra ( Jamana Gubhaju) etc. are some of the famous Vajracharya priests whose folklores of magical and mystical deeds are popular among the people of Kathmandu valley\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49925885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49925885", "title": "Zhizha", "text": "Zhizha\n\nZhizha (), or Taoist paper art, is a type of traditional craft, mainly used as offerings in Taoist festive celebrations and funerals. It had become a widely accepted element in religious practice since Northern Song Dynasty. It now faces a gradual loss of craftsmanship due to related environmental concerns and weakened superstitions.\n\nZhizha is generally perceived as a form of offering in festive celebrations and funerals. It is believed to be a substitute for living offerings in a sacrifice.\n\nYoung women in ancient China were offered as brides every year to a so called “River God” in exchange for less frequent floods. To facilitate the exchange, the women would be sacrificed. This practice was later halted by Ximen Bao of Wei due to ethical concerns.\n\nZhizha is the present form of offerings. It only appeared after the maturation of papermaking skills in the Han dynasty. Its common usage came to reality in Northern Song Dynasty, when burning zhǐmǎ (paper dolls in the shape of animals) and zhǐyǒng (paper tomb figures) became popular. Effigies, which were often produced purposefully to resemble humans, took varied forms in different periods of time, from couch grass, terracotta, and eventually paper. \n\nZhizha art plays an important role in Chinese culture. Despite being one of the most important kinds of decorations in villages, it also serves as an important medium of communication between humans and gods in different forms.\n\nThe Zhizha art is mostly for festive or funeral decoration and offerings. During festivals which perform the Taoist ritual, “Dajiao”, Zhizha is used to make symbolic decorations such as lanterns, the models of mythic creatures and Gods in parades. During Ghost Festival and Qingming Festival, apart from joss paper, people burn Zhizha offerings to worship gods and show respect to the ghosts of the deceased. While similarly, Zhizha is essential for a traditional Taoist funeral. Since the Chinese generally believe in an afterlife, anything needed for the deceased to enjoy their afterlives, such as houses, furniture, food, gadgets and even servants will be made into Zhizha models and burned as offerings to them.\n\nBamboo and colored paper are used to prepare Zhizha. The manufacturing process of different offerings are similar, but for large and complex Zhizha, the production process is more time-consuming and more complicated.\nGenerally, to create a Zhiza, the first step is to draft the appearance on a graph. Then, the paper is cut and torn into the desired shape. A form for support made by bamboo is needed on which to glue the colored paper. It is possible to alter the shape of Zhizha to the desired form. Therefore, a large variety of Zhizha products such as apartment, mobile phones, laptops, vehicles, etc, can be made. \n\nComparing Zhizha in the past to modern Zhizha, there are differences in its types and production processes.\n\nIn the past, the types of Zhizha is simpler, as Zhizha craftsmen made products that fulfilled basic human needs for clothing, food, shelter and transportation. Common types of Zhizha includes mansions, servants, paper money and sedan chair. People believe that burning these kinds of necessities to their ancestors can ensure them a better afterlife. However, there are various types of Zhizha like iPhones, iPads and also branded products like Prada.\n\nIn terms of the production process, most of Zhizha in the past was hand-made, and the production cost was generally high. More recently, Zhizha work has shifted to factories in China for mass production so as to lower the cost. \"Though most people can buy paper-made offerings in local stores, a quick look at taobao.com, the most popular online shopping mall in China, reveals a wide choice of paper-made items from mini-houses, Mercedes Benz cars, passports and LV suitcases to iPads and iPhones.\"\n\nZhizha therefore evolves with the era.\n\nThe craftsmen who produced Zhizha are usually recognised as zhācǎi jiàng (扎彩匠 in Chinese). Skills are passed down to the disciples from “sifus” (“masters”).\n\nSince Zhizha is Taoism-based, a Taoist priest can be a Zhizha craftsman. They learn the craftsmanship while handling their priestly duties simultaneously. The production of paper crafts is considered as an inferior duty, thus they are often assigned to the young priests.\n\nAs revealed by Chan and Bok, Zhizha, as a kind of traditional craft, is declining at present. One of the contributing factors is the low entry rate of new craftsmen into the industry. The growing disbelief in the afterlife, and increased awareness of the pollutive nature of burning Zhizha offerings are believed the main reasons behind the decline.\n\n"}

Relics of the Buddha after cremation are termed \"dhātu\" in the \"Mahaparinibbana Sutta\". Śarīra are held to emanate or incite 'blessings' and 'grace' (Sanskrit: adhiṣṭhāna) within the mindstream and experience of those connected to them. Sarira are also believed to ward off evil in the Himalayan Buddhist tradition.\n\nŚarīra originally meant \"body\" in Sanskrit, but when used in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit texts to mean \"relics\", it is always used in the plural: śarīrāḥ. The term \"ringsel\" is a loanword from the Tibetan language. Both of these terms are ambiguous in English; they are generally used as synonyms, although according to some interpretations, ringsels are a subset of śarīras.\n\nŚarīra can refer to:\n\nAlthough the term śarīra can be used to refer to a wide variety of Buddhist relics, as listed above, it is generally used to refer to pearl or crystal-like bead-shaped objects that are purportedly found among the cremated ashes of Buddhist spiritual masters.\n\nThese objects are considered relics of significant importance in many sects of Buddhism since they are believed to embody the spiritual knowledge, teachings, realizations or living essence of spiritual masters. They are taken as evidence of the masters' enlightenment and spiritual purity. Some believe that śarīras are deliberately left by the consciousness of a master for veneration, and that the beauty of the śarīras depends on how well the masters had cultivated their mind and souls. Śarīra come in a variety of colours, and some are even translucent.\n\nSariras are typically displayed in a glass bowl inside small gold urns or stupas as well as enshrined inside the master's statue. Śarīras are also believed to mysteriously multiply while inside their containers if they have been stored under favorable conditions. Saffron threads are sometimes placed within or around the bowl containing individual śarīra as an offering.\n\nIn the Korean \"Samguk yusa\" it is said that the monk Myojong received a śarīra from a turtle which caused others to treat the monk better.\n\nThe occurrence of śarīra is not restricted to ancient times, and many Buddhists have shown that śarīra are not limited to humans or masters. Many texts of Pure Land Buddhism report śarīras of many adherents, some occurring recently. Some Buddhists associate a student's spiritual life with the amount and condition of the śarīra they leave after cremation. Many Pure Land Buddhists believe Amitābha's power manifests cremated remains into śarīra. Many claim that pearls of śarīra rain at the funerals of eminent monks. There are reports that śarīra may appear, multiply or disappear, depending on a keeper's thoughts. One's vow may also be important. One legend holds that the translator Kumārajīva wanted to demonstrate that his translations were not false; as a result his tongue remained intact after cremation.\n\nThere is evidence that under certain conditions of heating, human bones can form crystalline structures. In one chemical analysis, śarīras were found to be composed of the constituent elements of both bones and stones.\n\nPearl relics are documented in the 2008 film, \"Unmistaken Child\", among the cremation ashes of Geshe Lama Konchog.\n\nJavanese has a strong historical bond with the Hindu tradition and Sanskrit liturgical language. Śarīra is also used in Archaic (Kawi) Javanese, preserving its original meaning of 'body' or 'human body'. The word also finds its way into the modern Javanese language as \"slira\" with the same meaning. \"Sliramu\" (strictly translated as 'your body') and \"sliraku\" (strictly translated as 'my body') are usually used in poems or songs to replace \"you\" and \"I\", respectively. The word is not common but is used in both oral and written contexts.\n\n\n"}
