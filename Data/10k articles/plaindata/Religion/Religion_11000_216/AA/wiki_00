The Ahmadi teaching that Jesus survived crucifixion, traveled east in order to preach to the Lost Tribes of Israel and died naturally, as promoted by Ghulam Ahmad, continues to be a source of friction with Christianity, in which vicarious atonement and the resurrection of Jesus are central tenets. The historian Francis Robinson states:\nAhmadiyya teachings also identify the emergence of the Antichrist (\"Al-Masih ad-Dajjal\") as foretold in Islamic eschatology with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of European Christianity. Ghulam Ahmad, who wrote extensively on this topic, identified the Antichrist principally with colonial missionaries who, according to him, were to be countered through argumentation rather than by physical warfare. While the term \"Dajjāl\" is taken as a reference to the forces of falsehood in matters of ideology and religious belief, prophecies concerning Gog and Magog (or \"Yaʾjūj Maʾjūj\") are taken as relating to the duplicity in the realm of politics and the shattering of world peace by the same forces – whose ancestors are thought to be the Slavic and Teutonic peoples – and are seen as embodied by the political (as opposed to religious) dominance of European powers. The conflict between Russia and the United States as two superpowers, or the militant rivalry between the communist and capitalist systems and their impact over the nations of the world, are thus seen as having occurred in accordance with prophecies concerning Gog and Magog. These views, too, have proven controversial with some Christians.\n\nAhmadis have recognised Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, as a holy man since Ghulām Ahmad carried out a detailed study of him and the history of Sikhism. Ahmadis believe that historically, Sikhism was a Sufi sect of Islam, a view strongly opposed by modern Sikhs.\n\nGhulām Ahmad was involved in debates with leaders of the Arya Samaj movement of Hinduism and wrote several texts on the subject.\n\nAhmadis, like other Muslims, believe that the last, perfect message from God was brought to Muhammad. However, unlike mainstream Muslims, Ahmadis believe that many founders or significant figures of various faiths, including Krishna and Buddha, have brought messages from God. Ghulām Ahmad claimed to be the Kalki Avatar, the last avatar of Vishnu, whom Hindus were waiting for. However, he did not agree with the Hindu concept of incarnations of God. He considered Krishna and Rama human prophets who preached to others about the One God, and he believed that Hindus had distorted this view into polytheism over many thousands of years.\n\nThe Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement does not see Ghulām Ahmad as a prophet. Ahmadis claim this is a result of misinterpreting his statements on his coming \"in the spirit of Muhammad\" (similar to John the Baptist coming in the spirit and power of Elijah). Ahmadi Muslims believe Ghulām Ahmad to be the Mahdi, Islam's prophesied messiah. Mainstream Muslims, however, say that he did not fulfill the prophecies of the Mahdi and that the title of Messiah was given only to Jesus. Thus, they consider him a false prophet. Because the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement’s view of Ghulām Ahmad is closer to current mainstream Islamic thought than the view held by Ahmadis, its literature has found greater acceptance among the Muslim intelligentsia, and some mainstream Islamic scholars consider members of the movement Muslims.\n\nThe government of Pakistan views members of both Ahmadi movements as non-Muslims, and this is recorded on their travel documents. But Ahmadi citizens from Western countries and some Muslim nations perform the Hajj and Umrah, as the Saudi government is not made aware that they are Ahmadis when they apply for a visa. A 1970 court decision in India upheld the right of Ahmadis to identify themselves as Muslims.\n\nSome Muslims group both Ahmadi movements together and refer to them as \"Qadianis\", and their beliefs as \"Qadianism\" (after Qadian, the small town in the Gurdaspur district of India's Punjab region where Ghulām Ahmad was born). Most Ahmadis of both sects dislike this term, because it has derogatory connotations and because they prefer to differentiate their two movements.\n\nIn the past, there has been widespread persecution of Ahmadis by other Muslims in India and Pakistan. Sporadic violence, as well as subtler persecution, continues today.\n\nAhmadis believe that the founders of all the major world religions were working towards the establishment of Islam in its broadest sense, as part of the divine scheme of the development of religion. They say that the completion and consummation of this development occurred with the coming of Muhammad, and that the \"manifestation\" of Muhammad’s prophethood and message was destined to be perfected with the coming of the Mahdi. Because they regard Ghulām Ahmad as the Mahdi, they believe he is the \"Promised One\" of all religions, fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrianism, Indian religions, Native American traditions and others.\n\nAhmadis believe that many verses of the Old Testament and New Testament—such as those in the Book of Revelation, and those about the Second Coming of Christ in the 24th chapter of Matthew—were prophecies regarding the Messiah of the end times, and that they were fulfilled through the appearance of Ghulām Ahmad. Ahmadis also cite a passage in Chapter 12 of the Book of Daniel:\n\n\"The time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away\" is interpreted by Ahmadis to mean the supersession of Judaic law by Islamic law, and \"the abomination that maketh desolate\" to mean the banning of idol worship brought about with the founding of Islam. Based on these interpretations and the day-year principle, Ahmadis believe that the \"thousand two hundred and ninety days\" are actually 1,290 years of the Islamic calendar, ending in 1875, when, according to Ahmadi belief, Ghulām Ahmad began to receive divine revelations with continuity. Ahmadis maintain that, as per Judeo-Christian prophecy regarding the coming of the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ, Ghulām Ahmad appeared at the end of the 6,000th year from the time of Adam, and that with him, the final, 7th epoch of 1000 years began. It is also important to note that Ahmadis don't believe that the world is 6000 years old, but only the approximate time since the first prophet being 6000 years.\n\nAhmadis cite numerous passages from the Qur'an, tafsir and hadith in support of their views. They believe that the Messiah, Isa (i.e., Jesus), and the Mahdi whose comings are prophesied in Islam are, in fact, two titles or roles for the same person. According to Ahmadi thought, the promised redeemer is called \"Isa\" or \"Masih\" (Messiah) in relation to his task of refuting what they perceive as the erroneous doctrines of Christianity, and \"Mahdi\" in relation to his task of reforming and guiding Muslims. His advent is seen as a continuation of the prophethood of Muhammad.\n\nAhmadis regard Krishna as a prophet of God, citing the hadith and Qur'an. Ghulām Ahmad stated that the terms \"avatar\" and \"prophet\" were synonymous, and that the Avatar was equivalent to the Qur'anic Messenger.\n\nMembers of the Ahmadiyya community believe that Ghulām Ahmad was the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Maitreya, a future Buddha said to usher in an age of peace and security. Ghulām Ahmad himself wrote in his book \"Jesus in India\" that the Maitreya was actually Jesus, and that Jesus travelled to India, Kashmir and Tibet (predominantly Buddhist regions at the time) to preach to Jews who had migrated there and converted to other religions.\n\nGhulām Ahmad called himself the \"reflection of all prophets\", and regarded Gautama Buddha as a prophet. According to him, Jesus was both the Jewish Messiah and the Maitreya. Thus, Ghulām Ahmad claimed to have fulfilled the prophecy of the Second Coming of Jesus and, in turn, the prophecy of the Second Coming of the Maitreya as well.\n\nGhulām Ahmad claimed that he had been bestowed with the attributes of all biblical and non-biblical prophets, in accordance with a verse of the Qur'an that says all prophets will converge into one person in the future. He said he had received a revelation in which God called him \"the Champion of Allah in the mantle of Prophets\"\".\" The biblical prophets include Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus.\n\nHe also likened his role to that of Adam, as the initiator of a new age. In various writings, he stated that he and Adam were born twins on a Friday and that, just as Adam was born in the final hours of the sixth day of the week, he was born in the final years of the sixth millennium: As per the Qur'an and the Bible, a day in the estimation of God is a thousand years. Ahmadis also believe that Ghulām Ahmad was the Second Coming of Noah, citing the prophecy made by Jesus in .\n\nGhulām Ahmad further compared himself to the Qur'anic figure Dhul-Qarnayn, who is often equated with Cyrus the Great.\n"}

The organization provides afrocentric-based spiritual training to the African American community in particular and to the African diaspora in general.\n\nEach Ausar Auset Society branch or study group replicates the society's structure established by Ra Un Nefer Amen in New York and falls under the leadership of either a Paramount King, Paramount Queen Mother, or Chief(tess) who has his/her own hierarchy of officials and autonomy over their respective region.\n\nCentral to the Ausarian religious system are the 11 Divine Laws. An important theme of this book is that the essence of these 11 Laws must be programmed into the Spirit of the individual through specific meditation techniques. Impressing these Laws upon the spirit will ensure that an individual's identity is with his or her true Self when he or she is confronted with a challenging situation rather than with the false self-image that gives control over to the emotions.\n\nA proper understanding for the cultivation of the 11 Laws consists of the following:\n\nAnother important concept that is integral to the teachings of Ausar Auset Society is that Man's entire Being is a composite made up of the Self and the Not-Self, as both are required in order to exist in the physical world. An individual's true identity, however, is the Self which consists of Consciousness and Will (Not-Self consists of Energy and Matter) as there is no energy or matter in Man's true Self. Since Spirit is considered Not-Self, Man's true Self cannot be Spirit. Also, every thought, emotion and sensation belongs to the Not-Self and generally represents a manifestation of the Animal Spirit in Man. The Animal Spirit, along with the Mental Spirit and the Divine Spirit, represents a triune view of Man's Being. The Divine Spirit, which is pre-programmed with Divine Law, corresponds to Man's true Self while both the Mental Spirit (Man's intellect and reasoning ability) and the Animal Spirit correspond to the Not-Self. Therefore, failure to control one's emotions, for example, represents a submission to the animal part of Being as well as a waste of one's Life Force.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "556904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=556904", "title": "Bazaar", "text": "Bazaar\n\nA bazaar is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold. The term originates from the Persian word \"bāzār\". The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the \"network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen\" who work in that area. Although the current meaning of the word is believed to have originated in Persia, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world. In Balinese, the word \"pasar\" means \"market.\" The capital of Bali province, in Indonesia, is Denpasar, which means \"north market.\" \"Souq\" is another word used in the Middle East for an open-air marketplace or commercial quarter.\n\nEvidence for the existence of bazaars dates to around 3,000 BCE. Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, indications suggest that they initially developed outside city walls where they were often associated with servicing the needs of caravanserai. As towns and cities became more populous, these bazaars moved into the city center and developed in a linear pattern along streets stretching from one city gate to another gate on the opposite side of the city. Over time, these bazaars formed a network of trading centres which allowed for the exchange of produce and information. The rise of large bazaars and stock trading centres in the Muslim world allowed the creation of new capitals and eventually new empires. New and wealthy cities such as Isfahan, Golconda, Samarkand, Cairo, Baghdad and Timbuktu were founded along trade routes and bazaars. Street markets are the European and North American equivalents.\n\nShopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the \"beating heart\" of Middle-Eastern city and South Asian life. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as World Heritage sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance. Visiting a bazaar or souq has also become a popular tourist pastime.\n\nThe origin of the word \"bazaar\" comes from Persian \"bāzār\". from Middle Persian \"wāzār\", from Old Persian \"vāčar\", from Proto-Indo-Iranian \"*wahā-čarana\". The term, bazaar, spread from Persia into Arabia and ultimately throughout the Middle East.\n\nIn North America, the United Kingdom and some other European countries, the term can be used as a synonym for a \"rummage sale\", to describe charity fundraising events held by churches or other community organisations in which either donated used goods (such as books, clothes and household items) or new and handcrafted (or home-baked) goods are sold for low prices, as at a church or other organisation's Christmas bazaar, for example.\n\nAlthough Turkey offers many famous markets known as \"bazaars\" in English, the Turkish word \"pazar\" refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate \"çarşı\" (shopping district) as \"bazaar\" when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages. For example, the Turkish name for the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is \"Kapalıçarşı\" (gated shopping area), while the Spice Bazaar is the \"Mısır Çarşısı\" (Egyptian shopping area). The Arabic term, souk (souq or suk) is a synonym for bazaar in Arab-speaking countries.\n\nBazaars originated in the Middle East, probably in Persia. Pourjafara et al., point to historical records documenting the concept of a bazaar as early as 3000 BC. By the 4th century (CE), a network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars were typically situated in close proximity to ruling palaces, citadels or mosques, not only because the city afforded traders some protection, but also because palaces and cities generated substantial demand for goods and services. Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged.\n\nThe Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.\n\nPrior to the 10th century, bazaars were situated on the perimeter of the city or just outside the city walls. Along the major trade routes, bazaars were associated with the caravanserai. From around the 10th century, bazaars and market places were gradually integrated within the city limits. The typical bazaar was a covered area where traders could buy and sell with some protection from the elements. Over the centuries, the buildings that housed bazaars became larger and more elaborate. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating, purpose-built market; its construction began in 1455.\nCity bazaars occupied a series of alleys along the length of the city, typically stretching from one city gate to a different gate on the other side of the city. The bazaar at Tabriz, for example, stretches along 1.5 kilometres of street and is the longest vaulted bazaar in the world. Moosavi argues that the Middle-Eastern bazaar evolved in a linear pattern, whereas the market places of the West were more centralised.\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of bazaar existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of bazaars, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.\n\nNejad has made a detailed study of early bazaars in Iran and identifies two distinct types, based on their place within the economy, namely:\n\nIn the 1840s, Charles White described the Yessir Bazary of Constantinople in the following terms:\n\nIn the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be \"the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance.\" Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value.\n\nThe Medina of Fez, Morocco, with its labyrinthine covered market streets was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Al-Madina Souq is part of the ancient city of Aleppo, another UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986. The Bazaar complex at Tabriz, Iran was listed in 2010. The Bazaar of Qaisiyariye in Laar, Iran is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Lar\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the \"Orient.\" Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the \"European West\" and the \"East or Orient\"; \"us\" and the \"other.\" Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilisation; the peoples could be threatening- they were \"despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.\" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as \"Orientalism.\" Artists focussed on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favourite subject matter. European society generally frowned on nude painting – but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.\n\nFrench painter Jean-Étienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled \"From the Black Sea through Persia and India.\" Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830–1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853–1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.\n\nA proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of \"The Arabian Nights\" (translated into English from the French in 1705–08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's \"History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,\" (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's \"Oriental Tales,\" is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.\n\nMany English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: \"Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles\" by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle's \"Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas\" published in 1922\n\nIn Albania, two distinct types of bazaar can be found; Bedesten (also known as bezistan, bezisten, bedesten) which refers to a covered bazaar and an open bazaar.\n\nIn Nepal, India and Bangladesh, a Haat bazaar (also known as \"hat\" or \"haat\" or \"hatt\") refers to a regular produce market, typically held once or twice per week.\n\n\nIn India, and also Pakistan, a town or city's main market is known as a Saddar Bazaar.\n\nThese are mutually agreed border bazaars and haats of India on borders of India with its neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Qaysari Bazaar is a type of covered bazaar typical of Kurdistan and Iraq.\n\nAfter sustaining irreparable damage during the country's civil war, Beirut's ancient souks have been completely modernised and rebuilt while maintaining the original ancient Greek street grid, major landmarks and street names.\n\nIn the Balkans, the term, 'Bedesten' is used to describe a covered market or bazaar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Turkey, the term 'bazaars' is used in the English sense, to refer to a covered market place. In Turkish the term for bazaar is \"çarşı.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6188", "title": "Buddhist cuisine", "text": "Buddhist cuisine\n\nBuddhist cuisine is an East Asian cuisine that is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Chinese Buddhism. It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, as well as East Asian religions like Taoism. While monks and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\n\nVegetarian cuisine is known as \"sùshí\" (素食) (\"vegetarian food\"), \"chúnsù\" (纯素) (\"pure vegetarian\"), \"zhāicài\" (斋菜) (\"lent / fasting food\") in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan; \"đồ chay\" in Vietnam; in Japan; \"sachal eumsik\" (\"temple food\") in Korea; \"jay (เจ)\" in Thailand and by other names in many countries. The dishes that comprise Buddhist cuisine in any given place will be influenced by the general local cuisine.\n\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to monasteries, where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as , and served at many temples, especially in Kyoto. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the Ōbaku school of zen, and known as ; this is served at the head temple of Manpuku-ji, as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\n\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but opinions and restrictions on the eating of meat, and whether it should be prohibited, vary among sects.\n\nWhen monks and nuns who follow the Theravadan way feed themselves by alms, they must eat leftover foods which are given to them, including meat. (The Pali/Sanskrit term for monks and nuns means \"one who seeks alms\".) The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be karmically negative. The same restriction is also followed by lay Buddhists and is known as the consumption of the \"triply clean meat\" (三净肉). Additionally, the Pali Sutras where this rule is set forth tell of the Buddha refuting a suggestion by his student Devadatta to include vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\n\nIn the Mahayana tradition, by contrast, acceptance of the Pali Sutras is contested and several of the sutras that comprise the Mahayana canon contain several explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, in one case saying \"One who eats meat kills the seed of great compassion\". Japanese Buddhist sects generally believe that Buddha ate meat. All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism (Zen, Nichiren, Jodo) have relaxed Mahayana vinaya, and as a consequence, vegetarianism is optional. Tibetan Buddhism has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, the leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practising vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible. The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism.\n\nStill, both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating Bodhisattvas's paramita.\n\nIn addition to the ban on garlic practically all Mahayana monastics in China, Korea, Vietnam and Japan specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally asafoetida, shallot, mountain leek and Allium chinense, which together with garlic are referred to as \"wǔ hūn\" (五荤, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or \"wǔ xīn\" (五辛 or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the Brahamajala Sutra, the Surangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander. The origins of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of Hinduism and Jainism. Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list.\n\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"mindfulness\". It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, tobacco and drugs other than medicine to be addictive. Although caffeine is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially tea are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\n\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adopted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\n\nIn \"Tenzo kyokun\" (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), Soto Zen founder Eihei Dogen wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\n\nIn preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"\"\n\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, rice features heavily in as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or congee as the usual morning meal. Noodles and other grains may often be served as well. Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, soy sauce and vegan dashi figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while curry and Tương (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a tea ceremony in the Zen tradition.\n\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as seitan, kao fu (烤麸) or wheat meat, soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, konnyaku and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world. Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own. With the proper seasonings, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\n\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many monasteries and temples which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\n\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days. To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\n\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the Zen tradition generally follow a pattern of \"three bowls\" in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or congee; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26619916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26619916", "title": "Christian privilege", "text": "Christian privilege\n\nChristian privilege is any of several advantages bestowed upon Christians in some societies. This arises out of the presumption that Christian belief is a social norm, that leads to the marginalization of the nonreligious and members of other religions through institutional religious discrimination or religious persecution. Christian privilege can also lead to the neglect of outsiders' cultural heritage and religious practices.\n\nChristian privilege is a type of dominant group privilege where the unconscious or conscious attitudes and beliefs of Christians advantage Christians over non-Christians. Examples include opinions that non-Christian beliefs are inferior or dangerous, or that those that adhere to non-Christian beliefs are amoral, immoral, sinful, or misguided. Such prejudices pervade established social institutions, are reinforced by the broader American society, and have evolved as part of its history.\n\nLewis Z. Schlosser observes that the exposure of Christian privilege breaks a \"sacred taboo\", and that \"both subtle and obvious pressures exist to ensure that these privileges continue to be in the sole domain of Christians. This process is quite similar to the way in which whites and males continue to (consciously and unconsciously) ensure the privilege of their racial and gender groups\".\n\nThere is a hierarchy of Christian privilege in the United States. White mainstream Protestant denominations have greater degrees of privilege than minority Christian denominations. Such groups include African American churches, Christian Hispanics and Latinos, Amish people, Mennonite, Quakers, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Christian scientists, Mormons, and in some instances, Catholics.\n\nWhen the dominant Christian groups impose their cultural norms, values, and perspectives on people with different beliefs, those people are oppressed. These values are imposed \"on institutions by individuals and on individuals by institutions\". These social and cultural values define ideas of good and evil, health and sickness, normality and deviancy, and how one should live one's life. The dominant group's social values serve to justify and rationalize social oppression, while the dominant group members may not be aware of the ways in which they are privileged because of their own social identity; \"unpacking\" McIntosh's allegorical knapsack of privilege (of any kind) is to become aware of and to develop critical consciousness of its existence and how it impacts the daily lives of both those with and those without this privilege.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville the French political scientist and diplomat, traveled across the United States for nine months between 1831–1832, conducting research for his book \"Democracy in America\". He noted a paradox of religion in the U.S. On the one hand, the United States promoted itself around the world as a country that valued both the \"separation of church and state\", and religious freedom and tolerance. On the other hand, \"There is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America\". He explained this paradox by proposing that with no officially sanctioned governmental religion, Christian denominations were compelled to compete with one another and promote themselves in order to attract and keep parishioners, thereby making religion even stronger. While the government did not support Christian churches as such, Tocqueville argued that religion should be considered the first political institution because of the enormous influence that churches had on the political process.\n\nAlthough de Tocqueville favored U.S. style democracy, he found its major limitation to be in its limiting of independent thought and independent beliefs. In a country that promoted the notion that the majority rules, this effectively silenced minorities by what Tocqueville termed the \"tyranny of the majority\". Without specific guarantees of minority rights—in this case minority religious rights—there is a danger of religious domination over religious minorities and non-believers. The religious majority in the U.S. has historically been adherents of mainline Protestant Christian denominations who often assume that their values and standard apply equally to others.\n\nAnother traveler to the United States, social theorist Gunnar Myrdal examined U.S. society following World War II, and he noted a contradiction, which he termed \"an American dilemma\". He found an overriding commitment to democracy, liberty, freedom, human dignity, and egalitarian values, coexisting alongside deep-seated patterns of racial discrimination, privileging of white people, and the subordination of peoples of color. This contradiction has been reframed for contemporary consideration by the religious scholar, Diana Eck:\n\nThe concept of hegemony describes the ways in which a dominant group, in this case mainly U.S. Protestant Christians, disseminate their \"dominant\" social constructions as common sense, normative, or even universal, even though most of the world's inhabitants are not Christian. Christian hegemony also accepts Christianity as part of the natural order, even at times by those who are marginalized, disempowered, or rendered invisible by it. Thus, Christian hegemony helps to maintain the marginality of other religions and beliefs. According to Beaman, \"the binary opposition of sameness/difference is reflected in Protestant/minority religion in which mainstream Protestantism is representative of the 'normal'\".\n\nThe French philosopher, Michel Foucault, described how a dominant-group's hegemony is advanced through \"discourses\". Discourses include the ideas, written expressions, theoretical foundations, and language of the dominant culture. According to Foucault, dominant-group discourses pervade networks of social and political control, which he called \"regimes of truth\", and which function to legitimize what can be said, who has the authority to speak and be heard, and what is authorized as true or as \"the\" truth.\n\nChristian privilege at the individual level occurs in proselytizing to convert or reconvert non-Christians to Christianity. While many Christians view proselytizing as offering the gift of Jesus to the non-Christians, non-believers and people of other faiths may view this as an imposition, manipulation, or oppression.\n\nSocial institutions—including but not limited to educational, governmental, and religious bodies—often maintain and perpetuate policies that explicitly or implicitly privilege and promote some groups while limiting access, excluding, or rendering invisible other groups based on social identity and social status.\n\nOvert forms of oppression, when a dominant group tyrannizes a subordinate group, for example, apartheid, slavery and ethnic cleansing, are obvious. However, dominant group privilege is not as obvious, especially to members of dominant groups. Oppression in its fullest sense refers to structural or systemic constraints imposed on groups, even within constitutional democracies, and its \"causes are embedded in unquestioned norms, habits, and symbols, in the assumptions underlying institutional rules and the collective consequences of following those rules\".\n\nChristian dominance is facilitated by its relative invisibility, and because of this invisibility, it is not analyzed, scrutinized, or confronted. Dominance is perceived as unremarkable or \"normal\". For example, some symbolism and rituals associated with religious holidays may appear to be free of religion. However, this very secularization can fortify Christian privilege and perpetuate Christian hegemony by making it harder to recognize and thus circumvent the constitutional requirements for the separation of religion and government.\n\nChristian privilege and religious oppression exist in a symbiotic relationship. Oppression toward non-Christians gives rise to Christian privilege, and Christian privilege maintains oppression toward non-Christian individuals and faith communities.\n\nAccording to Schlosser, many Christians reject the notion that they have any privilege by claiming that all religions are essentially the same. Thus, they have no more and no fewer benefits accorded to them than members of other faith communities. Blumenfeld notes the objections that some of his university students raise when discussing Christian privilege as connected with the celebration of Christian holidays. The students, he notes, state that many of the celebrations and decorations have nothing to do with religion as such, and do not represent Christianity, but are rather part of American culture—however, this could be considered a further example of privilege.\n\nSimilarly, some claim that the religious significance of cultural practices stems not from Christianity, but rather from a Judeo-Christian tradition. Beaman argues that \"this obscures the pervasiveness of anti-Semitism in the modern world\".\n\nSome claim that the concept of Christian Privilege is a misnomer. James Madison, in his first significant public act, objected to the use of \"toleration\" in the article, believing that it implied that religious liberty was a grant from the state that could be revoked at will. The Virginia Convention agreed, and Article XVI was amended to make it clear that \"the free exercise of religion\" is a right, not a privilege granted by the state.\nMark David Hall, Ph.D., argues, \"The Founders of the United States believed it permissible for the national and state governments to encourage Christianity, but this may no longer be prudential in our increasingly pluralistic country. Yet the Constitution does not mandate a secular polity, and we should be wary of jurists, politicians, and academics who would strip religion from the public square. We should certainly reject arguments that America's Founders intended the First Amendment to prohibit neutral programs that support faith-based social service agencies, religious schools, and the like.\"\n\nScholars and jurists debate the exact scope of religious liberty protected by the First Amendment. For instance, it is unclear whether the amendment requires religious minorities to be exempted from neutral laws. (For example, does the Free Exercise Clause require Congress to exempt religious pacifists from conscription into the military?) But at a minimum, it prohibits Congress from, in the words of James Madison, compelling \"men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1249101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1249101", "title": "Claude Cahun", "text": "Claude Cahun\n\nClaude Cahun (25 October 1894 – 8 December 1954), born Lucy Renee Mathilde Schwob, was a French photographer, sculptor and writer.\n\nLucy Renee Mathilde Schwob adopted the gender-ambiguous name Claude Cahun in 1917 and is best known for self-portraits, in which she assumed a variety of personas.\n\nHer work was both political and personal, and often undermined traditional concepts of static gender roles. She once explained: \"Under this mask, another mask; I will never finish removing all these faces.\"\n\nBorn in Nantes in 1894, Cahun was born into a provincial but prominent intellectual Jewish family. Cahun was the niece of an avant-garde writer Marcel Schwob and the great-niece of Orientalist David Léon Cahun. When Cahun was four years old, her mother, Mary-Antoinette Courbebaisse, began suffering from mental illness, which ultimately led to her permanent internment at a psychiatric facility. Due to the absence of her mother, Cahun was brought up by her grandmother, Mathilde Cahun.\n\nCahun attended a private school (Parsons Mead School) in Surrey after experiences with anti-Semitism at her high school in Nantes. She attended the University of Paris, Sorbonne.\n\nShe began making photographic self-portraits as early as 1912 (aged 18), and continued taking images of herself through the 1930s.\n\nAround 1919, she changed her name to Claude Cahun, after having previously used the names Claude Courlis (after the curlew) and Daniel Douglas (after Lord Alfred Douglas). During the early 1920s, she settled in Paris with her lifelong lesbian partner and step-sibling Suzanne Malherbe, who adopted the pseudonym Marcel Moore. For the rest of their lives together, Cahun and Moore collaborated on various written works, sculptures, photomontages and collages. The two published articles and novels, notably in the periodical \"Mercure de France\", and befriended Henri Michaux, Pierre Morhange, and Robert Desnos.\n\nAround 1922 Claude and Moore began holding artists' salons at their home. Among the regulars who would attend were artists Henri Michaux and André Breton and literary entrepreneurs Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier.\n\nCahun's works encompassed writing, photography, and theatre. She is most remembered for her highly staged self-portraits and tableaux that incorporated the visual aesthetics of Surrealism. During the 1920s Cahun produced an astonishing number of self-portraits in various guises such as aviator, dandy, doll, body builder, vamp and vampire, angel, and Japanese puppet.\n\nMany of Cahun's portraits feature her looking directly at the viewer, with her head shaved, often revealing only her head and shoulders (eliminating the body from view), and a blurring of gender indicators and behaviors which serve to undermine the patriarchal gaze.\n\nHer published writings include \"Heroines,\" (1925) a series of monologues based upon female fairy tale characters and intertwining them with witty comparisons to the contemporary image of women; \"Aveux non avenus\", (Carrefour, 1930) a book of essays and recorded dreams illustrated with photomontages; and several essays in magazines and journals.\n\nIn 1932 she joined the Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires, where she met André Breton and René Crevel. Following this, she started associating with the surrealist group, and later participated in a number of surrealist exhibitions, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition (New Burlington Gallery) and Exposition surréaliste d'Objets (Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris), both in 1936. Cahun's photograph of Sheila Legge standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square with her head obscured by a flower arrangement with pigeons perching on her outstretched arms from the London exhibition, appeared in numerous newspapers and later reproduced in a number of books. In 1934, they published a short polemic essay, \"Les Paris sont Ouverts\", and in 1935 took part in the founding of the left-wing anti-fascist alliance \"Contre Attaque\", alongside André Breton and Georges Bataille. Breton called Cahun \"one of the most curious spirits of our time.\"\n\nIn 1994 the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London held an exhibition of Cahun's photographic self-portraits from 1927–47, alongside the work of two young contemporary British artists, Virginia Nimarkoh and Tacita Dean, entitled Mise en Scene. In the surrealist self-portraits, Cahun represented themself as an androgyne, nymph, model, and soldier.\n\nIn 2007, David Bowie created a multi-media exhibition of Cahun’s work in the gardens of the General Theological Seminary in New York. It was part of a venue called the Highline Festival, which also included offerings by Air, Laurie Anderson, Mike Garson and Ricky Gervais. Bowie said of Cahun:\n\"You could call her transgressive or you could call her a cross dressing Man Ray with surrealist tendencies. I find this work really quite mad, in the nicest way.Outside of France and now the UK she has not had the kind of recognition that, as a founding follower, friend and worker of the original surrealist movement, she surely deserves. Meret Oppenheim was not the only one with a short haircut.\" \n\"Nothing could better do this, I thought, than to show her photographs through the digital technology of the 21st century and in a setting that embraces the pastoral sanctuary of her last years.\"\n\nCahun’s work was often a collaboration with Marcel Moore. Cahun and Moore collaborated frequently, though this often goes unrecognized. It is believed that Moore was often the person standing behind the camera during Cahun's portrait shoots and was an equal partner in their collages.\n\nWith the majority of the photographs attributed to Cahun coming from a personal collection, not one meant for public display, it has been proposed that these personal photographs allowed for Cahun to experiment with gender presentation and the role of the viewer to a greater degree.\n\nIn 1937 Cahun and Moore settled in Jersey. Following the fall of France and the German occupation of Jersey and the other Channel Islands, they became active as resistance workers and propagandists. Fervently against war, the two worked extensively in producing anti-German fliers. Many were snippets from English-to-German translations of BBC reports on the Nazis' crimes and insolence, which were pasted together to create rhythmic poems and harsh criticism. The couple then dressed up and attended many German military events in Jersey, strategically placing them in soldier's pockets, on their chairs, and in cigarette boxes for soldiers to find. Additionally, they inconspicuously crumpled up and threw their fliers into cars and windows. In many ways, Cahun and Moore's resistance efforts were not only political but artistic actions, using their creative talents to manipulate and undermine the authority which they despised. In many ways, Cahun's life's work was focused on undermining a certain authority; however, their activism posed a threat to their physical safety.\n\nIn 1944, Cahun and Moore were arrested and sentenced to death, but the sentence was never carried out as the island was liberated from German occupation in 1945. However, Cahun's health never recovered from her treatment in jail, and she died in 1954. She is buried in St Brelade's Church with her lover Marcel Moore.\n\nCahun made work for herself and did not want to be famous. It wasn't until 40 years after her death that Cahun's work became recognized. In many ways, Cahun's life was marked by a sense of role reversal, and like many early lesbian pioneers, her public identity became a commentary upon the public's notions of sexuality, gender, beauty, and logic. Her adoption of a sexually ambiguous name and her androgynous self-portraits display a revolutionary way of thinking and creating, experimenting with the audience's understanding of photography as a documentation of reality. Her poetry challenged gender roles and attacked the increasingly modern world's social and economic boundaries. Also, Cahun's participation in the Parisian Surrealist movement diversified the group's artwork and ushered in new representations. Where most Surrealist artists were men, and their primary images were of women depicted as isolated symbols of eroticism, Cahun epitomized the chameleonic and various possibilities of genders and of the body. Her photographs, writings, and general life as an artistic and political revolutionary continue to influence artists.\n\nCahun's collected writings were published in 2002 as \"Claude Cahun – Écrits\" (), edited by François Leperlier.\n\nIn 2018, a street of Paris took the name of \"Allée Claude Cahun - Marcel Moore\" (area of Saint-Germain-des-Prés - Montparnasse, near the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Lucie and Suzanne lived).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in 2018, 'Never Anyone But You' a novel by Rupert Thomson, was based on the life of Cahun and Moore and was favourably reviewed by Adam Mars-Jones in the London Review of Books.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "924975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=924975", "title": "Cleyera japonica", "text": "Cleyera japonica\n\nCleyera japonica (sakaki) is a flowering evergreen tree native to warm areas of Japan, Taiwan, China, Myanmar, Nepal, and northern India (Min and Bartholomew 2015). It can reach a height of 10 m. The leaves are 6–10 cm long, smooth, oval, leathery, shiny and dark green above, yellowish-green below, with deep furrows for the leaf stem. The bark is dark reddish brown and smooth. The small, scented, cream-white flowers open in early summer, and are followed later by berries which start red and turn black when ripe. Sakaki is one of the common trees in the second layer of the evergreen oak forests. It is considered sacred to Japanese Shintō faith, and is one of the classical offerings at Shintō shrines.\n\nSakaki wood is used for making utensils (especially combs), building materials, and fuel. It is commonly planted in gardens, parks, and shrines.\n\nSakaki is considered a sacred tree in the Shinto religion, along with other evergreens such as and . Shinto shrines are traditionally encircled with . In Shinto ritual offerings to the , branches of sakaki are decorated with paper streamers (\"shide\") to make \"tamagushi\".\n\nThe Japanese word \"sakaki\" is written with the kanji character , which combines (\"ki\", \"tree; wood\") and (\"kami\", \"spirit; god\") to form the meaning \"sacred tree; divine tree\". The lexicographer Michael Carr notes:\n\nIn modern Japanese, \"sakaki\" is written with a doubly exceptional logograph. It is an ideograph (in the proper sense of 'logograph representing an idea' rather than loosely 'Chinese character; logograph') and is a \"kokuji\" 'Japanese [not Chinese] logograph.' Ideograms and \"kokuji\" are two of the rarest logographic types, each constituting a small percentage of a typical written Japanese sample. First, the idea of \"sakaki\" is expressed with a melding of \"boku\" or \"ki\" 'tree' and \"shin\" or \"kami\" 'god; divine, sacred' [of \"Shinto\" ]; comparable to a graphic fusion of the word \"shinboku\" 'sacred tree.' Second, the \"sakaki\" ideograph is a \"kokuji\" 'national [i.e., Japanese] logograph' rather than a usual \"kanji\" 'Chinese logograph' borrowing. \"Kokuji\" often denote Japanese plants and animals not native to China, and thus not normally written with Chinese logographs. (1995:11) \n\nThe kanji first appears in the (12th-century) \"Konjaku Monogatarishū\", but two 8th-century transcriptions of the word \"sakaki\" are , meaning \"sage tree\" (\"Kojiki\", tr. Chamberlain 1981:64 \"pulling up by pulling its roots a true \"cleyera japonica\" with five hundred [branches] from the Heavenly Mount Kagu\"), and , meaning \"slope tree\" (\"Nihon Shoki\", tr. Aston 1896:42–43, \"True Sakaki tree of the Heavenly Mt. Kagu\"). \"Sakaki\" ( or ) is the title of Chapter 10 in \"The Tale of Genji\" (ca. 1021). It comes from this context.\n\n\"May I at least come up to the veranda?\" he asked, starting up the stairs. The evening moon burst forth and the figure she saw in its light was handsome beyond describing. Not wishing to apologize for all the weeks of neglect, he pushed a branch of the sacred tree in under the blinds. \"With heart unchanging as this evergreen, This sacred tree, I enter the sacred gate.\" She replied: \"You err with your sacred tree and sacred gate. No beckoning cedars stand before my house.\" And he: \"Thinking to find you here with the holy maidens, I followed the scent of the leaf of the sacred tree.\" Though the scene did not encourage familiarity, he made bold to lean inside the blinds. (tr. Seidensticker 1976:187) \n\nThe etymology of the pronunciation \"sakaki\" is uncertain. With linguistic consensus that the \"-ki\" suffix denotes (\"tree\"), the two most probable etymologies are either \"sakae-ki\" (\"evergreen tree\"), from ; or \"saka-ki\" (\"boundary tree\"), from – an older form of modern reading \"sakai\", from the way that trees were often planted at a shrine's boundary line. Carr (1995:13) cites Japanese tradition and historical phonology to support the latter etymon. The Shogakukan \"Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary\" entry for this term also notes that the pitch accent for \"sakayu\" () – the origin of modern \"sakae\" () – is different than what would be expected, suggesting that may be the more likely derivation (Shogakukan 1988).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4535498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4535498", "title": "David Berkowitz", "text": "David Berkowitz\n\nDavid Richard Berkowitz (born Richard David Falco, June 1, 1953), known also as the Son of Sam and the .44 Caliber Killer, is an American serial killer who pleaded guilty to eight separate shooting attacks that began in New York City during the summer of 1976. The crimes were perpetrated with a .44 caliber Bulldog revolver. He killed six people and wounded seven others by July 1977. As the number of victims increased, Berkowitz eluded the biggest police manhunt in the history of New York City while leaving letters that mocked the police and promised further crimes, which were highly publicized by the press. The killing spree terrorized New Yorkers and achieved worldwide notoriety.\n\nOn the night of August 10, 1977, Berkowitz was taken into custody by New York City police homicide detectives in front of his Yonkers apartment building, and he was subsequently indicted for eight shooting incidents. He confessed to all of them, and initially claimed to have been obeying the orders of a demon, manifested in the form of a dog, \"Harvey\", who belonged to his neighbor \"Sam\". Despite his explanation, Berkowitz was found mentally competent to stand trial. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was incarcerated in state prison. He subsequently admitted the dog-and-devil story was a hoax. In the course of further police investigations, Berkowitz was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the city.\n\nIntense coverage of the case by the media lent a kind of celebrity status to Berkowitz, and some observers noted that he seemed to enjoy it. In response, the New York State legislature enacted new legal statutes, known popularly as \"Son of Sam laws\", designed to keep criminals from profiting financially from the publicity created by their crimes. Despite various amendments and legal challenges, the statutes have remained law in New York, and similar laws have been enacted in several other states.\n\nBerkowitz has been incarcerated since his arrest and is serving six consecutive life sentences. During the mid-1990s, he amended his confession to claim that he had been a member of a violent Satanic cult that orchestrated the incidents as ritual murder. He remains the only person ever charged with the shootings. Although some law enforcement authorities have questioned whether Berkowitz's claims are credible, a new investigation of the murders began in 1996, but was suspended indefinitely after inconclusive findings.\n\nBerkowitz's mother, Elizabeth \"Betty\" Broder, grew up as part of an impoverished Jewish family and married Tony Falco, an Italian-American, in 1936. After a marriage of less than four years, Falco left her for another woman. About a decade later in 1950, Broder started a relationship with a married man named Joseph Klineman. Three years later she became pregnant with a child to whom she chose to give the surname Falco—Richard David Falco was born on June 1, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York. Within a few days of his birth, she gave the child away. Although her reasons for doing so are unknown, later writers have surmised that Klineman threatened to abandon her if she kept the baby and used his name.\n\nThe infant boy was adopted by Pearl and Nathan Berkowitz of the Bronx. The Jewish-American couple were hardware store retailers of modest means, and childless in middle age. They reversed the order of the boy's first and middle names and gave him their own surname, raising young David Richard Berkowitz as their only child.\n\nJournalist John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was \"somewhat troubled\". Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in learning at an early age and became infatuated with petty larceny and starting fires. Neighbors and relatives would recall Berkowitz as difficult, spoiled, and a bully. His adoptive parents consulted at least one psychotherapist due to his misconduct, but his misbehavior never resulted in a legal intervention or serious mention in his school records. Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was fourteen years old, and his home life became strained during later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife.\n\nAt the age of 17 in 1971, he joined the U.S. Army and served in the United States and South Korea. After an honorable discharge in 1974, he located his birth mother, Betty. After a few visits, she disclosed the details of his illegitimate birth. The news greatly disturbed Berkowitz, and he was particularly distraught by the array of reluctant father figures. Forensic anthropologist Elliott Leyton described Berkowitz's discovery of his adoption and illegitimate birth as the \"primary crisis\" of his life, a revelation that shattered his sense of identity. His communication with his birth mother later lapsed, but for a time he remained in communication with his half-sister, Roslyn. He subsequently had several non-professional jobs, and at the time of his arrest he was working as a letter sorter for the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nIn June 1976, a friend from the Army purchased a .44 caliber Bulldog gun for Berkowitz.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, Berkowitz started to commit violent crimes. He bungled the first attempt at murder using a knife, then switched to a handgun and began a lengthy crime spree throughout the New York boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. He sought young female victims. He was purportedly most attracted to women with long, dark, wavy hair. All but one of the crime sites involved two victims; he infamously committed some of his attacks while the women sat with boyfriends in parked cars. He exhibited an enduring enjoyment of his activities, often returning to the scenes of his crimes.\n\nBerkowitz claimed that he committed his first attack on Christmas Eve, 1975, when he used a hunting knife to stab two women. One alleged victim was never identified by police, but the other was teenager Michelle Forman, whose injuries were serious enough for her to be hospitalized. Berkowitz was not suspected of these crimes, and soon afterward he relocated to an apartment in Yonkers, New York, just north of the New York City border.\n\nThe first shooting attributed to the Son of Sam occurred in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx. At about 1:10 a.m. on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's Oldsmobile, discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque. Lauria opened the car door to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, \"Now what is this  ...\" The man produced a pistol from the paper bag that he carried and crouched. He braced one elbow on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter turned and walked away quickly.\n\nValenti survived her injuries and said that she did not recognize the killer. She described him as a white male in his thirties with a fair complexion, about tall and weighing about . His hair was short, dark, and curly in a \"mod style\". This description was repeated by Lauria's father, who claimed to have seen a similar man sitting in a yellow compact car parked nearby. Neighbors gave corroborating reports to police that an unfamiliar yellow compact car had been cruising the area for hours before the shooting.\n\nOn October 23, 1976, a similar shooting occurred in a secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park. Carl Denaro, 20, and Rosemary Keenan, 18, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered. \"I felt the car exploded \", Denaro said later. Keenan quickly started the car and sped away for help. The panicked couple did not realize that someone had been shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull. Neither victim saw the attacker.\n\nPolice determined that the bullets embedded in Keenan's car were .44 caliber, but they were so damaged and deformed that they thought it unlikely that they could ever be linked to a particular weapon.\n\nDenaro had shoulder-length hair, and police later speculated that the shooter had mistaken him for a girl. Keenan's father was a 20-year veteran police detective of the NYPD, causing an intense investigation. As with the Lauria–Valenti shooting, however, there seemed not to be any motive for the shooting, and police made little progress with the case. Many details of the Denaro–Keenan shooting were very similar to the Lauria–Valenti case, but police did not initially associate them, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs and were investigated by different local police precincts.\n\nDonna DeMasi, 16, and Joanne Lomino, 18, walked home from a movie soon after midnight on November 27, 1976. They were chatting on the porch of Lomino's home in Bellerose, Queens, when a man dressed in military fatigues who seemed to be in his early 20s approached them and began to ask directions.\n\nIn a high-pitched voice he said, \"Can you tell me how to get  ...\" but then quickly produced a revolver. He shot each of the victims once and, as they fell to the ground injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. A neighbor heard the gunshots, rushed out of the apartment building, and saw a blond man rush by gripping a pistol in his left hand. DeMasi had been shot in the neck, but the wound was not life-threatening. Lomino was hit in the back and hospitalized in serious condition; she was ultimately rendered a paraplegic.\n\nDuring the early morning of January 30, 1977, Christine Freund, 26, and her fiancé John Diel, 30, were sitting in Diel's car near the Forest Hills LIRR station in Queens, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the movie \"Rocky\". Three gunshots penetrated the car at about 12:40 a.m. In a panic, Diel drove away for help. He suffered minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice and died several hours later at the hospital. Neither victim had seen their attacker(s).\n\nPolice made the first public acknowledgment that the Freund–Diel shooting was similar to earlier incidents, and that the crimes might be associated. All the victims had been struck with .44 caliber bullets, and the shootings seemed to target young women with long, dark hair. NYPD sergeant Richard Conlon stated that police were \"leaning towards a connection in all these cases\". Composite sketches were released of the black-haired Lauria–Valenti shooter and the blond Lomino–DeMasi shooter, and Conlon noted that police were looking for multiple \"suspects\", not just one.\n\nAt about 7:30 p.m. on March 8, 1977, Columbia University student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, was walking home from school when she was confronted by an armed man. She lived about a block from where Christine Freund was shot. In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, but the makeshift shield was penetrated, the bullet striking her head and killing her.\n\nMoments after the shooting, a neighborhood resident who had heard the gunshots was rounding the corner onto Voskerichian's street. He nearly collided with a person whom he described as a short, husky boy, 16 to 18 years old and clean-shaven, wearing a sweater and watch cap, who was sprinting away from the crime scene. The neighbor said that the youth pulled the cap over his face and said, \"Oh, Jesus!\" as he sprinted by. Other neighbors claimed to have seen the \"teenager\", as well as another person matching Berkowitz's description, loitering separately in the area for about an hour before the shooting. During the following days, the media repeated police claims that this \"chubby teenager\" was the suspect. There were no direct witnesses to the Voskerichian murder.\n\nIn a March 10, 1977, press conference, NYPD officials and New York City Mayor Abraham Beame declared that the same .44 Bulldog revolver had fired the shots that killed Lauria and Voskerichian. Official documents were later revealed, however, saying that police strongly suspected that the same .44 Bulldog had been used in the shootings, but that the evidence was actually inconclusive.\n\nThe crimes were discussed by the local media virtually every day. Circulation increased dramatically for the \"New York Post\" and \"Daily News\", newspapers with graphic crime reporting and commentary. Foreign media featured many of the reports as well, including front page articles of newspapers such as the Vatican's \"L'Osservatore Romano\", the Hebrew newspaper \"Maariv\", and the Soviet \"Izvestia\".\n\nAt about 3:00 a.m. on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau, 20, and Valentina Suriani, 18, were sitting in Suriani's car near her home in the Bronx, only a few blocks from the scene of the Lauria–Valenti shooting, when each was shot twice. Suriani died at the scene, and Esau died in the hospital several hours later without being able to describe his attacker(s).\n\nPolice said that the weapon used for the crime was the same as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings. During the days afterwards, they repeated their theory that only one man was responsible for the .44 murders. The chubby teenager in the Voskerichian case was still regarded as a witness, while the dark-haired man who shot Lauria and Valenti was considered the suspect.\n\nPolice discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and Suriani, written mostly in block capitals with a few lower-case letters, and addressed to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli. With this letter, Berkowitz revealed the name \"Son of Sam\" for the first time. The press had previously dubbed the killer \"the .44 Caliber Killer\" because of his weapon of choice. The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press, and the name \"Son of Sam\" quickly replaced the old name.\n\nThe letter expressed the killer's determination to continue his work, and taunted police for their fruitless efforts to capture him. In full, with misspellings intact, the letter read:\n\nAt the time, police speculated that the letter-writer might be familiar with Scottish English. The phrase \"me hoot it urts sonny boy\" was taken as a Scottish-accented version of \"my \"heart\", it \"hurts\", sonny boy\"; and the police also hypothesized that the shooter blamed a dark-haired nurse for his father's death, due to the \"too many heart attacks\" phrase, and the facts that Lauria was a medical technician and Valenti was studying to be a nurse. On July 28, \"New York Daily News\" columnist Jimmy Breslin alluded to the \"wemon\" quirk and referred to the shooter watching the world from \"his attic window\".\n\nThe killer's unusual attitude towards the police and the media received widespread scrutiny. Psychologists observed that many serial killers gain gratification by eluding pursuers and observers. The feeling of control of media, law enforcement, and even entire populations provides a source of social power for them. After consulting with several psychiatrists, police released a psychological profile of their suspect on May 26, 1977. He was described as neurotic and probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and believed himself to be a victim of demonic possession.\n\nOn May 30, 1977, \"Daily News\" columnist Jimmy Breslin received a handwritten letter from someone who claimed to be the .44 caliber shooter. The letter was postmarked early that same day in Englewood, New Jersey. On the reverse of the envelope, neatly handprinted in four precisely centered lines, were the words: \"Blood and Family – Darkness and Death – Absolute Depravity – .44\". The letter inside read:\n\nUnderneath the \"Son of Sam\" was a logo or sketch that combined several symbols. The writer's question \"What will you have for July 29?\" was considered an ominous threat: July 29 would be the anniversary of the first .44 caliber shooting. Breslin notified police, who thought that the letter was probably from someone with knowledge of the shootings. The Breslin letter was sophisticated in its wording and presentation, especially when compared to the crudely written first letter, and police suspected that it might have been created in an art studio or similar professional location by someone with expertise in printing, calligraphy, or graphic design. The unusual writing caused the police to speculate that the killer was a comic letterer, and they asked staff members of DC Comics whether they recognized the lettering. The \"Wicked King Wicker\" reference caused police to arrange a private screening of \"The Wicker Man\", a 1973 horror movie.\n\nThe \"New York Daily News\" published the letter a week later (after agreeing with police to withhold portions of the text) and Breslin urged the killer to surrender himself. The dramatic article made that day's paper the highest-selling edition of the \"Daily News\" to date—more than 1.1 million copies were sold. Police received thousands of tips based on references in the publicized portions of the letter, all of which proved useless. All the shooting victims to date had long dark hair, and thousands of women in New York acquired short cuts or brightly colored dyes, and beauty supply stores had trouble meeting the demand for wigs.\n\nOn June 26, 1977, there was another shooting. Sal Lupo, 20, and Judy Placido, 17, had left the Elephas discotheque in Bayside, Queens, and were sitting in Lupo's parked car at about 3:00 a.m. when three gunshots blasted through the vehicle. Lupo was wounded in the right forearm, while Placido was shot in the right temple, shoulder and back of the neck, but both victims survived their injuries. Lupo told police that the young couple had been discussing the Son of Sam case only moments before the shooting.\n\nNeither Lupo nor Placido had seen their attacker, but two witnesses reported a tall, dark-haired man in a leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave in a car and even supplied a partial license plate number. Another report described a blond man with a mustache who drove from the scene in a Chevy Nova without turning on its headlights. Police speculated that the dark-haired man was the shooter, and that the blond man had observed the crime.\n\n The first anniversary of the initial .44 caliber shootings was approaching, and police established a sizable dragnet that emphasized past hunting grounds in Queens and the Bronx. However, the next and final .44 shooting occurred in Brooklyn.\n\nEarly on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante, both 20, were in Violante's car, which was parked under a streetlight near a city park in the neighborhood of Bath Beach. They were kissing when a man approached within three feet of the passenger side of Violante's car and fired four rounds into the car, striking both victims in the head before he escaped into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, although he lost vision in one eye and retained very limited vision in the other eye.\n\nThe Moskowitz–Violante crime produced more witnesses than any of the other Son of Sam murders; there was one direct eyewitness who was not an intended victim. During the shooting, 19-year-old Tommy Zaino was parked with his date three cars in front of Violante's vehicle. Moments before the shooting, Zaino caught a peripheral glimpse of the shooter's approach and happened to glance in his rear view mirror just in time to see the actual shooting. Zaino clearly saw the perpetrator for several seconds due to the bright street light and full moon and later described him as being 25 to 30 years old, of average height— to —with shaggy hair that was dark blond or light brown. Zaino said that the shooter's hair \"looked like a wig.\"\n\nAbout a minute after the shooting, a woman seated next to her boyfriend in his car on the other side of the city park saw a \"white male [who was wearing] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig\" sprint from the park and enter a \"small, light-colored\" auto, which drove away quickly. \"He looks like he just robbed a bank\", said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's license plate. She was unable to determine the first two characters, but was certain that the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR. Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots, and at least two witnesses who described a yellow Volkswagen driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off. A neighborhood resident given the pseudonym Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violante's calls for help, and glanced from her apartment window to see a man whom she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually \"away\" from the crime scene as many others were rushing \"towards\" the scene to render aid.\n\nSoon after 2:35 a.m., a man who was later given the pseudonym Alan Masters was driving through an intersection a few blocks from the park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle that sped through the intersection without its headlights activated as the driver ignored a red light. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face, dark, long, stringy hair, several days' growth of dark whiskers on his face, and wearing a blue jacket. Masters was upset and he neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought that it might have been a New Jersey rather than a New York plate. Violante encountered a very similar man, because he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before they were shot. Violante described him as a \"grubby-looking hippy\" with whiskers, wiry hair over his forehead, dark eyes, and wearing a denim jacket.\nThomas Scally stated that he was sitting in Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle approached his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close to the site of the Donna DeMasi and Joanne Lomino shootings.\n\nPolice did not learn of the Moskowitz–Violante shooting until about 2:50 a.m., and Dowd did not think that it was another Son of Sam shooting until an officer at the scene reported that large-caliber shells had been used. Police established a series of roadblocks about an hour after the shooting, stopping hundreds of cars to question drivers and inspect vehicles. During interviews, Masters and others described a Volkswagen speeding from the crime scene, and police now suspected that the shooter owned or drove such a vehicle. In subsequent days, police determined that there were more than 900 Volkswagens in New York or New Jersey, and they made plans to trace each of these cars and their owners. Detective John Falotico was awakened at home and told to report to the 10th Homicide Division at the 60th Precinct station house in Coney Island. He was told that Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante had been shot. Falotico was given two weeks to work on the case as a normal murder investigation; it was then given to a special Son of Sam task force.\n\nLocal resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz and Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car that was parked near a fire hydrant. Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car, and he seemed to study her with some interest. Davis felt concerned because he was wielding in his hand some kind of \"dark object\". She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street. Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night.\n\nBerkowitz's 1970 four-door yellow Ford Galaxie was among the cars that they investigated. On August 9, 1977, NYPD detective James Justis telephoned Yonkers police to ask them to schedule an interview with Berkowitz. The Yonkers police dispatcher who first took Justis' call was Wheat Carr, the daughter of Sam Carr and sister of Berkowitz's alleged cult confederates John and Michael Carr.\n\nJustis asked the Yonkers police for some help tracking down Berkowitz. According to Mike Novotny—a sergeant at the Yonkers Police Department—the Yonkers police had their own suspicions about Berkowitz in connection with other strange crimes in Yonkers, crimes that they saw referred to in one of the Son of Sam letters. To the shock of the NYPD, they told the New York City detective that Berkowitz might just be the Son of Sam.\n\nThe next day, August 10, 1977, police investigated Berkowitz's car that was parked on the street outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. They saw a rifle in the back seat, searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Omega Task Force. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment, rather than risk a violent encounter in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried that their search might be challenged in court. The initial search of the vehicle was based on the rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00 p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico pointed his gun close to Berkowitz's temple, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side.\n\nA paper bag containing a .44-caliber Bulldog revolver of the type that was identified in ballistics tests was found next to Berkowitz in the car. As described in \"Son of Sam\" (1981) by Lawrence D. Klausner, Detective Falotico remembered the big, inexplicable smile on the man's face:\n\nAn alternate version claimed that Berkowitz' first words were reported to be, \"Well, you got me. How come it took you such a long time?\" Detective John Falotico was officially credited by the New York City Police Department as the arresting officer of the Son of Sam.\n\nPolice searched Apartment 7-E and found it in disarray, with Satanic graffiti on the walls. They also found diaries that he had kept since he was 21 years old—three stenographer's notebooks nearly all full wherein Berkowitz meticulously noted hundreds of arsons that he claimed to have set throughout New York City. Some sources allege that this number might be over 1,400. Soon after Berkowitz's arrest, the address of the building was changed from 35 Pine Street to 42 Pine Street in an attempt to end its notoriety. After the arrest, Berkowitz was briefly held in a Yonkers police station before being transported directly to the 60th Precinct in Coney Island, where the detectives' task force was located. At about 1:00 a.m., Mayor Abraham Beame arrived to see the suspect personally. After a brief and wordless encounter, he announced to the media: \"The people of the City of New York can rest easy because of the fact that the police have captured a man whom they believe to be the Son of Sam.\"\n\nBerkowitz was interrogated for about thirty minutes in the early morning of August 11, 1977. He quickly confessed to the shootings and expressed an interest in pleading guilty. During questioning, Berkowitz claimed that his neighbor's dog was one of the reasons that he killed, stating that the dog demanded the blood of pretty young girls. He said that the \"Sam\" mentioned in the first letter was his former neighbor Sam Carr. Berkowitz claimed that Carr's black labrador retriever Harvey was possessed by an ancient demon and that it issued irresistible commands that Berkowitz must kill people.\n\nA few weeks after his arrest and confession, Berkowitz was permitted to communicate with the press. In a letter to the \"New York Post\" dated September 19, 1977, Berkowitz alluded to his original story of demonic possession but closed with a warning that has been interpreted by some investigators as an admission of criminal accomplices: \"There are other Sons out there, God help the world.\"\n\nThree separate mental health examinations determined that Berkowitz was competent to stand trial. Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but Berkowitz refused. He appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings.\n\nAt his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom. After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted \"Stacy was a whore\" and shouted \"I'd kill her again. I'd kill them all again.\" The court ordered another psychiatric examination before sentencing could proceed. During the evaluation, Berkowitz drew a sketch of a jailed man surrounded by numerous walls; at the bottom he wrote, \"I am not well. Not well at all\". Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial.\n\nOn June 12, 1978, Berkowitz was sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison for each murder, to be served consecutively. He was ordered to serve time in Attica Correctional Facility, an Upstate New York supermax prison. Despite prosecutors' objections, the terms of Berkowitz's guilty plea made him eligible for parole in 25 years.\n\nBerkowitz declared at a press conference during February 1979 that his previous claims of demonic possession were a hoax. Berkowitz stated in a series of meetings with his special court-appointed psychiatrist David Abrahamsen that he had long contemplated murder to get revenge at a world that he felt had rejected and hurt him.\n\nAfter his arrest, Berkowitz was initially confined to a psychiatric ward in Kings County Hospital where the staff reported that he seemed remarkably untroubled by his new environment. On the day after his sentencing, he was taken first to Sing Sing prison and then to the upstate Clinton Correctional Facility for psychiatric and physical examinations. Two more months were spent at the Central New York Psychiatric Center in Marcy before his admission to Attica prison. Berkowitz served about a decade in Attica until he was relocated (c. 1990) to Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, New York, where he remained for many years until he was transferred to Shawangunk Correctional Facility. Berkowitz described life in Attica as a \"nightmare\". In 1979, there was an attempt on Berkowitz's life in which the left side of his neck was slashed from front to back, resulting in a wound that required more than fifty stitches to close. Berkowitz refused to identify his assailant, and he only claimed that he was grateful for the attack—it brought a sense of justice or, in Berkowitz's own words, \"the punishment I deserve\".\n\nIn 1987, Berkowitz became an evangelical Christian in prison. According to his personal testimony, his moment of conversion occurred after reading Psalm 34:6 from a Bible given to him by a fellow inmate. He says he is no longer to be referred to as the \"Son of Sam\" but the \"Son of Hope\".\n\nBefore his first parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz sent a letter to New York Governor George Pataki asking that it be canceled. He wrote, \"In all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life. I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my situation and I have accepted my punishment.\" Officials at the Sullivan facility duly rejected his case.\n\nBerkowitz is entitled to a parole hearing every two years as mandated by state law, but he has consistently refused to ask for his release, sometimes skipping the hearings altogether. In his 2016 hearing at Shawangunk, Berkowitz stated that while parole was \"unrealistic,\" he felt he had improved himself behind bars, adding: \"I feel I am no risk, whatsoever.\" His lawyer, Mark Heller, noted that prison staff considered Berkowitz to be a \"model prisoner,\" but commissioners once again denied a parole.\n\nSoon after his imprisonment, Berkowitz invited Malachi Martin, an exorcist, to help him compose an autobiography, but the offer was not accepted. During later years, Berkowitz developed his memoirs with assistance from evangelical Christians. His statements were released as an interview video, \"Son of Hope\", during 1998, with a more extensive work released in book form, entitled \"Son of Hope: The Prison Journals of David Berkowitz\" (2006). Berkowitz does not receive any royalties or profit from any sales of his works. He has continued to write essays on faith and repentance for Christian websites. His own official website is maintained on his behalf by a church group, since he is not allowed access to a computer. Berkowitz stays involved with prison ministry, and regularly counsels troubled inmates. While in the Sullivan facility, he pursued education and graduated with honors from Sullivan Community College.\n\nIn 2002, during the D.C. sniper attacks, Berkowitz wrote a letter telling the sniper to \"stop hurting innocent people.\" Berkowitz made his comments in a three-page letter to Rita Cosby, senior Chicago correspondent for Fox News Channel, after Cosby wrote him seeking his comment on the sniper attacks.\n\nDuring June 2005, Berkowitz sued one of his previous lawyers for the misappropriation of a large number of letters, photographs, and other personal possessions. Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the \"National Enquirer\" from buying one of his letters. Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia—\"Dear David\" (2005)—which he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations. Berkowitz stated that he would only drop the lawsuit if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families. In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State Crime Victims Board.\n\nIn 1979, Berkowitz mailed a book about witchcraft to police in North Dakota. He had underlined several passages and written a few marginal notes, including the phrase: \"Arliss [sic] Perry, Hunted, Stalked and Slain. Followed to Calif. Stanford University.\" The reference was to Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old North Dakota newlywed who had been murdered at Stanford on October 12, 1974. Her death, and the notorious abuse of her corpse in a Christian chapel on campus, was a widely reported case. Berkowitz mentioned the Perry attack in other letters, suggesting that he knew details of it from the perpetrator himself. Local police investigators interviewed him but they \"now [2004] believe he has nothing of value to offer\". The Arlis Perry case has since been solved.\n\nAfter his admission to Sullivan prison, Berkowitz began to claim that he had joined a Satanic cult in the spring of 1975. In 1993, Berkowitz made these claims known when he announced to the press that he had only killed three of the Son of Sam victims: Donna Lauria, Alexander Esau and Valentina Suriani. In his revised version of the events, Berkowitz said that other shooters were involved and that he fired the gun only in the first attack (Lauria and Valenti) and the sixth (Esau and Suriani). He said that he and several other cult members were involved in every incident by planning the events, providing early surveillance of the victims, and acting as lookouts and drivers at the crime scenes. Berkowitz stated that he could not divulge the names of most of his accomplices without putting his family directly at risk.\n\nAmong Berkowitz's alleged unnamed associates was a female cult member whom he claims fired the gun at Denaro and Keenan, both of whom survived, Berkowitz said, because the alleged accomplice was unfamiliar with the powerful recoil of a .44 Bulldog. Berkowitz declared that \"at least five\" cult members were at the scene of the Freund–Diel shooting, but the actual shooter was a prominent cult associate who had been brought in from outside New York with an unspecified motive—a cult member whom he identified only by his nickname, \"Manson II\". Another unnamed person was the gunman in the Moskowitz–Violante case, a male cult member who had arrived from North Dakota for the occasion, also without explanation.\n\nBerkowitz did name two of the cult members: John and Michael Carr. The two men were sons of the dog-owner Sam Carr and they lived on nearby Warburton Avenue. Both of these other \"sons of Sam\" were long dead: John Carr had been killed by a shooting judged a suicide in North Dakota during 1978, and Michael Carr had been in a fatal car accident in 1979. Berkowitz claimed that the actual perpetrator of the DeMasi–Lomino shooting was John Carr, and he added that a Yonkers police officer, also a cult member, was involved in this crime. He claimed that Michael Carr fired the shots at Lupo and Placido.\n\nJournalist John Hockenberry asserts that, even aside from the Satanic cult claims, many officials doubted the single-shooter theory, writing, \"what most don't know about the Son of Sam case is that from the beginning, not everyone bought the idea that Berkowitz acted alone.\" John Santucci, Queens District Attorney at the time of the killings, and police investigator Mike Novotny both expressed their convictions that Berkowitz had accomplices. NYPD officer Richard Johnson, involved in the original investigations, has opined that unresolved discrepancies in statements from witnesses and surviving victims indicate Berkowitz did not act alone: \"Why are there three [suspect] cars, five different [suspect] descriptions, different heights, different shapes, different sizes of the perpetrator? Somebody else was there.\" \n\nOther contemporaries have voiced their belief in the Satanic cult theory including Donna Lauria's father, and Carl Denaro who stated his opinion that \"more than one person was involved\" but admitted he could not prove the cult theory. Denaro's conclusion rests on his criticism of Berkowitz's statement to police as \"totally false\". John Diel's recollection is that he physically bumped into Berkowitz outside the Wine Gallery restaurant as he and Christine Freund departed and walked to his car where the shooting occurred; Berkowitz, in contrast, told police that he passed within a few feet of Diel and Freund shortly before they entered the car. Diel contends he and Freund passed no one on their way to the car and further that the placement of the car parked at the curb would have made it impossible for Berkowitz to have sneaked up on them in the few minutes between their encounter outside the restaurant and the shooting at the car. Diel thus reasons he was shot by someone other than Berkowitz.\n\nHockenberry's own report was broadcast by network news and given much exposure by \"Dateline NBC\" (2004). In it, he discusses another journalist, Maury Terry, who had begun investigating the Son of Sam shootings before Berkowitz was arrested. Terry published a series of investigative articles in the Gannett newspapers in 1979 which challenged the official explanation of a lone gunman.\n\nVigorously denied by police at the time, Terry's articles were widely read and discussed; they were later assembled in book form as \"The Ultimate Evil\" (1987; expanded second edition 1999). Largely impelled by these reports of accomplices and Satanic cult activity, the Son of Sam case was reopened by Yonkers police during 1996, but no new charges were filed. Due to a lack of findings, the investigation was eventually suspended but remains open.\n\nFrom prison Berkowitz continues to assert and expand upon his claims of demonic possession. He stated in a series of nine videos in 2015 that the \"voice\" he heard was that of Samhain, a druid devil and the true origin of \"Son of Sam\". He added that it never was a dog, saying that detail was fabricated by the media. \n\nBerkowitz's later claims are dismissed by many. Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that \"when they talked to David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything step by step by step. The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it. He's the guy and there's nothing else to look at.\"\n\nSkeptics include a former FBI profiler, John E. Douglas, who spent hours interviewing Berkowitz. He states that he was convinced Berkowitz acted alone and was an \"introverted loner, not capable of being involved in group activity\". Dr. Harvey Schlossberg, a NYPD psychologist, states in \"Against The Law\", a documentary about the Son of Sam case, that he believes that the Satanic cult claims are nothing but a fantasy concocted by Berkowitz to absolve himself of the crimes. In his book \"Hunting Humans\" (2001), Elliott Leyton argued that \"recent journalistic attempts to abridge—or even deny—Berkowitz's guilt have lacked all credibility.\"\n\nDecades after his arrest, the name \"Son of Sam\" remains widely recognized as that of a notorious serial killer. Many manifestations in popular culture have helped perpetuate this notoriety, while Berkowitz himself continues to express remorse on Christian websites.\n\nNeysa Moskowitz, who previously had not hidden her hatred of Berkowitz, wrote him a letter shortly before her own death in 2006, forgiving him for killing her daughter, Stacy.\n\nAfter rampant speculation about publishers offering Berkowitz large sums of money for his story, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed a new law that prevented convicted criminals (and their relatives) from making any financial profit from books, movies, or other enterprises related to the stories of their crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the so-called \"Son of Sam law\" for violating the First Amendment's right of free expression in the 1991 case of Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Crime Victims Board, but New York produced a constitutionally revised version of the law in the following year. Similar laws have since been enacted in 41 states and at the federal level.\n\nJimmy Breslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published a novelized account of the murders, \".44\" (1978), less than a year after Berkowitz's arrest. The highly fictionalized plot recounts the exploits of a Berkowitz-based character dubbed \"Bernard Rosenfeld\". Outside of North America, the book was renamed \"Son of Sam\". The 2016 young adult novel \"Burn Baby Burn\" by Meg Medina is set in New York during 1977, and depicts how fear of being one of the Son of Sam victims affected the daily lives of people.\n\nThe Spike Lee drama \"Summer of Sam\" was released in 1999 with actor Michael Badalucco in the role of Son of Sam. The film depicts the tensions that develop in a Bronx neighborhood during the shootings, and Berkowitz's part is largely symbolic. A minor character in the script, he functions \"mostly as a berserk metaphor for Lee's view of the seventies as a period of amoral excess\". Berkowitz was reported to be disturbed by what he called exploitation of \"the ugliness of the past\". Other movie portrayals of Berkowitz include the Ulli Lommel DVD release \"Son of Sam\" (2008) and the CBS television movie \"Out of the Darkness\" (1985). The character of Son of Sam played a significant minor role in the miniseries \"The Bronx Is Burning\" (2007).\n\nSon of Sam has been popularly (and mistakenly) associated with the contemporaneous song \"Psycho Killer\" (1977) by Talking Heads. Compositions more directly inspired by the events include \"Son of Sam\" (1978) by The Dead Boys, \"Son of Sam\" by Chain Gang, and \"Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun\" (1989) by the Beastie Boys. Guitarist Scott Putesky used the stage name \"Daisy Berkowitz\" while playing with Marilyn Manson in the 1990s, and the band's song \"Son of Man\" conspicuously describes Berkowitz; several other rock musicians established a full ensemble named Son of Sam during 2000. A cartoon composite of Berkowitz and the breakfast cereal icon Toucan Sam was featured in Green Jellÿ's comedy rock video \"Cereal Killer\" (1992) by the name of \"Toucan Son of Sam\", but it was later removed under threat of a copyright lawsuit by the Kellogg Company.\n\nSon of Sam has also been mentioned in hit Netflix show 'Jessica Jones'(2015). It was mentioned in Season one episode three in relation to Hope Shlottman.\n\n"}

May 1, 1948 Moscow) was a Ukrainian-born Russian painter and graphic artist.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family in Zhitomir, Ukraine, Shterenberg studied art in Odessa and then from 1906-1912 based himself in Paris where he studied with, amongst others, Kees van Dongen.\nHe studied at the Académie Vitti in Paris.\nHe was influenced by the works of Paul Cézanne and by Cubism. \n\nHe made return visits to Russia but did not settle there until after the Revolution of 1917, when he was supported by his acquaintance Lunacharsky, who was the People's Commissar responsible for culture. He attended the \"Conference of Authors, Artists and Directors\" on cooperation with the Soviet Government at the Smolny Palace in Petrograd (St.Petersburg) with Nathan Altman and others . In 1917 -1918 he was a Commissar for Artistic Matters. In 1918 he had an exhibition with the group \"Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts\" together with Baranoff-Rossine, Altman, and Lissitzky, in Moscow. From 1918 to 1920 he was the Head of the Department of Fine Arts (IZO) of the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (NARKOMPROS). In 1918 he published his programmatic essay \"Tasks of Contemporary Art\" in the News of the Petrograd Council. \n\nIn 1920 Shterenberg was the Director of the Department of Fine Arts (IZO) at the People's Commissariat for Education. In this rile he organised the funding of the Moscow based Institute of Artistic Culture (INKhUK). He explained that \"We organised the INKhUK as a cell for the determination of scientific hypotheses on matters of art\".\n\nFrom 1920 to 1930 Shterenberg taught at the VKhUTEMAS. He showed at an exhibition of Jewish artists in Moscow in 1922 which also featured Marc Chagall. In the same year he wrote an essay for the catalogue of the \"First Russian Art Exhibition\" at the Gallery van Diemen, in Berlin. However his independent style ceased to find favour with the Soviet authorities and gradually his work was withdrawn from public view. After the 1930s he was forced to work in a more 'realistic' style. By his death in 1948 he was virtually forgotten. He is buried in Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow.\nShterenberg was deeply conscious of his Jewish roots. He wrote to his wife Nadezhda: 'I have an Oriental blood in my veins, blood of my forebears who wrote the 'Song of Songs', - and there's no better song.''\n\nToday his work is on view in public galleries in Moscow (Tretyakov Gallery and Pushkin Museum), St. Petersburg (Russian Museum) and Ekaterinburg. Much is still held in private collections in Russia.\n\n\n"}

This was intended to emphasise the fact that Catholics gathered together to witness and participate in an action (i.e. the sacramental renewal of the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary) rather than merely participate in common prayer which was a hallmark of the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The introduction of bilingual hand Missals (Latin-vernacular) occurred in Germany in the 19th century in defiance of Church law which required the liturgical texts to be reproduced exclusively in Latin. Later given authorisation, they allowed the laity to quietly follow the Mass (\"Pray the Mass\") rather than the traditional practice of saying private prayers as the priest celebrated. The subsequent step was the people actually saying the Latin responses of the Mass called the Dialogue Mass.\n\nIn 1922, the Holy See gave approval to the practice whereby \"at least in religious houses and institutions for youth, all people assisting at the Mass make the responses at the same time with the acolytes\", a practice that it declared praiseworthy in view of the evident desire expressed in papal documents \"to instil into the souls of the faithful a truly Christian and collective spirit, and prepare them for active participation.\" The practice was already established without authorisation in Belgium and in Germany before the First World War. Further approval was granted in 1935 and 1958. However, the Dialogue Mass was not obligatory and there were conflicting statements about the practice from the Vatican. The Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 1922, shortly after the incipient Dialogue Mass, replied to the question \"May the congregation, assisting at the Sacrifice make the responses in unison, instead of the server?\" by saying: \"The norm is: Things that in themselves are licit are not always expedient. Owing to the difficulties which may easily arise, as in this case, especially on account of the disturbances which the priests who celebrate and the people who assist may experience, to the disadvantage of the sacred Action and of the rubrics. Hence it is expedient to retain the common usage, as we have several times replied in similar cases.\" \n\nThe Dialogue Mass never became prevalent in English-speaking countries and current celebrations of Tridentine Mass in these countries are in practice rarely structured as a Dialogue Mass. In other countries, however, such as France, and Germany, the Dialogue Mass met with a greater acceptance as the Church hierarchies of these countries in the 1940s and 1950s tended to be more progressive than the generally traditionally-minded bishops in English-speaking lands as became evident during the Second Vatican Council. A number of Tridentine Masses currently celebrated in these countries use the Dialogue Mass form.\n\nThe minimum form of Dialogue Mass introduced in 1922 allowed the people to join with the servers in reciting the responses in the Ordinary of the Mass. In addition, the people were allowed to recite those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass that are sung by all at a Missa Cantata, the Gloria, Creed, Sanctus and Agnus Dei, and to recite with the priest the triple \"Domine non sum dignus\" that he said as part of the rite of Communion of the faithful. Rarely, the people were also allowed to recite the Introit, Offertory and Communion Antiphons sung by the choir at a Solemn or High Mass. The form to be used in a particular diocese was left to the discretion of the bishop.\n\n\n"}

In 1426 a Faculty of Canon Law was added, and at that time both Law Faculties functioned together in one \"Collegium utriusque iuris\".\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, a \"studium generale\" was often rounded out after a short time with the foundation of a Faculty of Theology. After repeated requests from the municipal government, from the Duke of Brabant and from Philip the Good, the university received permission to grant theological degrees from Pope Eugene IV on 7 March 1432.\nProfessors for the new faculty were first recruited from already existing theological faculties, particularly those of the University of Paris and the University of Cologne. Instruction in the old faculty of theology was thus closely based on the theological developments of these sister faculties. Students wishing to earn the degree of \"Sacrae Theologiae Licentiatus\" were taught and required to comment upon the Scriptures and Peter Lombard’s Book of Sentences, and they took part in disputations that were a typical part of medieval university education. The most famous theologian from the 15th century faculty was Adrian Floriszoon of Utrecht. He taught in Leuven from 1491 to 1515 and later became Pope Adrian VI.\n\nThroughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Adrian’s successors made a name for themselves by resourcing theology through a renewed study of Augustine. The Leuven Faculty and its magisters anticipated several of the theological trends that emerged in their time. An example of this is seen in Jacobus Latomus’s \"De trium linguarum et studii theologici ratione dialogus\", which was published in 1519 as a response to the challenge posed by the work of Desiderius Erasmus, who was active at the \"Collegium Trilingue\" in Leuven. Later theologians such as Johannes Driedo also strongly opposed Erasmian thought, saying it was a contemporary brand of Pelagianism. At the same time, the faculty also opposed Martin Luther’s thought, by refuting his early writings in a censure published on 7 November 1519. Ruard Tapper, another Leuven theologian, led the controversy by drawing up a summary of the Catholic position in 59 articles, later reduced to 39 articles.\n\nOn top of this, Leuven's Theological Faculty also played an active role during the Council of Trent. Among the delegates to the Council were several of its professors, including theologians like Tapper, Johannes Hesselius, and Michael Baius. In addition, Johannes Driedo’s works were influential and circulated among the Tridentine Council Fathers.\n\nIn 1546 two Royal Chairs were granted to the faculty by Charles V, in addition to the five already existing chairs. One of these new chairs was dedicated to the study of Scripture. A characteristic of this period was the transition the Leuven faculty made from a scholastic theology to a more positive theology based on Scripture and the Church Fathers. A specific brand of Leuven Augustinianism developed in this context, and characterized the faculty and its theology throughout the eighteenth century, thus allowing the faculty to procure its own position within the Counter-Reformation. Here the faculty set the tone by publishing an Index of Forbidden Books (1546, reworked in 1550). This Index was the first of its kind and served as a model for the later Roman \"Index librorum prohibitorum\" published in 1559 by Pope Paul IV.\n\nIn 1547 the faculty published a new version of the Vulgate, which was submitted to better revisions. This new translation was used by the committee charged with preparing an official edition of the Vulgate in the seventeenth century under the authority of Pope Paul V. The faculty’s growing scientific specialization was manifest in the publishing of two major works: the six language \"Biblia Polyglotta\" (1568–1572) and a new edition of the complete works of Augustine, supervised by Johannes Molanus (1576–1577) and published by Christoffel Plantijn (publisher of the Polyglot Bible, which is in exposition at the Plantijn-Moretus Museum in Antwerp).\n\nThe emphasis on Augustinus in theology took its most extreme form in Leuven in the teaching of Michael Baius. This theology focused on Augustine's thought regarding grace and creation, and it produced an extremely negative view of humanity in its fallen state. In this respect, Baius shared Reformation ideas, while flatly opposing the idea of sacramental restoration of humanity from this state. Baius’ work was condemned by the theological faculties in Salamanca (1565) and Alcalá (1567), and 97 of his theses were thereafter condemned by Pope Pius V in the bull \"Ex omnibus afflictionibus\" on 1 October 1567. A new condemnation was given in 1580 by Pope Gregory XIII in his papal bull \"Provisionis Nostrae\". Baius’ work was also later contested by Jesuit theologians such as Leonardus Lessius and Robert Bellarmine. However, despite all of this opposition against Baianism, the Leuven professor regius became Inquisitor General. Later, in the twentieth century, theologians such as Henri de Lubac – in his famous book \"Surnaturel\" of 1946 – revived the discussion on the value of Baius' theological opinions.\n\nAnother famous exponent of Leuven Augustinianism was Cornelius Jansen, after whom Jansenism is named. After studying at the University of Utrecht and Leuven, Jansenius withdrew to France, where he applied himself to an intensive study of the Scriptures and the Church Fathers. He worked together with his friend Jean Duvergier de Hauranne who later became the abbé of Saint-Cyran. Jansenius studied the original sources rather than concentrating upon scholastic subtleties in a debate over the ground and efficacy of grace precisely as Pope Clement VIII had demanded. Jansenius’ study of Augustine of Hippo’s thought cost many years of work as is reflected in his book Augustinus, which was published posthumously in 1640. Jansenius’ work was attacked by the \"Societas Jesu\" in particular, but it had other opponents as well, such as the Protestant theologian Gisbertus Voetius.\n\nThrough the Jesuit’s efforts the Augustinus was condemned in 1642. Nevertheless, the work had its defenders, among who was the French monastery at Port-Royal-des-Champs. Blaise Pascal and Antoine Arnauld were the best known of the defenders of Jansenius' work, who also brought moral questions into the debate. Five of Jansenius' Augustinus’ theses were condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653. But, in reaction, Arnauld cum suis disputed the idea that these theses could as such be found in Jansenius’ writings. In 1656 Pope Alexander VII declared that the theses, exactly as they had been condemned, were in fact precisely what Jansenius had meant. Then, only after Alexander VII’s death a compromise was made under Pope Clement IX.\n\nTensions between the Leuven Faculty and the Jesuit Order heated up due in part to the fact that the Leuven faculty presented a list of propositions in 1653 and 1657 for condemnation, aimed against the Jesuits, claiming that they represented a theological laxism. Between 1677 and 1679, the faculty obtained the condemnation, through Pope Innocent XI, of 65 theses drawn from the writings of Jesuit moral theologians. The Jesuits in their turn obtained a condemnation of 31 rigorist propositions allegedly taught by the Leuven professors in 1713. The Jansenist controversy finally ended with the promulgation of the papal bull \"Unigenitus\" in 1713. After professors like Martin Steyaert turned to the Roman point of view, the entire faculty subjected itself to this position. The faculty became more conciliatory toward the central doctrinal authority in the eighteenth century, becoming a center of Ultramontanism through its dismissal of Gallicanism and Febronianism. The faculty’s reputation was strengthened by its opposition to Joseph II of Austria’s religious politics and to the vows imposed on clerics by the French Republic.\n\nAfter the French Revolutionary Wars, by the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Austrian Netherlands was ceded to the French Republic by Austria in exchange for the Republic of Venice. Once integrated into the French Republic, a law dating to 1793 mandating that all universities in France be closed came into effect. The University of Leuven was abolished by decree of the Département of the Dyle on 25 October 1797.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "512336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=512336", "title": "Faustina the Younger", "text": "Faustina the Younger\n\nAnnia Galeria Faustina Minor (\"Minor\" is Latin for \"the Younger\"), Faustina Minor or Faustina the Younger (born probably 21 September CE, died in winter of 175 or spring of 176 CE) was a daughter of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and Roman Empress Faustina the Elder. She was a Roman Empress and wife to her maternal cousin Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. She was held in high esteem by soldiers and her own husband and was given divine honours after her death.\n\nFaustina, named after her mother, was her parents' fourth and youngest child and second daughter; she was also their only child to survive to adulthood. She was born and raised in Rome.\n\nHer great uncle, the emperor Hadrian, had arranged with her father for Faustina to marry Lucius Verus. On 25 February 138, she and Verus were betrothed. Verus’ father was Hadrian’s first adopted son and his intended heir; however, when Verus’ father died, Hadrian chose Faustina’s father to be his second adopted son, and eventually, he became Hadrian’s successor. Faustina’s father ended the engagement between his daughter and Verus and arranged for Faustina's betrothal to her maternal cousin, Marcus Aurelius; Aurelius was also adopted by her father.\n\nIn April or May 145, Faustina and Marcus Aurelius were married, as had been planned since 138. Since Aurelius was, by adoption, Antoninus Pius' son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his \"patria potestas\") for the ceremony to take place. Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been \"noteworthy\". Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as \"Pontifex Maximus\", would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina. Faustina was given the title of \"Augusta\" on 1 December 147 after the birth of her first child, Domitia Faustina.\n\nWhen Antoninus died on 7 March 161, Marcus and Lucius Verus ascended to the throne and became co-rulers. Faustina then became empress.\nNot much has survived from the Roman sources regarding Faustina's life, but what is available does not give a good report. Cassius Dio and the unreliable \"Augustan History\" accuse Faustina of ordering deaths by poison and execution; she has also been accused of instigating the revolt of Avidius Cassius against her husband. The \"Augustan History\" mentions adultery with sailors, gladiators, and men of rank; however, Faustina and Aurelius seem to have been very close and mutually devoted.\n\nFaustina accompanied her husband on various military campaigns and enjoyed the love and reverence of Roman soldiers. Aurelius gave her the title of \"Mater Castrorum\" or ‘Mother of the Camp’. She attempted to make her home out of an army camp. Between 170–175, she was in the north, and in 175, she accompanied Aurelius to the east.\n\nThat same year, 175, Aurelius's general Avidius Cassius was proclaimed Roman emperor after the erroneous news of Marcus's death; the sources indicate Cassius was encouraged by Marcus' wife Faustina, who was concerned about her husband's failing health, believing him to be on the verge of death, and felt the need for Cassius to act as a protector in this event, since her son Commodus, aged 13, was still young. She also wanted someone who would act as a counter-weight to the claims of Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, who was in a strong position to take the office of Princeps in the event of Marcus’s death. The evidence, including Marcus's own \"Meditations\", supports the idea that Marcus was indeed quite ill, but by the time Marcus recovered, Cassius was already fully acclaimed by the Egyptian legions of II Traiana Fortis and XXII Deiotariana.\n\n\"After a dream of empire lasting three months and six days\", Cassius was murdered by a centurion; his head was sent to Marcus Aurelius, who refused to see it and ordered it buried. Egypt recognized Marcus as emperor again by 28 July 175.\n\nFaustina died in the winter of 175, after an accident, at the military camp in Halala (a city in the Taurus Mountains in Cappadocia). \n\nAurelius grieved much for his wife and buried her in the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome. She was deified: her statue was placed in the Temple of Venus in Rome and a temple was dedicated to her in her honor. Halala’s name was changed to \"Faustinopolis\" and Aurelius opened charity schools for orphan girls called \"Puellae Faustinianae\" or 'Girls of Faustina'. The Baths of Faustina in Miletus are named after her.\n\nIn their thirty years of marriage, Faustina bore Marcus Aurelius thirteen children:\n\n"}

There are seldom reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. The different religious communities generally coexisted without problems, although some tensions between different Muslim groups and between Muslims and Christians were reported.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 9,885,700. More than half of the population is Muslim, approximately one-third is Christian, and the remainder practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs or no religion at all. Most northerners practice Islam, and many southerners practice Christianity or traditional indigenous religious beliefs; however, population patterns are becoming more complex, especially in urban areas, and anecdotal evidence indicates that Muslim conversion is on the rise in areas that were previously Christian or animist. Many citizens, despite having stated religious affiliations, do not practice their religion regularly.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam known locally as Tijaniyah, which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of Muslims (5 to 10 percent) hold more fundamentalist beliefs, which in some cases may be associated with Saudi-oriented belief systems such as Wahhabism or Salafism.\n\nRoman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based \"Winners Chapel\", are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the Baha'i and Jehovah's Witnesses religious communities also are present. Both religious groups were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered \"new\" religious groups.\n\nForeign missionaries representing numerous religious groups continue to proselytize in the country.\n\nArticle 1 of the Chad Constitution declares that the country is a secular state and \"affirm[s] the separation of the religions and of the State\".\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government banned the religious group Al Faid al-Djaria and indirectly monitors Islamic activities through the pro-Government High Islamic Council. The Constitution also provides that the country shall be a secular state; however, some policies favor Islam in practice. For example, a committee composed of members of the High Council for Islamic Affairs and the Directorate of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior organizes the Hajj and the Umra. In the past the Association of Evangelical Churches criticized government-sponsored Hajj trips as eroding the traditionally secular stance of the country.\n\nThe Office of the Director of Religious and Traditional Affairs under the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security oversees religious matters. The office is responsible for mediating intercommunal conflict, reporting on religious practices, and ensuring religious freedom.\n\nWhile the Government is legally obligated to treat all religious groups or denominations equally, non-Muslims allege that Muslims receive preferential status. In the past the Government reportedly accorded public lands to Muslim leaders for the purpose of building mosques but required representatives of other religious groups to purchase land at market rates to build places of worship.\n\nThe Director of Religious and Traditional Affairs oversees religious matters. Working under the Minister of the Interior, the Director of Religious and Traditional Affairs is responsible for arbitrating intercommunal conflicts and ensuring religious freedom. The Director also monitors religious practices within the secular state. An independent religious organization, the High Council for Islamic Affairs, oversees all Islamic religious activities, including the supervision of Arabic language schools and higher institutions and the representation of the country in international Islamic meetings.\n\nThe High Council for Islamic Affairs, in coordination with the president, also has the responsibility of appointing the grand imam—a spiritual leader for all Muslims in the country who oversees each region's high imam and serves as head of the council. In principle, the grand imam has the authority to restrict proselytizing by other Islamic groups throughout the country, regulate the content of mosque sermons, and exert control over activities of Islamic charities operating in the country. The current grand imam, Sheikh Hissein Hassan Abakar, a representative of the generally moderate Sufi (Tijaniyah) branch of Islam, is viewed as a generally moderate religious figure. He has had his authority challenged by followers of other sects of Islam who adhere to more fundamentalist teachings derived from eastern and northern Africa and the Middle East.\n\nReligious leaders are also involved in managing the country's wealth. A representative of the religious community sits on the Revenue Management College, the body that oversees the allocation of oil revenues. The seat rotates between Muslim and Christian leaders every 4 years. In 2004 the Muslim representative handed responsibilities over to a Catholic priest designated by the Christian community. The mandate of the Christian representative at the College ended in June 2007.\n\nThe Government requires religious groups, including both foreign missionary groups and domestic religious groups, to register with the Ministry of the Interior's Department of Religious Affairs. The Department created two separate services for Muslims and Christians. Registration takes place without discrimination and is interpreted as official recognition. Despite popular perceptions to the contrary, registration is not intended to confer tax preferences or other benefits to religious groups.\n\nThe Government prohibits activity that \"does not create conditions of cohabitation among the populations\". This prohibition is understood to mean regulating groups who advocate sectarian tensions in the country. The Al Mountada al Islami and the World Association for Muslim Youth organizations were banned by the government for portraying violence as a legitimate precept of Islam.\n\nGenerally, foreign missionaries did not face restrictions; however, they must register and receive authorization from the Ministry of Interior to circulate within the country, as do other foreigners traveling and operating throughout the country. It is difficult to find a report that the Government withheld authorization from any group.\n\nPublic schools conduct instruction in French, and public bilingual schools conduct classes in French and Arabic. The Government prohibits religious instruction in public schools but permits all religious groups to operate private schools without restriction. The poor quality of Chad's educational system has prompted many Muslim families to look to Islamic schools as an opportunity for educating children who would otherwise have little or no access to formal schooling. Most large towns have at least one or two private religious schools. Although the Government does not publish official records on school funding, many Islamic schools were commonly understood to be financed by Arab donors (governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals), particularly from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Libya.\n\nIn the past several human rights organizations have reported on the problem of the mahadjirin children, students of certain Islamic schools who are forced by their teachers to beg for food and money. There were no credible estimates as to the number of mahadjirin children. The High Council for Islamic Affairs appealed for an immediate end to such practices, and the Government called for the closure of such schools. Despite attempted reforms, the schools remained open.\n\nAmong the numerous private radio stations, religious organizations own several stations broadcasting throughout the country (six Christian and two Islamic). Officials closely monitored radio stations run by both nonprofit and commercial groups.\n\nThe Government celebrates both Christian and Islamic holy days as national holidays. Islamic national holidays include Eid al-Adha, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Eid al-Fitr. Christian holidays include Easter Monday, All Saints' Day, and Christmas Day. It is not uncommon for Muslims and Christians to attend each other's festivities during these holidays.\n\nWhile most interfaith dialogue takes place on a voluntary basis and not through government intervention, the Government was generally supportive of these initiatives. On March 8, 2007, the Government initiated a campaign for peace, and Christian organizations organized a peaceful march to support the initiative. The Muslim religious establishment also attended, specifically the Imam of the grand mosque on behalf of the High Council of Islamic Affairs.\n\nAl Faid al-Djaria (also spelled Al Faydal Djaria), a Sufi group that adheres to a mystical form of Islam and is found in the Kanem, Lake Chad, and Chari Baguirimi areas, is banned by the government. The Director of Religious and Traditional Affairs, the High Council for Islamic Affairs, and certain Ulema (Muslim religious authorities) objected to some of Al Faid al-Djaria's customs, such as the incorporation of singing, dancing, and the intermixing of sexes during religious ceremonies, which they deemed un-Islamic. During the reporting period, the Minister of Interior's 2001 ban on Al Faid al-Djaria continued as the group's case remained in court; however, the group still carried out activities in the Chari Baguirmi region of the country.\n\nThe Government is believed to monitor some Islamic organizations, such as the Salafi/Wahhabi group Ansar al Sunna, which were well funded by Arab donors and able to use money and other material incentives to encourage adherence to their more austere interpretation of Islam.\n\nThere were no reports of religious detainees or prisoners in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion carried out by the Government; however, there were reports of forced conversions of prisoners to Islam by other prisoners. Reports of such cases are disputed and many observers, including human rights groups, find it extremely difficult to determine whether compulsion was used. According to the Government, such cases are due to the violent nature of certain groups within the jail, who use violence against other prisoners and try to extort money.\n\nThere were no reports of the forced religious conversion of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nThere are seldom reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice, although there was occasional tension between Christians and Muslims as well as between more fundamentalist and more moderate Muslims. There are regular meetings between key religious leaders to discuss peaceful collaboration among their groups.\n\nIn April 2007 the Association of Evangelical Churches appealed to the Government for additional assistance in ending the conflict between nomadic herders (who are primarily Muslim) and local farmers (who are primarily Christian) in the southern part of the country; however, the Government did not respond to the appeal.\n\nIn January 2007 the Catholic Church and Association of Evangelical Churches sent a second official protest to the Government for its failure to respond to a February 2006 rally against the Danish cartoons that resulted in damage to several Christian properties and injury to an evangelical missionary. The Government did not officially respond to the complaint.\n\nThe marketplace violence between Christians and Muslims in the southern town of Bebedja that resulted in 12 dead and 21 wounded in 2004 remained a source of tension among the local populace. Some victims accused the Government of failing to investigate the cases thoroughly and conduct proper trials.\n\nThere were reports of tensions within the Muslim community. Such tensions arose from differences between the Tijaniyahs leading the High Council for Islamic Affairs and more fundamentalist groups regarding interpretations of practices, preaching, and the leading of prayers.\n\nMost interfaith dialogues that attempted to address Christian-Muslim and Muslim-Muslim tensions were facilitated by the groups themselves and not through government intervention. Religious groups meet regularly to try to resolve sources of tension and promote greater collaboration. During these encounters, leaders discussed problems of peaceful cohabitation, tolerance, and respect for religious freedom. These dialogues were usually initiated by the Commission for Peace and Justice (CDPJ), a Catholic organization, and both Christian and non-Christian groups participated. CDPJ also held events that brought together members of the Islamic and Christian communities to discuss issues such as child domestics and herders.\n\nThere are rarely reports of tension between Christians and Muslims in reaction to proselytizing of traditional believers by evangelical Christians.\n\n\n"}

It is around 40 km away from Eluru. The rock-cut part of the site has two Buddhist caves, a chaitya hall and a large group of stupas. The chaitya hall has a rare carved stone entrance replicating wooden architecture, a simpler version of that at the Lomas Rishi Cave. \n\nThere are remains of structural buildings in brick and stone, including remains of two vihara made of brick, as well as excavated caves at two levels, including an unusual structural chaitya hall (that is, one built above ground). The core of this consists of the stone stupa with an enclosed path around it allowing ritual parikrama (circumambulation). They mostly date to 200-0 BCE, with some sculptures added later. The main building above ground is in brick, around a stone stupa, with over 30 smaller stupas on a terrace in front of it. There are ruins of two other buildings. \n\nDuring excavation, three relic caskets were found. The caskets had many precious elements like gold, silver, crystal beads. The bronze image of Padmapani was found along with one of the caskets. The inscription on the casket was in the Devanagari script which indicates the year as from the 9th to 10th century CE.\n\n"}

In 1658, the Dutch agreed with David Nassy to establish a colony of Jews on the Pomeroon River, which flourished, becoming a prized possession of the Dutch, until its destruction in 1666 by an incursion by the English from Barbados under Major John Scott. The Jews of Pomeroon (Bowroom) fled, following the destruction of their colony, mostly to Suriname, where they were granted unprecedented religious freedoms.\n\nBy the 1930s there was neither an organized Jewish community nor a synagogue in the capital city of Georgetown. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several Jewish families immigrated to British Guiana from Arab lands to avoid persecution and expand business opportunities.\n\nBritish Guiana was part of the expanding British Empire, which included much of the Middle East. The expansion of the sugar cane industry in British Guiana allowed the British to encourage workers (initially indentured Portuguese from Madeira, and then East Indians from South India), and the expansion of the economy brought opportunities to Jews from warm lands to emigrate. Most of the Jewish migration during this period came from British controlled portions of the Middle East including what is now modern Iraq, and were erroneously identified as Assyrians and called \"Syrians.\" Prominent among these families were affluent Jews including the Elias family from Palestine who ran several mercantile exchanges until the great fires of the 1960s burn them out. There were also several other Jewish merchant families erroneously identified as Arabs. Until the 1960s, there were close to a few hundred Jewish merchants who were categorized as \"Syrians\". Most of the Jews returned to the Middle East after racial resentment and political upheaval culminated with race riots of the 1960s.\n\nPrior to World War II, the leadership of Nazi Germany discussed the possibility of exiling the German Jewish population to British Guiana. Winston Churchill had also raised the possibility of relocating up to 250,000 Jews to British Guiana, but his proposal was rejected by then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. In early 1939, 165 Jewish refugees travelling on the S.S. Koenigstein from Europe were refused disembarkation and entry, and not long after the government prohibition immigration.\n\nAfter World War II began, the British colonial administration in charge of Guyana agreed to provide shelter for 50 Jewish refugees who escaped Europe through Spain. These refugees emigrated after the war.\n\nToday there are a few Jewish communities in Georgetown.\n\nJanet Jagan, an American-born Jewish woman married to a Guyanese national, served as prime minister from March 17, 1997, to December 19, 1997, and as president of Guyana from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999. However, Jagan downplayed her faith, telling a journalist in a 2000 interview that \"Jewishness wasn't much of a factor in my life.\" Jagan also added that as of 2000, \"There's no Jewish community in Guyana.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5183703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5183703", "title": "Huang Chao", "text": "Huang Chao\n\nHuang Chao (835 – July 13, 884) was a Chinese smuggler, soldier, and rebel, and is most well known for being the leader of a major rebellion that severely weakened the Tang dynasty.\n\nHuang was a salt smuggler before joining Wang Xianzhi's rebellion in the mid-870s. After splitting with Wang, his army turned south and conquered Guangzhou. In 881, his troops captured the capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong of Tang to flee. Huang proclaimed himself the Qi emperor, but was defeated by the Tang army led by the Shatuo chieftain Li Keyong in 883 and forced to desert Chang'an. Following successive defeats, including to former subordinates Zhu Wen and Shang Rang who had surrendered to Tang, Huang was killed by his nephew Lin Yan.\n\nThe Tang dynasty, established in 618 A.D., had already passed its golden age and entered its long decline beginning with the An Lushan Rebellion by Sogdian general An Lushan. The power of the jiedushi or provincial military governors increased greatly after imperial troops crushed the rebels. The discipline of these generals also decayed as their power increased, the resentment of common people against the incapacity of the government grew, and their grievances exploded into several rebellions during the mid-9th century. Many impoverished farmers, tax-burdened landowners and merchants, as well as many large salt smuggling operations, formed the base of the anti-government rebellions of this period. Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao were two of the important rebel leaders during this era.\n\nIt is not known when Huang was born, but it is known that he was from Yuanqu (within the present-day Mudan District of Heze, Shandong). His family had been salt privateers for generations (with the salt trade officially monopolized by the state ever since the Anshi Rebellion), and the Huang family became wealthy from smuggling. It was said that Huang was capable in swordsmanship, riding, and archery, and was somewhat capable in writing and rhetoric. He used his wealth to take in desperate men who then served under him. He had at least one older brother, Huang Cun (黃存), and at least six younger brothers, Huang Ye (黃鄴) or Huang Siye (黃思鄴), Huang Kui (黃揆), Huang Qin (黃欽), Huang Bing (黃秉), Huang Wantong (黃萬通), and Huang Sihou (黃思厚). He repeatedly participated in the imperial examinations, but was not able to pass them, and thereafter resolved to rebel against Tang rule.\n\nLate in the \"Xiantong\" era (860–874) of Emperor Yizong, there were severe droughts and floods that caused terrible famine. Despite this, the Tang imperial government largely ignored the victims of these natural disasters—instead of granting tax exemptions for effected areas, taxes were increased to fund Emperor Yizong's luxurious lifestyle and military campaigns. As a result, survivors grouped themselves into bands and rose to resist Tang rule.\n\nIn 874, Wang Xianzhi (who, like Huang Chao, was a salt privateer) and Shang Junzhang (尚君長) rose an army at Changyuan (長垣, in modern Xinxiang, Henan). By 875 he had repeatedly defeated Xue Chong in battle, (薛崇) the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Huang had by this point also raised several thousand men, and joined forced with Wang's now veteran troops. By this time Emperor Yizong had died and his young son Emperor Xizong ruled.\n\nLate in 876, Wang was sought to parlay his victories into a peaceful submission to Tang authority, in which he would be generously treated by the throne. This was being mediated by Tang official Wang Liao (王鐐), a close relation to chancellor Wang Duo, and Pei Wo (裴偓) the prefect of Qi Prefecture (蘄州, in modern Huanggang, Hubei). Under Wang Duo's insistence, Emperor Xizong commissioned Wang Xianzhi an officer of the imperial Left Shence Army (左神策軍) and delivered the commission to Qi Prefecture. However, Huang, who did not receive a commission as part of this arrangement, angrily stated:\n\nHe battered Wang Xianzhi on the head, and the rebel soldiers also clamored against the arrangement. Wang Xianzhi, fearing the wrath of his own army, turned against Pei and pillaged Qi Prefecture. However, afterwards, the rebel army broke up into two groups, with one group following Wang Xianzhi and Shang Junzhang, and one group following Huang.\n\nHuang Chao subsequently roamed throughout central China, and his campaign took him into many engagements with Tang forces:\n\n\nIn spring 878, Huang was sieging Bo Prefecture (亳州, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), when Wang Xianzhi was crushed by Zeng at Huangmei (黃梅, in modern Huanggang, Hubei) and killed. Shang Rang took the remnants of Wang's army and joined Huang at Bo Prefecture, and he offered the title of king to Huang. Huang, instead, claimed the title of \"Chongtian Dajiangjun\" (衝天大將軍, \"Generalissimo Who Charges to the Heavens\") and changed the era name to Wangba, to show independence from the Tang regime. He then captured Yi and Pu Prefectures again, but then suffered several defeats by Tang forces. He thus wrote the new military governor of Tianping, Zhang Xi (張裼), asking Zhang to ask for a Tang commission on his behalf. At Zhang's request, Emperor Xizong commissioned Huang as a general of the imperial guards, but ordered him to report to Yun Prefecture to disarm before he would report to the capital Chang'an. Faced with those conditions, Huang refused the offer. Instead, he attacked Song and Bian (汴州, in modern Kaifeng, Henan) Prefectures, and then attacked Weinan (衛南, in modern Puyang, Henan), and then Ye (葉縣, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan) and Yangzhai (陽翟, in modern Xuchang, Henan). Emperor Xizong thus commissioned troops from three circuits to defend the eastern capital Luoyang, and further ordered Zeng to head to Luoyang as well. With the Tang forces concentrating on defending Luoyang, Huang marched south instead.\n\nHuang Chao crossed the Yangzi River southwards and captured several prefectures south of the Yangzi—Qian (虔州, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi), Ji (吉州, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi), Rao (饒州, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), and Xin (信州, in modern Shangrao). In fall 878, he then headed northeast and attacked Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), defeating Wang Ning (王凝) the governor of Xuanshe Circuit (宣歙, headquartered at Xuan Prefecture) at Nanling (南陵, in modern Wuhu, Anhui), but could not capture Xuan Prefecture, and therefore further headed southeast to attack Zhedong Circuit (浙東, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), and then, via a mountainous route, Fujian Circuit (福建, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) in winter 878. However, during this march, he was attacked by the Tang officers Zhang Lin (張璘) and Liang Zuan (梁纘), who were subordinates of Gao Pian the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and defeated several times. As a result of these battles, a number of Huang's followers, including Qin Yan, Bi Shiduo, Li Hanzhi, and Xu Qing (許勍), surrendered to the Zhenhai troops. As a result, Huang decided to turn further south, toward the Lingnan region.\n\nBy this point, Wang Duo had volunteered to oversee the operations against Huang, and Wang was thus made the overall commander of the operations as well as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). In reaction to Huang's movement, he commissioned Li Xi (李係) to be his deputy commander, as well as the governor of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), in order to block a potential northerly return route for Huang. Meanwhile, Huang wrote Cui Qiu (崔璆) the governor of Zhedong Circuit and Li Tiao (李迢) the military governor of Lingnan East Circuit (嶺南東道, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), to ask them to intercede for him, offering to submit to Tang imperial authority if he were made the military governor of Tianping. Cui and Li Tiao relayed his request, but Emperor Xizong refused. Huang then directly made an offer to Emperor Xizong, requesting to be the military governor of Lingnan East. Under the opposition of the senior official Yu Cong, however, Emperor Xizong also refused, instead, at the chancellors' advice, offering to make Huang an imperial guard general. Huang, receiving the offer, was incensed by what he perceived to be an insult. In fall 879, he attacked Lingnan East's capital Guang Prefecture, capturing it after a one-day siege and taking Li Tiao captive. He ordered Li Tiao to submit a petition to Emperor Xizong on his behalf again, but this time, Li Tiao refused, so he executed Li Tiao. The Arab historian Abu Zayd Hasan of Siraf reports when Huang Chao captured Guang Prefecture, his army killed a large number of foreign merchants resident there: Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Parsees. The ethnicity of the killed were reported to be Persians, Arabs, and Jews. \nThe death toll could have ranged from 120,000 to 200,000 foreigners. However Chinese sources do not mention the alleged massacre. Mulberry groves were ruined by his army.\n\nHowever, as Huang Chao's army was in the Lingnan region, his soldiers were stricken by illnesses, and some 30-40% died. His key subordinates suggested that he march back north, and he agreed. He thus made rafts at Gui Prefecture (桂州, in modern Guilin, Guangxi) and took them down the Xiang River, reaching Hunan's capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan) in winter 879. He attacked Tan Prefecture and captured it in a day, and Li Xi fled to Lang Prefecture (朗州, in modern Changde, Hunan). Shang Rang then attacked Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality, where Wang Duo was. Wang panicked and fled as well, leaving the city to be defended by his officer Liu Hanhong, but as soon as Wang left the city, Liu mutinied, pillaged the city, and took his soldiers to become bandits.\n\nHuang himself followed Xiang's advance and went through Jiangling to attack Xiangyang, the capital of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道). He was, however, defeated by the joint forces of Shannan East's military governor Liu Jurong (劉巨容) and the imperial general Cao Quanzhen (曹全晸), who further pursued him all the way to Jiangling. However, Liu, concerned that if he captured Huang, the imperial government would no longer value him, called off the pursuit, and Cao also broke off his pursuit. Huang then headed east and attacked E Prefecture (鄂州, in modern Wuhan), and pillaged the 15 surrounding prefectures. As he did, however, he was repeatedly repelled by Zhang Lin. As a result of Zhang's successes, the imperial government put Zhang's superior Gao Pian, who had by that point been transferred to Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), in charge of the overall operations against Huang, replacing Wang. Many circuits thus sent troops to Huainan\n\nWith his forces repeatedly defeated by Zhang and also suffering from plagues, Huang, then stationed at Xin Prefecture (信州, in modern Shangrao), decided to try to bribe his way out of his predicament. He thus submitted much gold to Zhang and wrote letters to plead with Gao, offering to submit to Tang imperial authority. Gao, who also wanted to use trickery himself to capture Huang, offered to recommend Huang as a military governor. Further, Gao, in order to monopolize the achievement, decided to return the supplementary troops from Zhaoyi (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Ganhua (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and Yiwu (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) Circuits. As soon as he returned those troops, however, Huang broke off negotiations and challenged Zhang to a battle. Gao, in anger, ordered Zhang to engage, but this time, Huang decisively defeated Zhang in spring 880 and killed him in battle, throwing Gao into a panic.\n\nHuang, after defeating Zhang, then captured Xuan Prefecture, then, in summer 880, crossed the Yangtze River north at Caishi (采石, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), and put the Huainan defense outposts Tianchang (天長, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) and Liuhe (六合, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) under siege, not far from Gao's headquarters at Yang Prefecture (揚州). Bi Shiduo, who was then serving as an officer under Gao, suggested that Gao engage Huang, but Gao was terrified of engaging Huang after Zhang's death, and instead sent urgent requests for aid to the imperial government. The imperial government, which had hoped that Gao would be successful in stopping Huang, was very disappointed and thrown into a panic itself. Emperor Xizong ordered the circuits south of the Yellow River to send troops to Yin River (溵水, a major branch of the Shaying River) to block off Huang's further advance, and also sent Cao and Qi Kerang the military governor of Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) to intercept Huang. However, Cao was only given 6,000 men, and although he fought hard, he was ultimately unable to stop Huang's 150,000 men.\n\nAt this point, a mutiny among the imperial armies further ended any imperial resistance at Yin River. This occurred as some 3,000 Ganhua soldiers were heading to Yin River to participate in the defense operations there, and they went through Xu Prefecture (許州, in modern Xuchang), the capital of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武). Despite the Ganhua soldiers' reputation for lack of discipline, Xue Neng (薛能) the military governor of Zhongwu, because he had been Ganhua's military governor before, believed that they would be obedient to him, so he allowed them to stay in the city. But that night, the Ganhua soldiers rioted over what they perceived to be the lack of supplies given to them. Xue met them and calmed them down, but this in turn caused the Zhongwu soldiers and the populace of Xu Prefecture to be angry at his lenient treatment of them. The Zhongwu officer Zhou Ji, himself then taking Zhongwu soldiers toward Yin River, thus turned his army around and attacked and slaughtered the Ganhua soldiers. His soldiers also killed Xue and Xue's family. Zhou then declared himself military governor. Qi, concerned that Zhou would attack him, withdrew from the area and returned to Taining Circuit. In response, the troops that other circuits had stationed at Yin River scattered, leaving the path wide open for Huang. Huang thus crossed the Huai River north, and it was said that starting from this point, Huang's army stopped pillaging for wealth, but forced more young men into the army to increase its strength.\n\nAs winter 880 began, Huang Chao headed toward Luoyang and Chang'an, and issued a declaration that his aim was to capture Emperor Xizong to make Emperor Xizong answer for his crimes. Qi Kerang was put in charge of making a final attempt to stop Huang from reaching Luoyang. Meanwhile, though, the chancellors Doulu Zhuan and Cui Hang, believing that imperial forces would not be able to stop Huang from reaching Luoyang and Chang'an, suggested that Emperor Xizong prepare to flee to Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), where Chen Jingxuan, the brother of the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi, was military governor. Emperor Xizong, however, wanted to also make one last attempt to defend Tong Pass, between Luoyang and Chang'an, and therefore sent the imperial Shence Army (神策軍) officers Zhang Chengfan (張承範), Wang Shihui (王師會), and Zhao Ke (趙珂)—whose soldiers were ill-trained and ill-equipped, as the Shence Army soldiers' families were largely wealthy and were able to pay the poor and the sick to fill in for them—to try to defend it. Meanwhile, Luoyang fell quickly, and Qi withdrew to Tong Pass as well, and submitted an emergency petition stating that his troops were fatigued, hungry, and without supplies, with no apparent imperial response.\n\nHuang then attacked Tong Pass. Qi and Zhang initially resisted his forces for more than a day, but thereafter, Qi's troops, hungry and tired, scattered and fled. Zhang's final attempts to defend Tong Pass were futile, and it fell. Meanwhile, Tian had recruited some new soldiers, who were also ill-trained but relatively well-equipped, and sent them to the front, but by the time they reached there, Tong Pass had already fell, and the troops from Boye Army (博野軍) and Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), also sent to the front to try to aid Zhang, became angry at the good equipment (including warm clothes) that Tian's new soldiers had, and mutinied, instead serving as guides for Huang's forces. Emperor Xizong and Tian abandoned Chang'an and fled toward Xichuan Circuit on January 8, 881. Later that day, Huang's forward commander Chai Cun (柴存) entered Chang'an, and the Tang general Zhang Zhifang welcomed Huang into the capital. Shang Rang issued a declaration proclaiming Huang's love for the people and urging the people to carry on their daily affairs, but despite Shang's assurance that the people's properties would be respected, Huang's soldiers were pillaging the capital repeatedly. Huang himself, briefly, lived at Tian's mansion, moving into the Tang palace several days later. He also ordered that Tang's imperial clan members be slaughtered.\n\nHuang Chao then moved into the Tang palace and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qi. He made his wife Lady Cao empress, while making Shang Rang, Zhao Zhang (趙璋), and the Tang officials Cui Qiu (崔璆) and Yang Xigu (楊希古) chancellors. Huang initially tried to simply take over the Tang imperial mandate, as he ordered that the Tang imperial officials of the fourth rank or lower (in Tang's nine-rank system) continue to remain in office, as long as they showed submission by registering with Zhao, removing only the third-rank or above officials. The Tang officials who would not submit were executed en masse. Huang also tried to persuade Tang generals throughout the circuits to submit to him, and a good number of them, including Zhuge Shuang (諸葛爽) (whom he made the military governor of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan)), Wang Jingwu the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Wang Chongrong (whom he made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and Zhou Ji (whom he made the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit) — although each of those generals eventually redeclared loyalty to Tang and disavowed Qi allegiances. He also tried to persuade the former Tang chancellor Zheng Tian, the military governor of nearby Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), to submit, but Zheng resisted, and when he sent Shang and Wang Bo (王播) to try to capture Fengxiang, Zheng defeated Qi forces that he sent in spring 881.\n\nIn light of Zheng's victory over Qi forces, Tang forces from various circuits, including Zheng and his ally Tang Hongfu (唐弘夫), Wang Chongrong (who had turned against Qi by this point and redeclared his loyalty to Tang), Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu Circuit, and Tuoba Sigong the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (夏綏, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), converged on Chang'an in summer 881, hoping to quickly capture it. With the people of Chang'an waging street warfare against Qi forces as well, Huang withdrew out of the city — but as Tang forces entered Chang'an, they lost discipline and became bogged down in pillaging the city. Qi forces then counterattacked and defeated them, killing Cheng Zongchu (程宗楚) the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) and Tang Hongfu, and forcing the other Tang generals to withdraw out of the city. Huang reentered Chang'an and, angry at the people of Chang'an for aiding Tang forces, carried out massacres against the population. With Zheng subsequently forced to flee Fengxiang due to a mutiny by his officer Li Changyan, Tang forces in the region became uncoordinated and did not make another attempt to recapture Chang'an for some time.\n\nIn spring 882, Emperor Xizong, then at Chengdu, commissioned Wang Duo to oversee the operations against Qi, and Wang positioned himself at LInggan Temple (靈感寺, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). With Wang overseeing the operations, Tang forces began to converge again in Chang'an's perimeter area, and the areas controlled by Qi forces became limited to Chang'an and its immediate surroundings, as well as Tong (同州) and Hua (華州) Prefectures (both in modern Weinan). With farming completely disrupted by the warfare, a famine developed in the region, such that both Tang and Qi forces resorted to cannibalism. By fall 882, the Qi general Zhu Wen, in charge of Tong Prefecture, had become unable to stand to Tang pressure and surrendered to Tang. By winter 882, Hua Prefecture also surrendered to Tang under the leadership of the officer Wang Yu (王遇), limiting Qi territory to Chang'an.\n\nHowever, Tang forces were still not making a true attempt to recapture Chang'an by this point. However, the ethnic Shatuo general Li Keyong — who had been a Tang renegade for years but who had recently resubmitted to Tang and offered to attack Qi on Tang's behalf, arrived at Tong Prefecture in winter 882 to join the other Tang forces. In spring 883, Li Keyong and the other Tang generals defeated a major Qi force (150,000 men) commanded by Shang and approached Chang'an. In summer 883, Li Keyong entered Chang'an, and Huang was unable to resist him, and so abandoned Chang'an to flee east. With Tang forces again boggled down in pillaging the city, they were unable to chase Huang, and Huang was able to flee east without being stopped.\n\nHuang Chao headed toward Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian) and had his general Meng Kai (孟楷) attack Fengguo's capital Cai Prefecture. The military governor of Fengguo, Qin Zongquan, was defeated by Meng, and reacted by opening the city gates, submitting to Huang, and joining Huang's forces. Meng, after defeating Qin, attacked Chen Prefecture (陳州, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), but was surprised by a counterattack by Zhao Chou, the prefect of Chen Prefecture, and killed in battle. Angered by Meng's death, Huang led his and Qin's forces and put Chen Prefecture under siege, but could not capture it despite a nearly 300-day siege. With his army low on food supplies, he allowed them to roam the nearby countryside, seizing humans and using them for food.\n\nMeanwhile, in spring 884, fearing that they would become Huang's next target, Zhou Ji, Shi Pu, the military governor of Ganhua Circuit, and Zhu Wen (whose name had been changed to Zhu Quanzhong by that point), the Tang military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), jointly sought aid from Li Keyong, who had been made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li Keyong thus headed south to aid them. After Li Keyong joined forces with those sent by Zhou, Zhu, Shi, and Qi Kerang, they attacked and defeated Shang Rang at Taikang (太康, in modern Zhoukou) and Huang Siye at Xihua (西華, in modern Zhoukou as well). Huang Chao, in fear, lifted the siege on Chen and withdrew. With his encampments being destroyed in a flood, Huang Chao decided to head toward Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture. While Zhu was able to repel Huang's initial attacks, he sought emergency aid from Li Keyong. Li Keyong, catching Huang when about to cross the Yellow River north, launched an attack at Wangman Crossing (王滿渡, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) and crushed his army. Shang surrendered to Shi, while a large number of other generals surrendered to Zhu. Li Keyong gave chase, and Huang fled to the east. During the chase, Huang's youngest son was captured by Li Keyong. Li Keyong's army became worn out during the chase, however, and he broke off the chase and returned to Bian Prefecture.\n\nHuang headed toward Taining's capital Yan Prefecture. Shi Pu's officer Li Shiyue (李師悅), along with Shang, engaged Huang at Yan Prefecture and defeated him, annihilating nearly the remainder of his army, and he fled into Langhu Valley (狼虎谷, in modern Laiwu, Shandong). On July 13, 884, Huang's nephew Lin Yan (林言) killed Huang, his brothers, his wife, and his children, and took their heads to prepare to surrender to Shi. On his way to Shi's camp, however, he encountered Shatuo and Boye Army irregulars, who killed him as well and took the heads to present to Shi. (However, according to an alternative account in the \"New Book of Tang\", Huang, believing that it was the only way that any of his army could be saved, committed suicide after instructing Lin to surrender with his head.)\n\nSome speculate that Lin Yan bringing the alleged heads of Huang Chao and others to Shi Pu was only a decoy to allow the real Huang Chao escape. It was noted that Langhu Valley was over 500 \"li\" or 3–4 days away on a horseback from Shi's camp in Xu Prefecture, and decomposition would have already kicked in during the hot summer to make the faces unrecognizable. Moreover, Huang Chao had a number of brothers following him and the siblings likely resembled each other.\n\nLegends popular during the ensuing Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period claim that Huang became a Buddhist monk following his escape. The Song dynasty scholar Wang Mingqing (王明清), for example, alleged in his book \"Huizhu Lu\": \"When Zhang Quanyi was the mayor (留守) of the Western Capital (i.e. Luoyang), he recognized Huang Chao from among the monks.\"\n\nHe wrote a few poems, lyrical even when expressing anger and violence, one line that reads:\n\n\"Capital full of golden armored soldiers\" (滿城盡帶黃金甲)\n\nwas used to describe his preparations for rebellion in an angry spirit, this phrase was used for the Chinese name of the 2006 film Curse of the Golden Flower. The Hongwu Emperor, founder of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), wrote a similar poem.\n\n\n"}

The festival starts on the first Saturday of August, at midnight, and runs throughout the weekend. Every town within the central part of the city has its own 3 wheeled, highly decorative festival cart. Each cart has a large taiko drum at the back and several kane along the sides. Each town has a particular sequence for each of those instruments, creating a unique and identifying sound. Another identifying feature is the placement of the kakegoe, or shouts. Over the course of the weekend, the carts are pulled toward Kasuga Shrine for presentation, performing along the way. With over 30 carts with distinct rhythms, it has been said that the Kuwana festival is the loudest festival in Japan.\n\nThe festival originally started in the Edo period (1751-1764). It is believed to have originated from the custom of local worshipers selecting stones from the Machiya River to take to the local shrine. The stones were ceremoniously transported to the shrine on carts, while taiko and kane were played.\nIn 1981, the festival was designated as an asset of intangible culture for Mie Prefecture. In 2007, it was designated as a national asset of intangible culture.\n\nTypically the towns are separated by age. There is a children's group, young adult group, older adult group, and senior adult group.\nThough each town has its own schedule of events and traditions, the following is the generalized schedule of events, with the main event being on the \"First Sunday of August\":\nMarch 6\nThe order of the carts is determined by lottery.\nJuly 15-20th\nThis is the practice time with the festival carts. On the 20th, some carts will gather together in one particular town to end the practice session in camaraderie. They can not touch the carts again until Tatakidashi (叩き出し), which is at midnight between Friday night and Saturday morning before the First Sunday of August. Around this time, there is a gender-specific competition between the young adults of each town, though not all towns choose to compete.\nJuly 20\nThere is a Kawarabarai Ceremony (川原祓式) at Machiya River to pray for a safe festival.\nWeekend before the Festival\nEach town readies its carts; polishing, cleaning, and setting up components. They also mark the festival path with streamers hanging from telephone lines, and otherwise prepare for the festival, though there is no drumming until Tatakidashi.\n3 days before the Festival (Thursday)\nBamboo is gathered to decorate the festival meeting places.\n2 days before the Festival (Friday)\nEach age group attends their local shrine for the Okattsan Ceremony (お勝さん), which includes singing and praying. The children and adults, with the exception of the young adults, move the cart to its festival position, as was determined in March. Much later, the young adults return to the group after much drinking.\n1 day before the Festival (Saturday)\nFriday night leads up to Tatakidashi. At midnight, all the towns are signaled to start drumming simultaneously.\nAfter playing into the early hours of the morning, the group will retire, typically meeting once more at 10am.\nThe festival carts are paraded through their towns on this day, and once again it leads up to silence, awaiting the next Tatakidashi.\nFestival Day (Sunday)\nAt 2am, there is another Tatakidashi. The taikos and kane start playing simultaneously and the carts are paraded around their town for another long night of celebration. The day is very similar to the previous one. During the day on Sunday, the young adults drink while once again the others put the cart into its specific order. Later, the young adults join in, and each town makes its way to Kasuga Shrine.\n\nThe following is a list of the current participating towns:\nGroup 1 - Uehon-Machi (上本町); Hagoromoren (羽衣連) which includes Hon-Machi (本町), Kitahon-Machi (北本町), and Higashisenba-Cho (東舩馬町); Nishisenba-Cho (西舩馬町); and Hanamachiren (花街連) which includes Kawaguchi-Machi (川口町), and Edo-Machi (江戸町)\nGroup 2 - Miyadori (宮通), Kyo-Machi (京町), Kata-Machi (片町)\nGroup 3 - Misakidori (三崎通); and Miyakita (宮北) which includes Kitauo-Machi (北魚町), Miya-Machi (宮町), Furo-Machi(風呂町)\nGroup 4 - Minamiuo-Machi (南魚町), Ta-Machi (田町), and Shokunin-Machi (職人町)\nGroup 5 - Yotsuya-Cho (吉津屋町), Kaji-Machi (鍜冶町), and Irieyoshi-Machi (入江葭町)\nGroup 6 - Shin-Machi (新町), Tenma-Cho (傳馬町), and Kaya-Machi (萱町)\nGroup 7 - Kasuga-Cho (春日町); Shimizu-Cho (清水町); and Takara-Machi (宝町) which includes Hoden-Cho (宝殿町), and Shinhoden-Cho (新宝殿町)\nGroup 8 - Tera-Machi (寺町)、Tsutsumibara (堤原), Imakata-Machi (今片町), Imanaka-Machi (今中町), and Imakita-Machi (今北町)\nGroup 9 - Higashinabeya-Machi (東鍋屋町), Nishinabeya-Machi (西鍋屋町), Kakehi (掛樋), Higashiyada-Machi (東矢田町), Nishiyada-Machi (西矢田町), Fukue-Machi (福江町)\nGroup 10 - Umamichi (馬道); Nishiumamichi (西馬道) which includes Umamichi-Nichome (馬道二丁目), and Umamichi-Sanchome (馬道三丁目); Nishisakae-Machi (西栄町) which includes Sakae-Machi (栄町), and Nishigawara (西川原); Shinyada-ichome (新矢田一丁目); and Ueno-Machi (上野町)\nGroup 11 - Kotobuki-Cho (寿町), Chuodori (中央通), and Higashitokiwa-Cho (東常盤町)\n\n"}

He claimed to be able to materialize spirits, produce ectoplasm and levitate objects. Guzyk was endorsed by the psychical researcher Gustav Geley who attended his séances. However, the skeptical investigator Paul Heuzé and a professional illusionist known as Professor Dicksonn suspected that Geley and other psychical researchers had been duped by trickery.\n\nHeuzé organized five scientists, including the French physicist Paul Langevin to observe Guzyk during his séances. Objects were moved but only in close reach of the medium. They concluded that he had freed one of his legs to perform the phenomena. When tighter controls were introduced, nothing happened. \n\nIn 1923 he was exposed as a fraud in a series of séances in Sorbonne in Paris. Guzyk would use his elbows and legs to move objects around the room and touch the sitters. He was caught cheating by the psychical researcher Harry Price. According to Price the \"man was clever, especially with his feet, which were almost as useful to him as his hands in producing phenomena.\" Price also noted that Guzyk impersonated a \"spirit\" animal during a séance by placing his hand in a stocking to stimulate the illusion of a snapping jaw. \n\nThe psychologist Max Dessoir wrote that the trick of Guzyk was to use his \"foot for psychic touches and sounds\". He was investigated many times and his mediumship was detected in fraud. At a séance in Kraków in December 1924 a photograph showed him moving a curtain with his hand. Walter Franklin Prince who attended séances with Guzyk came to the conclusion he had no paranormal ability. The psychical researcher Paul Tabori has written that it was established beyond doubt that Guzyk had cheated at his séances.\n\n"}

He has held a number of positions in both the academic and ecclesiastical world. In the ecclesiastical field he has served as an Evangelist for the Presbyterian Church of Ghana (1982–86), Second Minister for the Presbyterian Congregation in Sunyani (1989–90), the Minister In-Charge of the Presbyterian Congregation in London (1996–98), and the District Minister of Presbyterian Churches in London (2010–11). He has also served in a variety of other roles within the church. He was the Co-ordinator for PCG Northern Outreach Programme in Accra (1998–2000), the Pioneer Co-ordinator for Northern Outreach Programme in Kumasi 91990-1993), and the Acting Director for the Presbyterian Lay Training Centre in Tamale (2003–04). He has as well served as the International Deputy Director of the Lausanne Movement in Africa (2004-2007).\n\nIn the academic field he has taught at a number of different institutions. He has served in India as the Visiting Lecturer at SAIACS in Bangalore (2001–05), the Senior Lecturer at Henry Martyn Institute in Hyderabad (2000–01), and the Senior Lecturer at Union Biblical Seminary in Pune (2001–03).

He currently serves as the Associate Professor of World Christianity & Islam and the Director of International Programs at Columbia Theological Seminary (2011–present).\n\nIn addition to speaking around the world, Azumah has written a number of books and has contributed to a large range of publications. He is a strong advocate for ecumenical dialogue between Islam and Christianity.\n\nHe identifies five faces of Islam as: “the missional face (the face that seeks to convert the world to Islam), the mystical face (the face that focuses more on spiritual things), the ideological or political face (the face that seeks to occupy the public sphere by implementing sharia or Islamic law), the militant face (this is the face of Islam that seeks to achieve its ends by the use of violence), and the progressive face (this face is usually self-critical and seek to reread the Koran in light of present realities).” He believes that many Christians only see Islam through one of these faces and urges them to see Islam instead as an amalgamation of them all. Azumah grew up as a Muslim, in a Muslim family, and converted to Christianity so he understands the importance of nurturing dialogue between the two traditions. This is especially true in the context of today's world, where many people misunderstand the Islam faith. He states that “during difficult times foolish people build walls and wise people build bridges. My hope is that we have many more people who’ll be willing to build bridges.” He continues to be a leader throughout the world in facilitating and encouraging interfaith dialogue and understanding.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28139933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28139933", "title": "Kuman Thong", "text": "Kuman Thong\n\nKuman Thong () is a household divinity of Thai popular religion. It is believed to bring luck and fortune to the owner if properly revered. \"Kuman\", or \"Kumara\" (Pali) means \" Sanctified young boy\" (female \"kumari\"); \"thong\" means golden.\n\nThe veneration of Kuman Thong is not part of mainstream Buddhist practices, but it is popular in Thailand since ancient times.\n\nThe authentic Kuman Thong originated in a practice of necromancy. They were obtained from the desiccated fetuses of children who had died whilst still in their mothers' womb. The witch doctors were said to have the power to invoke these stillborn babies, adopt them as their children, and use them to help them in their endeavours.\n\nAccording to ancient Thai manuscripts used by practitioners of black magic ( \"Saiyasat\"), first the unborn fetus was surgically removed from the womb of its mother. Then the body of the child would be taken to a cemetery for the conduction of the proper ceremonial ritual to invoke a Kuman Thong. The body was roasted until dry whilst the witch doctor chanted incantations of magical script. Once the rite was completed, the dry-roasted Kuman was painted with Ya Lak (a kind of lacquer used to cover amulets and Takrut with gold leaf) and covered in gold leaf. Thus this effigy received the name of \"“Kuman Thong”\", meaning “Golden Little Boy”.\n\nSome Kuman effigies were soaked in Nam Man Phrai, a kind of oil extracted by burning a candle close to the chin of a dead child or a person who died in violent circumstances or an unnatural death. This is much less common now, because this practice is now illegal if using fat from human babies for the consecrating oil. Occasionally there are still some amulets obtained through the authentic methods appearing in the market. Some years ago a famous monk was expelled from the Buddhist Sangha for roasting a baby. He was convicted, but later continued to make magic as a layperson after his release.\n\nIn the case of a female spirit child, the effigy is not called Kuman Thong, but \"Hong Phrai\" (โหงพราย).\n\nThe Kuman Thong is mentioned in the Thai legend of Khun Chang Khun Phaen, where the character Khun Phaen made one by removing the stillborn baby from the stomach of his wife, whom he had killed.\n\nOn May 18, 2012 a 28-year-old British citizen of Taiwanese origin, Chow Hok Kuen, was arrested in a Bangkok hotel room with six male fetuses that had been roasted and covered in gold. Police reported that Kuen intended to sell the fetuses in Taiwan for about 6,300 USD each.\n\nIn 2011, a case was reported in Laos of a man murdering his pregnant wife, so as to use the fetus as a \"Louk Lord\".\n\nHyper-realistic dolls of children (but not made out of real children), \"Luk Thep\" or \"Look Thep\" (\"child angel\"), have recently (2015) become popular in Thailand. Some people believe the dolls can be injected with the spirit of a child after being blessed by a Buddhist monk. Their owners provide such care as food, water and clothes \"in the hope of receiving good fortune in return\", and some companies offer owners of the dolls the option to reserve them their own seats and services.\n\n\n"}

They are described as Nephite record-keepers, missionaries and prophets.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Ammaron (; Ammoron a frequent scribal variant in the Printer's Manuscript) was a Nephite record-keeper and perhaps a prophet. He was also one of the authors who wrote on the Plates of Nephi, which Mormon abridged.\n\nAmmaron took custody of the Nephite records after the death of his brother, Amos, in AD 306 and three verses contain Mormon's abridgment of his writings. In 321, he hid all the Nephites' sacred writings in the Hill Shim in the Land of Antum. He later instructed the ten-year-old future prophet Mormon to wait until he was 24 and then take the Plates of Nephi from the hill (leaving the other writings hidden) and continue the record.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Amos was a Nephite record keeper. His father was Amos, and his grandfather was Nephi the Disciple. Mormon is thought to have abridged his record which consists of 26 verses in the Book of 4th Nephi. Amos must have been exceptionally long-lived, for he had custody of the Nephite records for 112 years, approximately from AD 194 to 306 (although a certain commentator suggests that this Amos may be referring to at least two different people). are an abridgment of his writings. When Amos died, his brother Ammaron took over as record keeper.\n\nAmos' record relates the degeneration of the society of the Nephites after the appearance of Jesus on the American continent. This degeneration is due to the pride of the people.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Amos was a Nephite record keeper and son of Nephi the Disciple. Amos had custody of the Nephite records for 84 years, from approximately AD 110 to 194. Upon his death the Book of Mormon record passed to his son Amos.\n\nTwo verses, 4 Nephi 1:19-20, are an abridgment (by Mormon) of his writings:\n19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last record, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his stead; and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also.\n20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still peace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the land.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Corianton () was a Nephite missionary, the third son of Alma the Younger (the first chief judge). Circa 74 BC (17th year of the reign of the judges), Corianton went with his older brother Shiblon and his father Alma, and 5 others (Amulek, Zeezrom, Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni), on a proselytizing mission to the Zoramites in Antionum, while his eldest brother Helaman stayed behind. The group witnessed the peculiar worship of the Zoramites, including the prayers upon the Rameumptom.\n\nHis father Alma reprimanded him for his grievous sins, commanded him to repent, and preached to him about the afterlife, the Resurrection, and the Atonement. Shortly thereafter, Alma called him again to preach to the people. The last account in the Book of Mormon of Corianton is that he journeyed to a northern land to deliver provisions.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Helaman, son of Helaman, (sometimes referred to as Helaman II) was a Nephite prophet who lived around 30 BC. His father was Helaman, son of Alma, who was also a prophet and military commander. The younger of Helaman's sons include the missionaries Nephi and Lehi. He served as chief judge for seven years and then gave the Judgement Seat to his son Nephi.\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Shiblon () was a Nephite missionary and record-keeper. He was the second son of Alma the Younger, who was the first chief judge. Circa 74 BC (17th year of the reign of the judges), Shiblon went with his father, younger brother Corianton, and 5 others (Amulek, Zeezrom, Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni), on a mission to proselytize to the Zoramites in Antionum, while his older brother Helaman stayed behind. The group witnessed the peculiar worshiped of the Zoramites in their congregations, including praying to the Rameumptom.\n\nAt the beginning of the Zoramite mission, Alma prayed for Shiblon and the group for the Lord to sustain and guide them. Afterwards as Alma clapped his hands on them and each was filled with the Holy Spirit; each went separate ways to begin their missions. Through faith and prayer, they succeeded among the poorer classes, who had been shunned from other churches because of their lowly appearance.\n\nIn 73 BC, during Shiblon's mission to the Zoramites, Alma gave him counsel and advice. From these instructions, we learn that Shiblon was held in bonds and stoned for the Word's sake. According to Alma, Shiblon bore all things with patience because the Lord was with him. We also discover the following strengths and weaknesses that Shiblon \"may\" have possessed through the words of counsel that Alma gives:\n\n\n\nShiblon appears to obey his father's teachings; Alma advises that adult children need continual direction and encouragement from their fathers regardless of the child's maturity and station.\n\nCirca 56 BC (36th year of the judges), Shiblon inherited the records and other items from his brother Helaman. He kept them for three years, then realized he would soon die. Because he could not deliver them to Corianton who had gone north in a ship, he gave them to his nephew Helaman II. As he predicted, he died shortly afterwards, c. 53 BC.\n\nLDS scholar Hugh Nibley stated both names are probably related to the Arabic word \"shibl\", \"lion cub\", and argued that Shiblon may have been a variant of Shiblom. His student Benjamin Urrutia further connected it with \"Jaguar Cub\" imagery of the Olmec people.\n\n\"Shiblon\" is also a Nephite word for a weight of silver, equal to half a senine of gold, or a senum of silver. \"See Book of Mormon weights and measures\".\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Timothy was the son of Nephi, son of Helaman, and brother of Nephi the Disciple. At one point while preaching as a missionary, he was stoned to death but was raised from the dead by his brother. After the appearance of the resurrected Jesus Christ to the Nephites, he along with Nephi was chosen by Christ to be one of Twelve Disciples.\n\nTimothy is relatively unusual in the Book of Mormon for having a Greek name.

The book became a best-seller.\n\n\"Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk\" was published in January 1836. In it, Monk claimed that nuns of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph of the Montreal convent of the Hôtel-Dieu, whom she called \"the Black Nuns\", were forced to have sex with the priests in the seminary next door. The priests supposedly entered the convent through a secret tunnel. If the sexual union produced a baby, it was baptized and then strangled and dumped into a lime pit in the basement. Uncooperative nuns disappeared.\n\nMonk's story contains inconsistencies. In her account, she stated that there were three convents in Montreal: \"1st. The Congregational Nunnery. 2d. The Black Nunnery, or Convent of Sister Bourgeoise. 3d The Grey Nunnery.\" The Congregational Nuns were the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, founded by Marguerite Bourgeoys, not the Sisters of Charity, as Monk stated at the beginning of her text; the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, whose habits were black but who were not typically called \"Black Nuns\", operated the Hotel-Dieu, where Monk claimed that she entered and suffered, and it was not founded by \"Sister Bourgeoise [sic]\"; and it was the Sisters of Charity who were commonly known as the Grey Nuns.\n\nIt is known that Maria Monk lived in an asylum in her early years and that one of the nuns mentioned in her story was actually a fellow patient in the asylum. There is some evidence that Maria Monk had suffered a brain injury as a child. One possible result of this alleged injury could be that Monk might have been manipulated, and might not be able to distinguish between fact and fantasy. Another possible result of the alleged injury could be that Monk had little understanding of the devastating result of her claims. It has been suggested, though not proven, that Maria Monk was manipulated into playing a role for profit by her publisher or her ghost writers. The book has been described as a hoax by some scholars.\n\nMonk’s book was published in an American atmosphere of anti-Catholic hostility (partly fueled by early 19th-century Irish and German Catholic immigration to the U.S.) and followed the 1834 Ursuline Convent Riots near Boston. These were triggered by an incident in which one of the nuns left the convent but was persuaded to return on the following day by her superior, Mother Mary St. George, and by the Bishop of Boston, the Most Reverend Benedict Fenwick. This incident immediately gave rise to the claim that the woman was being held in the convent against her will; a mob invaded and then burned down the convent in an effort to free her.\n\nIn 1835 Rebecca Reed published an anti-Catholic, gothic novel, a highly-colored account of her six months as an Episcopalian charity pupil at the Ursuline convent school in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Reed herself died of tuberculosis shortly after the publication of her book; her disease was widely believed to have been caused by the austerities to which she had been subjected at the convent.\n\nReed’s book became a bestseller, and Maria or her handlers might have hoped to cash in on the evident market for anti-Catholic horror fiction. Monk’s claims might have been modeled on the gothic novels that were popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries, a literary genre that had already been used to stoke anti-Catholic sentiments in such works as Denis Diderot's \"La Religieuse\". Monk’s story epitomizes the genre-defining elements of a young, innocent woman being trapped in a remote, old, gloomily picturesque estate, where she learns dark secrets and escapes after harrowing adventures. \n\nMonk claimed that she had lived in the convent for seven years, became pregnant, and fled because she did not want her baby destroyed. She told her story to a Protestant minister, Rev. John Jay Slocum, in New York, who encouraged her to repeat it to a wider audience. According to the \"American Protestant Vindicator\", by July 1836 the book had sold 26,000 copies. Other publishers later issued books that supported Monk’s claims or were close imitators, or else they published tracts that refuted the tale. Historian Richard Hofstadter called it, in his 1964 essay \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\", \"[p]robably the most widely read contemporary book in the United States before \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\"\n\nMonk’s book caused a public outcry. Protestants in Montreal, Quebec, demanded an investigation, and the local bishop organized one. The inquiry found no evidence to support the claims, though many American Protestants refused to accept the conclusion and accused the bishop of dishonesty.\n\nColonel William Leete Stone, Sr., a Protestant newspaper editor from New York City, undertook his own investigation. In October 1836, his team entered the convent and found that the descriptions in the book did not match the convent interior. During their first visit, the investigators were denied entry to the basement and the nuns’ personal quarters. There was much dispute regarding the existence of a tunnel underground leading to the nuns' residence. Its existence was verified by many people. There were disputes regarding \"renovations to the Nuns residence and if the \"tunnel \" had been filled in or not. Stone returned to New York, interviewed Monk and concluded that she had never been in the convent. On a later visit, he was given total access to all quarters. Stone’s team found no evidence that Maria had ever lived in the convent.\n\nMaria disappeared from the public view. It was later discovered that she had spent the seven-year period in question in the Magdalen Asylum for Wayward Girls. One critic points out that a nun character in her book, Jane Ray, was actually residing with Monk at the Magdalen Asylum, rather than at the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. The Magdalene asylum building was a very small wooden building, quite different to the described nunnery of the book Maria Monk wrote.\n\nMany details of the story seem to have originated with Monk’s legal guardian, William K. Hoyte, an anti-Catholic activist, and his associates. The writers later sued each other for a share of the considerable profits, while Monk was left destitute.\n\nMonk traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a lover whom historians often identify as Graham Monk. She penned a sequel, \"Further Disclosures of Maria Monk\". When she gave birth to another child, Oliver (a brother to William), out of wedlock in 1838, most of her supporters abandoned her.\n\n\"The Boston Pilot\" published this obituary for her on September 8, 1849: \"There is an end of Maria Monk; she died in the almshouse, still cooking as was her wont. Blackwell's Island, New York, on Tuesday\".\n\n\"Awful Disclosures\" remained in print for years afterwards and was occasionally revived. There appear to have been two Australian editions (1920, 1940). The last recorded unsupplemented facsimile edition was published in 1977.\n\nPosthumous editions of \"Maria Monk\" were published in 1837 (New York: Howe and Bates), 1920 (Melbourne: Wyatt and Watt), 1940? (Brisbane: Clarion Propaganda Series),1962 (Hamden: Archon), and were often reprints or facsimiles of the original. In 1975, a microform format was made available from New Haven, Connecticut. ISBN references are available for the following editions:\n\n\nThe book has been translated into several languages, for instance, Dutch:\nand Ukrainian:\n\n\nNotes'\n\n"}
{"id": "9431560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9431560", "title": "Michael Nugent", "text": "Michael Nugent\n\nMichael Nugent (born 1 June 1961) is an Irish writer and activist. He has written, co-written or contributed to seven books and the comedy musical play \"I, Keano\". He has campaigned on many political issues, often with his late wife Anne Holliday, and he is chairperson of the advocacy group Atheist Ireland. \n\nNugent was completing a project on the Gospels in primary school when he started to question the \"comic book\" nature of the Bible. He attended St. Aidan's C.B.S. secondary school in Whitehall in Dublin. He graduated in visual communications in 1983 at the College of Marketing and Design, now part of the Dublin Institute of Technology. In 1983, he was elected president of the college students' union and students' representative on the Dublin City Council Vocational Education Committee. In 1984, he was defeated when he ran for the post of education officer in the Union of Students in Ireland, in opposition to Joe Duffy, then USI president, who is now a broadcaster with RTÉ. He then took a course in product development, and set up as a freelance designer.\n\nIn 2009 Nugent married his longtime partner Anne Holliday, after she was diagnosed with cancer. She died on 9 April 2011, aged 57. Holliday and Nugent were founder members in 1988 of New Consensus, the group which called for the revision of the Republic's territorial claim on the North and devolved government for the people of Northern Ireland based on \"mutual respect, civil liberty and freely given allegiance\", and they helped to organise the Peace Train campaign to end disruption of the north-south rail link by the IRA. Holliday was also a Simon Community volunteer, a founder member of the Limerick chapter of the Irish Georgian Society, campaigned to save Wood Quay, and was active in residents rights issues. She worked as a secretary at the law firm Matheson Ormsby Prentice, a Dáil secretary for TDs Michael Keating and Roger Garland, personal assistant to National Museum Director Pat Wallace, in media relations and special projects at the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, and in the Tánaiste's office at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Holliday donated her body to medical research and, in 2014, her body was buried in the Dublin medical Schools plot in Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin. After a request from Nugent, the Dublin Medical Schools agreed to change the religious wording on the headstone over the plot to a secular wording, so that it would be inclusive of people of all religious beliefs and none. In 2015 Nugent wrote a tribute to his wife in the Irish Times in which he also wrote about coping with bereavement as an atheist.\n\nNugent has written, co-written or contributed to seven books and the comedy musical play \"I, Keano\".\n\n\nNugent, with Arthur Mathews and Paul Woodfull, co-wrote \"I, Keano\", a comedy musical play about footballer Roy Keane leaving the Republic of Ireland national football team before the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It was presented as a mock-epic melodrama about an ancient Roman legion preparing for war. In its first two years, over half a million people watched it, generating €10m ($13m) in ticket sales. It was updated and revived in 2015 after Roy Keane became assistant coach of the Ireland football team.\n\n\"Dear John\" was a number one best-seller in Ireland, co-written by Nugent and Sam Smyth. By writing prank letters, Nugent and Smyth convinced then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds to help the fictitious 'John' seek a grant from the Industrial Development Authority to produce dog bowls modelled on dinner plates; prompted Charles Haughey to meet 'John' to help fund a 'Bring Back Charlie' campaign, and provoked Pope John Paul II to pray for 'John's' children because his kids put condoms on the family chess-set bishops.\n\nThe \"Irish Times\" included \"Ireland on the Internet\" among its top ten computer books of 1995.\n\n\"That's Ireland – A Miscellany\", co-written with Damien Corless, was a hardback best-seller that included such trivia as that three in every ten TDs since 1922 have been called some variation of Paddy, Mick, Sean or Seamus, and that when the Pope held his youth Mass in Galway in 1979, each diocese was asked to send a baker in white overalls and a lame person with a stick or crutches.\n\nIn \"Absurdly Yours\", Nugent pitched a new series of prank letters, ranging from planes without seats (for Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary) to scaffolding on Mount Everest (the Nepalese Government responded it would be \"inappropriate\"). The FAI offered to help with his invention of a left-footed football, but the GAA replied that they could detect a wind-up from 1,000 yards.\n\nIn \"Towards Mutual Ground - Pluralism, Religious Education and Diversity in Irish Schools\", Nugent and Jane Donnelly contributed a chapter titled ‘Only secular schools respect every person’s human rights equally.’\n\nIn \"Who Owns Marriage? - A Conversation about Religion, Government, Marriage and a Civil Society\", edited by Nick Park of the Irish Evangelical Alliance, Nugent critiqued evangelical arguments about same sex marriage from a secular perspective.\n\nIn 1986, Nugent joined the newly founded Progressive Democrats, working with Michael Keating TD, a friend since his VEC days. He soon left the PDs, saying that he was disillusioned with the clientilist system and that he believed in the need to tackle the Northern Ireland problem on a cross-party basis.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nugent was spokesperson for a campaign against the conviction of two Tallaght youths for robbery and assault. In 1990, Taoiseach Charles Haughey assured the youths' families and Nugent that new evidence would be considered. In 1993, the government announced a new law to enable this to happen and, in 2001, the case was declared a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIn 1988, Nugent co-founded the New Consensus peace group with his partner Anne Holliday and Michael Fitzpatrick. He also chaired the group. Its launch meeting in April 1989 announced its aims as challenging ambivalence about murder in Northern Ireland, and promoting a democratic, pluralist and non-sectarian society with integrated education, a bill of rights and revision of Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution.\n\nIn 1992, after an IRA bomb killed eight Protestant workmen in Teebane Cross, Nugent and six other men protested by chaining themselves across the entrance of the Sinn Féin office in Dublin. New Consensus also organised peace rallies and pickets of Sinn Féin and UDA offices, and collections of flowers after paramilitary killings.\n\nSinn Féin regularly said that New Consensus did not protest against violence by the security forces in Northern Ireland. Nugent responded falsely that they protested when agents of the British or Irish States acted outside the law When New Consensus picketed the Belfast offices of the loyalist UDA, some said that it was only in response to criticism of imbalance. Also some single-issue peace groups, such as Peace 93 and the Peace Train Organisation, distanced themselves from the political aims of New Consensus.\n\nIn 1970 Sinn Féin had split into Provisional and Official Sinn Féin, with Official Sinn Féin later becoming the Workers' Party and then Democratic Left before merging with the Labour Party, whichs mirrored a split within the IRA, which split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. The Official IRA officially decommissioned in 2010. Although the group declined in support from 1972, it remained linked to Official Sinn Féin and was frequently accused of committing robberies and fraud to fund the party. Some political commentators such as Vincent Browne and Paddy Prendeville said that the Workers' Party and Democratic Left had an attitude to Northern Ireland that was close to Ulster unionism. New Consensus was regularly derided by Sinn Féin and a number of commentators who stated that the group was a front for the Workers' Party. During pickets members of Sinn Féin would challenge picketers about the Official IRA and killings and acts associated with the group. Both New Consensus and the parties denied this.\n\nIn 1996, Nugent, Anne Holliday and Michael Fitzpatrick won a libel action against the Irish author and historian Tim Pat Coogan and Harper Collins Publishers over a claim that \"New Consensus\" was an offshoot of Official Sinn Féin. The author and publishers apologised in court, stating they had made a mistake.\n\nIn 1992, Nugent highlighted that Veritas, a bookshop owned by the Catholic Bishops, was breaking the law by selling an anti-abortion book, \"Closed\" by Joseph Scheidler, which contained abortion clinic contact details for potential protestors. Under Irish law at the time no contact details of any abortion service could be published.\n\nIn 1996, he and his partner Anne Holliday organised an email campaign to protest against the proposed demolition of James Joyce's childhood home in Drumcondra. The campaign received messages of support from Joyce scholars in Britain, Australia, Canada and the US, which were passed on to Dublin Corporation.\n\nIn 1999, he was a local election candidate for Dublin City Council, running for Fine Gael in the Ballymun-Whitehall local electoral area, but he failed to be elected.\n\nIn 2000, Nugent helped to stop the Irish government appointing a disgraced former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, to the European Investment Bank. The Bank accepted Nugent's argument that they had a statutory duty to consider other candidates, and he forwarded the CV of Irish Senator and business editor Shane Ross. After public pressure, O'Flaherty withdrew his candidacy.\n\nNugent supports Bohemians and Leeds United football clubs. In 2002, he helped to prevent the Football Association of Ireland from selling broadcast rights for international matches to Sky television, but failed in an attempt to create a representative body for Irish football fans. In 2008, he was removed as a director of Bohemian Football Club after he questioned the viability of the club's growing expenditure. Two years later, the club was reported to be entering the most critical stage in its history.\n\nNugent is the inaugural chairperson of Atheist Ireland, an advocacy group for an ethical and secular society free from superstition and supernaturalism. Its first AGM in 2009 outlined specific aims, including the removal of references to God from the Irish constitution, the introduction of a secular education system, and a campaign to encourage people to read the Bible. \n\nHe represented Atheist Ireland at the first formal meeting between an Irish Prime Minister and members of an atheist advocacy group in the history of the State, where they argued how the Constitution, education system and laws and practices systemically discriminate against atheists. \n\nNugent was the opening speaker at the 2011 World Atheist Convention in Dublin, Ireland, which adopted the Dublin Declaration on Secularism and launched Atheist Alliance International, a newly restructured umbrella group for atheists worldwide. He told the convention that atheists were considered arrogant “because we do not believe that the entire universe was created for our benefit,” and because they did not believe “that the most powerful being ever created a universe of over 100 billion galaxies, each with over 100 billion stars like our sun, which existed for 14 billion years, and then picked one of the 100 billion galaxies and picked one of the 100 billion stars in that galaxy, and picked one planet revolving around that star and of the million species on that planet he picked one animal member of all those species and said: ‘I’ve really got to tell that guy to stop gathering sticks on the Sabbath’.” \n\nHe described a radio debate with irate Catholics protesting against an art exhibition as being \"like discussing the rules of quidditch with people who believe Harry Potter was a documentary.\" He predicted that moderate religious belief will become a minority position in many countries. He said that religion is being squeezed by science, which undermines its claims about reality, and secularism, which erodes its positions on morality. He also wrote a series of five articles for the Irish Times about atheism and its relationship to reality, morality, faith and Jesus.\n\nNugent published a manifesto on “ethical atheism” that sought to promote reason, critical thinking and science, natural compassion and ethics, inclusive, caring atheist groups and fair and just societies, and challenged the myths that atheism is a religion or belief system based on faith and certainty, and that we need religion for meaning and morality. In a BBC radio debate, he defended Richard Dawkins against charges by New Humanist editor Daniel Trilling that some criticism of Islam was a cover for racist views.\n\nHe told an RTÉ debate about miracles that you have a better chance of dying than being cured at Lourdes. He described Pope Francis as a pope of the global south with good PR in the global north, saying that as two in every three Catholics live in the global south, Pope Francis has to appeal to Catholics with very different values. He debated on RTÉ Radio with a Catholic Priest who said that he would not report child rape to the police if he heard about it in Confession. He told TV3’s People’s Debate on homophobia that the Catholic Church is overtly homophobic, and is becoming more so as its population shifts to the global South. He debated the Christian theologian William Lane Craig in University College Cork about the existence of God. \n\nNugent opposed the law against blasphemous libel introduced by Justice Minister Dermot Ahern. He described it as \"silly and dangerous\", and argued that ideas should always be open to criticism and ridicule. As part of the campaign, he was involved in the formation of the parody Church of Dermotology, which satirises organised religion and the concept of blasphemy, and in the launch of a website opposing the bill, called \"Blasphemy.ie\".\n\nWhen the Irish blasphemy law came into force in 2010, Atheist Ireland published a list of 25 blasphemous quotes on its website to challenge it. The Justice Minister proposed that a referendum should be held to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Irish Constitution. Nugent told RTÉ that the Irish blasphemy law had caused Irish media to self-censor their output, saying that he had been told before several live interviews not to say anything blasphemous. \n\nWhen Irish police investigated comedian Stephen Fry for alleged blasphemy in 2017, Nugent welcomed the move because it highlighted a law that he said was “silly, silencing, and dangerous”. When the police dropped the investigation because they could not find a large number of people who were outraged by Fry’s comments, Nugent said that this created a dangerous incentive for people to demonstrate outrage when they see or hear something that they believe is blasphemous.\n\nIn 2018 Nugent welcomed a new Government decision to hold a referendum to remove the offence of blasphemy from the constitution. He said that even in the absence of prosecutions the law was causing real damage to freedom of expression in Ireland, and to the country’s reputation abroad. He said that it’s never a good look when Pakistan, where people are killed for blasphemy, is speaking approvingly of your laws. \n\nNugent told the Oireachtas health committee on abortion law to stop the unethical pattern of lawmaking by reacting to personal tragedies, and to base abortion law on human rights and compassion and not on religious doctrines. He supported a referendum in 2018 to remove the constitutional ban on abortion, saying it would enable pregnant women to make their own ethical decisions, based on their own conscience, but he added that he makes no claim that all atheists share this view. He asked the Standards in Public Office Commission to examine the funding of the Catholic bishops’ referendum campaign in support of retaining the Amendment.\n\nHe asked the Irish Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Eamon Gilmore, who is agnostic, to refuse to swear the religious oath that he had to swear as a member of the Council of State, but Gilmore said that he had taken legal advice and that he had a constitutional obligation to swear the oath.\n\nNugent campaigns for secular education in Ireland, including in an alliance between Atheist Ireland, the Evangelical Alliance of Ireland, and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Ireland. He argues for secular schools that would not ignore religion, but would teach children about religions and beliefs in an objective, critical and pluralist manner, while respecting everybody’s human rights. \n\nHe launched the Schools Equality PACT in 2015, which outlined Atheist Ireland’s plans for a fair education system. PACT is an acronym for four areas of legal change – Patronage, Access, Curriculum and Teaching. He argued that the Louise O’Keeffe judgment at the European Court of Human Rights could begin the end of State-supported religious discrimination in Irish schools. The European Court had told the Irish State it was responsible for protecting the human rights of children while in school, regardless of whether it runs the schools directly.\n\nNugent said that Government plans in 2016 to encourage the Catholic Church to transfer patronage of primary schools would make the situation worse for most families, as the Catholic Church wanted a stronger Catholic ethos in the schools they would retain. He said that reducing teaching time for religion classes was not the most important issue because schools implement the religious ethos throughout the entire school day. \n\nHibernia College, an online teacher-training institution in Dublin, removed slides from its religion module for primary teachers in 2012 at the request of Atheist Ireland. The course notes had said that atheist humanism produced the worst horrors history has ever witnessed.\n\nThe following year Nugent announced a new project in which Atheist Ireland and Educate Together were preparing lessons about atheism that would be taught in Ireland’s primary schools for the first time. He said this was necessary because the Irish education system has for too long been totally biased in favour of religious indoctrination. Nugent noted that Atheist Ireland was not pushing for atheist schools, but rather pluralistic, objective alternatives to religious ones.\n\nA Dublin school canceled an invitation to Nugent to address its final-year students on the basis that it would clash with its Catholic ethos.\n\nNugent also campaigns on other issues of church-state separation in Ireland. He said the Good Friday drink ban is silly, and that people should be able to drink in the same way on any Friday as they can on any Thursday or Saturday. When the law was repealed in 2018, he invited people to ‘an evening of legalised normality’ at Atheist Ireland’s first ever Good Friday Atheists in the Pub session. \n\nNugent criticised the question “What is your religion?” in the 2011 Irish census. He said the census should instead ask “Do you have a religion?” and “If so, what is it?” He asked nonreligious Irish people to tick the No Religion box. He warned that joke responses to the religion question in the census, being categorised as “not stated”, potentially contribute to an underreporting of the number of non-religious people. \n\nHe called for the removal of the daily Angelus from RTÉ, saying that it amounted to a free advert for the Catholic Church, and he debated the issue on RTÉ radio with Roger Childs, RTÉ’s editor of religious programmes. When RTÉ unveiled a new-look 6pm TV Angelus, he argued that it is not the role of a public service broadcaster to take a Catholic call to prayer and turn it into something else.\n\nHe told Radio Kerry that the placement of a cross in Kerry Council chamber represents the promotion of the supremacy of one religion over other religions and none.\n\nWhen Atheist Ireland declined an invitation to take part in the Government’s commemorations of the 1916 Rising, Donald Clarke of the Irish Times said that Nugent and his team could hardly have seemed more out of touch if they’d sought to ban Christmas. \n\nNugent was given the award of International Atheist of the Year 2017 by the Kazimierz Lyszczynski Foundation in Warsaw, Poland, along with Fauzia Ilyas, founder of the Atheist & Agnostic Alliance Pakistan. He said that he accepted the award on behalf of all of the work done by everybody in Atheist Ireland.\n\nHe argued for secularism and ethical atheism and against blasphemy laws at the Freedom From Religion Convention in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. He spoke at the 2010 Gods and Politics international atheist conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nNugent spoke at the 2012 European Atheist Convention in Cologne, Germany, against blasphemy and apostasy laws. He said they were silly in western states and dangerous in Islamic states. He said on RTÉ that the Irish blasphemy law was influencing blasphemy debates at the United Nations and in Islamic countries. Speaking again in Germany in 2015, on the day of the Irish marriage equality referendum victory, he described the result as the start of the fall of Ireland’s religious Berlin Wall.\n\nHe and Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland briefed the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, before the UN questioned Ireland’s human rights record under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The following year, they briefed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, before the UN questioned Ireland’s human rights record, and told the Committee that Ireland repeatedly ignores the rights of atheists and non-Christian children in the education system. In 2016 they twice briefed the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, as the UN prepared to question Ireland’s human rights record under the Covenant the Rights of the Child, and the Universal Periodic Review process. \n\nNugent has spoken at several OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meetings in Warsaw, Poland, opposing discrimination against atheists and agnostics. He said that it was absurd to insist that we respect all religions and all prophets, and said that “we can respect your right to believe, while not respecting the content of your beliefs.” He addressed a meeting in Brussels at which the Presidents of the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council discussed the fight against poverty and social exclusion with representatives of philosophical non-confessional organisations.\n\nIn 2017 Nugent was part of a joint delegation from Atheist Ireland, the Evangelical Alliance of Ireland, and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Ireland, to the United Nations Humans Rights Committee when the UN was questioning Pakistan about its human rights record. The three groups raised issues related to freedom of religion and belief, the Pakistan blasphemy law, and related violence including mob lynchings of Ahmadis, forced conversions of Christians, and disappearances of secular bloggers.\n\nIn 2011 Nugent’s wife Anne Holliday died of cancer, after making plans to take her own life if she felt that she needed to. In 2012, Nugent, Tom Curran and Máirín de Burca founded Right To Die Ireland, a campaign group to legalise assisted suicide in Ireland. Tom Curran is the co-ordinator of Exit International Ireland, and Máirín De Burca is a former secretary of Official Sinn Féin. In 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that Tom Curran’s partner Marie Fleming did not have a constitutional right to assisted suicide, Nugent said on RTÉ that the law would have to catch up with the reality that terminally ill people will take their own ethical decisions based on their own personal conscience. In 2014, he told Today FM that the right to die is not merely about the act of dying, but also about the increased quality of life that comes from knowing that you have the option to end your suffering if you need to, and he told Newstalk radio that Right to Die Ireland was working with legal people and politicians to prepare a Bill on assisted dying for Dáil Éireann. In 2015, he welcomed California’s vote to legalise assisted suicide, and he told BBC Radio Ulster that changes in the law in the UK and Ireland were inevitable as society became more compassionate. In 2016, he told RTÉ that people who wanted palliative care should have the right to palliative care, that people who want to die in a way of their choosing should have that right, and that terminally ill people and their loved ones should absolutely break the law to avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nNugent has been profiled or interviewed in the \"Irish Times\", the \"Sunday Business Post\", the \"Sunday Independent\" and the \"BBC Mundo\" Spanish language website. He has been interviewed on various broadcast media including the BBC World Service, NPR's \"All Things Considered\", and RTÉ's \"Prime Time\", \"Ryan Tubridy\", \"Today with Pat Kenny\", \"Spirit Moves\", and \"Seoige and O'Shea\".\n\nNugent speaks and debates in Ireland and internationally. He has spoken in Ireland at Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Dublin Institute of Technology, University College Cork, National University of Ireland Galway and Maynooth, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Oireachtas Health Committee. He has addressed several United Nations human rights reviews in Geneva, Switzerland, and OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meetings in Warsaw, Poland. He has also spoken at the South Place Ethical Society in London, England in 2010; the Gods and Politics Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2010; the World Atheist Convention in Dublin, Ireland in 2011; the Muslim Debate Initiative in London, England in 2012; the European Atheist Conferences in Cologne, Germany in 2012 and 2015; the Oxford Union in England in 2013; the Freedom From Religion Foundation Convention in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA in 2014; the Rationalist International Conferences in Tallinn, Estonia in 2016, and Helsinki, Finland in 2017; the International Conference on Freedom of Conscience in London in 2017; the International Association of Freethought Congress in Paris in 2017, and the Days of Atheism in Warsaw, Poland in 2017 and 2018.\n\n"}

Particularly in Sufism it refers to a spiritual guide. The term is frequently used in Sufi orders such as the Qadiriyya, Chishtiya, Shadhiliya and Suhrawardiyya.\n\nThe path of Sufism starts when a student (Murid) takes an oath of allegiance or \"Bay'ah\" (\"bai'ath\") with a spiritual guide (\"murshid\"). In speaking of this initiatory pact of allegiance, the Qur’ ̄an (48:10) says: \"Verily they who pledge unto thee their allegiance pledge it unto none but God. The Hand of God is above their hands\".\n\nThe murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path, but \"only one who has himself reached the End of the path is a spiritual guide in the full sense of the Arabic term \"murshid\"\".\n\nA murshid usually has authorisation to be a teacher for one tariqa (spiritual paths). Any tariqa or silsila has one murshid at a time who is the head of the spiritual order. He is known as the \"shaykh, by way of \"khilafah\": process in which the \"shaykh\" identifies one of his disciples as his successor, for the khalifa.\n\nIn Sufism, it is the transmission of the divine light from the murshid's heart to the disciple's which surpasses any other source of knowledge and is the only way to progress directly towards the divine. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as \"Insan-e-Kamil\") is significant in most tariqas. The concept states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a Qutb or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet Mohammad.\n\n\n"}

Considered a visionary of his time, his \"Vivekachintamani\", written in encyclopaedic proportions and in prose style, and the \"Kaivalya Paddhati\", a musical treatise consisting of songs are considered his most enduring works.\n\nThe \"Vivekachintamani\", written in ten chapters, characterises by subject over 1500 topics including astronomy, medicine, poetics, erotica, musicology and dance-drama (\"natya shastra\"). Each topic is divided into sub-topics and each sub-topic is further divided into items. For example, the topic of poetics includes a sub-topical description of \"alamkara\" (figures of speech) which includes 65 types of \"alamkaras\". The writing was translated into Marathi language in 1604, and into Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century, an indication of its importance among medieval Kannada language writings.\n\nShivayogi authored a collection of songs in early 15th century called the \"Kaivalya Paddhati\" (\"lit\", \"Songs of the pathway to emancipation\"). These songs are best described as lyrical \"swara Vachanas\" (poems written to notes) set to various classical \"ragas\" (\"tunes\"). They are based on religious, philosophical and reflective themes and are quite unlike those composed by the contemporary Haridasas (devotee-saint-poets of the god Vishnu) of Karnataka. This work established Shivayogi as the originator of a mystical form of literature called \"Kaivalya Sahitya\" (\"lit\" \"Kaivalya literature\"), a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and Advaita philosophies, with an emphasis on knowledge as opposed to devotion. His influence on writers in the \"swara Vachana\" genre over the next three centuries is evident. Notable poets who were inspired by Shivayogi include Shadaksharadeva (Muppina Sadakshari), a contemporary poet, Chidananda Avadhuta (17th century), Sarpabhushana Shivayogi (18th century) and the itinerant poet Shishunala Sharif.\n\nThe \"Puratana Trividhi\" is a short work by him consisting of 77 \"tripadis\" (three-line verses) eulogising the 63 Nayanmars (devotee-saints of the Hindu god Shiva) of Tamil Nadu. His other compositions include \"Paramanubhava Bodhe\", \" Paramartha Gita\" and \"Anubhavasara\".\n\n"}
{"id": "38053200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38053200", "title": "Oikeiôsis", "text": "Oikeiôsis\n\nIn Stoic ethics, oikeiôsis (, ) is a technical term variously translated as \"appropriation,\" \"orientation,\" \"familiarization,\" \"affinity,\" \"affiliation,\" and \"endearment.\" \"Oikeiôsis\" signifies the perception of something as one’s own, as belonging to oneself. The theory of \"oikeiôsis\" can be traced back to the work of the first Stoic philosopher, Zeno of Citium.\nThe Stoic philosopher Hierocles saw it as the basis for all animal impulses as well as human ethical action. According to Porphyry, \"those who followed Zeno stated that \"oikeiôsis\" is the beginning of justice\".\n\n\"Oikeiôsis\" is rooted in the word \"oikos\" (οἶκος). Oikos is the word for household, house, or family, and can be seen in modern English words like economics and ecology (Greek oiko- to Classical Latin oeco- to Medieval Latin eco-). Similarly, the term \"Oikeiotes\" denotes the sense of belonging, the opposite of alienation. The term invokes the sense of being \"at home\", of belonging to and by extension becoming \"familiarized\" with something.\n\nIn his \"Elements of Ethics\" (), the philosopher Hierocles began his account of \"oikeiôsis\" by looking at the beginning of the life of animals. In the initial stage of perception, an animal is only aware of their bodies and sensations as \"belonging to itself\", this awareness is the \"proton oikeion\", the \"first thing that is one's own and familiar\". This self-awareness is continuous as well as dependent on the perception of external objects. This is why according to Hierocles, children are afraid of the dark, because their weak sense of self fears death in the absence of external entities. Hierocles argued that the impulse of self-preservation arises out of \"oikeiôsis\": \"an animal, when it has received the first perception of itself, immediately becomes its own and familiar to itself and to its constitution\". In perceiving itself and becoming familiar to itself, an animal finds value in itself and its own well-being.\n\nHierocles divided the many forms of \"Oikeiôsis\" as internal and external. Internal forms of \"oikeiôsis\" included appropriation of the self as well as of one's constitution, external forms included familiarization with other people and an orientation towards external goods. \"Oikeiôsis\" is the basis for Hierocles' theory of \"appropriate acts\" () because it is in \"accordance with nature\" since animals use appropriation to project themselves externally and thus care for others (such as their offspring). Stoics see these acts as a duty because, according to Cicero, \"all duties derive from principles of nature\". In Hierocles' other ethical work, \"On Appropriate acts\" (of which only fragments survive), he outlined a theory of duty based on concentric circles. Beginning with the self and then our immediate family, Hierocles outlined how humans can extend their \"oikeiôsis\" towards other human beings in widening circles, such as our ethnos and eventually the entire human race. The distance from the center acts as a standard by which we may measure the strength of our ties and therefore our duties towards other people. Hierocles argued that there was an ethical need for a \"contraction of circles\", to reduce the distance between the circles as much as possible and therefore increase our familiarization with all of mankind (while still retaining the strongest affinity within our immediate circle).\n"}
{"id": "16806446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16806446", "title": "Religion in Eritrea", "text": "Religion in Eritrea\n\nReligion in Eritrea mainly consists of Abrahamic faiths. Since May 2002, the Eritrean government has officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, the Evangelical Lutheran church, and Islam. All other faiths and denominations are in principle required to undergo a registration process; in practice they are not allowed to register. Among other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership to be allowed to worship.\n\nThere are two major religions in Eritrea, Islam and Christianity. However, the number of adherents is subject to debate. In 2010, the United States Department of State (USDoS) estimated that 50% of the population was Christian, around 48% was Muslim. According to the ACS-Italia, around 51.6% of Eritrea's population in 2017 adhered to Islam, and 46.4% followed Christianity. The remaining 2% of residents practiced other religions, including traditional faiths and animism.\n\nThe Kingdom of Aksum, covering much of modern-day Eritrea and the Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia, arose somewhere around the first or second centuries. The Aksumites erected a number of large stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. Over 200 years after the kingdom's formation, it adopted Christianity under King Ezana. Eritrea was also one of the first Islamic settlements in Africa, as a group of Muslims facing persecution in Mecca migrated to the Kingdom of Aksum.\n\nThe denominations of the religions in Eritrea also differ from source to source.\n\nFor Christianity the Pew Research Center indictes that, of the Eritrean population, 57.7% are Orthodox Christians, 4.6% are Roman Catholic, 0.7% are Protestants and less than 0.5% are other Christians. \"Eritrea: Religious Distribution\" gives 58% Orthodox, 5% Roman Catholic, less than 1% Protestant. The Department of State says that 30% are Orthodox, 13% Roman Catholic and others, which includes \"Protestants, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Buddhist, Hindus, and Baha'is\", at less than 5%.\n\nThe United States Department of State indicates that 50% of the population are Sunni Muslims but gives no figures for Shias, while a 2009 Pew Research Center report says that less than 1% are Shia.\n\nAround 0.9% of local residents follow traditional religions or other faiths. Atheism is low, while participation in religion is high among all ethnicities.\n\nAll religious groups other than the four officially recognised faiths—the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Islam, and the Roman Catholic Church—must be registered with the government of Eritrea. The government has refused to register any religious group despite some of them meeting the requirements.\n\nJudaism is thought to have existed as an important religion in Eritrea and Ethiopia before Christianity became the official religion of the Kingdom of Aksum (today's Ethiopia and Eritrea) in the early 4th century AD. Islam spread to Ethiopia and Eritrea around 615 AD with the arrival of Uthman ibn Affan, one of the \"Sahabah\" (companions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Uthman had been driven out of Saudi Arabia and found shelter at Axum in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia under the protection of the Axumite king, Aṣḥama ibn Abjar.\n\nAnother great power came in the person of the Imam of Harar in Ethiopia, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, also known as Ahmad Gurey or Gragn. Al-Ghazi led Muslim forces consisting of Somali, Harari, Oromo, Afar, Saho, Argobba, Hadiya, Silte and Gurage soldiers from present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia. The Ethiopian Christians are the Tigray-Tigrinya and the Amhara, while the Eritrean Christians are the Tigray-Tigrinya. In 1530 he began to attack the plateau. Within four years he laid waste to the majority of the Christian highlands, including the Tigray Region of Ethiopia and Eritrea. He converted hundreds of thousands of Christians to Islam by force. Only by surrender and conversion could people save their lives. Only the intervention of the Portuguese transformed the flow of events. They landed at Massawa in 1541 and helped the Eritreans and Ethiopians to drive the Imams forces from the plateau. The Muslim forces dispersed, retreated and disappeared.\n\nCatholicism was first brought to Eritrea by the Jesuits in 1600. In 1632, this order was expelled from Eritrea for wanting to convert the country (an Orthodox country) to Catholicism. In the 19th century the Italians began to bring Eritrea under their sphere of influence and introduced Roman Catholicism again. The Protestant presence in Eritrea is small. Missionaries appeared in the 19th century and established the Lutheran and Evangelical churches. These organizations have been allowed to continue to practice. New groups however, have been discouraged from establishing a base in Eritrea.\n\nChristianity is the religion of about 50% to 63% of the population of Eritrea. While elsewhere on the continent, Christianity in Africa was primarily introduced by European missionaries, this was not the case with the Tigray-Tigrinya people of Eritrea and Tigray Region in neighbouring Ethiopia (or with the Amhara people of Ethiopia). The ancient empire of the Kingdom of Aksum centered in north Tigray and the central highlands of Eritrea had intimate connections with the Mediterranean world in which Christianity grew. Christianity arrived in the Eritrean and Tigrayan area in the 4th century, growing dynamically in the pre-existing Jewish/Animistic mixed environment. The Tigrayan-Tigrinyas thus converted to Christianity centuries before most of Europe, thereby establishing one of the oldest state churches in the world. The Eritrean Orthodox have their origins in the 4th century Coptic mission of Syrian Frumentius in East Africa, when the first Archbishop was elected for the Aksumite Empire, under Ezana of Axum (r. 320-360). Among ecclesiastical buildings, most notable date from the 6th to the 14th centuries; for example Libanos, Bizen and Sina.\n\nThe majority of Christians are found in the Eritrean Highlands found in southern, central and parts of northern Eritrea. A majority of the Tigrinya who constitute almost 60% of the population are Christian. The majority of the Kunama are Catholic, with a small minority of Muslims and some who practice traditional indigenous religions. Approximately 40% of the Bilen are Christian, the majority being Catholic.\n\nAccording to some sources, Orthodox Christians make up 57.7% of the population. A majority of the Christian population of Eritrea belongs to the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which used to belong to the formerly Coptic Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Eritrean Church was recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria following independence in 1993, and in 1994 the two neighbouring churches affirmed their respective status. In April 1998 the former Archbishop Abune Phillipos of Asmara was elevated to the rank of Patriarch. He died in 2004 and was succeeded by Abune Yacob. The reign of Abune Yacob as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by Abune Antonios as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected on 5 March 2004, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of the Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 24 April 2004. Pope Shenouda III presided at the ceremony in Asmara, together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a Coptic Orthodox Church delegation. He was later formally deposed by the government. However many believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed and still consider him Patriarch. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters.\n\nCatholics make up 4.6% of the Eritrean population. The Eritrean Catholic Church and Roman Catholic Church has dioceses of Asmara, Keren and Barentu. Catholics in Eritrea mainly follow the Ge'ez variant of the Alexandrian Rite, but the Roman Rite is also used. There are four territorial jurisdictions in the country known as eparchies. Before the era of Italian Eritrea, Roman Catholicism was already introduced into the country by Saint Justin de Jacobis and the Vincentian Fathers. Today the church is a distinctly Eritrean church, using the Ge'ez language in the liturgy, although Mass (liturgy) Masses continue to be celebrated also in Italian and Latin for the small Italian and Italo-Eritrean community, mainly in Asmara. When Eritrea was an Italian colony, all the colonists and the Italian military were of the Latin Church: in 1940 they constituted 11% of the total population. The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary was their main church. So, in the early 1940s Catholicism was the religion of nearly 28% of people in the colony of Italian Eritrea.\n\nProtestants, sometimes known by the slang name \"P'ent'ay\", in Eritrea make up between less than 1% to 5% of the Christians. A minor church is the Kale Hiywot Church of Eritrea. Protestant denominations include Christian Brethren, Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. In 1926, Swedish missionaries founded the Evangelical/Lutheran Church of Eritrea. However there was tension between the Catholic Church as the Roman Catholic Italians resisted and discouraged the spread of Protestantism in their colony and even lay prohibitions and numerous constraints on the activities of the Swedish missionaries. The Lutheran Church of Eritrea and its Swedish and Eritrean missionaries were the ones who translated the Bible from Ge'ez language only understood by higher clergymen, into the Tigrinya language and other local languages and their main goal was to reach and \"enlighten\" as many people as possible in the world through education.\n\nIslam accounts for approximately 36% to 50% of the population. More than 99% of Eritrean Muslims practice Sunni Islam.\n\nIslam first arrived to the region when immigrants from Mecca, persecuted by the ruling Quraysh tribe were accepted into the Aksumite Empire by whom Arabic tradition has named Aṣḥama ibn Abjar, and he settled them in Negash, located in what is today the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Muhammad himself instructed his followers who came to Aksum, to respect and protect Aksum as well as live in peace with Aksumite Christians. In the late 11th century, a Muslim sultanate was founded in Dahlak. Islam later spread in Eritrea under the Ottoman Empire when ethnic groups like the Tigre people in mainland Eritrea began converting to Islam. In the late 19th century, during the reign of Emperor Yohannes IV, who was a devoutly Christian Tigrayan, Muslim Tigrayans were forcibly expelled from their homes and found refuge in the nearby northern areas in what is now Eritrea, out of reach of royal Ethiopian authority.\n\nThe majority of Muslims in Eritrea inhabit the eastern, coastal lowlands as well as the western lowlands near the border with Sudan. Most belong to various Afro-Asiatic communities, especially the Tigre, Saho, Afar, Rashaida, Beja and Bilen ethnic groups. About 5% of the Tigrinya are also Muslims; they are known as the Jeberti, though they claim a different ethnic background from the Biher-Tigrinya; the Rashaida are an Arab tribe who migrated from Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, many of the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nara ethnic minorities also adhere to Islam, as do some of the Kunama Nilotes.\n\nIt is believed that before Christianity became the official religion of Abyssinia (ancient Eritrea and northern Ethiopia) in the 4th century, Judaism had a heavy presence in Eritrea. Those who refused to embrace the new religion were compelled to seek refuge in the mountains of southern Ethiopia. This explains the concentration of Jews known as Beta Israel or \"Falasha\" in Gondar, Ethiopia and southern Tigray. However, there was not much oppression against ethnic Jews.\n\nThe present Eritrean Jewish community is believed to be started by Yemenite Jews from Yemen attracted by new commercial opportunities driven by Italian colonial expansion in the late 19th Century. The Jewish population then later increased from European refugees coming to Eritrea to escape the anti-Semitic regimes in Europe at the time. Many returned to Israel in 1948. During British administration, Eritrea was often used as a location of exile for Irgun and Lehi guerrillas. Among those imprisoned was future Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir and Haim Corfu, a founder of Beitar Jerusalem. In 1961 the Eritrean War of Independence began after Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia. It was then that Jews began to leave Eritrea. In the early 1970s, Jewish emigration increased because of ensuing violence between Eritrea and Ethiopia (up to and beyond Eritrea's official declaration of independence in 1993). Judaism is not one of the four religions recognized by the Eritrean government and indeed, as of 2006 there was only one last native Jew left in Eritrea - Sami Cohen, who attends to the Asmara Synagogue and cemetery.\n\nThe highland region is predominantly Christian while Muslims predominate in the east and west lowlands.\n\nAmong the ethnic groups of Eritrea the Tigrinya are mainly Orthodox Christian and Catholic and an exception to this is the Jeberti people (Djiberti Tigrinya) who are Muslim . More than 50% of the Kunama people are Catholic, with a sizable minority of Muslims and some who practice traditional religions. Approximately 40% of the Bilen people are Christian, the majority being Catholic, but most are Muslim. Along with the Bilen, most members of the Tigre, Saho, Nara, Afar, Rashaida and Beja ethnic groups are Muslim.\n\nThe Christian Tigrinyas along with some Muslim Djiberti Tigrinya and Saho live in the central and southern highlands. The eastern lowlands are inhabited by the Afar, the Rashaida along with some of the Saho and Tigre. The border formed between the western lowlands and the central highlands are the home to the Bilen who are concentrated in the Keren area. The area is also home to a large minority of Tigre and Tigrinya. The western lowlands are home to the Beja, Kunama, Nara and the majority of Tigre.\n\nEritrea officially recognizes only the Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Christian churches and Sunni Islam. Certain religious groups are reported to be persecuted by the current Eritrean Government. These groups include independent Non-Evangelical Protestants and Wahabi Muslims suspected of being linked to armed Islamist or the mainly Muslim Eritrean Liberation Front opposition groups. Those practicing religions that are not recognized face imprisonment. Human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented serious violations of the right to freedom of religion. They report disruption of private worship, mass arrests of participants at religious weddings, prayer meetings, and other gatherings. Amnesty reports that over 1,750 members of unregistered churches and suspect Muslims have been detained, typically without charges and for an indefinite period of time. This figure includes women and children.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses report that police raided a private home on 28 June 2009, where Jehovah's Witnesses were meeting, resulting in several arrests. They also report that three members were arrested in Eritrea in 1994 and that they remain imprisoned without trial. In April 2014, 121 members were arrested while attending religious services; by 25 July 2014, 73 members had been imprisoned for conducting secret religious gatherings, engaging in religious activity, and for refusing to undertake national service.\n"}
{"id": "6817069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6817069", "title": "Religious views of George Washington", "text": "Religious views of George Washington\n\nThe religious views of George Washington have long been debated. Washington attended the Anglican Church all of his life and was baptized as an infant. As a young man he also joined the Freemasons which also promoted spiritual and moral values for society. While some of the Founding Fathers, such as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Patrick Henry were noted for writing about religion, Washington rarely discussed his religious and philosophical views. His personal letters and public speeches sometimes referred to \"Providence.\" He was a member of several churches which he attended, and served as an Anglican vestryman and warden for more than fifteen years when Virginia had an established church.\n\nWashington's great-great-grandfather, Lawrence Washington, was an Anglican rector in England.\n\nGeorge Washington was baptized in infancy into the Church of England, which, until 1776, was the established church of Virginia. As the British monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and its clergy swear an Oath of Supremacy to the monarch, the American churches established the Episcopal Church after the American Revolution. The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1786) disestablished the Church, although it retained some lands which had been purchased with public monies. (The denominations that share the Church of England tradition are associated through the Anglican Communion).\n\nAs an adult, Washington served as a member of the vestry (lay council) for his local parish. Office-holding qualifications at all levels—including the House of Burgesses, to which Washington was elected in 1758—required affiliation with the current state religion and an undertaking that one would neither express dissent nor do anything that did not conform to church doctrine. At the library of the New-York Historical Society, some manuscripts containing a leaf from the church record of Pohick were available to Benson Lossing, an American historian, which he included in his \"Field Book of the Revolution\"; the leaf contained the following signed oath, required to qualify individuals as vestrymen:\n\nWashington served as a vestryman or warden for more than 15 years. The Vestry in Virginia was the governing body of each church.\n\nWashington paid for pews at several churches. Rev. Lee Massey, his pastor wrote, \"I never knew so constant an attendant in church as Washington.\" However, Washington's personal diaries indicate that he did not regularly attend services while home at Mount Vernon, spending most Sundays writing letters, conducting business, fox-hunting, or doing other activities. Biographer Paul Leicester Ford wrote:\n\nHis daily \"where and how my time is spent\" tells how often he attended church, and in the year 1760 he went sixteen times, and in 1768 he went fourteen.\n\nWhile he was at Mount Vernon, his first parish was Pohick Church, from Mt. Vernon; his second parish in Alexandria was away.\n\nWhen traveling, particularly on political business, he was more likely to attend church services. In the seven Sundays during the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, he went to church on three, attending Anglican, Quaker, and Catholic services. During his tours of the nation in his two terms as President, he attended religious services in each city, sometimes as frequently as three services in a day.\n\nThe record of Washington receiving communion was spotty. Ministers at four of the churches Washington often attended wrote that he regularly left services before communion.\n\nAfter the religious ceremony and Pulpit service Washington, along with the greater congregation, would exit the church, leaving wife Martha with the communicants to receive communion. In one definitive case a Pastor James Abercrombie of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, in Philadelphia took exception to the advent and, considering it his duty, said in one of his sermons that he was unhappy to see people in elevated stations not set an example by receiving communion. He later admitted that the remark was intended for the President, and indeed Washington had assumed the remark was aimed at him. Washington later discussed the incident with a Congressman at a dinner and related to him that he had honored the preacher for his integrity and candour, and that he had never considered that his example was of any influence. Never being a communicant, Washington felt that if he were to begin it would be seen as an ostentatious display of a President flaunting his religion soley prompted by the Pastor's remarks. Historian Paul F. Boller suggests that Washington, a man who had help to promote a major war, refrained from receiving communion from the idea that his heart and mind were not in \"a proper condition to receive the sacrament,\" and that Washington simply did not want to indulge in something he regarded to be an act of hypocrisy on his part. After the incident it is believed that Washington completely stopped attending that church on communion Sundays.\n\nIn 1915 the great-grandson of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton reported that when he was 7 years old and she was 97 years old (about 1854) she said, \"If anyone ever tells you that George Washington was not a communicant in the Church, you say that your great-grandmother told you to say that she 'had knelt at this chancel rail at his side and received with him the Holy Communion.'\"\n\nLong after Washington died, when asked about Washington's beliefs, Abercrombie replied: \"Sir, Washington was a Deist!\" Nonetheless, it was also not uncommon in those days for churchgoers to pass on participating in communion.\n\nWashington was a devoted member of the Anglican Church. As an infant he was baptized in April 1732.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War it has been suggested that Washington was again baptized by the Baptist chaplain to the Continental Army John Gano at Valley Forge. Washington biographer Rupert Hughes determined that Rev. Gano served with Clinton's army, not with Washington's, that the location is sometimes given as Valley Forge and sometimes as the Potomac, that there is no documentation of Gano ever being at Valley Forge, that there is nothing in Gano's own correspondence or his biography to suggest that the event took place, and that none of the 42 reputed witnesses ever documented the event.\nIn William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri there is a painting of Gano baptizing Washington. The school takes no stance on whether the baptism of Washington actually took place.\n\nWashington used the word \"God\" 146 times in his personal and public writings, many of which were in his public speeches and while some were regularly used phrases such as \"thank God,\" \"God knows,\" \"for God's sake,\" or \"my God!\" there are many other examples where Washington used thoughtful expressions about God and His Providence. \n\nFrom his Head Quarters in New York, July 9, 1776, Washington issued a General Order: (Excerpt) ... \"The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary but especially so in times of public distress and danger—The General hopes and trusts, that every officer and man, will endeavour so to live, and act, as becomes a Christian Soldier defending the dearest Rights and Liberties of his country.\" Throughout his life, Washington spoke of the value of righteousness, and of seeking and offering thanks for the \"blessings of Heaven.\" Washington often spoke of \"Providence.\" Historian and Philosopher Michael Novak writes that Anglican laymen of that period rarely invoked the name of Jesus Christ. The most famous reference came in a 1779 letter to a delegation of Native Americans. The letter was in the handwriting of an aide, and the leading biographers, including Chernow, Henriques and Freeman, say that the aide wrote it, not Washington.:\n\nYou do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. Congress will do every thing they can to assist you in this wise intention; and to tie the knot of friendship and union so fast, that nothing shall ever be able to loose it.\n\nWhen Congress authorized a day of fasting in 1778, Washington told his soldiers:\n\nThe Honorable Congress having thought proper to recommend to The United States of America to set apart Wednesday the 22nd. instant to be observed as a day of Fasting, Humiliation and Prayer, that at one time and with one voice the righteous dispensations of Providence may be acknowledged and His Goodness and Mercy toward us and our Arms supplicated and implored; The General directs that this day also shall be religiously observed in the Army, that no work be done thereon and that the Chaplains prepare discourses suitable to the Occasion.\n\nWashington believed in the importance of religion for republican government. His 1796 Farewell Address, written by Alexander Hamilton and revised by himself, said that it was unrealistic to expect that a whole nation, whatever might be said of minds of peculiar structure, could long be moral without religion, that national morality is necessary for good government, and that politicians should cherish religion's support of national morality:\n\nWashington rejected an additional sentence, also written by Alexander Hamilton, with a stronger sentiment: \"does it [national morality] not require the aid of a generally received and divinely authoritative Religion?\"\n\nFor decades, Washington was credited with starting the tradition of adding the words \"so help me, God\" to the presidential inaugural oath, although experts at the Library of Congress, the U.S. Senate Historical Office, and Mount Vernon have said there is no evidence to support that claim. None of the detailed contemporaneous eyewitness accounts of the first inauguration mentioned that Washington had used that expression, and it is not part of the text of the inaugural oath prescribed by the Constitution. The first authors to state that Washington added the words were Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1854 and Washington Irving in 1857. (According to the Library of Congress, the earliest documented use of that phrase during an inauguration was by President Chester Arthur, almost a century after Washington's first inauguration.)\n\nIn his first inaugural address, Washington stressed his belief that the new nation \"was under the special agency of Providence.\"\n\nWashington made several statements as General of the Army which mentioned religion. Sparks quotes orders given by General Washington to his Army requiring them to attend to their religious duties and \"to implore the blessing of Heaven\" upon the American Army.\n\nEarly in his presidency, at the request of Congress, he issued the first National Thanksgiving Proclamation on October 3, 1789. The proclamation was sent to the governors of the states, and assigns the day upon which \"the people of these States\" devote themselves in service to \"that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.\" It urges the people in the young country to express their gratitude to God for: his protection of them through the Revolutionary War and the peace they had experienced since; for allowing the Constitution to be composed in a \"peaceable and rational manner;\" for the \"civil and religious liberty\" they possessed; and \"in general, for all the great and various favors which He has been pleased to confer upon us.\" The proclamation also states that \"it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor.\" It ends by calling the people of the United States to prayer and to beseech God \"to pardon our national and other transgressions;\" to allow the national government to be wise and just; to \"protect and guide\" all nations; to promote \"true religion and virtue, and the increase of science;\" and to \"grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as He alone knows to be best.\"\n\nIn his letters to young people, particularly to his adopted children, Washington urged upon them truth, character, honesty, but said little or nothing related to specific items of religious practice. Analysts who have studied Washington's papers held by the Library of Congress say that his correspondence with Masonic Lodges is filled with references to the \"Great Architect of the Universe.\"\n\nPrayers said to have been composed by him in his later life are highly edited. An unfinished book of Christian prayers attributed to him (as a youth) by a collector (around 1891) was rejected by Worthington C. Ford, editor of an edition of Washington's papers, and the Smithsonian Institution for lack of authenticity. Comparisons to documents Washington wrote show that it is not in his handwriting.\n\nIn a letter to George Mason in 1785, he wrote that he was not among those alarmed by a bill \"making people pay towards the support of that [religion] which they profess\", but felt that it was \"impolitic\" to pass such a measure, and wished it had never been proposed, believing that it would disturb public tranquility.\n\nWashington held that all religions, and nearly all religious practices, were beneficial to humans. On some occasions, such as during the Constitutional Convention, he attended Presbyterian, Catholic, and Friends Sunday services.\nWashington was an early supporter of religious toleration and freedom of religion. In 1775, he ordered that his troops not show anti-Catholic sentiments by burning the pope in effigy on Guy Fawkes Night. When acquiring workmen for Mount Vernon, he wrote to his agent, \"If they be good workmen, they may be from Asia, Africa, or Europe; they may be Mohammedans <nowiki>[</nowiki>Muslims], Jews, or Christians of any sect, or they may be Atheists.\" In 1790, Washington expressed his support for religious tolerance where in a letter to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, he stated, \"May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\" The phrase “under his own vine and fig tree” is from the Hebrew Bible (Micah 4:4).\n\nWashington was an officer in the Freemasons, an organization which, at the time Washington lived, required that its members \"will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine\", which meant that they should believe in God, regardless of other religious convictions or affiliations.\n\nSome biographers hold the opinion that many of the American Founding Fathers (and especially Washington) believed that, as leaders of the nation, they should remain silent on questions of doctrine and denomination, to avoid creating unnecessary divisiveness within the nation; instead they should promote the virtues taught by religion in general.\n\nEyewitness accounts exist of Washington engaging in morning devotions. Jared Sparks recorded the following account from Washington's nephew George W. Lewis: \"Mr. Lewis said he had accidentally witnessed [Washington's] private devotions in his library both morning and evening; that on those occasions he had seen him in a kneeling position with a Bible open before him and that he believed such to have been his daily practice.\" Sparks also reports that Washington's adopted daughter, Nelly Custis-Lewis, in response to his request for information on Washington's religions views, wrote, \"He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles (a one-way journey of 2–3 hours by horse or carriage). In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness].\" She continued by saying \"No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect.\" She added: \"I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, that they may be seen of men.\" In closing, Nelly attempted to answer the question of whether General Washington was a Christian. She responded, \"Is it necessary that any one should certify, 'General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?' As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, 'Deeds, not Words;' and, 'For God and my Country.'\"\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, General Robert Porterfield stated he \"found him on his knees, engaged in his morning's devotions.\" Alexander Hamilton corroborated Porterfield's account, stating \"such was his most constant habit.\" A French citizen who knew Washington well during the Revolutionary War and the presidency stated \"Every day of the year, he rises at five in the morning; as soon as he is up, he dresses, then prays reverently to God.\" Indeed, Washington had purchased a prayer book \"with the New Version of Psalms & good plain Type\" a few years before the Revolutionary War.\n\nOn February 1, 1800, a few weeks after Washington's death, Thomas Jefferson made the following entry in his journal, regarding an incident on the occasion of Washington's departure from office:\n\nIn the 1840s, abolitionist newspapers printed interviews with and testimony of Oney Judge, a slave who escaped from the Washingtons in 1796. One such article, from the \"Granite Freeman\", stated: \"she never heard Washington pray, and does not believe that he was accustomed to. 'Mrs. Washington used to read prayers, but I don't call that praying.'\" (It should be kept in mind that reading printed prayers is typical Anglican practice.) In another case, the Rev. Benjamin Chase, in a letter to \"The Liberator\", wrote that \"She says that the stories told of Washington's piety and prayers, so far as she ever saw or heard while she was his slave, \"have no foundation\". Card-playing and wine-drinking were the business at his parties, and he had more of such company Sundays than on any other day.\" In both cases it should be borne in mind that these statements were intended to disparage Washington's character in so far as he held slaves; for example, Chase continues, \"I do not mention this as showing, in my estimation, his anti-Christian character, so much as the bare fact of being a slaveholder, and not a hundredth part so much as trying to kidnap this woman; but, in the minds of the community, it will weigh infinitely more.\"\n\nEven during his lifetime, people were unsure of the degree to which Washington believed in Christianity. As noted above, some of his contemporaries called him a deist. Debate continues to this day regarding whether he is best categorized as a deist or as a Christian, and some writers have introduced other terms to describe a blending of the two.\n\nDeism was an influential worldview during his lifetime. There is no known record of Washington ever using \"Jesus\" or \"Christ\" in private or public writings or speeches. One document he signed but did not write did say to the Delaware Indian chiefs that learning the \"religion of Jesus Christ\" is the most important thing they can do. It is not true that Washington avoided the word \"God\" and instead used different words. In actuality Washington used \"God\" 146 times in his personal and public writings. Some of these references to \"God\" are stock phrases like \"God forbid\" or \"God be with you\". Some instances are serious expressions about God and especially His Providence, a common theme among Deists. Washington used words such as \"Grand Architect\" and \"Providence\" that were popular among deists. These terms were also commonly used by the Freemasons. While deists and Freemasons did use these words, words like \"Providence\" specifically were not exclusively used by deists and Freemasons, but were also used by Christians during Washington's time period.\n\nHistorian Fred Anderson says that Washington's Providence was, \"a generally benevolent, as well as an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being, but He was hardly the kind of warm and loving God embraced by the evangelical Protestants.\"\n\nPaul F. Boller, Jr. stated \"Washington was no infidel, if by infidel is meant unbeliever. Washington had an unquestioning faith in Providence and, as we have seen, he voiced this faith publicly on numerous occasions. That this was no mere rhetorical flourish on his part, designed for public consumption, is apparent from his constant allusions to Providence in his personal letters. There is every reason to believe, from a careful analysis of religious references in his private correspondence, that Washington's reliance upon a Grand Designer along Deist lines was as deep-seated and meaningful for his life as, say, Ralph Waldo Emerson's serene confidence in a Universal Spirit permeating the ever shifting appearances of the everyday world.\"\n\nDavid L. Holmes, author of \"The Faiths of the Founding Fathers\", in a sidebar article for Britannica categorizes Washington as a Christian deist. His usage of this category implies a religious spectrum of sorts for deism. Holmes also distinguishes between strict deists and orthodox Christians by their church attendance, participation in religious rites (such as baptism, Holy Communion, and confirmation), the use of religious language, and opinions of contemporary family, friends, clergy, and acquaintances. Regarding these specific parameters, Holmes describes Washington as a Christian deist due to his religious behavior falling somewhere between that of an orthodox Christian and a strict deist. Although Washington was clearly not a communicant, was infrequent in his Church attendance, and did not deem it necessary to participate in religious rites, Holmes labels him as a Christian deist due to his references of God, which resemble strict deistic terminology yet add a Christian dimension of mercy and divine nature. Additionally, Holmes states that Washington's \"dedication to Christianity was clear in his own mind\" as to imply that Washington's own religious self-analysis should be deemed at least as noteworthy as that of critics who claim he was unorthodox.\n\nHistorian and Washington specialist Frank E. Grizzard, Jr. highlights \"Providence\" as the central feature of Washington's religious faith, noting that \"Providence\" was Washington's most often-used term for God.\n\nIn 2006 Peter Lillback, the president of Westminster Theological Seminary, published a lengthy book through his own non-profit organization on the subject of Washington's religious beliefs. The book, \"George Washington's Sacred Fire\", proposed that Washington was an orthodox Christian within the framework of his time; it gained attention through promotion on Glenn Beck's show. Lillback claims he disproved the deist hypothesis. Lillback has explained more recently that evidence unavailable to earlier historians shows that\n\nWashington referred to himself frequently using the words \"ardent,\" \"fervent,\" \"pious,\" and \"devout.\" There are over one hundred different prayers composed and written by Washington in his own hand, with his own words, in his writings...Although he never once used the word \"Deist\" in his voluminous writings, he often mentioned religion, Christianity, and the Gospel...Historians ought no longer be permitted to do the legerdemain of turning Washington into a Deist even if they found it necessary and acceptable to do so in the past. Simply put, it is time to let the words and writings of Washington's faith speak for themselves. \n\nBiographer Barry Schwartz has stated that Washington's \"practice of Christianity was limited and superficial, because he was not himself a Christian. In the enlightened tradition of his day, he was a devout Deist—just as many of the clergymen who knew him suspected,\"\n\nTwo recent books exploring Washington's religious beliefs—\"Realistic Visionary\" by Peter Henriques, and \"Faith and the Presidency\" by Gary Scott Smith—both categorize Washington as a \"theistic rationalist\" which is described as a hybrid belief system somewhere between strict deism and orthodox Christianity, with rationalism as the predominant element.\nThe term itself is not known to have been in use during Washington's lifetime.\n\nHistorian and Philosopher Michael Novak maintains that Washington could not have been strictly a Deist, but was a Christian:\n\nWhat we did prove, and quite conclusively, is that Washington cannot be called a Deist—at least, not in a sense that excludes his being Christian. Although he did most often address God in the proper names a Deist might use—such as \"Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be\" and \"Disposer of all human events\"—the actions that Washington expected God to perform, as expressed both in his official public prayers (whether as general or as president) and in his private prayers as recorded, are the sorts of actions only the God of the Bible performs: interposing his actions in human events, forgiving sins, enlightening minds, bringing good harvests, intervening on behalf of one party in a struggle between good and evil (in this case, between liberty and the deprivation of liberty), etc. Many persons at the end of the 18th century were both Christians and Deists. But it cannot be said, in the simpleminded sense in which historians have become accustomed to putting it, that Washington was merely a Deist, or even that the God to whom he prayed was expected to behave like a Deist God at all.\n\nBiographer Ron Chernow, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"\", has acknowledged the profound role Christianity played in Washington's life through the 18th-century Virginian Anglican/Episcopalian church:\n\nIn 2012, historian Gregg Frazer argued that Washington was not a deist but a \"theistic rationalist.\" This theological position rejected core beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ, the Trinity and Original Sin. However, unlike the deists, the theological rationalists believed in the efficacy of prayer to God.\n\nOn his death bed, Washington did not summon a minister or priest. After his death, he was buried according to the rite of the Episcopal Church, with the Rev. Thomas Davis, rector of Christ Church, Alexandria, officiating. Masonic rites were also performed by members of his lodge.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7792391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7792391", "title": "Sexuality and Mormonism", "text": "Sexuality and Mormonism\n\nSexuality has a prominent role within the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which teaches that gender is defined in the premortal existence, and that part of the purpose of mortal life is for men and women to be sealed together, forming bonds that allow them to progress eternally together in the afterlife. It also teaches that sexual relations within the framework of opposite-sex marriage is healthy, necessary, and ordained of God. In contrast with some orthodox Christian movements, sexuality in the Church's theology is neither a product of original sin nor a \"necessary evil\". In accordance with the law of chastity, LDS Church doctrine bars sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to obey what it calls the law of chastity, which is a code of morality and modesty. Under this code, all members are taught to be \"morally clean in their thoughts, words, and actions\" and to abstain from pornography. Violations of this code include \"adultery, being without natural affection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication. They included all sexual relations outside marriage—petting, sex perversion, and preoccupation with sex in one’s thoughts and talking.\" \n\nThough celestial marriage is the only form of marriage recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, common law marriage, civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication. Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty, which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses of the law of chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.\n\nLGBT members of the church are expected to keep the law of chastity. The church characterizes its church discipline policy as neutral regarding sexual orientation. If gay or lesbian members desire to enter into a heterosexual marriage, they are advised that they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate. Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether the participants are married or not, is grounds for church discipline. Participation in \"repeated homosexual activities (by adults)\" results in the First Presidency making a permanent special annotation to a person's membership record. In most cases, gay or lesbian sex bars a person, permanently, from serving as a church missionary.\n\nOn many occasions church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the law of chastity. Salient examples of this include a church guide to stop masturbating produced in the 1970s. Another is the 1990 edition of the church's youth guidelines pamphlet which stated that the \"Lord specifically forbids ... masturbation\" with the next two editions (including the most current one) alluding to it with statements forbidding anything that \"arouses\" any sexual feelings or emotions in one's \"own body\". Apostle Spencer W. Kimball, who later served as church president, warned of the \"possible damages\" and \"dangers\" of this \"common indescretion\" on various occasions calling it a \"reprehensible sin\" that grows \"with every exercise\". The apostle Boyd Packer gave a 1976 general conference address \"To Young Men Only\" warning young men not to tamper with their little factory (a euphemism for their reproductive system) lest it speed up and become a guilt- and depression-inducing habit that is not easy to resist. He gave vigorous exercise as a method to help control thoughts and break the habit of masturbation since it is a \"transgression\" that is \"not pleasing to the Lord\". The talk was printed as a pamphlet and widely distributed by the church from 1980 to 2016. Since 1985 the church has provided a manual for parents to use in discussing sexuality with their children. The manual includes statements that \"prophets have condemned [masturbation] as a sin\" and \"perversion of the body's passions\" that causes one to \"become carnal\". The most recent explicit mention of masturbation by top leaders in public discourse was by Tad R. Callister who stated in a 2013 speech at BYU-Idaho that God \"condemns self-abuse\" (a euphemism for masturbation).\n\nChurch leaders have stated that outside of marriage \"passionate kisses\", defined as \"more intense and last[ing] longer than a brief kiss\", and \"prolonged kisses that involve the tongue and excite the passions\" are \"off limits\". For example, church president Spencer Kimball, called the \"soul kiss\" an \"abomination\" that leads to necking, petting, and \"illegitimate babies\". He further stated that even when dating for a time a kiss should be a \"clean, decent, sexless one like the kiss between a mother and son\". He also stated that kissing during casual dating is \"asking for trouble\" and that kisses should not be \"handed out like pretzels\". Apostle Richard Scott advised that physical expressions of romantic feelings between unmarried individuals should be kept to \"those that are comfortable in the presence of your parents\".\n\nChurch leaders have also condemned erotic touching outside of heterosexual marriage using terms like \"necking\" for general kissing and stroking of areas outside of the breasts, buttocks, or groin region, and \"petting\" for \"fondling a member of the opposite sex in areas that are private, personal, and sacred\" whether under or over clothing. Necking (passionate kissing with intimate touching) has been called an \"insidious practice\" while petting was called \"sinful\" and \"an abomination before God\". Despite the policies on extramarital sex and making out, a 2007 survey of over 1,000 BYU students showed that 4% of single women and 3% of single men had participated in oral sex or intercourse while dating. Additionally, 54% of men and 46% of women BYU students reported \"making out and intense kissing\" while dating.\n\nIn the early 1980s the church explicitly banned oral sex even for married couples as it was considered an \"unnatural, impure, or unholy practice\" which reflects verbiage for sexual misconduct in the Church Handbook of Instructions. In a 5 January 1982 First Presidency letter to bishops and other local leaders it was explicitly stated that members who participated in any oral sex were barred from the temple unless they \"repented and discontinued\" this practice. A follow-up letter nine months later on 15 October 1982 stated that the First Presidency had received numerous complaints of church leaders inappropriately \"delving into private, sensitive matters\" and directed leaders to never inquire with \"explicit questions\" about \"intimate matters involving marital relations\". The oral sex ban, however, was neither removed, modified, or clarified as the only additional directive to leaders was that \"if the member has enough anxiety about the propriety of the conduct to ask about it, the best course would be to discontinue it\".\n\nSubsequent discussion of marital sex warned against behaviors that the church considered unnatural, impure, and unholy including Spencer Condie's warning that when couples \"participate in unholy practices\" during their physical intimacy it can become a \"disruptive force\" in their marriage. When discussing physical intimacy a 2003 church manual on marriage quotes church president Spencer Kimball who stated that the idea that \"behind the bedroom doors anything goes\" is not true nor condoned by the Lord and \"if it is unnatural, you just don't do it\". Previous to this more public ban, in a private letter dated 17 May 1973, church President Harold Lee called \"oral lovemaking\" a \"degrading\" \"perversion\" that was \"abhorrent in the sight of the Lord\". In a popular book sold by the church's bookstore and cowritten by a BYU professor the authors state that oral sex is unworthy and impure for married couples. An LDS magazine published a bishop's teaching in 2013 that oral sex was forbidden. Two BYU graduate Mormon sex therapists, however, publicly stated in 2013 that oral sex was okay for married couples as did another LDS therapist in 2014.\n\nLDS church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature and visual material for decades. They have compared pornography to a plague or epidemic that is overpoweringly addictive like hard drugs such as cocaine on multiple occasions. They've also stated that viewing erotic material can become a habit that's \"almost impossible to break\" which can metaphorically \"blast a crater\" in the brain. The church hosts meetings and has a website to assist members who wish to curb their consumption of pornographic material, and has asked church members to attend an anti-pornography rally. Church leaders have also stated that women who dress immodestly become pornography to men around them.\n\nThe Church Handbook for leaders states that the three bishopric members should ensure that members from ages 12 to 17 are interviewed twice a year during which they are to discuss the \"importance of obeying the commandments, particularly ... refraining from any kind of sexual activity, and refraining from viewing, reading, or listening to pornographic material.\" It also states that disciplinary council should not be called for members \"who are struggling with pornography or self-abuse.\"\n\nSociological research into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% of the sample considered viewing pornography \"unacceptable\". However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the entire sample reporting viewing pornography at least once in the last month. No data was collected on female students. A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest subscription rate of any state. The state's LDS governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016. In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn addictiveness and relationship anxiety. The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any potential negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material. Additionally, individuals reporting higher religiosity were more likely to consider themselves addicted to porn regardless of their comparative usage rate.\n\nCurrently and in the past LDS church leaders have forbidden dancing that includes full-body contact or is suggestive of sexual behavior. One youth guide stated that these unapproved movements deemed vulgar included shoulder or hip shaking, body jerking, crouching, slumping over, and backbending.\n\nIn the past the use of family planning birth control methods including artificial contraception was explicitly condemned by LDS church leaders. Beginning in July 1916 apostles were quoted stating that birth control was a \"pernicious doctrine\" and that \"limiting the number of children in a family...is sinful\". The first time that any approval of a non-abstinence fertility control method was publicly expressed occurred in a 1942 Improvement Era article in which Apostle John Widtsoe mentioned the rhythm method as an acceptable means of spacing children. In his influential 1956 treatise \"Doctrines of Salvation\", then apostle Joseph Fielding Smith called birth control a wickedness which leads to damnation and caused the downfall of nations. He further stated that an LDS couple that deliberately prevents themselves from having more children after their second or third child is guilty of iniquity which must be punished. The 1958 edition of McConkie's popular book Mormon Doctrine stated that all those using condoms or other artificial contraception are \"in rebellion against God and are guilty of gross wickedness.\" The BYU Honor Code in 1968 stated that \"the Church does not approve of any form of birth control.\" In 1969 the first and only First Presidency statement on birth control was released reemphasizing that it was \"contrary to the teachings of the Church artificially to curtail or prevent the birth of children\", though, for the first time there was a clarification that men should be considerate to \"conserve\" the \"health and strength\" of their wives when planning families since they carry the \"greater responsibility\" for bearing and rearing children. \n\nOther discussions of the topic include those by Ezra Benson who became a church president. He stated that those that advocate for birth control perpetuate types of government that cause famine, that couples should not prevent births for selfish reasons, and that a sterilization operation could \"jeapordiz[e] your exaltation.\" As recently as 2003 a church manual was published containing a quote from the late church president Spencer Kimball stating that the church does not \"condone nor approve of\" measures of contraception which greatly \"limit the family\".\n\nThe current church stance is that \"decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple\" and that they should consider \"the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children\" when planning a family. However, in teaching children about sexual morals and birth control, Mormons parents have ranked among the lowest in comfort discussing these topics with their children among US parents of all religious affiliations. In discussing another method of family planning the church \"strongly discourages\" surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and only allows it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop. The LDS Church opposes elective abortion \"for personal or social convenience\" but states that abortion could be an acceptable option in cases of rape, incest, danger to the health or life of the mother, or where the fetus has been diagnosed with \"severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.\"\n\nFrom the 1830s, marriage has been a central and distinctive component of Mormon theology. Mormon teachings on marriage begins with the belief that, if performed by a person who has the requisite priesthood authority, a marriage may continue in the afterlife. Such a marriage is called a \"celestial marriage\" or a \"temple marriage\", and is a particular instance of a \"sealing\" which binds people together in the afterlife. Celestial marriage is considered to be a requirement for entry into the highest \"degree\" of the celestial kingdom (the highest degree of heaven in Latter Day Saint theology), and is thought to allow the participants to continue to have spirit children in the afterlife and become gods. According to Mormon belief, the continuance of a celestial marriage in the afterlife is contingent upon the couple remaining righteous. In rare cases, a couple's exaltation may be \"made sure\" through the ritual of the second anointing.\n\nIn the 1800s, the practice of celestial marriage included plural marriage, a form of polygamy. According to a consensus of historians, the practice of plural marriage was taught by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and after Smith's death was formally acknowledged in 1852 by Brigham Young, leader of the LDS Church. The practice became famous during the 19th century when it was opposed and outlawed by the United States federal government, resulting in an intense legal conflict, which culminated in LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issuing the 1890 Manifesto, which officially discontinued the creation of new plural marriages in church temples. Nevertheless, unofficial plural marriages continued within the LDS Church after 1890 for some years, often in Mexico. In 1904, the church issued a Second Manifesto, which discontinued the official practice worldwide and established excommunication as a possible penalty for violators. These manifestos did not automatically divorce existing plural unions, however, and some couples in the LDS Church continued to live together as plural families well into the 20th century, with the final polygamous marriage in the LDS Church ending in 1954 when one of Edward Eyring's two wives died.\n\nThe LDS Church now embraces monogamy and the nuclear family. Members who are found entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages or associating with polygamous groups are now subject to church discipline and possible excommunication. Beginning in the late-20th century, the LDS Church began supporting political and legal measures to limit legal marriage to a union of one man and one woman.\n\nThe LDS Church does, however, continue to recognize some theological aspects of its polygamy doctrine. Although both men and women may enter a celestial marriage with only one partner at a time, a man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his first wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. A woman, however, may only be sealed to one man during her lifetime. This leaves room to believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband and all his sealed wives will live together in the afterlife as a polygamous family. In the 1950s, one influential church leader wrote that plural marriage would \"obviously\" be reinstituted after the Second Coming of Jesus.\n\nWhile not accorded the theological significance of a celestial marriage, the LDS Church does recognize civil marriages or marriages performed within other religious traditions. In the 1870s, a prominent Mormon writer wrote that Mormons considered such a marriage to be \"no marriage at all.\" Today, however, non-celestial marriages are respected and recognized as valid by the church, but such marriages must be legal according to the government where the marriage is performed, and must not be a same-sex marriage, polygamous marriage, common law marriage, or other type of non-ceremonial marriages in non–common law countries. Moreover, such marriages are thought to last only for the mortal life, and not into the next. In countries where the church's celestial marriages are not recognized by the government, the church requires that it be preceded by a civil marriage.\n\nIn the United States, the LDS Church has expressed support for a constitutional ban on same-sex and polygamous marriage and has stated that it \"favors measures that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman and that do not confer legal status on any other sexual relationship.\" The church's position is that government recognition of such rights will \"undermine the divinely created institution of the family\".\n\nThe church recognizes and officially welcomes gays and lesbians as members under condition that they attempt to live the church's moral code. The church teaches that homosexual feelings, as distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn, and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they can and should be controlled. The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.\n\nIn addition to opposing gay and lesbian sex, the LDS Church also opposes and campaigns against the extension of marital rights to gay and lesbian families that would, in its opinion, undermine the tradition of heterosexual monogamous marriage. Since the 1990s, the issue of same-sex marriage has been one of the church’s foremost political concerns.\n\nIn 2008, the church participated in a campaign in support of California Proposition 8, which proposed limiting the definition of marriage to a union of one man and one woman. This mobilized many of its members to donate time and money towards the initiative. The political organization ProtectMarriage.com, the official proponents of Proposition 8, estimate that about half the donations they received came from Mormon sources, and that \"eighty to ninety percent\" of the early volunteers going door-to-door were members of the LDS Church. The church was criticized for its involvement by non-members and by some of its members, and in 2010, general authority Marlin K. Jensen personally apologized to church members in California for the church's role. In December 2012 a landmark website \"Mormons and Gays\" was launched dedicated to the topic of homosexuality.\n\nGender identity and roles play an important part in Mormon theology which teaches a strict binary of spiritual gender as literal offspring of divine parents. Part of Sunday Church meetings are currently divided by biological sex, and for most of the 1800s church presidents Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had men, women, and children sit separately for all Sunday meetings. Expressions and identities for sexuality and gender are \"separate, but related\" aspects of a person and stem from similar biological origins. As far as gender minorities, Church leaders have stated that they have unfinished business in teaching on the difficult and sensitive topic of transgender individuals. In the past, church president Joseph Fielding Smith, stated that he believed that those who did not reach the celestial kingdom in the afterlife would be \"neither man nor woman, merely immortal beings\".\n\nWithin the church, there have also been a number of unofficial statements regarding gender. For example, \"Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family\" (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, \"Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children.\" The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage between a man and a woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation. Apostle David A. Bednar stated: \"[Gender] in large measure defines who we are, why we are here upon the earth, and what we are to do and become. For divine purposes, male and female spirits are different, distinctive, and complementary. ...The unique combination of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional capacities of both males and females were needed to implement the plan of happiness\". Apostle M. Russell Ballard taught, \"The premortal and mortal natures of men and women were specified by God Himself. ...[Sometimes women] ask: 'Is a woman's value dependent exclusively upon her role as a wife and mother?' The answer is simple and obvious: No. ...Every righteous man and woman has a significant role to play in the onward march of the kingdom of God.\"\n\n\n"}

Members are confirmed from the ranks of subscribing Master Masons of a Grand Lodge in amity with United Grand Lodge of England.\n\nThe structure and grade of this order, as A. E. Waite suggests, were derived from the 18th-century German Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross. It later became the same grade system used for the Golden Dawn.\n\nThe society claims to be inspired by the original Rosicrucian Brotherhood but does not allege a provable link thereto. It bases its teachings on those found in the \"Fama\" and \"Confessio Fraternitas\" published in the early 17th century in Germany along with other similar publications from the same time.\n\nThe society was founded in 1867, derived from a pre-existing Rosicrucian order in Scotland (which bore no relation to similarly named the Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia, which was a later creation), following the admission of William James Hughan and Robert Wentworth Little. Little was a clerk and cashier of the General Secretary of the United Grand Lodge of England, William Henry White. These Fratres were advanced quickly in Scotland and granted a warrant to form a Society in England. The formation meeting took place on 1 June 1867 in Aldermanbury, London with Frater Little elected Master Magus, the title of \"Supreme Magus\" not being invented until some years later.\n\nThey produced a journal, called \"The Rosicrucian\", which was co-edited by William Robert Woodman.\n\nThe society requires all aspirants for membership to declare a belief in the fundamental\nprinciples of the Trinitarian Christian faith and offers assistance to all its members in\nworking out the great problems of nature and science.\n\nThe Order is subdivided into:\n\nMembers of the 1st Order(\"Fratres\") meet in a College which is equivalent to a Freemasons Lodge. A College is empowered to confer the first four degrees of the society which are known as Grades. A minimum of six months must elapse between the receipt of grades. However, the emphasis in the work of the society is learning, therefore every member is encouraged to deliver a paper of their own work on some topic of interest in open college.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to a Masonic Provincial Grand Lodge headed by a Chief Adept and his deputy (Suffragan) who have jurisdiction over all first order Colleges within the Province. The Chief Adept is empowered to confer three further Grades at this level to deserving \"Fratres\" of Grade IV who have been a member of the Society for a minimum of four years.\n\n\nA minimum of one year must elapse between the receipt of grades at this level. A member can only serve as the Celebrant (Master) of a College of the First Order after receiving the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus.\n\nThis is equivalent to a Grand Lodge headed by a Supreme Magus, Senior Substitute Magus and Junior Substitute Magus. Members of the second order who have given service to the society and been selected by the Supreme Magus for such advancement may be awarded a further two Grades.\n\n\nIn 1888, three members of SRIA formed the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which removed the restriction on membership, allowing non-Christians, non-Freemasons, and women to join. A great deal of the SRIA structure survived in the new order, which went on to greatly influence the modern occult revival in the 20th century.\n\n\n\nThe Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia has led to a number of similar organisations in different countries such as Scotland, Canada, and two in America.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "17050382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17050382", "title": "Vaikuntha Ekadashi", "text": "Vaikuntha Ekadashi\n\nVaikunta Ekadashi is the Shukla Paksha Ekadashi that occurs during the Dhanu month in the Hindu calendar (corresponding to late December - January in English calendar).\n\nThe Vaishnava (Worship of Vishnu) sect believes that ‘Vaikunta Dwaram’ or ‘the gate to the Lord's Inner Sanctum’ is opened on this day. The Margashirsha Shukla Paksha Ekadashi in the Lunar calendar is known as a 'Mokshada Ekadashi.' Special prayers, \"yagnas\", discourses and speeches are arranged at Vishnu temples across the world on this auspicious day. The Shaiva sect observes the day as \"Trikoti Ekadashi,\" a religious observance where all the deities in the Hindu pantheon pay obeisance to Lord Sri Shiva at once.\n\nAccording to the Vishnu Purana, fasting on Vaikuntha Ekadashi is equivalent to fasting on the remaining 23 Ekadashis of the (Hindu) year. However, according to Vaishnava tradition fasting is mandatory on all Ekadashi of both Shukla paksha and Krishna paksha. Fasting on Ekadashi is considered holier than any other religious observation.\n\nVishnu opened the gate of Vaikuntham (his abode) for two demons in spite of their being against him. They also asked for the boon that whoever listens to their story and sees the image of Vishnu coming out of the door (called Dwar), called Vaikunth Dwar, will reach Vaikunth as well. Temples all over India make a door kind of structure on this day for devotees to walk through.\n\nAccording to Padma Purana, the female energy of Vishnu slayed the demon Muran and protects the 'Devas'. This happened on the eleventh day of lunar month during the sun's journey in the Dhanurrashi or Dhanu Rashi. Impressed by the act, Vishnu names her as 'Ekadashi' and gives her the boon that those who worship 'Ekadashi' on the day of her victory over Muran would reach 'Vaikunth' (His abode).\n\nVaikuntha Ekadashi is one of the important and auspicious days for Hindus. It is dedicated to Vishnu. It occurs in the Hindu calendar, in the month of Margashirsha (between December and January). When observed, it bestows liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe significance of Vaikuntha Ekadashi is mentioned in the \"Padma Purana\". The legend says that the Devas, unable to bear the tyranny of 'Muran' - a demon, approached Shiva, who directed them to Vishnu. A battle ensued between Vishnu and the demon and Vishnu realized that a new weapon was needed to slay Muran. In order to take rest and create a new weapon, Vishnu retired to a cave for the goddess named Haimavati in Bhadrikashrama. When Muran tried to slay Vishnu, who was sleeping, the female power that emerged from Vishnu burned Muran to ashes with her glance. Vishnu, who was pleased, named the goddess 'Ekadashi' and asked her to claim a boon. Ekadashi, instead, beseeched Vishnu that people who observed a fast on that day should be redeemed of their sins. Vishnu thus declared that people who observed a fast on that day and worshipped Ekadashi, would attain Vaikuntha. Thus came into being the first Ekadashi, which was a Dhanurmasa Shukla Paksha Ekadashi.\n\nThe demon Muran stands for the Rajasic and Tamasic qualities in people, attributed to lust, passion, inertia, arrogance etc. When one conquers these tendencies, one attains the purity of mind, Satva, indispensable for attaining of moksha, the liberation or realization of the self. For realizing the self as pure awareness, purity of mind is required. Fasting helps to keep at bay tendencies which could be triggered by intake of certain foods. Keeping vigil in the night is symbolic of awareness, or being watchful of the contents of the mind. When the mind is looked at, it becomes still. To abide in the stillness is to attain freedom or peace, acquired through merging of the mind with the self. This is symbolic of the mind automatically being absorbed at the sight of Vishnu after the arduous fast and vigil.\n\nThe belief that rice is prohibited, because Muran dwells in it, symbolically signifies that the eating of rice makes one feel heavy and hampers the vigil. This signifies that entertaining negative tendencies could hamper one's progress towards awareness or consciousness. Observance of the rituals on this auspicious day even without understanding their importance is beneficial. Hence the merit accrued through observing them with piety is believed to be immeasurable. In the \"Mahabharata\", \"Bhagavad Gita\" the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna at the beginning of Kurukshetra War is said to have occurred on this day.\n\nVaikuntha Ekadashi fasting is an important aspect of those associated with it. People fast the whole day and keep vigil. Special prayers are offered to Vishnu and devotees engage in Japa (chanting of Vishnu's name) and Dhyana (Meditation). On 'Dashami', the previous day of the observance, devotees who take up Vaikuntha Ekadashi fasting are to take only lunch. On Ekadashi, the next day, they have to maintain a complete fast and engage in prayers and meditation of Vishnu. They are strictly prohibited from taking rice. That night, people keep vigil the whole night and visit the temple of Vishnu, mostly in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nOn this day, the Vaikuntha Dwaram or the Vaikuntha Vaasal, 'The Gates of Vaikundam' are believed to be kept open. The area encircling the sanctum is referred to Vaikuntha Vaasal and devotees throng to gain entry into the temple, to seek Vishnu.\n\nSri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam Vaikuntha Ekadashi celebrations in Srirangam last 20 days, divided into two parts: \"pagal pathu\" (morning part 10 days) and \"Ira pathu\" (night part 10 days). Vishnu as Lord Ranganatha Molavar will bless devotees in 'Muthangi' an armor of Pearls on all 20 days. On the 10th day of Pagal Pathu (previous day of Vaikuntha Ekadashi) Utsavar Namperumal will blesss devotees in Mohini Alankaram.\n\nOn Vaikuntha Ekadashi very early morning, Utsavar Namperumal will bless devotees in an armor of diamonds (rathnaangi) and brought to the Thousand-Pillared Hall from the sanctum sanctorum through the northern gate known as Paramapada Vasal, the gate to Vaikuntha. This gate is opened once in a year, only on the Vaikuntha Ekadashi day. It is said that any one who goes through the Paramapada Vasal will reach vaikuntham. On the 8th day of Irapathu Namperumal will bless devotees in Golden Horse Vahanam in the evening & Thirumangai Mannan Vedupari Ritual will be held\n\nTirumala Venkateswara Temple also has a similar concept to celebrate \"Mukkoti Ekadashi,\" as it is known as in the Telugu-speaking regions. Tirumala has a special entrance called \"Vaikuntha Dwaram\" that encircles the sanctum sanctorum. The \"dwaram\" (passage) is opened only on Vaikuntha Ekadashi and it is believed that any person who passes through this `Vaikuntha Dwaram' on this particular day attains salvation. The temple witnesses heavy inflow of pilgrims and dignitaries for Vaikuntha Ekadashi. All Arjitha sevas are cancelled on this day, including VIP darshan and only Sarva Darshanam is allowed on Vaikunta Ekadashi except VVIP's. No Online Bookings are permitted on this day. Privileged darshan formats are stopped during this period.\n\n"}
{"id": "33653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33653", "title": "Wheel of the Year", "text": "Wheel of the Year\n\nThe Wheel of the Year is an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by many modern Pagans. It consists of either four or eight festivals: either the solstices and equinoxes, known as the \"quarter days\", or the four midpoints between, known as the \"cross quarter days\"; syncretic traditions like Wicca often celebrate all eight festivals.\n\nThe festivals celebrated by differing sects of modern Paganism can vary considerably in name and date. Observing the cycle of the seasons has been important to many people, both ancient and modern, and many contemporary Pagan festivals are based to varying degrees on folk traditions.\n\nAmong Wiccans, the festivals are also referred to as \"sabbats\" , with Gerald Gardner claiming this term was passed down from the Middle Ages, when the terminology for Jewish Shabbat was commingled with that of other \"heretical\" celebrations.\n\nThe contemporary, eightfold, Wheel of the Year is a modern innovation. Many historical pagan and polytheist traditions celebrated various equinoxes, solstices, and the days approximately midway between them (sometimes termed \"cross-quarter days\") for their seasonal and agricultural significance. Generally, European cultural communities observed four main celebrations a year, sometimes with smaller, more local festivals as well. But none were known to have held \"all eight\" as seen in the modern, culturally syncretic \"wheel\" that is popular in Modern Paganism.\n\nMid-20th century British Paganism had a strong influence on early adoption of an eightfold Wheel. By the late 1950s, the Wiccan Bricket Wood coven and Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids had both adopted eightfold ritual calendars, in order to hold more frequent celebrations. This also had the benefit of more closely aligning celebrations between the two Pagan orders.\n\nDue to early Wicca's influence on Modern Paganism and the syncretic adoption of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic motifs, the most commonly used English festival names for the Wheel of the Year tend to be Celtic and Germanic, even when the celebrations were not based on those cultures.\n\nThe American Ásatrú movement has adopted, over time, a calendar in which the Heathen major holidays figure alongside many \"Days of Remembrance\" which celebrate heroes of the Edda and the Sagas, figures of Germanic history, and the Viking Leif Ericson, who explored and settled Vinland (North America). These festivals are not, however, as evenly distributed throughout the year as in Wicca and other Heathen denominations.\n\nIn many traditions of modern Pagan cosmology, all things are considered to be cyclical, with time as a perpetual cycle of growth and retreat tied to the Sun's annual death and rebirth. This cycle is also viewed as a micro- and macrocosm of other life cycles in an immeasurable series of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four seasons. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals are the most common times for community celebrations.\n\nWhile the \"major\" festivals are usually the quarter and cross-quarter days, other festivals are also celebrated throughout the year, especially among the non-Wiccan traditions such as those of polytheistic reconstructionism and other ethnic traditions.\n\nIn Wiccan and Wicca-influenced traditions, the festivals, being tied to solar movements, have generally been steeped in solar mythology and symbolism, centered on the life cycles of the sun. Similarly, the Wiccan esbats are traditionally tied to the lunar cycles. Together, they represent the most common celebrations in Wiccan-influenced forms of Neopaganism, especially in contemporary Witchcraft groups.\n\nMidwinter has been recognised as a significant turning point in the yearly cycle since the late Stone Age. The ancient megalithic sites of Newgrange and Stonehenge, carefully aligned with the solstice sunrise and sunset, exemplify this. The reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky symbolizes the rebirth of the solar god and presages the return of fertile seasons. From Germanic to Roman tradition, this is the most important time of celebration.\n\nPractices vary, but sacrifices, feasting, and gift giving are common elements of Midwinter festivities. Bringing sprigs and wreaths of evergreenery (such as holly, ivy, mistletoe, yew, and pine) into the home and tree decorating are also common during this time.\n\nIn Germanic traditions, this liminal festival marks the last month of the old year and the first month of the new year and is followed by eleven days of extended celebration. In Roman traditions additional festivities take place during the six days leading up to Midwinter.\n\nAs the first cross-quarter day following Midwinter this day falls on the first of February and traditionally marks the first stirrings of spring. It aligns with the contemporary observance of Groundhog Day. It is time for purification and spring cleaning in anticipation of the year's new life. In Rome, it was historically a shepherd's holiday, while the Celts associated it with the onset of ewes' lactation, prior to birthing the spring lambs.\n\nFor Celtic pagans, the festival is dedicated to the goddess Brigid, daughter of The Dagda and one of the Tuatha Dé Danann.\n\nAmong Reclaiming tradition Witches, this is the traditional time for pledges and rededications for the coming year and for initiation among Dianic Wiccans.\n\nDerived from a reconstruction produced by linguist Jacob Grimm of an Old High German form of the Old English goddess name \"Ēostre\", Ostara marks the vernal equinox in some modern Pagan traditions.\n\nTraditionally the first day of summer in Ireland, in Rome the earliest celebrations appeared in pre-Christian times with the festival of Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, and the Walpurgisnacht celebrations of the Germanic countries.\n\nSince the Christianisation of Europe, a more secular version of the festival has continued in Europe and America, commonly referred to as May Day. In this form, it is well known for maypole dancing and the crowning of the Queen of the May.\n\nMidsummer is one of the four solar holidays, and is considered the turning point at which summer reaches its height and the sun shines longest. Among the Wiccan sabbats, Midsummer is preceded by Beltane, and followed by Lammas or Lughnasadh.\n\nSome Wiccan traditions call the festival \"Litha\", a name occurring in Bede's \"The Reckoning of Time\" (', 8th century), which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the twelve months. ' (\"first\" or \"preceding\" ') roughly corresponds to June in the Gregorian calendar, and ' (\"following\" \"\") to July. Bede writes that \"Litha means \"gentle\" or \"navigable\", because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea\".\n\nLammas or Lughnasadh () is the first of the three Wiccan harvest festivals, the other two being the autumnal equinox (or Mabon) and Samhain. Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the god in bread and eating it, to symbolise the sanctity and importance of the harvest. Celebrations vary, as not all Pagans are Wiccans. The Irish name Lughnasadh is used in some traditions to designate this holiday. Wiccan celebrations of this holiday are neither generally based on Celtic culture nor centered on the Celtic deity Lugh. This name seems to have been a late adoption among Wiccans. In early versions of Wiccan literature the festival is referred to as \"August Eve\".\n\nThe name \"Lammas\" (contraction of \"loaf mass\") implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread, which symbolises the first fruits of the harvest. Christian festivals may incorporate elements from the Pagan Ritual.\n\nThe holiday of the autumnal equinox, \"Harvest Home\", \"Mabon\", the \"Feast of the Ingathering\", ' or ' (in Neo-Druid traditions), is a modern Pagan ritual of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the God during the coming winter months. The name \"Mabon\" was coined by Aidan Kelly around 1970 as a reference to , a character from Welsh mythology. Among the sabbats, it is the second of the three Pagan harvest festivals, preceded by Lammas / Lughnasadh and followed by Samhain.\n\nSamhain () is considered by Wiccans to be one of the four \"Greater Sabbats\". Samhain is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. Aligned with the contemporary observance of Halloween and Day of the Dead. In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the festival of Beltane, which is celebrated as a festival of light and fertility.\n\nMany Pagans believe that at Samhain the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year, making it easier to communicate with those who have left this world.\n\nIn addition to the eight major holidays common to most modern Pagans, there are a number of minor holidays during the year to commemorate various events.\n\nThe minor holidays common in contemporary Germanic Paganism:\n\nThe precise dates on which festivals are celebrated are often flexible. Dates may be on the days of the quarter and cross-quarter days proper, the nearest full moon, the nearest new moon, or the nearest weekend for secular convenience. The festivals were originally celebrated by peoples in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, the traditional times for seasonal celebrations do not agree with the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere or near the equator. Pagans in the Southern Hemisphere often advance these dates by six months to coincide with their own seasons.\n\nCelebration commonly takes place outdoors in the form of a communal gathering.\n\nOfferings of food, drink, various objects, etc. have been central in ritual propitiation and veneration for millennia. Modern Pagan practice strongly avoids sacrificing animals in favour of grains, herbs, milk, wines, incense, baked goods, minerals, etc. The exception being with ritual feasts including meat, where the inedible parts of the animal are often burned as offerings while the community eats the rest.\n\nSacrifices are typically offered to gods and ancestors by burning them. Burying and leaving offerings in the open are also common in certain circumstances. The purpose of offering is to benefit the venerated, show gratitude, and give something back, strengthening the bonds between humans and divine and between members of a community.\n\nIt is a misconception in some quarters of the Neopagan community, influenced by the writings of Robert Graves, that historical Celts had an overarching narrative for the entire cycle of the year. While the various Celtic calendars include \"some\" cyclical patterns, and a belief in the balance of light and dark, these beliefs vary between the different Celtic cultures. Modern preservationists and revivalists usually observe the four 'fire festivals' of the Gaelic Calendar, and some also observe local festivals that are held on dates of significance in the different Celtic nations.\n\nSlavic mythology tells of a persisting conflict involving Perun, god of thunder and lightning, and Veles, the \"black god\" and \"horned god\" of the underworld. Enmity between the two is initiated by Veles' annual ascent up the world tree in the form of a huge serpent and his ultimate theft of Perun's divine cattle from the heavenly domain. Perun retaliates to this challenge of the divine order by pursuing Veles, attacking with his lightning bolts from the sky. Veles taunts Perun and flees, transforming himself into various animals and hiding behind trees, houses, even people. (Lightning bolts striking down trees or homes were explained as results of this.) In the end Perun overcomes and defeats Veles, returning him to his place in the realm of the dead. Thus the order of the world is maintained.\n\nThe idea that storms and thunder are actually divine battle is pivotal to the changing of the seasons. Dry periods are identified as chaotic results of Veles' thievery. This duality and conflict represents an opposition of the natural principles of earth, water, substance, and chaos (Veles) and of heaven, fire, spirit, order (Perun), not a clash of good and evil. The cosmic battle between the two also echoes the ancient Indo-European narrative of a fight between the sky-borne storm god and chthonic dragon.\n\nOn the \"great night\" (New Year), two children of Perun are born, Jarilo, god of fertility and vegetation and son of the Moon, and Morana, goddess of nature and death and daughter of the Sun. On the same night, the infant Jarilo is snatched and taken to the underworld, where Veles raises him as his own. At the time of the spring equinox, Jarilo returns across the sea from the world of the dead, bringing with him fertility and spring from the evergreen underworld into the realm of the living. He meets his sister Morana and courts her. With the beginning of summer, the two are married bringing fertility and abundance to Earth, ensuring a bountiful harvest. The union of Perun's kin and Veles' stepson brings peace between two great gods, staving off storms which could damage the harvest. After the harvest, however, Jarilo is unfaithful to his wife and she vengefully slays him, returning him to the underworld and renewing enmity between Perun and Veles. Without her husband, god of fertility and vegetation, Morana – and all of nature with her – withers and freezes in the ensuing winter. She grows into the old and dangerous goddess of darkness and frost, eventually dying by the year's end only to be reborn again with her brother in the new year.\n\nIn Wicca, the narrative of the Wheel of the Year traditionally centres on the sacred marriage of the God and the Goddess and the god/goddess duality. In this cycle, the God is perpetually born from the Goddess at Yule, grows in power at the vernal equinox (as does the Goddess, now in her \"maiden aspect\"), courts and impregnates the Goddess at Beltane, reaches his peak at the summer solstice, wanes in power at Lammas, passes into the underworld at Samhain (taking with him the fertility of the Goddess/Earth, who is now in her \"crone aspect\") until he is once again born from Her mother/crone aspect at Yule. The Goddess, in turn, ages and rejuvenates endlessly with the seasons, being courted by and giving birth to the Horned God.\n\nMany Wiccan, Neo-Druid, and eclectic Neopagans incorporate a narrative of the Oak King and the Holly King as rulers of the waxing year and the waning year respectively. These two figures battle endlessly with the turning of the seasons. At the summer solstice, the Holly King defeats the Oak King and commences his reign. After the Autumn equinox the Oak King slowly begins to regain his power as the sun begins to wane. Come the winter solstice the Oak King in turn vanquishes the Holly King.After the spring equinox the sun begins to wax again and the Holly King slowly regains his strength until he once again defeats the Oak King at the summer solstice. The two are ultimately seen as essential parts of a whole, light and dark aspects of the male God, and would not exist without each other.\n\nThe Holly King is often portrayed as a woodsy figure, similar to the modern Santa Claus, dressed in red with sprigs of holly in his hair and the Oak King as a fertility god.\n\n\n"}

The method of partaking of the \"zapivka\" is to first take three sips of the warm wine, then consume the antidoron.\n\nThe clergy also partake of \"zapivka\". The priests and deacons who communicated will partake of the \"zapivka\" immediately after receiving Holy Communion, except for the deacon (or priest, if there is no deacon serving) who will perform the ablutions (consume the remaining Sacred Mysteries). He will then receive \"zapivka\" after finishing the ablutions. After consuming the \"zapivka\" all of the clergy will rinse their hands and their lips.\n"}
