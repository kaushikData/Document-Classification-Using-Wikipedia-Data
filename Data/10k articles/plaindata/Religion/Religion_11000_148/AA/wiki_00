These monuments are located at a distance of 97 km from Dhar town. These are renowned for mural paintings by master painters of ancient India. The use of the word \"cave\" is a bit of a misnomer, since these are not natural, but instead examples of Indian rock-cut architecture. \nThe Bagh caves, like those at Ajanta, were excavated by master craftsmen on perpendicular sandstone rock face of a hill on the far bank of a seasonal stream, the Baghani. Buddhist in inspiration, of the nine caves, only five have survived. All of them are 'viharas' or resting places of monks monasteries having quadrangular plan. A small chamber, usually at the back, forms the 'chaitya', the prayer hall. Most significant of these five extant caves is the Cave 4, commonly known as the \"Rang Mahal\" (Palace of Colors). \n\nThe Bagh Caves were quarried in the 5th -6th century AD, in the very late stages of Buddhism in India, and long after most of the Indian Buddhist Caves had been built, many of them since the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE.\n\nThe paintings on the wall and ceilings of the \"vihara\"s of Bagh, the fragments of which are still visible in Cave 3 and Cave 4 (remnants seen also in Caves 2, 5 and 7), were executed in tempera. These paintings are materialistic rather than spiritualistic.The ground prepared was a reddish-brown gritty and thick mud plaster, laid out on the walls and ceilings. Over the plaster, lime-priming was done, on which these paintings were executed. Some of the most beautiful paintings were on the walls of the portico of Cave 4. To prevent further loss of the values of Indian classical art, most paintings were carefully removed in 1982 and today can be seen in Archaeological Museum of Gwalior.\nAn copperplate inscription of Maharaja Subandhu, recording his donation for the repair of the \"vihara\" was found at the site of Cave 2. Though, the date of the Bagh inscription is missing, his Badwani copperplate inscription is dated in the year (Gupta era) 167 (487). So the repair of Cave 2 took place in the late 5th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18502422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18502422", "title": "Bahá'í Faith in Germany", "text": "Bahá'í Faith in Germany\n\nThough mentioned in the Bahá'í () literature in the 19th century, the Bahá'í Faith in Germany begins in the early 20th century when two emigrants to the United States returned on prolonged visits to Germany bringing their newfound religion. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was established following the conversion of enough individuals to elect one in 1908. After the visit of `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, and the establishing of many further assemblies across Germany despite the difficulties of World War I, elections were called for the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1923. Banned for a time by the National Socialist government and then in East Germany the religion re-organized and was soon given the task of building the first Bahá'í House of Worship for Europe. After German reunification the community multiplied its interests across a wide range of concerns earning the praise of German politicians. German Census data shows 5600 registered Bahá'ís in Germany in 2012. But there might be much more who are not enrolled in the official community. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11743 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nIbrahim George Kheiralla, an early Bahá'í from Lebanon, traveled through Germany in 1892 attempting to making a living but found no interest in his inventions and moved on to the United States in February, 1893. There he managed to convert some individuals by 1895 (see Thornton Chase.) Following these conversions, some German emigrants became Bahá'ís as well. Two in particular traveled back to Germany: Edwin Fischer and Alma Knobloch. Dr. Edwin Fischer, a dentist, had emigrated in 1878 from Germany to New York City, became a Bahá'í there, and then returned to Stuttgart in 1905. Fisher used every opportunity, including talking with his patients, to mention the Bahá'í teachings, and in time a few Germans embraced the religion. The other German Bahá'í, Alma Knobloch, became a Bahá'í in 1903, before Fischer, but arrived in Germany in 1907. This small group of Bahá'ís began to organize and formed a Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in 1908 and by 1909 began self-publishing pamphlets and letters and Bahá'í books including the Hidden Words and a history of the religion by Knobloch. The second spiritual assembly in Germany was founded in 1909 in Esslingen.\n\nIn the German Colony in Palestine, as part of the worldwide , \"Frau Doktor Fallscheer\" was the family physician for the family of `Abdu'l-Bahá, son of the founder of the religion. Fallscheer later became a Bahá'í when she moved back to Germany by 1930. Prominent early Bahá'í Louis George Gregory stayed at a hotel in the German Colony in Haifa during his Bahá'í pilgrimage to Palestine in the spring of 1911 and on his return trip visited in Germany at the request of `Abdu'l-Bahá in the fall of 1912.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, Esslingen and Bad Mergentheim. During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of Esperantists. In less than a decade Bahá'í sources state there were some 300 Bahá'ís in Germany by the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's arrival. See `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". The seventh of the tablets mentioned European regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in \"Star of the West\" magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Germany. He says:\n\n\"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands.\"\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá praised the German Bahá'ís - \"individuals...endued with perceptive eyes and attentive ears\" were \"attracted to the principles of the oneness of mankind\" and treated \"all the peoples and kindreds of the earth in a spirit of concord and fellowship.\" He predicted Germany will \"surpass all other regions\" and \"lead all the nations and peoples of Europe spiritually.\" Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, continued commentary about Germany and its Bahá'ís; he wrote that during the Nazi government the German Bahá'ís demonstrated that they were the \"great-hearted, indefatigable, much admired German Bahá'í community\".\n\nAs World War I was becoming more widespread in its ramifications, the Bahá'ís pursued other courses of action. In 1916 a plaque was raised to honor `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit at Bad Mergentheim. On May 23, 1916, Austrian Franz Pöllinger learned of the religion while staying in Stuttgart and on returning to Austria had a prominent role in the growth of the religion there. When the United States entered the war, individuals from there, as Fischer and Knobloch, had to leave Germany and both returned to the United States. On return to the US Fischer went to the Los Angeles area and Knobloch went to New York. In a wave of anti-German sentiment (see German American internment for similar issues a generation later) Fischer was caught up in charges of espionage for Germany which were dismissed. As Germany was allied with the Ottoman Empire, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I played an important role with the Bahá'ís in Palestine - particularly the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918. As a direct result of the events of the battle, `Abdu'l-Bahá was rescued after death threats were made against him in case the Ottoman side was to lose (events in which Wellesley Tudor Pole played a significant part.)\n\nAfter WWI, the national Bahá'í community organized a German Bahá'í Publishing Trust and in 1920 Adelbert Mühlschlegel became a Bahá'í, and later appointed as a Hand of the Cause, individuals who have been considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. He was the first of three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís. As with other German emigrants who converted to the religion, Siegfried Schopflocher who was born in Germany, as an Orthodox Jew, sought out a wider unity and found the Bahá'í Faith while in Canada in the summer of 1921; he was also later appointed a Hand of the Cause. `Abdu'l-Bahá's last tablet before his death was addressed to the Bahá'ís in Stuttgart in November 1921.\n\nIn 1921 a new magazine \"Sun of Truth\" was first published as one of five Bahá'í journals produced by German Bahá'ís through the 1920s. It contained newly translated Bahá'í literature and news from the Bahá'í community around the world.\n\nIn 1923 the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assemblies were elected \"where conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size\". Along with India and the British Isles, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany and Austria was first elected in that year. In 1925 there were 95 delegates who performed the election. A 1925 list of local Bahá'í Centers mentions no less than 26 in Germany, compared to three in England and two in Switzerland. In late 1926 and again in 1929 widely traveled Martha Root spoke in most German universities and technical colleges. Eugen Schmidt, the second of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís, became a Bahá'í and was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany from 1932 for many years and served as chairman in the decisive years of re-building after World War II.\n\nAmong the Bahá'ís to visit Germany were Amelia Collins, Marion Jack and Louisa Mathew Gregory, wife of Louis George Gregory. Another Bahá'í with links to Germany was Robert Sengstacke Abbott whose adoptive father was German and, through his family connection, he kept in contact with his family in Germany. In 1930 the national convention included delegates from Stuttgart, Rostock, Hamburg, Schwerin, Karlsruhe, Göppingen, Bissingen, and from Vienna. The 1931 national assembly included four women and five men. In 1935 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, re-organized the German community to cover Austria as well so they shared a regional national assembly.\n\nDuring the early Nazi period Bahá'ís had general freedom; May Maxwell, wife of William Sutherland Maxwell, was still able to travel through Germany in 1936, though the plaque commemorating `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit had been taken down. By 1937 however, Heinrich Himmler signed an order disbanding the Bahá'í Faith's institutions in Germany because of its 'international and pacifist tendencies'. In 1939 and in 1942 there were sweeping arrests of former members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In May 1944 there was a public trial in Darmstadt at which Dr. Hermann Grossmann was allowed to defend the character of the religion but the Bahá'ís were instead heavily fined and its institutions continued to be disbanded. However for this service and others, Grossmann was ranked as the third of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís.\n\nFollowing the fall of Nazi Germany, an American Bahá'í, John C. Eichenauer who was a medic of the 100th Infantry division then at Geislingen started searching for the Bahá'í community in Stuttgart. He drove through Stuttgart looking and asking for Bahá'ís and was able to find an individual by nightfall/curfew. The next day saw the first meeting of Bahá'ís since their disbandment in 1937. Two other American Bahá'ís, Bruce Davison and Henry Jarvis, in Frankfurt and Heidelberg respectively, also connected with the Bahá'í community in Germany. At the beginning of the partition of Germany there were about 150 German Bahá'ís in the American section and they became registered with the American authorities. The National Spiritual Assembly was re-elected in 1946 and by 1950 there were 14 Local Spiritual Assemblies:\n\nand smaller Bahá'í communities in 27 cities.\n\nHowever, in Soviet controlled East Germany, the Bahá'í Faith was again disbanded in 1948. In West Germany, by 1954 there were reports of large growth in the religion, and from 1951 to 1966 philately stationery and a \"Cinderella stamp\" religious stationery were produced in West Germany.\n\nThe construction of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Langenhain near Frankfurt, began in 1952. Hand of the Cause Amelia Collins represented the Bahá'í International Community at the groundbreaking 20 November 1960. Designated as the \"Mother Temple of Europe\", it was dedicated in 1964 by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum, representing the first elected Universal House of Justice.\n\nBy 1963 the list of local assemblies was:\nIsolated Bahá'ís were found in an additional 86 locations.\n\nWest German Bahá'ís were given the responsibility of trying to strengthen the Bahá'í community in Russia in 1963. During the 1960s and 1970s, a small number of Bahá'ís visited the Soviet Union as tourists but no attempt was made to promulgate the religion. In 1986 Friedo and Shole Zölzer and Karen Reitz from Germany traveled into the Soviet Union but remained for only short periods of time. Continuing in the 1980s and into the 1990s the Bahá'í Esperanto-League began to prosper especially in West Germany. One reason behind this was that Esperanto had acquired the reputation of being an \"entrance ticket\" to countries behind the Iron Curtain, countries to which the Bahá'í Faith had had little access during the preceding decades (the first post-World War II Bahá'í know to pioneer to Russia was in 1979.)\n\nFollowing the German reunification in 1989-91 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany handed down a judgment affirming the status of the Bahá'í Faith as a religion in Germany. Continued development of youth oriented programs included the Diversity Dance Theater (see Oscar DeGruy) which traveled to Albania in February 1997. Udo Schaefer et al.'s 2001 \"Making the Crooked Straight\" was written to refute a polemic supported by the Evangelical Church in Germany written in 1981. Since its publication the Evangelical Church in Germany has revised its own relationship to the German Bahá'í Community. Former member of the federal parliament Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker commended the ideas of the German Bahá'í community on social integration, which were published in a statement in 1998, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a congratulatory message to the 1992 ceremony marking the 100th Anniversary of the Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Nearing the century mark of the Bahá'í community in Germany, the Bahá'ís in Germany have begun efforts in diverse fields of interest. An estimated 500,000 people visited the Bahá'í pavilion at the Hanover Expo 2000. The 170 square-meter Bahá'í exhibit, hosted by the Bahá'í International Community and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany, featured development projects in Colombia, Kenya and Eastern Europe that illustrated the importance of grassroots capacity-building, the advancement of women, and moral and spiritual values in the process of social and economic development. The German community organized a national Bahá'í Choir in 2001 which tours various events in Germany and Europe. In 2002 the director of the Ernst Lange-Institute for Ecumenical Studies held a meeting under the auspices of the German Federal Environment Ministry titled \"Orientation dialogue of religions represented in Germany on environmental politics with reference to the climate issue\" for the interfaith community including the Bahá'ís. In 2005 former federal Minister of the Interior, Otto Schily, praised the contributions of German Bahá'ís to the social stability of the country, noting \"It is not enough to make a declaration of belief. It is important to live according to the basic values of our constitutional state, to defend them and make them secure in the face of all opposition. The members of the Bahá'í Faith do this because of their faith and the way they see themselves.\" However the Bahá'ís have been excluded from other dialogues on religious issues. In 2007 a new memorial was unveiled replacing the one that had been taken down in Bad Mergentheim during Nazi Germany. Bahá'ís from much of Europe were among the more than 4,600 people who gathered in Frankfurt for the largest ever Bahá'í conference in Germany in February 2009.\n\nA 1997-8 estimate is of 4000 Bahá'ís in Germany (40 in Hannover). In 2002 there were 106 Local Spiritual Assemblies.\nThe 2007-8 German Census using sampling estimated 5-6,000 Bahá'ís in Germany. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11,743 Bahá'ís.\n\nAmong the better known Bahá'í artists of Germany are:\n\nThe writings of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá in the late 19th century and early 20th century contain some prophecies regarding Germany. The first mention related to Germany in the Bahá'í Faith is when the founder of the religion, Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1873:\nO banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous glory.\n\nIn 1912, shortly before visiting Germany, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke of the increasing tensions in Europe:\nWe are on the eve of the Battle of Armageddon referred to in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation... The time is two years hence, when only a spark will set aflame the whole of Europe... by 1917 kingdoms will fall and cataclysms will rock the earth. and in January 1920 he wrote:\nThe ills from which the world now suffers... will multiply; the gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented. Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of war.\n\n\n"}

Puras are built in accordance to rules, style, guidance and rituals found in Balinese architecture. Most of the puras are found on the island of Bali, as Hinduism is the predominant religion on it; however many puras exist in other parts of Indonesia where there are significant numbers of Balinese people. Mother Temple of Besakih is the most important, the largest and holiest temple in Bali. A large number of puras have been built in Bali, leading it to be titled \"the Island of a Thousand Puras\".\n\nThe term pura originates from the Sanskrit word (\"-pur, -puri, -pura, -puram, -pore\"), meaning \"city\", \"walled city\", \"towered city\", or \"palace\". During the development of the Balinese language the term \"pura\" came to refer to a religious temple complex, while the term \"puri\" came to refer to palace, the residence of kings and nobles, similar to Javanese kratons.\n\nUnlike the common towering indoor Hindu temples of the Indian Subcontinent, puras are designed as an open air place of worship within enclosed walls, connected with a series of intricately decorated gates between its compounds. These walled compounds contain several shrines, \"meru\" (towers), and \"bale\" (pavilions). The design, plan and layout of the pura follows the \"trimandala\" concept of Balinese space allocation. Three mandala zones arranged according to a sacred hierarchy:\n\nHowever, the layout rules for arrangements the facilities of the two outer zones, nista mandala and madya mandala, are somewhat flexible. Several structures, such as the bale kulkul, could be built as outer corner tower; also, the perantenan (temple's kitchen) could be located in the Nista mandala.\n\nThere are two types of gates within Balinese architecture: the split gate, known as \"candi bentar\", and the roofed tower gate known as \"paduraksa\" or \"kori agung\". Both types of gates have specific roles in Balinese architectural design. Candi bentar is the gate used in the nista mandala, while the kori agung is employed as the gate between the madya mandala and Utama mandala inner compounds. The rules for gate types are also valid for non-religious compounds such as puri, nobles' and kings' residences.\n\nThere are several types of pura, each serving certain functions of Balinese rituals throughout the Balinese calendar. The Balinese temples are arranged according to the physical and spiritual realm of Balinese people, which corresponds to \"kaja-kelod\" sacred axis, from mountain tops the realms of gods, hyang spirits, the middle fertile plain the realm of humans and other beings, all the way to the beach and ocean, and the many realms in Indonesia. \n\nThe \"Sad Kahyangan\", \"Sad Kahyangan Jagad\" or the \"six sanctuaries of the world\" are the six holiest places of worship on Bali. According to Balinese beliefs, they are the pivotal points of the island, and are meant to provide spiritual balance to Bali. The number of these most sacred sanctuaries always adds up six, but depending on the region, the specific temples that are listed may vary. A list of the Sad Kahyangan may include:\n\n\nBali has a number of important \"sea temples\" (Balinese: \"pura segara\"), which were founded in the 16th century by a Majapahit Brahmin from Java, named Nirartha, to honour the gods of the sea. Each of the temples is traditionally said to be visible from the next, forming a 'chain' around the coast of Bali. Many of the most important sea temples are located along the south-west coast of the island. The temples' positions were meant to provide a chain of spiritual protection for the Bali island.\n\nListed counterclockwise from Nirartha's legendary point of arrival in Bali, some of the most prominent Balinese sea temples include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The slayings were called \"one of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy\" by the BBC.\n\nThe first incident was a January 1998 double homicide that occurred in the woods near Somma Lombardo, northwest of Milan. Chiara Marino, shop assistant, aged 19, and her boyfriend Fabio Tollis, a 16-year-old student and heavy metal musician, were sacrificially stabbed and beaten in a drug-fueled occult rite involving sex and heavy metal music. \nThe young couple had spent a normal Saturday night drinking beer and listening to heavy metal music at \"Midnight Pub\", which was the center of the city's metal scene, but never returned home. Both Tollis and Marino were stabbed to death by their friends Andrea Volpe, Nicola Sapone and Marco Maccione. \nFabio Tollis, a sturdy young man (6 feet and 2 inches tall, 220 pounds) desperately tried to defend himself and his girlfriend Marino but was overpowered by the larger group. Maccione, Sapone and Volpe later buried the corpses in a large grave in the woods and danced on the graves, laughing and screaming \"Now you're both zombies! Try to get out of this hole, if you dare!\".\nThe conclusion initially drawn by the authorities at the time was that they had run away together for a love affair, as their friend suggested, but this explanation was not accepted by Tollis' father, Michele Tollis, who began his own investigation. \nJust a few hours before the murder, Nicola Sapone forced Fabio Tollis to call home and tell his father he did not intend to come back home that evening because he preferred sleeping with his girlfriend. Michele Tollis, realizing something was not right with the call he received, immediately reached back out to his son at the \"Midnight\" to have a word with him. Unfortunately, it was too late: Fabio and Chiara had already left with their presumed friend for Somma Lombardo and never came back again. \nMichele Tollis discovered just how deeply they had become involved in satanism and the occult, both common themes of the black metal and death metal genres that his son and friends were interested in. Becoming convinced of a connection between satanism and their disappearance, Michele Tollis spent the next six years steadily constructing a file on their activities and the bands in which they had played. When the third murder occurred, Tollis took his findings to the police, who used them to link all three murders to Andrea Volpe and the wider satanic sect.\n\nThe third murder was committed in January 2004. Mariangela Pezzotta, 27-year-old shop assistant, prior girlfriend of group member Andrea Volpe was first shot in the throat and later buried while she was still alive in a greenhouse in the nearby town of Golasecca not far from Somma Lombardo. Andrea Volpe was arrested shortly after with his young fiancée, an 18-year-old high school student named Elisabetta Ballarin, the daughter of an upper-class family who had run away from home with Volpe when she was just a teenager. Both Volpe and Ballarin were upset because of alcohol and drug addiction. Volpe confessed he invited Pezzotta for a friendly dinner but had already decided to kill her because she knew too many details about the sect and Tollis and Marino's murder. Volpe shot her after a violent fight, then rang Sapone up for help and they realized that, though in agony, Pezzotta was still alive. Volpe recalled that Sapone accused him \"You can't even kill a person!\" and threatened him; they tried hard to hide the dying girl's body in the greenhouse of Ballarin's parents' home and hit her several times with a heavy spade before burying her still alive. After that, Sapone came back home and pretended nothing had happened. Hours later Volpe and Ballarin took a heavy dose of cocaine and heroin and decided to get rid of Pezzotta's car by driving it into a nearby river but they had a car crash and were arrested. \nThe police investigation of the Pezzotta murder, and interrogation of Volpe using the information provided by Tollis led to the discovery of the buried bodies of Marino and Tollis and the revelation of the sect's existence. As the investigation continued, Pietro Guerrieri, who presented himself as \"the medium\" of the group and had been regarded by Tollis as his best friend, confessed to having beaten Fabio to death with a hammer, after Volpe and Sapone had stabbed him and Chiara Marino.\n\nAdditionally sect members were accused of pushing their drummer, Andrea Bontade, to commit suicide because he refused to join Volpe and Sapone at Somma Lombardo and help them kill Marino and Tollis. In September 1998, Andrea Bontade drank heavily, then killed himself by crashing his car. Authorities also investigated whether the group had any links to a possible wider network of Satanists in Italy.\n\nOn February 22, 2005 Andrea Volpe and Pietro Guerrieri were sentenced in the northern city of Busto Arsizio to 30 and 16 years imprisonment respectively. Volpe, in addition to the 1998 murders, was also found guilty of the 2004 slaying of Pezzotta. In Volpe's case the sentence was a decade longer than requested by prosecutors. A third suspect, Mario Maccione, had also confessed to the murders, but was cleared due to his secondary role in the crimes.\n\nThe reactions of the victims' families to the sentencing were mixed. Michele Tollis, the father of Fabio, said \"Today justice rewarded me.\" Lina Marino, mother of the slain Chiara, was outraged at the relatively light sentences Volpe and Guerrieri had received, due to their cooperation with prosecutors. She stated \"They are murderers. It's not fair.\"\n\nFive more members of the group went to trial in June 2005 and were sentenced to long prison terms in early 2006. Nicola Sapone, leader of the group and the person suspected as the mastermind behind the killings, received a life sentence. The other four, Paolo Leoni, Marco Zampollo, Eros Monterosso and Elisabetta Ballarin, received sentences between 24 and 26 years for their role in all three murders. On 2007 the Court of Appeal confirmed the life sentence for Sapone and lengthened the convictions of the other three members of the group: Paolo Leoni passed from 26 years to a life sentence, Marco Zampollo from 26 years to 29 years and 2 months and Eros Monterosso from 24 years to 27 years and 3 months; the sentence for Elisabetta Ballarin was reduced from 24 years and 3 months to 23 years. On May 2008 the last step, Court of Cassazione, confirmed all the Appeal's decisions.\n\nThe crimes occurred against a background of growing concern in Italy that Satanism and the occult were becoming increasingly attractive to Italian youth. In February 2005, a Roman Catholic university connected to the Vatican began offering a two-month course on diabolical possession and exorcism for priests and seminarians. In reaction to the crimes, priest Don Aldo Buonaito called for death metal to be banned, saying \"If music makes itself an instrument of nefarious deeds and death, it should be stopped.\"\nIn light of revelations from the Beasts of Satan investigation and trial, as well as growing public concern, Italian police stated their intention to create a special unit focusing on new religious sects, particularly Satanists and other violent ritualistic groups. It would coordinate nationwide investigations into potentially dangerous new religious movements, and planned to include psychologists and a priest who is an expert on the occult.\n\n"}
{"id": "42422497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42422497", "title": "Blood moon prophecy", "text": "Blood moon prophecy\n\nThe blood moon prophecy was a series of apocalyptic beliefs promoted by Christian ministers John Hagee and Mark Biltz, which state that a tetrad (a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses—coinciding on Jewish holidays—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse is a sign of the beginning of the end times as described in the Bible in the Book of Joel, Acts 2:20, and Revelation 6:12. The tetrad ended with the lunar eclipse on September 27–28, 2015.\nOn April 15, 2014, there was a total lunar eclipse which was the first of four consecutive total eclipses in a series, known as a tetrad; a second one took place on October 8, 2014, the third one on April 4, 2015, and the remaining one took place on September 27, 2015. It is one of eight tetrads to take place during the 21st century AD. As with most lunar eclipses, the moon appeared red during the April 15, 2014, eclipse. The red color is caused by Rayleigh scattering of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere, the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red. Hagee also connects the solar eclipse of March 20, 2015, in the middle of the sequence.\n\nThe idea of a \"blood moon\" serving as an omen of the coming of the end times comes from the Book of Joel, where it is written \"the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.\" This phrase is again mentioned by Saint Peter during Pentecost, as recorded in Acts, although Peter says that the date of Pentecost, not some future date, was the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy. The blood moon also appears in the Book of Revelation chapter 6 verses 11 – 13, where verse 12 says \" And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood\".\n\nAround 2008, Biltz began predicting that the Second Coming of Jesus would occur in the fall of 2015 with the seven years of the great tribulation beginning in the fall of 2008. He said he had \"discovered\" an astronomical pattern that predicted the next tetrad would coincide with the end times. When the prediction failed, he pulled the article from his website, but continued to teach on the \"significance\" of the tetrad.\n\nHagee would later seize on Biltz' prediction to write \"Four Blood Moons\", which would become a best seller, spending more than 150 days in Amazon.com's top 150 by April 2014. For the week ending March 30, 2014, it was the ninth best selling paperback, according to \"Publishers Weekly\". By mid-April, Hagee's book had hit No. 4 on \"The New York Times\" best-seller list in the advice category. Hagee's book (and subsequent sermon series at his home congregation, Cornerstone Church) did not proclaim that any specific \"end times\" event would occur (as did Biltz in his original prophecy), but claimed that every prior tetrad of the last 500 years coincided with events in Jewish and Israeli history that were originally tragic, yet followed by triumph.\n\nHagee and Biltz's speculations gained mainstream media attention in publications such as \"USA Today\" and \"The Washington Post\". \"Earth & Sky\" reported receiving \"a number of inquiries about Blood Moon\", prompting a response. Samantha Blake of \"Christian Today\" wrote that only a \"small group of Christians\" saw the eclipse as significant.\n\nWriting for \"Earth & Sky\" Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd point out that the referenced verse also says the \"sun will be turned into darkness\", an apparent reference to a \"solar\" eclipse. They note that since the Jewish Calendar is lunar, one sixth of all eclipses will occur during Passover or Sukkot. Furthermore, there have been 62 tetrads since the first century AD, though only eight of them have coincided with both feasts. Additionally, three of the four eclipses in the tetrad were not even visible in the biblical homeland of Israel, casting further doubt on Hagee and Biltz's interpretation; even then, only the very end of the last eclipse was visible in Israel. Writing for Space.com, Geoff Gaherty said he was saddened that 'prophets of doom' ... view these life-enriching events as portents of disaster\" and said the eclipse was \"hardly something to be concerned about\".\n\nIn January 2014, Mike Moore, the then General Secretary of Christian Witness to Israel, wrote a lengthy article dismissing the claims of Biltz and Hagee. Moore's view was that no significance can be drawn from the eclipses.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2251390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251390", "title": "Charlie Hebdo", "text": "Charlie Hebdo\n\nCharlie Hebdo (; French for \"Charlie Weekly\") is a French satirical weekly magazine, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics, and jokes. Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication describes itself as above all secular, skeptic, and atheist, far-left-wing, and anti-racist publishing articles about the extreme right (especially the French nationalist National Front party), religion (Catholicism, Islam, Judaism), politics and culture.\n\nThe magazine has been the target of two terrorist attacks, in 2011 and 2015. Both were presumed to be in response to a number of controversial Muhammad cartoons it published. In the second of these attacks, 12 people were killed, including publishing director Charb and several other prominent cartoonists.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" first appeared in 1970 as a companion to the monthly \"Hara-Kiri\" magazine, after a previous title was banned for mocking the death of former French President Charles de Gaulle. In 1981 publication ceased, but the magazine was resurrected in 1992. Its current editor-in-chief is Gérard Biard. The previous editors were François Cavanna (1970–1981) and Philippe Val (1992–2009). The magazine is published every Wednesday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.\n\nIn 1960, Georges \"Professeur Choron\" Bernier and François Cavanna launched a monthly magazine entitled \"Hara-Kiri\". Choron acted as the director of publication and Cavanna as its editor. Eventually Cavanna gathered together a team which included Roland Topor, Fred, Jean-Marc Reiser, Georges Wolinski, , and Cabu. After an early reader's letter accused them of being \"dumb and nasty\" (\"bête et méchant\"), the phrase became an official slogan for the magazine and made it into everyday language in France.\n\n\"Hara-Kiri\" was briefly banned in 1961, and again for six months in 1966. A few contributors did not return along with the newspaper, such as Gébé, Cabu, Topor, and Fred. New members of the team included , , and Willem.\n\nIn 1969, the \"Hara-Kiri\" team decided to produce a weekly publication – on top of the existing monthly magazine – which would focus more on current affairs. This was launched in February as \"Hara-Kiri Hebdo\" and renamed \"L'Hebdo Hara-Kiri\" in May of the same year. (\"Hebdo\" is short for \"hebdomadaire\" – \"weekly\")\n\nIn November 1970, the former French president Charles de Gaulle died in his home village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, eight days after a disaster in a nightclub, the Club Cinq-Sept fire, which caused the death of 146 people. The magazine released a cover spoofing the popular press's coverage of this disaster, headlined \"Tragic Ball at Colombey, one dead.\" As a result, the weekly was banned.\n\nIn order to sidestep the ban, the editorial team decided to change its title, and used \"Charlie Hebdo\". The new name was derived from a monthly comics magazine called \"Charlie\" (later renamed \"Charlie Mensuel\", meaning \"Charlie Monthly\"), which had been started by Bernier and Delfeil de Ton in 1969. The monthly \"Charlie\" took its name from the lead character of one of the comics it originally published, \"Peanuts\"s Charlie Brown. Using that title for the new weekly magazine was also an inside joke about Charles de Gaulle. The first issue did feature a \"Peanuts\" strip, as the editors were fans of the series.\n\nIn December 1981, publication ceased.\n\nIn 1991, Gébé, Cabu and others were reunited to work for \"La Grosse Bertha\", a new weekly magazine resembling \"Charlie Hebdo\" created in reaction to the First Gulf War and edited by singer and comedian Philippe Val. However, the following year, Val clashed with the publisher, who wanted apolitical humour, and was fired. Gébé and Cabu walked out with him and decided to launch their own paper again. The three called upon Cavanna, Delfeil de Ton and Wolinski, requesting their help and input. After much searching for a new name, the obvious idea of resurrecting \"Charlie Hebdo\" was agreed on. The new magazine was owned by Val, Gébé, Cabu and singer Renaud. Val was editor, Gébé publication director.\n\nThe publication of the new \"Charlie Hebdo\" began in July 1992 amidst much publicity. The first issue under the new publication sold 100,000 copies. Choron, who had fallen out with his former colleagues, tried to restart a weekly \"Hara-Kiri\", but its publication was short-lived. Choron died in January 2005.\n\nOn 26 April 1996, François Cavanna, Charb and Philippe Val filed 173,704 signatures, obtained in eight months, with the aim of banning the political party Front National, since it would have contravened the articles 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nIn 2000, journalist Mona Chollet was sacked after she had protested against a Philippe Val article which called Palestinians \"non-civilised\". In 2004, following the death of Gébé, Val succeeded him as director of publication, while still holding his position as editor.\n\nIn 2008, controversy broke over a column by veteran cartoonist Siné which led to accusations of antisemitism and Siné's sacking by Val. Siné successfully sued the newspaper for unfair dismissal and \"Charlie Hebdo\" was ordered to pay him €90,000 in damages. Siné launched a rival paper called ' which later became '. In 2009, Philippe Val resigned after being appointed director of France Inter, a public radio station to which he has contributed since the early 1990s. His functions were split between two cartoonists, Charb and Riss. Val gave away his shares in 2011. As of March 2011, \"Charlie Hebdo\" was owned by Charb (600 shares), Riss (599 shares), finance director Éric Portheault (299 shares), and Cabu and Bernard Maris with one share each.\n\nGérard Biard is the editor-in-chief of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nOn 5 May 2015 Charlie Hebdo was awarded the PEN/Toni and James C. Goodale Freedom of Expression Courage Award at the PEN American Center Literary Gala in New York City.\n\nIn 2007 the Grand Mosque of Paris began criminal proceedings against the chief-editor of \"Charlie Hebdo\", Philipe Val, under France's hate speech laws for publicly abusing a group on the ground of their religion. The lawsuit was limited to three specific cartoons, including one depicting Muhammad carrying a bomb in his turban. In March 2007 a Paris court acquitted Val, finding that it was fundamentalists, rather than Muslims, who were being ridiculed in the cartoons.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, a column by the cartoonist Siné (Maurice Sinet) appeared in \"Charlie Hebdo\" citing a rumour that Jean Sarkozy, son of Nicolas Sarkozy, had announced his intention to convert to Judaism before marrying his fiancée, Jewish heiress Jessica Sebaoun-Darty. Siné added, \"he'll go far, this lad!\" This led to complaints of antisemitism. The magazine's editor, Philippe Val, ordered Siné to write a letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would rather \"cut his own balls off,\" and was promptly fired. Both sides subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, Siné won a 40,000 euros court judgment against his former publisher for wrongful termination.\n\nControversy arose over the publication's edition of 9 February 2006. Under the title \"Mahomet débordé par les intégristes\" (\"Muhammad overwhelmed by fundamentalists\"), the front page showed a cartoon of a weeping Muhammad saying \"C'est dur d'être aimé par des cons\" (\"it's hard being loved by jerks\"). The newspaper reprinted the twelve cartoons of the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy and added some of their own. Compared to a regular circulation of 100,000 sold copies, this edition enjoyed great commercial success. 160,000 copies were sold and another 150,000 were in print later that day.\n\nIn response, French President Jacques Chirac condemned \"overt provocations\" which could inflame passions. \"Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided\", Chirac said. The Grand Mosque of Paris, the Muslim World League and the Union of French Islamic Organisations (UOIF) sued, claiming the cartoon edition included racist cartoons. A later edition contained a statement by a group of twelve writers warning against Islamism.\n\nThe suit by the Grand Mosque and the UOIF reached the courts in February 2007. Publisher Philippe Val contended \"It is racist to imagine that they can't understand a joke,\" but Francis Szpiner, the lawyer for the Grand Mosque, explained the suit: \"Two of those caricatures make a link between Muslims and Muslim terrorists. That has a name and it's called racism.\"\n\nFuture president Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to be read in court expressing his support for the ancient French tradition of satire. François Bayrou and future president François Hollande also expressed their support for freedom of expression. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) criticised the expression of these sentiments, claiming that they were politicising a court case.\n\nOn 22 March 2007, executive editor Val was acquitted by the court. The court followed the state attorney's reasoning that two of the three cartoons were not an attack on Islam, but on Muslim terrorists, and that the third cartoon with Muhammad with a bomb in his turban should be seen in the context of the magazine in question, which attacked religious fundamentalism.\n\nIn November 2011, the newspaper's office in the 20th arrondissement was fire-bombed and its website hacked. The attacks were presumed to be linked to its decision to rename the edition of 3 November 2011 \"Charia Hebdo\", with Muhammad listed as the \"editor-in-chief\". The cover, featuring a cartoon of Muhammad saying: \"100 lashes of the whip if you don't die laughing\" by Luz (Rénald Luzier), had circulated on social media for a couple of days.\n\nThe \"Charia Hebdo\" issue had been a response to recent news of the post-election introduction of sharia law in Libya and the victory of the Islamist party in Tunisia. It especially focuses on oppression of women under sharia, taking aim at domestic violence, mandatory veiling, burquas, restrictions on freedom, forced marriage, and stoning of those accused of adultery. It also targeted oppression of gays and dissenters, and practices such as stoning, flogging, hand/foot/tongue amputations, polygamy, forced marriage, and early indoctrination of children. \"Guest editor\" Muhammad is portrayed as a good-humoured voice of reason, decrying the recent elections and calling for a separation between politics and religion, while stating that Islam is compatible with humour. The magazine responded to the bombing by distributing some four times the usual number of copies.\n\nCharb was quoted by Associated Press stating that the attack might have been carried out by \"stupid people who don't know what Islam is\" and that they are \"idiots who betray their own religion\". Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, said his organisation deplores \"the very mocking tone of the paper toward Islam and its prophet but reaffirms with force its total opposition to all acts and all forms of violence.\" François Fillon, the prime minister, and Claude Guéant, the interior minister, voiced support for \"Charlie Hebdo\", as did feminist writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who criticised calls for self-censorship.\n\nIn September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which featured nude caricatures of him. Given that this issue came days after a series of attacks on US embassies in the Middle East, purportedly in response to the anti-Islamic film \"Innocence of Muslims\", the French government decided to increase security at certain French embassies, as well as to close the French embassies, consulates, cultural centres, and international schools in about 20 Muslim countries. In addition, riot police surrounded the offices of the magazine to protect it against possible attacks.\n\nForeign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised the magazine's decision, saying, \"In France, there is a principle of freedom of expression, which should not be undermined. In the present context, given this absurd video that has been aired, strong emotions have been awakened in many Muslim countries. Is it really sensible or intelligent to pour oil on the fire?\" The US White House said \"a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously, we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this.\" However, the newspaper's editor defended publication of the cartoons, saying, \"We do caricatures of everyone, and above all every week, and when we do it with the Prophet, it's called provocation.\"\n\nOn 7 January 2015, two Islamist gunmen forced their way into the Paris headquarters of \"Charlie Hebdo\" and opened fire, killing twelve: staff cartoonists Charb, Cabu, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, economist Bernard Maris, editors Elsa Cayat and Mustapha Ourrad, guest Michel Renaud, maintenance worker Frédéric Boisseau and police officers Brinsolaro and Merabet, and wounding eleven, four of them seriously.\n\nDuring the attack, the gunmen shouted \"Allahu akbar\" (\"God is great\" in Arabic) and also \"the Prophet is avenged\". President François Hollande described it as a \"terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity\". The two gunmen were identified as Saïd Kouachi and Chérif Kouachi, French Muslim brothers of Algerian descent.\n\nThe day after the attack, the remaining staff of \"Charlie Hebdo\" announced that publication would continue, with the following week's edition of the newspaper to be published according to the usual schedule with a print run of one million copies, up significantly from its usual 60,000. On 13 January 2015, the news came on BBC that the first issue after the massacre will come out in three million copies. On Wednesday itself it was announced that with a huge demand in France, the print run would be raised from three to five million copies. The newspaper announced the revenue from the issue would go towards the families of the victims.\n\nThe French government granted nearly €1 million to support the magazine. The Digital Innovation Press Fund (French: \"Fonds Google–AIPG pour l’Innovation Numérique de la presse\"), partially funded by Google, donated €250,000, matching a donation by the French Press and Pluralism Fund. The Guardian Media Group pledged a donation of £100,000.\n\n After the attacks, the phrase \"\", French for \"I am Charlie\", was adopted by supporters of free speech and freedom of expression who were reacting to the shootings. The phrase identifies a speaker or supporter of those who were killed at the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.\n\nThe slogan was first used on Twitter and spread to the Internet at large. The Twitter account and the original \"Je suis Charlie\" picture bearing the phrase in white Charlie Hebdo style font on black background were created by French journalist and artist Joachim Roncin just after the massacre.\n\nThe website of \"Charlie Hebdo\" went offline shortly after the shooting, and when it returned it bore the legend \"Je Suis Charlie\" on a black background. The statement was used as the hashtag #jesuischarlie on Twitter, as computer-printed or hand-made placards and stickers, and displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites. While other symbols were used, notably holding pens in the air, the phrase \"Not Afraid\", and tweeting certain images, \"Je Suis Charlie\" became more widespread.\n\nA series of rallies took place in cities across France on 10–11 January 2015 to honour the victims of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, and also to voice support for freedom of speech.\n\nLuz, one of the survivors of the attack, stated: \"People sang \"La Marseillaise\". We're speaking about the memory of Charb, Tignous, Cabu, Honoré, Wolinski: they would all have abhorred that kind of attitude.\" Willem, another surviving cartoonist, declared that \"We vomit on those who suddenly declared that they were our friends\".\n\nUnrest in Niger following the publication of the post-attack issue of \"Charlie Hebdo\" resulted in ten deaths, dozens injured, and at least nine churches burned. \"The Guardian\" reported seven churches burned in Niamey alone. Churches were also reported to be on fire in eastern Maradi and Goure. Violent demonstrations also were prevalent in Zinder, where some burned French flags. There were violent demonstrations in Karachi in Pakistan, where Asif Hassan, a photographer working for the Agence France-Presse, was seriously injured by a shot to the chest. In Algiers and Jordan, protesters clashed with police, while peaceful demonstrations were held in Khartoum, Sudan, Russia, Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania.\n\nRT reported that a million people attended a demonstration in Grozny, the capital city of the Chechen Republic, protesting against the depictions of Muhammad in \"Charlie Hebdo\" and proclaiming that Islam is a religion of peace. One of the slogans was \"Violence is not the method\". Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov declared a regional holiday and denounced \"people without spiritual and moral values\" in front of an audience estimated to range between 600,000 and a million people.\n\nOne week after the murders, Donald Trump mocked \"Charlie Hebdo\", saying the magazine reminded him of another \"nasty and dishonest\" satirical publication and that the magazine was on the verge of financial collapse.\n\nA British NGO, the Islamic Human Rights Commission, gave their 2015 international 'Islamophobe of the Year' award to \"Charlie Hebdo\", whereas another British organisation, the National Secular Society, awarded the \"Charlie Hebdo\" staff with Secularist of the Year 2015 \"for their courageous response to the terror attack\". The magazine said it would donate the associated £5,000 prize money to the fund that supports the families of the murdered cartoonists.\n\nFollowing some controversies over the paper's future following the 2015 attack, Charb's 40% stake in \"Charlie Hebdo\" was purchased from his parents by Riss and Eric Portheault, who were as of July 2015 sole shareholders in the paper. \"Charlie Hebdo\" switched to a new legal press publisher status which requires 70% of profits to be reinvested.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" was accused of attacking freedom of press when its lawyer Richard Malka tried to prevent the publication of the magazine \"Charpie Hebdo\", a pastiche of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nDaniel Schneidermann argues that the 2015 attack raised the profile of the paper internationally with non-Francophone audiences, meaning that only parts of the paper are selectively translated into English, making it easy to misrepresent the editorial stance of the publication and the purpose of provocative work. Nadine Morano was offended at being drawn as a baby with Down syndrome after making remarks supporting the National Front.\n\nOne year after the attack, the weekly featured a caricature of Yahweh with a Kalashnikov rifle. The Vatican and Jewish groups said they were offended, and the Associated Press censored images of the cover.\n\nThe 14 September 2015 edition's cover cartoon by Coco depicted a migrant being maltreated by a man who proclaims \"welcome to refugees\" - in order to parody European claims about compassion. Riss wrote an editorial on the European migrant crisis, arguing that it was hypocritical for Hungarian politicians to declare themselves compassionate because of their Christian beliefs, but at the same time reject migrants from Syria. Riss parodied anti-immigrant attitudes by featuring a cartoon with a caricature of Jesus walking on water next to a drowning Muslim boy, with the caption \"this is how we know Europe is Christian\". The cartoons were widely seen as gallows humour in France, but prompted another wave of controversy abroad. That issue also included a caricature of the dead body of Syrian Kurdish refugee child Alan Kurdi next to a McDonald's sign with the caption, \"So close to his goal.\" In response to criticism, cartoonist Corinne Rey said that she was criticising the consumerist society that was being sold to migrants like a dream. After the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, a January 2016 edition included a cartoon by Riss about Kurdi, reflecting fickle sentiment towards refugees by including a caption questioning whether the boy would have grown up to be an \"ass groper in Germany\".\n\nFollowing the crash of Metrojet Flight 9268, which killed 224 civilians, mostly Russian women and children, and was seen as a probable terrorist attack, \"Charlie Hebdo\" published cartoons which were widely perceived as mocking the victims of the tragedy. One of the cartoons showed a victim's blue-eyed skull and a burned-out plane on the ground, with the caption: \"The dangers of Russian low cost\" flights. The other showed pieces of the plane falling on an Islamic State (ISIS) fighter with the caption: \"Russia's air force intensifies its bombing.\" A spokesman for Vladimir Putin called the artwork \"sacrilege\", and members of the State Duma called for the magazine to be banned as extremist literature and demanded an apology from France.\n\nOn 2 September 2016, following the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake, which caused 294 deaths, the French magazine published a cartoon in which the earthquake victims are depicted as pasta dishes, under the title \"Séisme à l'italienne\". The reaction of Italians was unleashed on social networks so that, on the official Facebook page of the magazine, the cartoonist Coco pointed out with another cartoon: \"Italians ... it's not Charlie Hebdo who builds your houses, it's the Mafia!\" The French ambassador in Rome, in a statement, pointed out that the French Government's position on the Italian earthquake is not that expressed by \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nOn 29 December 2016, Russia accused \"Charlie Hebdo\" of 'mocking' the Black Sea plane crash after publishing 'inhuman' cartoons about the disaster. In one reference to the crash, which claimed 92 lives, including 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble choir, the French magazine depicted a jet hurtling downwards along with words translated as: 'Bad news... Putin wasn't on board'. Russian defence spokesman called cartoons 'a poorly-created abomination'. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said: \"If such, I dare say, 'artistry' is the real manifestation of 'Western values', then those who hold and support them are doomed\".\n\nSince 2016 Riss is now the publishing director of the magazine, and he owns 70% of the shares. The other 30% is owned by Éric Portheault.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

According to Bahá'í law, only the head of the religion, currently the Universal House of Justice, has the authority to declare a person a covenant-breaker. \n\nA person may be declared a covenant-breaker for actions which are seen as challenging the unity of the Bahá'í community, not for personal matters such as failure to obey Bahá'í law or conversion to another religion. \n\nWhen a person is a declared a covenant-breaker all Bahá'ís are expected to avoid unnecessary association with that person. \n\nCovenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from non-Bahá'ís or former Baha'is. Rather, it is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition where the Covenant-breaker is seen as challenging the unity of the Bahá'í Faith, causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure. The central purpose of the covenant is to prevent schism and dissension.\nIn a letter to an individual dated 23 March 1975, the Universal House of Justice wrote:\nThe term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqid al-mithaq' [pl. Naqidu 'l-mithaq], was first used by `Abdu'l-Bahá to describe the partisans of his brother Mírzá Muhammad `Alí, who challenged his leadership. In `Abdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament, He appointed Shoghi Effendi as the \"Guardian\" of the religion and called for the eventual election of the Universal House of Justice, and defined in the same manner opposition to these two institutions as Covenant-Breaking. `Abdu'l-Bahá advised all Bahá'ís to shun anyone opposing the Covenant: \"...one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past.\"\n\nMost Covenant-breakers are involved in schismatic groups, but not always. For example, a Bahá'í who refuses to follow guidance on treatment of Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article originally written for the Bahá'í Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bahá'í history as belonging to one of four categories:\n\n\nShoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957:\nBeyond this, many other relationships to the Bahá'í Faith exist, both positive and negative. Covenant-breaking does not apply to most of them. The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed Covenant-breakers:\n\n\nBábís are generally regarded as another religion altogether. Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broken it, and Bábís never recognized or swore allegiance to Bahá'u'lláh, they are not Covenant-breakers.\n\nFollowers of Subh-i-Azal, Bahá'u'lláh's half-brother who tried to poison him, engaged in active opposition to Bahá'ís, and Shoghi Effendi did inform Bahá'ís that they should avoid contact with his descendants, writing that \"No intelligent and loyal Baha'i would associate with a descendant of Azal, if he traced the slightest breath of criticism of our Faith, in any aspect, from that person. In fact these people should be strenuously avoided as having an inherited spiritual disease -- the disease of Covenant-breaking!\".\n\nThrough the influence of Bahiyyih Khanum, the eldest daughter of Bahá'u'lláh, everyone in the household initially rallied around Shoghi Effendi after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá. For several years his brother Husayn and several cousins served him as secretaries. The only ones publicly opposing him were Mírzá Muhammad `Alí and his followers, who were declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bahá. Contrary to `Abdu'l-Bahá's specific instruction, certain family members established illicit links with those whom `Abdu'l-Bahá had declared Covenant-breakers. After Bahiyyih Khanum died in 1932, Shoghi Effendi's eldest sister – Ruhangiz – married a son of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Bahá'u'lláh's son-in-law was, thus, a long-standing enemy of `Abdu'l-Bahá (who had declared him a Covenant-breaker.) Through Ruhangiz's efforts, Shoghi Effendi's other sister and his cousin Thurayya also married sons of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Presumably being faced with a choice between shunning their disobedient family members and being themselves disobedient to `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, his cousins, aunts and uncles chose the latter.\n\nAfter years of silence on these developments, cables sent by Shoghi Effendi on November 2, 1941 provide background to developments among family members. Ruhi Afnan, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through `Abdu'l-Bahá's daughter Tuba:\n\n\nFaydi was the son of Furughiyyih Khanum, a daughter of Bahá'u'lláh by his third wife Gawhar. Furughiyyih and her children all supported Mírzá Muhammad `Alí. Faydi had two elder brothers. Hussein Effendi Afnan was aide-de-camp to Faisal II of Iraq and Nayyer Effendi Afnan was Commissioner of Parks in Cairo, Egypt. The entire Bahá'í Family was stigmatized by Shoghi Effendi as Covenant-breakers as he was displeased with their marriages.\n\nThen in a 1950 cable:\n\n\nAnd in 1953:\n\n\nLater, Ruhi was presented with a copy of Sohrab's book about his excommunication:\n\nConcerning Munib Shahid, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through `Abdu'l-Bahá's daughter Ruha, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world in November 1944:\n\n\nHusayn Ali was Shoghi Effendi's brother. In April 1945, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world: \"My faithless brother Husayn, after long period of dishonourable conduct, has abandoned the Master's home to consort with his sister and other Covenant-breakers\" (\"Bahá'í News\", No. 174, p.2). In March 1950, Shoghi Effendi would send a further cable: \"Faithless brother Hussein, already abased through dishonorable conduct over period (of) years followed by association with Covenant-breakers (in) Holy Land and efforts (to) undermine Guardian's position, recently further demeaned himself through marriage under obscure circumstances with lowborn Christian girl (in) Europe\" (\"Bahá'í News\", No. 229, p.1). Shoghi Effendi would later defend the use of the term \"lowborn Christian girl\" as follows: \"Regarding his cable concerning Hussein: he has been very surprised to note that the terms 'low-born Christian girl ' and 'disgraceful alliance' should arouse any question; it seems to him that the friends should realize it is not befitting for the Guardian's own brother, the grandchild of the Master, an Afnán and Aghsán mentioned in the Will and Testament of the Master, and of whom so much was expected because of his relation to the family of the Prophet, to marry an unknown girl, according to goodness knows what rite, who is not a believer at all\" (\"Bahá'í News\", No. 236, p.4).\n\nConcerning his own brother Riaz, the following cable was sent in December 1951:\n\n\nHe dispatched a cable concerning his younger sister in December 1941:\n\n\nThe reason for her being declared a Covenant-breaker was that she followed the example of Ruhi's sister by marrying to one of his cousins without the Guardian's consent. Mehrangiz married to Hassan Afnan, the son of Furughiyyih Khanum, a daughter of Bahá'u'lláh by his third wife Gawhar.\n\nMost of the groups regarded by the larger group of Bahá'ís as Covenant-breakers originated in the claims of Charles Mason Remey to the Guardianship in 1960. The Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá states that Guardians should be lineal descendants of Bahá'u'lláh, that each Guardian must select his successor during his lifetime, and that the nine Hands of the Cause of God permanently stationed in the holy land must approve the appointment by majority vote. Bahá'ís interpret lineal descendency to mean physical familial relation to Bahá'u'lláh, of which Mason Remey was not.\n\nAlmost all of Bahá'ís accepted the determination of the Hands of the Cause that upon the death of Shoghi Effendi, he died \"without having appointed his successor\". There was an absence of a valid descendant of Bahá'u'lláh who could qualify under the terms of `Abdu'l-Bahá's will. Later the Universal House of Justice, initially elected in 1963, made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.\n\nIn 1960 Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed to have been coerced. He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi. He and the small number of people who followed him were expelled from the Faith by the Hands of the Cause. Those close to Remey claimed that he went senile in old age, and by the time of his death he was largely abandoned, with his most prominent followers fighting amongst themselves for leadership.\n\nThe largest group of the remaining followers of Remey, members of the so called \"Orthodox Bahá'í Faith\", believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella. They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers.\n\nThe present descendants of expelled members of Bahá'u'lláh's family have not specifically been declared Covenant-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bahá'í religion.\n\nA small group of Bahá'ís in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendants are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bahá'u'lláh to arise as the rightful Guardian.\n\nThere is also a small group in Montana, originally inspired by Leland Jensen, who claimed a status higher than that of the Guardian. His failed apocalyptic predictions and unsuccessful efforts to reestablish the Guardianship and the administration were apparent by his death in 1996. A dispute among Jensen's followers over the identity of the Guardian resulted in another division in 2001.\n\n\n"}

Christians believe that he was (and still is) divine, while Islam considers him to have been a prophet, messenger and the Messiah. Since the time in which he is said to have lived, a number of noted individuals have criticised Jesus, some of whom were themselves Christians.\n\nEarly critics of Jesus and Christianity included Celsus in the second century and Porphyry in the third. In the 19th century, Friedrich Nietzsche was highly critical of Jesus, whose teachings he considered to be \"anti-nature\" in their treatment of topics such as sexuality. More contemporary notable critics of Jesus include Ayn Rand, Hector Avalos, Sita Ram Goel, Christopher Hitchens, Bertrand Russell, and Dayananda Saraswati.\n\nThe Pharisees and scribes criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing Mosaic Law. They criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating. (The religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them—, .) Jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans (). The Pharisees also criticized Jesus' disciples for gathering grain on the Sabbath ().\n\nIn the latter half of the first century and into the second century, Jewish and pagan opponents of Christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus and his followers were the result of magic.\n\nAvery Robert Dulles held the opinion that \"Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution\", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either. In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, \"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery.\" Giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that Jesus approved of slavery. In certain major non-English translations, the first statement in the first sermon of Jesus (Luke 4:18), is a call to free the slaves: \"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war...\" (see Cornilescu translation).\n\nCelsus, 2nd-century Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity, mounts a wide criticism against Jesus as the founder of the Christian faith. He discounts or disparages Jesus' ancestry, conception, birth, childhood, ministry, death, resurrection, and continuing influence. According to Celsus, Jesus' ancestors came from a Jewish village. His mother was a poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth. He worked his miracles by sorcery and was a small, homely man. This Rabbi Jesus kept all Jewish customs, including sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. He gathered only a few followers and taught them his worst habits, including begging for money. These disciples, amounting to \"ten boatmen and a couple of tax collectors\" were not respectable. The reports of his resurrection came from a hysterical female, and belief in the resurrection was the result of Jesus' sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers, all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars.\n\nAccording to Celsus, Jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution.\n\nCelsus stated that Jesus was the bastard child of the Roman soldier Panthera or Pantera. These charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the Jewish charge that Jesus was conceived as the result of adultery (see Jesus in the Talmud) and that his true father was a Roman soldier named Panthera. Panthera was a common name among Roman soldiers of that period. The name has some similarity to the Greek adjective \"parthenos\", meaning \"virgin\". The tomb of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera, found in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, is taken by some scholars to refer to the Pantera named by Celsus.\n\nAccording to Celsus, Jesus had no standing in the Hebrew Bible prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness.\n\nThe Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry of Tyre (c. 232–c. 304) authored the 15 volume treatise \"Against the Christians\", proscribed by the Emperors Constantine and Theodosius II, of which only fragments now survive and were collected by Adolf von Harnack. Selected fragments were published in English translation by J. Stevenson in 1957, of which the following is one example:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century philosopher, has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity, even going so far as to style himself as \"The Anti-Christ\". In \"Human, All Too Human\", and \"Twilight of the Idols\" for example, Nietzsche accuses the Church's and Jesus' teachings as being anti-natural in their treatment of passions, in particularly sexuality: \"There [In the Sermon on the Mount] it is said, for example, with particular reference to sexuality: 'If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.' Fortunately, no Christian acts in accordance with this precept... the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.\" Nietzsche does explicitly consider Jesus as a mortal, and furthermore as ultimately misguided, the antithesis of a true hero, whom he posits with his concept of a Dionysian hero. Nietzsche was repulsed by Jesus' elevation of the lowly: \"Everything pitiful, everything suffering from itself, everything tormented by base feelings, the whole ghetto-world of the soul suddenly on top!\"\n\nHowever Nietzsche did not demur of Jesus, saying he was the \"only one true Christian\". He presented a Christ whose own inner life consisted of \"blessedness in peace, in gentleness, in the \"inability\" for enmity\". There is much criticism by Nietzsche of the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ's evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of God is within you. \"What are the 'glad tidings'? True life, eternal life is found—it is not promised, it is here, it is \"within you\": as life lived in love... 'Sin', every kind of distancing relationship between God and man, is abolished - \"precisely this is the 'glad tidings'.\" The 'glad tidings' are precisely that there are no more opposites...\"\n\nDayananda Saraswati, a 19th-century philosopher and the founder of Arya Samaj, in his book \"Satyarth Prakash\", criticized Christianity and described Jesus as a \"great thing in a country of uneducated savages\":\n\"All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peace-loving person. But in reality he was a hot-tempered person destitute of knowledge and who behaved like a wild savage. This shows that Jesus was neither the son of God, nor had he any miraculous powers. He did not possess the power to forgive sins. The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like Jesus. Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world. Therefore, it is evident that the hoax of Christ’s being the Son of God, the knower of the past and the future, the forgiver of sin, has been set up falsely by his disciples. In reality, he was a very ordinary ignorant man, neither learned nor a yogi.\"\n\nSaraswati asserted that Jesus wasn't an enlightened man either, and that if Jesus was a son of God, God would have saved him at the time of his death, and he wouldn't have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments.\n\nNoting that the Bible writes that women held the feet of Jesus and worshiped him, he questions:\n\"Was it the same body which had been buried? Now that body had been buried for three days, we should like to know why did it not decompose?\"\n\nIn the 1927 essay \"Why I Am Not a Christian\", Russell pointed to parts of the gospel where Jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners (). He concludes from this that Jesus' prediction was incorrect and thus that Jesus was \"not so wise as some other people have been, and He was certainly not superlatively wise\".\n\nThough Russell believed Jesus 'had a very high degree of moral goodness', he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character. In his essay he wrote: \n\nRussell also expresses doubt over the historical existence of Jesus and questions the morality of religion: \"I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.\"\n\nNovelist and philosopher Ayn Rand denounced the altruist recipe that Jesus passed down to his pupils, and with it the idea of vicarious redemption. She thought that not even Christians, who think of Jesus in the highest possible terms, shouldn't feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice. Not surprisingly, her understanding of love as a consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values attributes evil to the ideas Jesus is most famous for. Consider the following excerpt from a 1959 interview conducted by Mike Wallace:\nWallace: Christ, every important moral leader in man's history, has taught us that we should love one another. Why then is this kind of love in your mind immoral?<br>\nRand: It is immoral if it is a love placed above oneself. It is more than immoral, it's impossible. Because when you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately. That is to love people without any standard. To love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue, you are asked to love nobody.\n\nNotwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife, Rand saw Jesus' insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates, including Christian altruism.\n\nIn For the New Intellectual, Rand further accuses Judeo-Christian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality. \"The evils for which they damn him [man] are reason, morality, creativeness, joy — all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn. They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.\" And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult: \"No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body.\"\n\nHistorian and Hindu activist Sita Ram Goel accused Jesus of being the intellectual author behind Western imperialism and the Holocaust.\nGoel further writes that Jesus \"is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression. He does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness.\"\n\nHe made his case based on the gospels, which he thought cast too dark a shadow on unconverted Jews (see for instance ). From there he drew parallels between Jesus and Adolf Hitler, the latter of whom was, in Goel's words, the first to \"completely grasp the verdict passed on the Jews by the Jesus of the gospels\".\n\nRam Goel also ridiculed what he termed \"the cult of the disentangled Christ\", whereby Christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of Jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired — and only from the bad ones — as though missionary proselytism and Western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence.\n\nAuthor and journalist Christopher Hitchens, one of the leading exponents in the \"New Atheism\" movement, was extremely critical of Jesus, Christianity and any religion in general. Regarding Jesus' teachings on hell, Hitchens wrote:\n\"The god of Moses would call for other tribes, including his favorite one, to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation, but when the grave closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he remembered to curse their succeeding progeny. Not until the advent of the Prince of Peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and torturing the dead.\"\n\nHitchens also felt that a divine Jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the problem of evil, asking:\n\"If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened to meet, then why not heal blindness?\"\n\nSam Harris, author of The End of Faith, has expressed ambivalent views on Jesus' teachings. He argues that while Jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times, he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric law of the Old Testament, and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics. To Harris, Jesus' unresolved frustration and hatred of non-Christians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates, and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell. He wrote:\n\nTo the same end of exposing Jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell, Harris quotes Luke's version of the parable of the talents, which ends with the nobleman character saying:\n\nWhich is taken to be a self-portrait of Jesus and his own eschatological views.\n\nHector Avalos is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write a systematic critique of the ethics of Jesus in his book, \"The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics\". Koowon Kim, an associate professor in the Old Testament at Reformed Graduate University in South Korea remarks in his review of \"The Bad Jesus\": \"Whether or not one agrees with the author’s conclusions, this book is the first systematic challenge to New Testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the Hebrew Bible and its ancient Near Eastern context and well-versed in New Testament and Early Christianity.\"\n\nIn a review in \"Bilbilcal Theology Bulletin\", Sarah Rollens, a New Testament scholar at Rhodes College, remarks: \"Hector Avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of Jesus based on New Testament texts are morally or ethically problematic, but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize, explain away, or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards.\"\n\nJudaism, which includes Orthodox Judaism, Haredi Judaism, Hasidic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Samaritan Judaism, entirely rejects the idea of Jesus being a god, a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God who has a special relationship with Him that somehow makes Jesus \"divine\". Moreover, it is \"Avodah Zarah\" (\"foreign worship\", which means idolatry) to regard or worship a human being as God; in Judaism, as well as in Islam, God is only One, totally transcendent, and cannot be human (Exodus , Deuteronomy , ).\n\nJudaism also holds that Jesus couldn't be the Jewish Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the Messianic prophecies foretold in the Tanakh, nor did he embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah foretold by the Prophets. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE. Thus Judaism is critical of Jesus' own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the \"son of God\", as presented in the New Testament, and considers Jesus to be just one of many individuals who claimed to be the Messiah, but didn't fulfill any of the Messianic prophecies; therefore, they were all impostors.\n\nThe \"Mishneh Torah\", one of the most authoritative works of Jewish law, written by Moses Maimonides, provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in \"Hilkhot Melakhim\" 11:10–12 that Jesus is a \"stumbling block\" who makes \"the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11627", "title": "Faith healing", "text": "Faith healing\n\nFaith healing is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as laying on of hands) that are believed by some to elicit divine intervention in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice. Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a divine presence and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on empirical evidence that faith healing achieves an evidence-based outcome.\n\nClaims \"attributed to a myriad of techniques\" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. Recoveries have been attributed to many techniques commonly classified as faith healing. It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being.\n\nMany people interpret the Bible, especially the New Testament, as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 \"Newsweek\" poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease. Unlike faith healing, advocates of spiritual healing make no attempt to seek divine intervention, instead believing in divine energy. The increased interest in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health.\n\nVirtually all scientists and philosophers dismiss faith healing as pseudoscience. Faith healing can be classified as a spiritual, supernatural, or paranormal topic, and, in some cases, belief in faith healing can be classified as magical thinking. The American Cancer Society states \"available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments\". \"Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.\" When parents have practiced faith healing rather than medical care, many children have died that otherwise would have been expected to live. Similar results are found in adults.\n\nRegarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the Holy Spirit, faith healing often involves the laying on of hands. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including Elijah, Jesus and Paul.\n\nChristian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal. Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves, Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : \"He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.\"\n\nEven those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. \"[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are.\" Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes. \"Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to 'hold on to your miracle' will not cause your healing to manifest now.\" Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. \"The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time.\"\n\nParts of the four gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. One example is the case of \"a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse.\" After healing her, Jesus tells her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness.\" At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: and .\n\nJesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37), who \"bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine\" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, \"And who is my neighbor?\" in verse 29) to \"go, and do likewise\" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).\n\nThe healing in the gospels is referred to as a \"sign\" to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ. However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some but granted others in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed \"all\" who were present every single time. Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.\n\nJesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free\".\n\nJesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: \"Do not tell anyone!\" Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a \"wicked and adulterous generation.\"\n\nThe apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.\n\nIn the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.\n\nThe New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles.\n\nJesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age. as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the new Pentecostal movement drew participants from the Holiness movement and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.\n\nThe first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in Topeka, Kansas, in a Bible school conducted by Charles Fox Parham, a holiness teacher and former Methodist pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles led by William Joseph Seymour.\n\nSmith Wigglesworth was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned evangelist who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Aimee Semple McPherson was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the Great Depression. Subsequently, William M. Branham has been credited as the initiater of the post-World War II healing revivals. The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers. Because of this, Branham has been recognized as the \"father of modern faith healers.\" According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, \"the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement.\" By the late 1940s, Oral Roberts, who was associated with and promoted by Branham's Voice of Healing magazine also became well known, and he continued with faith healing until the 1980s. Roberts discounted faith healing in the late 1950s, stating, \"I never was a faith healer and I was never raised that way. My parents believed very strongly in medical science and we have a doctor who takes care of our children when they get sick. I cannot heal anyone – God does that.\" A friend of Roberts was Kathryn Kuhlman, another popular faith healer, who gained fame in the 1950s and had a television program on CBS. Also in this era, Jack Coe and A. A. Allen were faith healers who traveled with large tents for large open-air crusades.\n\nOral Roberts's successful use of television as a medium to gain a wider audience led others to follow suit. His former pilot, Kenneth Copeland, started a healing ministry. Pat Robertson, Benny Hinn, and Peter Popoff became well-known televangelists who claimed to heal the sick. Richard Rossi is known for advertising his healing clinics through secular television and radio. Kuhlman influenced Benny Hinn, who adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about her.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes two \"not mutually exclusive\" kinds of healing, one justified by science and one justified by faith:\n\nIn 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued \"Instruction on prayers for healing\" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing, which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.\n\nIt accepts \"that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science,\" but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.\n\nFaith healing is reported by Catholics as the result of intercessory prayer to a saint or to a person with the gift of healing. According to \"U.S. Catholic\" magazine, \"Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible.\" Three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for miracles.\n\nAccording to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, \"The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation,' or a sign of the kingdom that is coming.\" Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.\n\nThe Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process. Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.\n\nAccording to \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", it is often said that cures at shrines and during Christian pilgrimages are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in Divine providence, and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.\n\nAmong the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of Lourdes at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to Saint Jude, who is known as the \"patron saint of lost causes\".\n, Catholic medics have asserted that there have been 67 miracles and 7,000 unexplainable medical cures at Lourdes since 1858. In a 1908 book, it says these cures were subjected to intense medical scrutiny and were only recognized as authentic spiritual cures after a commission of doctors and scientists, called the Lourdes Medical Bureau, had ruled out any physical mechanism for the patient's recovery. Belgian philosopher and skeptic Etienne Vermeersch coined the term Lourdes effect as a criticism of the magical thinking and placebo effect possibilities for the claimed miraculous cures as there are no documented events where a severed arm has been reattached through faith healing at Lourdes. Vermeersch identifies ambiguity and equivocal nature of the miraculous cures as a key feature of miraculous events.\n\nChristian Science claims that healing is possible through an understanding of the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation. The world as humanly perceived is believed to be a distortion of spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in correcting the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Prayer works through love: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.\n\nAn important point in Christian Science is that effectual prayer and the moral regeneration of one's life go hand-in-hand: that \"signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin, to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world.\" Christian Science teaches that disease is mental, a mortal fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and power of ill-health – an ignorance of God's power and goodness. The chapter \"Prayer\" in \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\" gives a full account of healing through prayer, while the testimonies at the end of the book are written by people who believe they have been healed through spiritual understanding gained from reading the book.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the \"Ensign\". The church believes healings come most often as a result of priesthood blessings given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith.\n\nAccording to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored priesthood authority to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. Brigham Young stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.\n\nKonkhogin Haokip has claimed some Muslims believe that the Quran was sent not only as a revelation, but as a medicine, and that they believe the Quran heals any physical and spiritual ailments through such practices as\n\nSome critics of Scientology have referred to some of its practices as being similar to faith healing, based on claims made by L. Ron Hubbard in \"\" and other writings.\n\nNearly all scientists dismiss faith healing as pseudoscience. Some opponents of the pseudoscience label assert that faith healing makes no scientific claims and thus should be treated as a matter of faith that is not testable by science. Critics reply that claims of medical cures should be tested scientifically because, although faith in the supernatural is not in itself usually considered to be the purview of science, claims of reproducible effects are nevertheless subject to scientific investigation.\n\nScientists and doctors generally find that faith healing lacks biological plausibility or epistemic warrant, which is one of the criteria to used to judge whether clinical research is ethical and financially justified. A Cochrane review of intercessory prayer found \"although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not\". The authors concluded: \"We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care.\" \n\nA review in 1954 investigated spiritual healing, therapeutic touch and faith healing. Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.\n\nIn addition, at least one study has suggested that adult Christian Scientists, who generally use prayer rather than medical care, have a higher death rate than other people of the same age.\n\nThe Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient’s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices.” This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.\n\nSkeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural. The first is \"post hoc ergo propter hoc\", meaning that a genuine improvement or spontaneous remission may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the placebo effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed. In both cases the patient may experience a real reduction in symptoms, though in neither case has anything miraculous or inexplicable occurred. Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society:\nThe American Medical Association considers that prayer as therapy should not be a medically reimbursable or deductible expense.\n\nReliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques. This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children and in reduced life expectancy for adults. Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled \"healings\", where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment. For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications. It is the stated position of the AMA that \"prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care\". Choosing faith healing while rejecting modern medicine can and does cause people to die needlessly.\n\nChristian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.\n\nThe first is widely termed the \"open-but-cautious\" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by Robert L. Saucy in the book \"Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?\". Don Carson is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an \"open-but-cautious\" view. In dealing with the claims of Warfield, particularly \"Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,\" Carson asserts, \"But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so.\" However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, \"Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith.\"\n\nThe second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as cessationism, its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. Richard Gaffin argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book \"Are Miraculous Gifts for Today\"? In his book \"Perspectives on Pentecost\" Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that \"the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church.\" Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying \"At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on.\"\n\nSkeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a quack practice in which the \"healers\" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money. James Randi's \"The Faith Healers\" investigates Christian evangelists such as Peter Popoff, who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show. According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud. The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes. Physicist Robert L. Park and doctor and consumer advocate Stephen Barrett have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.\n\nThere have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a Jack Coe revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's leg braces. However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain. As a result, through the efforts of Joseph L. Lewis, Coe was arrested and charged on February 6, 1956 with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A Florida Justice of the Peace dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law. Later that year Coe was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on December 17, 1956.\n\nTV personality Derren Brown produced a show on faith healing entitled \"Miracles for sale\" which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.\n\nThe 1974 Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to child neglect and child abuse laws in order to receive federal money. The CAPTA amendments of 1996 state:\n\nThirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming. In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter. Of these, Idaho is the only state accused of having a large number of deaths due to the legislation in recent times. In February 2015, controversy was sparked in Idaho over a bill believed to further reinforce parental rights to deny their children medical care.\n\nParents have been convicted of child abuse and felony reckless negligent homicide and found responsible for killing their children when they withheld lifesaving medical care and chose only prayers.\n\n"}

The changes made by Pope Pius XII thus remained unaltered for only five years.\n\nHe made the following changes by the decree \"Cum nostra hac aetate\" (De rubricis ad simpliciorem formam redigendis) of 23 March 1955\n\nThe grade and rite of \"Semi-Double\" was suppressed, and the liturgical days formerly celebrated as that rite were to be celebrated in the simple rite except the Vigil of Pentecost which was raised to the double rite.\n\nThe Sundays of Advent and Lent and those that follow up to Low Sunday, and also Pentecost Sunday, were to be celebrated as doubles of the first class, outranking all feasts; but when feasts of the first class occurred on the second, third or fourth Sunday of Advent, Masses of the feast were permitted except the conventual Mass. Sundays previously celebrated in the Semi-Double rite were raised to the Double rite. An impeded Sunday Office and Mass was to be neither anticipated nor resumed. A feast or title or any mystery of Our Lord falling on a Sunday per annum was thenceforth to take the place of the Sunday, with the latter merely commemorated.\n\nThe Vigil of the Nativity of the Lord and the vigil of Pentecost were privileged vigils. The Vigils of the Ascension of Our Lord, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Baptist, Saints Peter and Paul and Saint Lawrence were to be common vigils and, if they occurred on a Sunday, were not to be anticipated, but simply omitted. All other vigils, including those marked in particular calendars, were suppressed.\n\nOnly the Octaves of Easter, Christmas and Pentecost were to be celebrated; all others occurring either in the universal or in particular calendars were suppressed. The days within the Easter and Pentecost octaves were raised to the Double rite, had precedence over all feasts, and did not admit commemorations. But the days of the Octave of Christmas, although of the Double rite, continued to be celebrated as before.\n\nFrom 2 to 5 January, unless some feast occurred, the Office was to be of the current feria in the simple rite. The Mass was to be the same as that of 1 January but without the Credo and the special \"Communicantes\".\n\nWith the suppression of the Octave of Epiphany, the days from 7 to 12 January became feriae per annum (in the Simple rite); up to the Sunday following Epiphany, the Mass was to be the same as that of the Epiphany, but without the Credo and without the special \"Communicantes\"; after the Sunday, the mass was to be that of the Sunday (which on that Sunday itself remained continually impeded by the Feast of the Holy Family). On 13 January the Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord was to be celebrated in the major double rite, using for the Office and the Mass those previously said on the Octave of the Epiphany. But if 13 January occurred on Sunday, the Office and Mass were to be those of the \"Feast of the Holy Family\" without any commemoration of the Baptism of Our Lord.\n\nThe days from the Ascension of Our Lord to the Vigil of Pentecost exclusive became feriae of Eastertide (in the Simple rite); the Mass was to be that of the Feast of the Ascension, but without the Credo and the special Communicantes (even on the Friday before Pentecost, where hitherto the Mass of the Sunday had to be taken). The days of the suppressed Octaves of Corpus Christi and the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus became feriae per annum.\n\nSaints' feasts previously celebrated in the Semi-Double rite were to be treated as Simple feasts, and those previously celebrated in the Simple rite were reduced to a commemoration. If any feast not of the first or second class occurred on the ferias of Lent and Passiontide, from Ash Wednesday to the Saturday before Palm Sunday, the Office (if recited privately) and the Mass could be either of the feria or of the feast.\n\nBy a separate decree of the same year 1955, Pope Pius XII instituted the feast of \"Saint Joseph the Worker\" on 1 May (moving the feast of \"Saints Philip and James Apostles\" from 1 May, where it had been since the sixth century, to 11 May, and suppressing the \"Solemnity of Saint Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" that, since Pope Pius IX's decree of 10 September 1847, had been celebrated on the second Wednesday after the Octave of Easter).\n\n\n"}

It describes the relationship between Krishna and the \"gopis\" (female cow herders) of Vrindavana, and in particular one gopi named Radha.\n\nThe \"Gita Govinda\" is organized into twelve chapters. Each chapter is further sub-divided into twenty-four divisions called \"Prabandha\"s. The prabandhas contain couplets grouped into eights, called \"Ashtapadis\". It is mentioned that Radha is greater than Krishna. The text also elaborates the eight moods of Heroine, the \"Ashta Nayika\", which has been an inspiration for many compositions and choreographic works in Indian classical dances.\n\nThe work delineates the love of Krishna for Radha, the milkmaid, his faithlessness and subsequent return to her, and is taken as symbolical of the human soul's straying from its true allegiance but returning at length to the God which created it.\n\n\nThe poem has been translated into most modern Indian languages and many European languages There is a German rendering which Goethe read by F.

{"id": "8783541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8783541", "title": "Historicity of Muhammad", "text": "Historicity of Muhammad\n\nWhile the existence of the figure Muhammad is established by contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous historical records, attempts to distinguish between the historical elements and the unhistorical elements of many of the reports of Muhammad have not been very successful. Hence the historicity of Muhammad, aside from his existence, is debated. The earliest Muslim source of information for the life of Muhammad, the Quran, gives very little personal information and its historicity has been questioned. Next in importance is the sīra literature and hadith, which survive in the historical works of writers from the third, and fourth centuries of the Muslim era (c. 800−1000 AD). There are also a relatively small number of contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous non-Muslim sources, which confirm the existence of Muhammad and are valuable both in themselves and for comparison with Muslim sources.\n\nThe main Islamic source on Muhammad's life are Muslim sources written in Arabic, which include the Quran and accounts of Muhammad's life written down by later Muslims, based on oral traditions. These sources are known as sīra and hadith.\n\nAccording to traditional Islamic scholarship, all of the Quran was written down by Muhammad's companions while he was alive (during AD 610–632), but it was primarily an orally related document. The written compilation of the whole Quran in its definite form as we have it now was not completed until many years after the death of Muhammad.\n\nModern scholars differ in their assessment of the Quran as a historical source about Muhammad's life.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", the \"Qur'an responds constantly and often candidly to Muhammad's changing historical circumstances and contains a wealth of hidden data that are relevant to the task of the quest for the historical Muhammad.\" In contrast, Solomon A. Nigosian writes that the Quran tells us very little about the life of Muhammad.\n\nF.E. Peters states, \"Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words... To sum this up: the Quran is convincingly the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation\". Peters argues that \"The search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman’s alleged recension in the 640s (what can be called the 'sources' behind our text) has not yielded any differences of great significance.\"\n\nPatricia Crone and Michael Cook challenge the traditional account of how the Quran was compiled writing that \"there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century.\" They also question the accuracy of some of the Quran's historical accounts. It was generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but their alternative account of early Islam had been almost universally rejected. Van Ess dismissed it stating that \"a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous.\" R. B. Serjeant stated: \"Hagarism [the thesis of Crone and Cook] ... is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'.\" In 2006 Fred Donner, a supporter of the revisionist school of Islamic studies wrote that \"Yet now more than 30 years later we can see that the publication of Hagarism was a milestone in the study of Islamic studies.\"\n\nGerd R. Puin's initial study of ancient Quran manuscripts found in Yemen led him to conclude that the Quran is a \"cocktail of texts\", some of which may have been existent a hundred years before Muhammad. He later stated that \"these Yemeni Qur'anic fragments do not differ from those found in museums and libraries elsewhere, with the exception of details that do not touch the Qur'an itself, but are rather differences in the way words are spelled.\" Puin has stated that he believes the Quran was an evolving text rather than simply the Word of God as revealed in its entirety to Muhammad in the seventh century A.D Karl-Heinz Ohlig comes to the conclusion that the person of Muhammed was not central to early Islam at all, and that at this very early stage Islam was in fact an Arabic Christian sect which had objections to the concept of the trinity, and that the later hadith and biographies are in large part legends, instrumental in severing Islam from its Christian roots and building a full-blown new religion. John Wansbrough believes that the Qu’ran is a redaction in part of other sacred scriptures, in particular the Judaeo-Christian scriptures. Herbert Berg writes that \"Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as \"conjectural,\" and \"tentative and emphatically provisional\", his work is condemned by some. Some of the negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many. Many praise his insights and methods, if not all of his conclusions.\"\n\nThere is considerable academic debate over the real chronology of the chapters of the Quran. Carole Hillenbrand holds that there are several remaining tasks for the Orientalist Quranic scholars: Few Quranic scholars have worked on the epigraphy of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem whose foundation inscription dates to 72/692 and the antique Quran recently discovered in the Yemen, the Sana'a manuscripts. The Carbon-14 tests applied to this Quran date its parchment to 645–690 AD with 95 percent accuracy. Their real age may be a good deal younger, since C-14 estimates the time of growth of an organism, and the process from that to the final writing on the parchment involves an unknown amount of time, and parchments were also re-used often. Paleography has dated the San'a manuscripts to 690–750 AD.\n\nThe parchment of the Birmingham Quran manuscript received radiocarbon analysis in 2015, which revealed with a 95.4% accuracy that it was made from an animal alive sometime between 568 and 645 AD, roughly around the lifetime of Muhammad. The text differs only slightly to modern versions of the Quran. Only the parchment has been analysed, the date of the ink is unknown.\n\nThe hadith collections include traditional, hagiographic accounts of the verbal and physical traditions of Muhammad.\n\nEarly Muslim scholars were concerned that some hadiths (and sīra reports) may have been fabricated, and thus they developed a science of hadith criticism (see Hadith studies) to distinguish between genuine sayings and those that were forged, recorded using different words, or were wrongly ascribed to Muhammad.\n\nIn general, the majority of western academics view the hadith collections with caution. Bernard Lewis states that \"The collection and recording of Hadith did not take place until several generations after the death of the Prophet. During that period the opportunities and motives for falsification were almost unlimited.\"\n\nThe main feature of hadith is that of Isnad (chains of transmission), which are the basis of determining authenticity of the reports in traditional Islamic scholarship. According to Stephen Humphreys, while a number of \"very capable\" modern scholars defended the general authenticity of \"isnads\", most modern scholars regard \"isnads\" with \"deep suspicion\".\n\nJonathan A. C. Brown asserts the hadith tradition is a \"common sense science\" or a \"common sense tradition\" and is \"one of the biggest accomplishments in human intellectual history ... in its breadth, in its depth, in its complexity and in its internal consistency.\"\n\nIn the sīra literature, the most important extant biography are the two recensions of Ibn Ishaq's (d. 768), now known as \"Sīrat Rasūl Allah\" (\"Biography/Life of the Messenger/Apostle of Allah\"), which survive in the works of his editors, most notably Ibn Hisham (d. 834) and Yunus b. Bukayr (d.814–815), although not in its original form. According to Ibn Hisham, Ibn Ishaq wrote his biography some 120 to 130 years after Muhammad's death. Many, but not all, scholars accept the accuracy of these biographies, though their accuracy is unascertainable. After Ibn Ishaq, there are a number of shorter accounts (some of which are earlier than Ibn Ishaq) recorded in different forms (see List of earliest writers of sīra). Other biographies of Muhammad include al-Waqidi's (d. 822) and then Ibn Sa'd's (d.844–45). Al-Waqidi is often criticized by early Muslim historians who state that the author is unreliable. These biographies are hardly biographies in the modern sense. The writers did not wish to record the life of Muhammad, but rather to describe Muhammad's military expeditions and to preserve stories about Muhammad, his sayings and the reasons of revelations and interpretations of verses in the Quran. In addition to sīra, the biographical dictionaries of Ali ibn al-Athir and Ibn Hajar provide much detail about the contemporaries of Muhammad but add little to our information about Muhammad himself.\n\nAccording to Wim Raven, it is often noted that a coherent image of Muhammad cannot be formed from the literature of sīra, whose authenticity and factual value have been questioned on a number of different grounds. He lists the following arguments against the authenticity of sīra, followed here by counter arguments:\n\n\nNevertheless, other content of sīra, like the Constitution of Medina, are generally considered to be authentic by both Muslim and non-Muslim historians.\n\nEarly Islamic history is also reflected in sources written in Greek, Syriac, Armenian, and Hebrew by Jewish and Christian communities, all of which are dated after 633 CE. These sources contain some essential differences with regard to Muslim sources, in particular regarding the chronology and Muhammad's attitude towards the Jews and Palestine.\n\nThere is a reference recording the Arab conquest of Syria (known as Fragment on the Arab Conquests), that mentions Muhammed. This much faded note is preserved on folio 1 of BL Add. 14,461, a codex containing the Gospel according to Matthew and the Gospel according to Mark. This note appears to have been penned soon after the battle of Gabitha (636 CE) at which the Arabs inflicted crushing defeat of the Byzantines. Wright was first to draw the attention to the fragment and suggested that \"it seems to be a nearly contemporary notice\", a view which was also endorsed by Nöldeke. The purpose of jotting this note in the book of Gospels appears to be commemorative as the author appears to have realized how momentous the events of his time were. The words \"we saw\" are positive evidence that the author was a contemporary. The author also talks about olive oil, cattle, ruined villages, suggesting that he belonged to peasant stock, i.e., parish priest or a monk who could read and write. It is worthwhile cautioning that the condition of the text is fragmentary and many of the readings unclear or disputable. The lacunae are supplied in square brackets:\n\nThe 8th century BL Add. 14,643 was published by Wright who first brought to attention the mention of an early date of 947 AG (635–36 CE). The contents of this manuscript has puzzled many scholars for their apparent lack of coherence as it contains an assembly of texts with diverse nature. In relation to Arabs of Mohamed, there are two important dates mentioned in this manuscript.\n\nIt is the first date above which is of great importance as it provides the first explicit reference to Muhammad in a non-Muslim source. The account is usually identified with the battle of Dathin. According to Hoyland, \"its precise dating inspires confidence that it ultimately derives from first-hand knowledge\".\n\nAnother account of the early seventh century comes from Sebeos who was an Armenian bishop of the House of Bagratuni. From this chronicle, there are indications that he lived through many of the events he relates. He maintains that the account of Arab conquests derives from the fugitives who had been eyewitnesses thereof. He concludes with Mu‘awiya's ascendancy in the Arab civil war (656–661 CE), which suggests that he was writing soon after this date. Sebeos is the first non-Muslim author to present us with a theory for the rise of Islam that pays attention to what the Muslims themselves thought they were doing. Concerning Muhammad, he says:\n\nSebeos was writing the chronicle at a time when memories of sudden eruption of the Arabs was fresh. He knows Muhammad's name and that he was a merchant by profession. He hints that his life was suddenly changed by a divinely inspired revelation.\n\nAs early as 1930, the question for the existence of Muhammad was raised by Soviet orientalist Klimovich, yet his thesis found no resonance in Islamic Studies. The question for the historicity of Muhammad was put on the agenda, when in the 1970s the so-called Revisionist School of Islamic Studies raised fundamental doubts about the reliability of traditional Islamic sources and applied the historical-critical methods to the early Islamic period. After the first provocative theses, the revisionist approach differentiated and moderated and spread in Islamic Studies with various intensity. Today, only a minority of historians of early Islam doubt the historicity of Muhammad.\n\nAttempts to distinguish between the historical elements and the unhistorical elements of many of the reports of Muhammad have not been very successful. A major source of difficulty in the quest for the historical Muhammad is the modern lack of knowledge about pre-Islamic Arabia. According to Harald Motzki, \"On the one hand, it is not possible to write a historical biography of the Prophet without being accused of using the sources uncritically, while on the other hand, when using the sources critically, it is simply not possible to write such a biography.\"\n\nHistorian Michael Cook takes the view that evidence independent of Islamic tradition \"precludes any doubts as to whether Muhammad was a real person\" and clearly shows that he became the central figure of a new religion in the decades following his death. He reports, though, that this evidence conflicts with the Islamic view in some aspects, associating Muhammad with Israel rather than Inner Arabia, complicating the question of his sole authorship or transmission of the Quran, and suggesting that there were Jews as well as Arabs among his followers. For Patricia Crone, a single Greek text written at around the time of Muhammad's death provides \"irrefutable proof\" that he was a historical figure. There is also, she says, \"exceptionally good\" evidence that Muhammad was an Arab political leader and prophet. She says we can be \"reasonably sure\" in attributing all or most of the Quran to him. She takes a view that Muhammad's traditional association with the Arabian Peninsula may be \"doctrinally inspired\", and is put in doubt by the Quran itself, which describes agricultural activity that could not have taken place there, as well as making a reference to the site of Sodom which appears to place Muhammad's community close to the Dead Sea.\n\nIn their 2003 book \"Crossroads to Islam\", Yehuda D. Nevo and Judith Koren advanced a thesis, based on an extensive examination of archaeological evidence from the early Islamic period, that Muhammad may never have existed, with monotheistic Islam only coming into existence some time after he is supposed to have lived. This has been described as \"plausible or at least arguable\" and employing a \"very rigorous historical methodology\" by David Cook of Rice University, but has also been compared to Holocaust denial by historian Colin Wells, who suggests that the authors deal with some of the evidence illogically.\n\nMuhammad Sven Kalisch, a Muslim convert and Germany's first professor of Islamic theology, has expressed the view that the Prophet Muhammad probably never existed. Similar views were also held by other scholars too as Professor Muhammad Sven Kalisch quotes in his conclusions. Another example is the case of Hans Jansen, a Dutch scholar, who too has the opinion that the evidences supporting the historicity of Muhammad are lacking.\n\nVolker Popp (2004/5) proposed that both \"Muḥammad\" and \"‘Alī\" originated as titles given to Jesus Christ by Syriac Christians in the Sassanid Empire (i.e. \"muḥammad\" \"blessed\" being the equivalent of the \"benedictus\" (ευλογηµένος) of the New Testament). In a numismatic study, Popp identified coins dated to AH 16 inscribed with \"mḥmd\" but lacking the \"rasūl allāh\" that later became common. Popp adduced Arabo-Sassanid and Syrian coins inscribed with \"MHMT\" in Pahlavi script, and also partly with \"mḥmd\" in Arabic script, in some cases combined with Christian symbolism.\nHeger (2008) argues that \"Muḥammad\" \"the blessed one\" being a title of Christ does not necessarily preclude the historicity of the prophet of Islam. It rather opens up a scale of possibilities summarised in three alternatives to the default assumption of the historicity of a Muhammad recognizably similar to the hadith accounts, \n\n\n"}

{"id": "38480380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38480380", "title": "Jain schools and branches", "text": "Jain schools and branches\n\nJainism is an Indian religion which is traditionally believed to be propagated by twenty-four spiritual teachers known as \"tirthankara\". Broadly, Jainism is divided into two major sects, Digambara and Svetambara. These are further divided into different sub-sects and traditions. While there are differences in practices, the core philosophy and main principles of each sect is same.\n\nTraditionally, the original doctrine of Jainism was contained in scriptures called Purva. There were fourteen Purva. These are believed to have originated from Rishabhanatha, the first \"tirthankara\". There was a twelve-year famine around fourth century BCE. At that time, Chandragupta Maurya was the ruler of Magadha and Bhadrabahu was the head of Jain community. Bhadrabahu went south to Karnataka with his adherents and Sthulabhadra, another Jain leader remained behind. During this time the knowledge of the doctrine was getting lost. A council was formed at Pataliputra where eleven scriptures called Angas were compiled and the remnant of fourteen purvas were written down in 12th Anga, Ditthivaya by the adherents of Sthulbhadra. When followers of Bhadrabahu returned, there was a dispute between them regarding the authenticity of the Angas. Also, those who stayed at Magadha started wearing white clothes which was unacceptable to the other who remain naked. This is how the Digambara and Svetambara sect came about. The \"Digambara\" being the naked ones where as \"Svetambara\" being the white clothed. According to Digambara, the purvas and the angas were lost. In course of time, the cannons of Svetambara were also getting lost. About 980 to 993 years after the Nirvana of Mahavira, a Vallabhi council was held at Vallabhi (now in Gujarat). This was headed by Devardhi Ksamashramana. It was found that the 12th Anga, the Ditthivaya, was lost too. The other Angas were written down. This is a traditional account of schism. According to Svetambara, there were eight schisms (\"Nihvana\").\n\nAccording to Digambara tradition, Ganadhara knew fourteen Purva and eleven Anga. Knowledge of Purva was lost around 436 years after Mahavira and Anga were lost around 683 years after Mahavira. The texts which do not belong to Anga are called Angabahyas. There were fourteen Angabahyas. The first four Angabahyas, \"Samayika\", \"Chaturvimasvika\", \"Vandana\" and \"Pratikramana\" corresponds to sections of second \"Mulasutra\" of Svetambara. The only texts of angabahyas which occurs in Svetambara texts are \"Dasavaikalika\", \"Uttaradhyayana\" and \"Kalpavyavahara\".\n\nDigambara is one of the two main sects of Jainism. This sect of Jainism rejects the authority of the \"Jain Agama\" compiled by Sthulabhadra. They believe that by the time of Dharasena, the twenty-third teacher after Gandhar Gautama, knowledge of only one Anga was there. This was about 683 years after the death of Mahavira. After Dharasena's pupils Acharya Puspadanta and Bhutabali. They wrote down the \"Shatkhandagama\", one of the oldest scriptures of the digambara sect of Jainism. The other most revered and oldest scripture is the \"Kasay-pahuda\". According to Digambara tradition, Mahavira, the last \"jaina tirthankara\", never married. He renounced the world at the age of thirty after taking permission of his parents. The Digambara believe that after attaining enlightenment, Mahavira was free from human activities like hunger, thirst, and sleep. Digambara monks tradition do not wear any clothes. They carry only a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers and a water gourd. One of the most important scholar-monks of Digambara tradition was Acharya Kundakunda. He authored Prakrit texts such as Samayasara and Pravachansara. Samantabhadra and Siddhasena Divakara were other important monks of this tradition. The Digambara are present mainly in Southern India, Bundelkhand region (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, etc. Digambar tradition is divided into two main orders Mula Sangh and the Kashtha Sangh. Among the prominent Digambara Acharyas today are Acharya Vidyasagar, Acharya Vardhman sagar, Acharya Vidyananda. \n\nMula Sangh is an ancient monastic order. Mula literally means \"root\" or \"original\". The great Acharya Kundakunda is associated with Mula Sangh. The oldest known mention of Mula Sangh is from 430 CE.\nMula Sangh was divided into a few branches. According to \"Shrutavatara\" and \"Nitisar\" of Bhattaraka Indranandi, Acharya Arhadbali had organised a council of Jain monks, and had given names (gana or sangha) to different groups. The four major groups were \"Nandi Gana\", \"Sena Gana\", \"Deva Gana\" and \"Simha Gana\". The Bhattarakas of Shravanabelagola, Mudabidri and Humbaj belongs to the \"Nandi Gana\".\n\nKashtha Sangha was a monastic order once dominant in several regions of North and Western India. It is said to have originated from a town named Kashtha. The origin of Kashtha Sangha is often attributed to Lohacharya in several texts and inscriptions from Delhi region. The Kashtasangh Gurvavali identifies Lohacharya as the last person who knew Acharanga in the Digambara tradition, who lived until around 683-year after the \"nirvana\" of Lord Mahavira. Several Digambara orders in North India belonged to Kashtha Sangha. The Agrawal Jains were the major supporters of Kashtha Sangha. They were initiated by Lohacharya. Kashta Sangha has several orders including \"Nanditat gachchha\", \"Mathura Sangha\", \"Bagada gachha\" and \"Lata-bagada gachha\". The celebrated poet and pratishthacharya Raighu was a disciple of the Kashtha Sangh Bhattarakas of Gwalior. The rock carved Jain statues in the Gwalior Fort were mostly consecrated by the Kashtha Sangh Bhattarakas.\n\nThe Digambar Terapanth subsect was formed by Amra Bhaunsa Godika and his son Jodhraj Godika during 1664–1667 in opposition to the bhattakaras. The Bhattakara are the priestly class of Jainism who are responsible for maintaining libraries and other Jain institutions. The \"Terapanth\" sub-sect among the Digambara Jains emerged around the Jaipur (Sanganer, Amber and Jaipur region itself). Godika duo expressed opposition to the Bhattaraka Narendrakirti of Amber. Authors Daulatram Kasliwal and Pandit Todarmal) were associated with the Terapanth movement. They opposed worship of various minor gods and goddesses. Some Terapanthi practices, like not using flowers in worship, gradually spread throughout North India among the Digambaras. Bakhtaram in his \"Mithyatva Khandan Natak\" (1764) mentions that group that started it included thirteen individuals, who collectively built a new temple, thus giving it its name Tera-Panth (Thirteen Path). However according to \"Kavitta Terapanth kau\" by a Chanda Kavi, the movement was named Tera Panth, because the founders disagreed with the Bhattaraka on thirteen points. A letter of 1692 from Tera Panthis at Kama to those at Sanganer mentions thirteen rituals that were rejected. These are mentioned in Buddhivilas (1770) of Bakhtaram. These are– authority of Bhattarakas, Use of flowers, cooked food or lamps, Abhisheka (panchamrita), consecretation of images without supervision by the representatives of Bhattarakas, Puja while seated, Puja at night, Using drums in the temple and Worship of minor gods like dikpalas, shasan devis (Padmavati etc.) and Kshetrapal. The Digambara Jains who have continued to follow these practices are termed Bispanthi.\n\nThe Taranapanth was founded by Taran Svami in Bundelkhand in 1505. They do not believe in idol worshiping. Instead, the taranapantha community prays to the scriptures written by Taran Swami.\nTaran Svami is also referred to as Taran Taran, the one who can help the swimmers to the other side, i.e. towards nirvana. A mystical account of his life, perhaps an autobiography, is given in Chadmastha Vani. The language in his fourteen books is a unique blend of Prakrit, Sanskrit and Apabhramsha. His language was perhaps influenced by his reading of the books of Acharya Kundakunda. Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been written recently. Osho, who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included Shunya Svabhava and Siddhi Svabhava as among the books that influenced him most. The number of Taranpanthis is very small. Their shrines are called Chaityalaya (or sometimes Nisai/Nasia). At the altar (vimana) they have a book instead of an idol. The Taranpanthis were originally from six communities.\n\nThe Śvētāmbara (white-clad) is one of the two main sects of Jainism. Śvētāmbara is a term describing its ascetics' practice of wearing white clothes, which sets it apart from the \"Digambara\" whose ascetic practitioners go naked. Śvētāmbaras, unlike Digambaras, do not believe that ascetics must practice nudity. Svetambara monks usually wear white maintaining that nudism is no longer practical. Śvētāmbaras also believe that women are able to obtain moksha. Śvētāmbaras maintain that the 19th Tirthankara, Mallinath, was a woman. Some Śvētāmbara monks and nuns cover their mouth with a white cloth or muhapatti to practise ahimsa even when they talk. By doing so they minimise the possibility of inhaling small organisms. The Śvētāmbara tradition follows the lineage of Acharya Sthulibhadra Suri. The Kalpa Sūtra mentions some of the lineages in ancient times.\n\nA major dispute was initiated by Lonka Shaha, who started a movement opposed to idol worship in 1476. Sthānakavāsī is a sect of Jainism founded by a merchant named Lavaji about 1653 CE that do not pray to any statue. The sect is essentially a reformation of the one founded on teachings of Lonka. Sthānakavāsīs reject all but thirty-two of the Śvētāmbara canon.\n\nŚvētāmbarins who are not Sthānakavāsins are called Murtipujaka (\"Idol-worshipers\"). Murtipujaka differ from Sthanakvasi Svetambaras in that their derasars contain idols of the Tirthankaras instead of empty rooms. They worship idols and have rituals for it. Murtipujaka monastics and worshippers do not use the muhapatti, a piece of cloth over the mouth, during prayers, whereas it is permanently worn by Sthanakvasi. The most prominent among the classical orders called Gacchas today are the Kharatara, Tapa and the Tristutik. Major reforms by Vijayanandsuri of the Tapa Gaccha in 1880 led a movement to restore orders of wandering monks, which brought about the near-extinction of the Yati institutions. Acharya Rajendrasuri restored the shramana organisation in the Tristutik Order.\n\nThe monks of Murtipujaka sect are divided into six orders or \"Gaccha\". These are:\n\nKharatara Gaccha is one of Shvetambara gacchas. It is also called Vidhisangha (the Assembly) as they follow sacred texts literally. It was founded by Vardhamana Suri (1031). His teacher was a temple-dwelling monk. He rejected him because of not following texts.\nHis pupil, Jineshvara, got honorary title 'Kharatara' (Sharp witted or Fierce) because he defeated Suracharya, leader of Chaityavasis in public debate in 1023 at Anahilvada Patan. So the Gaccha got his title. Another tradition regards Jinadatta Suri (1075–1154) as a founder of Gaccha. Kharatara ascetics follow the sacred texts to the word. They follow basic Shvetambara canon and works of other Kharatara teachers.\n\nTristutik Gaccha was a Murtipujaka Svetambara Jain religious grouping preceding the founding of the Tapa Gaccha by Acharya Rajendrasuri. It was established in 1194. It was known as Agama Gaccha in ancient times. The Tristutik believed in devotion to the Tirthankaras alone in most rituals, although offerings to helper divinities were made during large ceremonies. The Tristutik Gaccha was reformed by Acharya Rajendrasuri.\n\nTapa Gaccha is the largest monastic order of Svetambara Jainism. It was founded by Acharya Jagat Chandrasuri in 1229. He was given the title of \"Tapa\" (i.e. the meditative one) by the ruler of Mewar. Vijayananda Suri was responsible for reviving the wandering orders among the Svetambara monks. As a result of this reform, most Svetambara Jain monks today belong to the Tapa Gaccha.\n\nTerapanth is another reformist religious sect under Svetambara Jainism. It was founded by Acharya Bhikshu, also known as Swami Bhikanji Maharaj. Swami Bhikanji was formerly a Sthanakvasi saint and had initiation by Acharya Raghunatha. But he had differences with his Guru on several aspects of religious practices of Sthanakvasi ascetics. Hence he left the Sthanakvasi sect with the motto of correcting practise of Jain monks, eventually on 28 June 1760 at Kelwa, a small town in Udaipur district of Rajasthan state, Terapanth was founded by him. This sect is also non-idolatrous. As Acharya Bhikanaji laid stress on the thirteen religious principles, namely, five Mahavratas (great vows), five samitis (regulations) and three Guptis (controls or restraints), his sub-sect was known as the Tera-pantha (\"path of thirteen\"). In this connection, two other interpretations have been given for the use of the term Terapantha for the sub-sect. According to one account, it is mentioned that as there were only thirteen monks and thirteen laymen in the pantha when it was founded. Other account says, \"Tera\" derived from \"Tera\" which literally means \"yours\". Terapanth is organised under the direction of one Acharya. Terapanth had a succession of only eleven Acharyas from the founder Acharya Bhikanaji as the First Acharya to the present. Further, the Terapanth regularly observes a festival known as \"Maryada Mahotasava\". This distinctive festival is celebrated every year on the seventh day of the bright half of the month of Magha. At present Mahasharman is the eleventh Acharya of Terapanth.\n\nRaj Bhakta Marg or Kavi Panth or Shrimadia are founded on teachings of Shrimad Rajchandra by his followers after his death in 1901 while former Sthanakavasi monk Kanji Swami established Kanji Panth in 1934. Akram Vignan Movement established by Dada Bhagwan draws inspiration from teachings of Rajchandra and other Jain scriptures though it is considered as a Jain-Vaishnava Hindu syncretistic movement.\n\nYapaniya was a Jain order in western Karnataka which is now extinct. The first inscription that mentions them by Mrigesavarman (AD 475–490) a Kadamba king of Palasika who donated for a Jain temple, and made a grant to the sects of Yapaniyas, Nirgranthas (identifiable as Digambaras), and the Kurchakas (not identified). The last inscription which mentioned the Yapaniyas was found in the Tuluva region southwest Karnataka, dated Saka 1316 (1394 CE). According to Darshana-Sara, they were a branch of the Svetambara sect, however they were regarded to be Digambara by Swetambar authors. The Yapaniya monks remained naked but followed some Svetamabar views. They also possessed their own versions of texts that have been preserved in the Svetambar tradition. The great grammarian Shakatayana, who was a contemporary of the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha (c. 817–877), was a Yapaniya, as mentioned by Malayagira in his commentary on the \"NandiSutra\".\n\n"}

Details about his birth, as well as information regarding his whereabouts following his enigmatic disappearance remain apocryphal.\n\nDylkes achieved notoriety in August 1828, at a camp meeting near a chapel known as the Leatherwood Church in Salesville, Ohio. On a Sunday afternoon, the United Brethren minister John Crum was preaching to a large congregation when a voice shouted \"Salvation\" followed by a strange sound, taken by all who heard it to be the snort of a horse.\n\nEveryone was taken by surprise and turned to see a stranger dressed in a black broadcloth suit, frock coat, white cravat, and yellow beaver hat.

He attended various religious meetings, and sometimes preached.

A mob bent on discrediting him came to a religious service in the home of a Dylkes follower and tore out a considerable lock of his hair to demonstrate his mortality.\n\nDylkes was taken before the local Squire to be charged but was released on the grounds that it \"was not a crime to be a god.\" Dylkes took refuge in a farm belonging to one of his followers and ultimately declared he was going to Philadelphia to establish a \"New Jerusalem.\" During the trip he disappeared without a trace.\n\nA few of his believers, such as Michael Brill and Robert McCormick, died believing in Dylkes.\n\n"}

Religious and nationalist, it is affiliated with the conservative right-wing Israeli parties. \nThe paper was originally led by secular writers but over the years it became more religious. Makor Rishon is associated with the Settlers positions and is considered to have a qualitative impact on senior Likud and Jewish Home.\n\n\"Makor Rishon\" was founded as a weekly magazine in July 1997 in order to create an independent newspaper with a Jewish religious and nationalistic slant. The paper was the brainchild of its original owner, Rabbi Shmuel Tal. The Listenberg family, a National Religious family in the diamond business based in Belgium and Tel Aviv financed the founding of the newspaper. Journalist Meir Uziel was hired to recruit the staff. Uziel enlisted Michael Ruzulio to find writers. Ruzulio had served as a reporter for \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" as well as for the Second Authority for Television and Radio, and helped create the “Voice of the Red Sea” radio station. The newsroom was established in the “Pirsum Yisrael” offices located in Givat Shaul in Jerusalem and included religious and secular journalists and editors.\n\nThe majority of the newspaper’s editors in its early years were secular and included Meir Uziel, Michael Ruzulio, Yehuda Levi (journalist) and Ofer Shapira.\n\nEarnings from the paper were low and its financial situation worsened. The paper closed down at the end of October 1999, after which the owners filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\"Makor Rishon\" was reestablished after five weeks, in December 1999, under the auspices of a company named “The New Makor Rishon” – a move that enabled its purchaser, Dr. Michael Karash, to derive benefit from the newspaper’s name without having to be burdened by past debts. Karash worked to broaden the subscriber base and to make the paper financially viable. Over the course of 2003, the paper was purchased by businessman Shlomo Ben-Tzvi. After the buyout, changes were made that included a significant increase in the number of pages and journalists as well as a move to a broadsheet newspaper format.\n\nUntil mid-2007, \"Makor Rishon\" was published as a weekly. On April 25, 2007, the \"HaTzofe\" daily was incorporated into \"Makor Rishon\", which started appearing with the logo “Makor Rishon-HaTzofe”. Shlomo Ben-Tzvi, who until then had been the newspaper’s CEO, was appointed the editor-in-chief. \"Makor Rishon\" was then published as a daily for the next two years.\n\nIn November 2008, the newspaper entered into financial difficulties. The employees requested the court liquidate the assets of the paper. The newspaper dealt with the crises by drastically cutting content, raising prices, firing workers, and closing down its website and article archives, among other actions. Starting from June 2009, the paper returned to being a weekly. A reduced daily edition was distributed only to subscribers but was made available on the newspaper’s website, and a weekend edition was also attainable at newsstands.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the newspaper began distributing a free expanded edition at various locations throughout the country, that contained many references to the newspaper’s flagship edition that is sold on weekends, a move intended to increase sales and subscribers for the Friday edition.\n\nOn March 9, 2014, Ben-Tzvi’s request for a two-month injunction to halt bankruptcy proceedings against the \"Makor\" \"Rishon\" and \"Ma’ariv\" newspapers was approved by the court. On March 30, 2014, the Jerusalem District Court approved selling the newspaper to \"Israel Hayom\" for 14 million shekels. and Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo approved the sale one month later.\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the daily edition was printed for the last time. Starting from this date, only the weekend edition is published.\n\nIn the past, the newspaper had only included a main news section, a news journal and a weekly magazine, \"Diyukan\", that also included a cultural supplement. After Shlomo Ben-Tzvi purchased the newspaper in 2003, new supplements began appearing, which culminated with the switch to a new format in May 2005. The newspaper has undergone frequent changes since Ben-Tzvi purchased it. In its current format, the paper includes eight sections:\n\n\nFrom January 1, 2005, until February 2006, the weekly “\"Hashavuon\"”, a culture supplement that also contained a calendar for scheduled broadcasts and plays. Tamar Nesher-Rati was the editor-in-chief. The assistant editor was Shai Tzeler.\n\nAt the start of the newspaper’s switch to the new format, a vacation supplement was added, which became bi-weekly and was quickly cancelled.\n\nIn June of 2006, several months after the cancellation of “\"Hashavuon\"”, a bi-weekly section entitled “\"Shishi Yisraeli\"” was added, that was planned to become a weekly. It was a glossy supplement in a small format and contained articles on topics of current affairs. It was cancelled after around three months.\n\nThe \"Kalkala\" supplement edited by economist Eran Bar-Tal and the sports section edited by Dotan Malach were originally separate entities, but since August 3, 2012 have been incorporated into the \"Motzash\" magazine.\n\nFor a while, the newspaper published \"Shabbat Hagadol\" – an expanded Jewish philosophy supplement that appeared three times a year and was edited by Yoav Shurek. The paper also published \"Makori\" – a Shabbat pamphlet that was distributed free of charge in synagogues and contained condensed articles from the \"Makor Rishon\" newspaper and from other sections, but was canceled towards the end of 2010.\n\nThe newspaper’s \"Shabbat\" supplement deals with the topics of Jewish philosophy, literature and Torah thought and has been in print since 2004. Yoav Shurek was the editor from its inception until 2012. The current editor is Rabbi Elchanan Nir, with Dr. Shmuel Faust for book reviews.\n\nThe \"Shabbat\" supplement combines Jewish content with articles on literature and the arts, in a format similar to \"Haaretz\"’s “\"Culture and Literature\"” supplement. \"Shabbat\" deals with more extensive subject matter and is far longer than a regular literary supplement. It has 24 pages which has been the case for nearly all the years it has been in existence. The supplement is highly regarded and is considered a respectable platform where authors, poets, translators, researchers and Torah scholars can publish regularly. It also serves as a forum to publish short stories and poetry. The supplement’s format has only undergone minor changes since its inception. The front page features a work of art (a drawing or a photograph) together with a quotation.\n\nThe supplement is published in a similar format as \"Maariv’s\" culture supplement, entitled “\"Erev\" \"Shabbat”\", which contains exclusive material including weekly columns by Dov Elboim and Yair Sheleg.\n\nThe sections in the supplement are: a regular column on the weekly Torah portion whose author changes from Chumash to Chumash; “Arachim from a Jewish Lexicon” by Professor Shalom Rosenberg; a poetry review by Yonatan Berg, a music review by Amichai Chason; Chayuta Deutsch’s column “Lipnai U’lifnim”; “B’safa Acheret” – a monthly overview of periodicals from around the world by Zeev Shpeidel; “Yashan Mipnei Chadash”, a book column by Edmiel Cosman; and a section dealing with rabbinic leaders in Jewish communities around the world written by Rabbi Eliyahu Birenbaum.\n\nThe newspaper claims several exclusives to its credit, such as exposing the non-profit organizations affair in which Ehud Barak was involved during the 1999 general Israeli elections, and election fraud accusations made during the Labor party primaries that year that led to MK Ediso Masalah’s defeat.\n\n"}
{"id": "419842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419842", "title": "Moral character", "text": "Moral character\n\nMoral character or character is an evaluation of an individual's stable moral qualities. The concept of \"character\" can imply a variety of attributes including the existence or lack of virtues such as empathy, courage, fortitude, honesty, and loyalty, or of good behaviors or habits. Moral character primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another—although on a cultural level, the set of moral behaviors to which a social group adheres can be said to unite and define it culturally as distinct from others. Psychologist Lawrence Pervin defines moral character as \"a disposition to express behavior in consistent patterns of functions across a range of situations\". Similarly, the philosopher George refers to moral character as the “sum of one’s moral habits and dispositions.”\n\nThe word \"character\" is derived from the Ancient Greek word \"charaktêr\", referring to a mark impressed upon a coin. Later it came to mean a point by which one thing was told apart from others. There are two approaches when dealing with moral character: Normative ethics involve moral standards that exhibit right and wrong conduct. It is a test of proper behavior and determining what is right and wrong. Applied ethics involve specific and controversial issues along with a moral choice, and tend to involve situations where people are either for or against the issue.\n\nIn 1982 V. Campbell and R. Bond proposed the following as major sources in influencing character and moral development: heredity, early childhood experience, modeling by important adults and older youth, peer influence, the general physical and social environment, the communications media, the teachings of schools and other institutions, and specific situations and roles that elicit corresponding behavior.\n\nThe field of business ethics examines moral controversies relating to the social responsibilities of capitalist business practices, the moral status of corporate entities, deceptive advertising, insider trading, employee rights, job discrimination, affirmative action and drug testing.\n\nIn the military field, character is considered particularly relevant in the leadership development area. Military leaders should not only \"know\" theoretically the moral values but they must embody these values.\n\nThe \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" provides a historical account of some important developments in philosophical approaches to moral character. A lot of attention is given to Plato, Aristotle, and Karl Marx's views, since they all follow the idea of moral character after the Greeks. Marx accepts Aristotle's insight that virtue and good character are based on a sense of self-esteem and self-confidence.\n\nPlato believed that the soul is divided into three parts of desire: Rational, Appetitive, or Spirited. In order to have moral character, we must understand what contributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive desires educated properly, so that they can agree with the guidance provided by the rational part of the soul.\n\nAristotle tells us that there are good people in the world. These are those who exhibit excellences – excellences of thought and excellences of character. His phrase for excellences of character – \"êthikai aretai\" – we usually translate as moral virtue or moral excellence. When we speak of a moral virtue or an excellence of character, the emphasis is on the combination of qualities that make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person that he is. Aristotle defines virtuous character at the beginning of Book II in \"Nicomachean Ethics\": “Excellence of character, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on excess and that which depends on defect”. In Aristotle's view, good character is based on two naturally occurring psychological responses that most people experience without difficulty: our tendency to take pleasure from self-realizing activity and our tendency to form friendly feelings toward others under specific circumstances. Based on his view, virtually everyone is capable of becoming better and they are the ones responsible for actions that express (or could express) their character.\n\nAbraham Lincoln once said, \"Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.\"\n\nChristian character is also defined as exhibiting the \"Fruit of the Holy Spirit\": love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Doctrines of grace and total depravity assert that – due to original sin – mankind, entirely or in part, was incapable of truly being good without God's intervention; otherwise at best, one could only mimic good behavior for selfish reasons.\n\nThe Milgram experiment was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different socio-economic groups were tested on their willingness to press a buzzer that caused a participant – posing as a subject – in another room to express great pain and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the experimenter applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals. In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.\n\nIn one experiment that was done in the United States in 1985, the moral character of a person was based on whether or not a person had found a dime in a public phone booth. The findings were that 87% of subjects who found a dime in a phone booth mailed a sealed and addressed envelope that was left at the booth in an apparent mistake by someone else, while only 4% of those who did not find a dime helped. Some found it very troubling that people would be influenced by such morally trivial factors in their choice whether to provide low-cost assistance to others. John M. Doris raises the issue of ecological validity – do experimental findings reflect phenomena found in natural contexts. He recognizes that these results are counterintuitive to the way most of us think about morally relevant behavior.\n\nAnother experiment that was done that asked college students at Cornell to predict how they would behave when faced with one of several moral dilemmas, and to make the same predictions for their peers. Again and again, people predicted that they would be more generous and kind than others. Yet when put into the moral dilemma, the subjects did not behave as generously or as kindly as they had predicted. In psychological terms, the experimental subjects were successfully anticipating the base rate of moral behavior and accurately predicting how often others, in general, would be self-sacrificing.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a number of philosophers and social scientists began to question the very presuppositions that theories of moral character and moral character traits are based on. Due to the importance of moral character to issues in philosophy, it is unlikely that the debates over the nature of moral character will disappear anytime soon.\n\nSituationism can be understood as composed of three central claims:\n\n\nAccording to Situationists, the empirical evidence favors their view of moral character over the Traditional View. Hugh Hartshorne and M. A. May’s study of the trait of honesty among school children found no cross-situational correlation. A child may be consistently honest with his friends, but not with his parents or teachers. From this and other studies, Hartshorne and May concluded that character traits are not robust but rather “specific functions of life situations”.\n\nA second challenge to the traditional view can be found in the idea of moral luck. This idea is that moral luck occurs when the moral judgment of an agent depends on factors beyond the agent’s control. Fiery Cushman clarifies that this is judgement of an outcome comprising both the agent's character and an unanticipated circumstance, rather than an agent's intent. There are number of ways that moral luck can motivate criticisms of moral character. It is similar to “the kind of problems and situations one faces” If all of an agent’s moral character traits are situation-specific rather than robust, what traits an agent manifests will depend on the situation that she finds herself in. But what situations an agent finds herself in is often beyond her control and thus a matter of situational luck. Whether moral character traits are robust or situation-specific, some have suggested that what character traits one has is itself a matter of luck. If our having certain traits is itself a matter of luck, this would seem to undermine one’s moral responsibility for one’s moral character, and thus the concept of moral character altogether. As Owen Flanagan and Amélie Oksenberg Rorty write:\nA moral character trait is a character trait for which the agent is morally responsible. If moral responsibility is impossible, however, then agents cannot be held responsible for their character traits or for the behaviors that they do as a result of those character traits.\n\nA similar argument has also recently been advocated by Bruce Waller. According to Waller, no one is \"morally responsible for her character or deliberative powers, or for the results that flow from them.… Given the fact that she was shaped to have such characteristics by environmental (or evolutionary) forces far beyond her control, she deserves no blame [nor praise]\".\n\n"}

{"id": "55250976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55250976", "title": "Nagarparkar Jain Temples", "text": "Nagarparkar Jain Temples\n\nThe Nagarparkar Jain Temples () are located in the region around Nagarparkar, in Pakistan's southern Sindh province. The site consists of a collection of abandoned Jain temples, as well as a mosque heavily influenced by the architectural style of the temples. Buildings in the region date from the 12th to the 15th centuries - a period when Jain architectural expression was at its zenith. Frescoes at the Gori Temple are the oldest Jain frescoes still in existence in the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. The temples were inscribed on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status in 2016 as the Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape.\n\nThe region around Nagarparkar forms a zone of transition between the marshes and salt-flats of the Rann of Kutch, and the dry grounds of stabilized sand dunes and nearby pink-granite Karoonjhar Mountains. The region had been mostly covered by the Arabian Sea until the 15th century, though the region around Nagarparkar formed an area of raised and perennially dry land.\n\nNagarparkar was a centre of Jainism for several centuries, and the wealthy local Jain community built several extravagant temples in the nearby hills between the 12th and 15th centuries - considered a high point of Jain architectural expression. The region became a place of pilgrimage known as \"Sardhara\", with Jain ascetics establishing themselves in the Karoonjhar Mountains. The Nagarparkar region was described in 1650 as the \"most glorious of all regions of India\". \n\nJain influence in the region began to decline due to shifting of the Arabian Sea away from centres of Jain economic activity, as silt from the Indus River deposited in the Rann of Kutch. Changes in the coast line resulted in a large-scale shift of the local Jain population in the 19th century, while remaining Jains left the area following the Partition of British India in 1947, though several of the temples continue to be maintained by the area's sizable Hindu community. Several new temples were built in nearby Rajasthan, which trace their heritage back to older sites in Nagarparkar. \n\nThe remains of a number of Jain temples are popular tourist attractions and heritage sites in the region. A lack of an adequate road system in the area contributed to the site's state of good preservation, though the recent construction of roadways has led to a surge of tourists, despite the lack of adequate protection at the site. In 2009, satellite imagery was employed to document the site, and to help devise a plan to manage tourism.\nThe region was submitted by the Pakistani government in 2016 to be inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site status, not only for its architectural value, but also as reflection of Jainism as part of a commercial community based on maritime trade, and the effects of a changing natural environment around the region.\n\nApproximately 14 Jain temples are scattered throughout the region.\n\nThe Gori Temple is located approximately 14 miles northwest of the Viravah Temple. The temple was built in 1375-1376 CE, in a Gujarati-style, and features 3 \"mandaps\", with 52 Islamic-style domes. The temple measures 125 feet by 60 feet, and is built of marble. The entire temple is built on a high platform that is reached by a series of steps carved into stone.\n\nThe interiors of the temple feature finely carved marble pillars. The canopy which offers entrance to the temple is decorated with paintings that represent Jain mythology. The frescoes at Gori temple are the oldest Jain frescoes in existence in the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n24 small cells are found throughout the temple, which may have been used to house representations of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism.\n\nFor several centuries, the temple at Goripur was a celebrated Jain tirtha. The temple is notable amongst local Hindus as well for its image of Parasnath. \n\nAn account of its building is contained in \"Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\" by Pritivimala, composed in Samvat 1650 and \"Shri Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\" written by Nemavijaya in Samvat 1807. According to Muni Darshanvijaya, it was installed by Seth Godidas of Jhinjhuvad and was consecrated by Acharya Hemachandra at Patan in Samvat 1228. It was brought to Patan and was buried underground for safekeeping during a period of disturbance. It was rediscovered in 1375-76 and was stored in the stable of the local ruler.\n\nAccording to the texts, a merchant 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar had gone to Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under the house of a local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back. The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell asleep. In his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the \"shikhar\" of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the \"Gori Parshvanth Tirth\", and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.\n\nThe image is said to have disappeared in 1835. The temple was visited by Stanley Napier Raikes in 1854, who met local Jains to compile recent history and consulted \"Goorjee Kuntvujajee\" who had manuscripts describing the history of the temple. The temple was damaged by British troops who tried to capture a \"Sodha\" chief who had led a local rebellion.\n\nThe Nagarparkar Bazaar Temple was built main bazar of the Nagarparkar town. The temple is remarkable for its intricately carved sculptures and paintings. The structure of the temple, including its \"shikhara\" and the \"torana\" gateway is completely intact. It was in use until the independence of Pakistan in 1947, and perhaps for some years even after that.\n\nBhodesar, 4 miles from Nagar, features the ruins of three Jain temples. Bhodesar was the region's capital during Sodha rule. Two of the three temples were used as cattle sheds, while the third was noted in 1897 to be in disrepair with holes in the back. An ancient water tank, known as \"Bhodesar Talao\", was also built in the nearby hills.\n\nThe oldest temple, was built in the classical style with stones without any mortar, built around the 9th century CE, by a Jain woman named Poni Daharo. It is built on a high platform and reached by a series of steps carved into the rock. It has beautifully carved huge stone columns and other structural elements. The remaining walls are unstable and partially collapsed. Parts of the building had been dismantled by the locals who used the bricks to construct their homes.\n\nThe two other Jain temples are said to have been built in 1375 CE and 1449 CE, built of \"kanjur\" and redstone, with fine carvings and corbelled domes.\n\nThe Viravah Temples were 3 temples that are located near the town of Viravah, about 15 miles north of Nagarparkar. The site is near the ruins of the ancient seaport of \"Parinagar\" on the edge of the Rann of Kutch. The area once had three temples, which are said to have been founded in 456 CE by Jeso Parmāra. \n\nOne of the temples was in use during the British era, and is well-preserved and made of white marble. Another temple had a block of finely carved marble which was transferred to the Karachi Museum during the British era. The third ruined temple has 26 small domes surrounding a large central dome measuring 18 feet in diameter. The central dome features fine stone tracing It contains carved stone pillars with carved capitals.\n\nDuring construction of a nearby road, workers accidentally discovered numerous Jain statues, which were then placed by locals in the remaining abandoned temple, while others were taken to the museum in Umerkot.\n\nThe white marble mosque of Bhodesar is built in a style that was highly influenced by the architecture of nearby Jain temples. The mosque was built in 1505 CE by the Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat. The mosque features a central dome very similar to domes found on the nearby Jain temples, resting upon a square shaped edifice measuring 9.2 metres on each side. Pillars at the mosque also reflect Jain architecture, while decorative elements along the roofline were also inspired by Jain temples.\n\nThe temples and mosques are protected by the \"Antiquities Act 1968,\" which was replaced by the \"Antiquities Act 1975.\" The site is managed by Director General of Archaeology and Museums. The Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh, established in 2008, has undertaken restoration works at the site using private funding. The landscape was submitted by the Pakistani government in 2016 to be inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2016.\n\n"}

He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2008.\n\nBorn in London, he contributed significantly to the advancement of Roman Catholic life and ecumenism in England during the 20th century, notably through co-founding the Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain, his collaboration as an Editorial Committee member of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics and his General Editorship of its second edition, and his work as a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee and as Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and the Greek, as well as of its ecumenical edition. His specialist subjects were the Deuterocanonical Books, on which he contributed articles to three major Biblical Commentaries (see \"Publications\" below), and the life and works of Alexander Geddes, a pioneer of biblical criticism, on which he wrote his doctoral thesis (see \"Publications\" below).\n\nInitially Fuller's parents, the physician and medical author Arthur William Fuller and Florence Margaret Fuller (née Montgomery), of St John's Wood, London, sent their son to Ealing Priory School (subsequently renamed St Benedict's School) where he happened to share classes and hone his Latin skills in competition with a younger pupil, later also a New Testament scholar who would be Fuller's colleague on a number of major academic projects, John Bernard Orchard. Recognizing his academic potential, they then decided to move their son to Cardinal Vaughan School, before sending him for the final years of his schooling to Ampleforth College.\n\nFuller attended seminary studies at Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, from 1926 to 1931 and was ordained priest by Cardinal Bourne at Westminster Cathedral in 1931. His academic studies at the Dominican University in Rome earned him a SThL in 1933 and a SThD in 1935, and at the Biblical Institute in Rome a SScriptLic in 1934. During 1964–1968 he took up biblical research at Cambridge University and earned a PhD.\n\nAt various times during 1950–1994 Rev. Fuller held pastoral appointments in the Archdiocese of Westminster. He served as Rector of the Church and Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and St. Gregory, Warwick Street, London W1 (1950–1963), as Chaplain at Westminster Cathedral (1976–1978), and as Rector of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, Islington (1978–1983). After his retirement he served as Assistant Priest at the Church of St. Mellitus, Tollington Park, London (1983–1990, (where on one occasion in the sacristy he was attacked by intruders and hit over the head with a crucifix but suffered no lasting injury), and at the Church of Our Lady and St. Joseph, Poplar, London (1990–1994). Thereafter he took up residence in Clergy House at Westminster Cathedral, regularly hearing Confessions at the Cathedral and helping with occasional exhibitions. In 2003 he moved to Nazareth House, where on request he continued to provide spiritual guidance to his visitors on an individual basis.\n\nFuller was lecturer in Biblical Studies at Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, from 1936 to 1949, for the Newman Association from 1950 to 1954, and at St Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, from 1968 to 1972. He then spent three years in Kenya as lecturer in Old Testament Studies at the University of Nairobi from 1972 to 1975. While there he availed himself of the opportunity to indulge some of his recreational interests and with members of the university staff went mountain climbing and visited Mount Kenya and the Ngorongoro Crater, and admired the wild-life in Serengeti/Tanzania and the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1990 Fuller was a member of the \"Society of Old Testament Studies (SOTS)\". Among his involvement in major professional projects was the co-founding of the \"Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain\" (CBA), of which he then was Hon. Secretary from 1940 to 1965 and chairman from 1968 to 1982. As representative of the CBA he acted in 1963 as Promoter of the English spelling of Biblical names for Catholic use to the Conference of the Bishops of England and Wales (e.g. Noah, Elijah, Joshua, in place of Noe, Elias, Josue as in the Douay-Challoner Bible, based on the Latin text).\n\nFr Bernard Orchard invited Fuller onto the Editorial Committee of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics, entitled \"A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (CCHS, 1953 ); and the Diocese entrusted Fuller in 1951 with the office of \"Censor Deputatus\" for the \"Nihil Obstat\" in its regard (cf. CCHS, p. iv). When subsequent developments – among them Vatican II and the discovery of the manuscripts in the caves at Qumran – required an updating of the commentary, he was General Editor of its second edition, entitled \"A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1969).\n\nHe was, moreover, Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and Greek, entitled \"The Holy Bible – Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition\" (1966), and its ecumenical counterpart, \"The Common Bible\" (1973). He was a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee from 1969 to 1980 and of the Joint Committee on the Revised English Bible from 1979 to 1989. From 1946 to 1953 he was the Editor of the quarterly journal, \"Scripture\".\n\nIn addition to many articles and book reviews that Fuller contributed to specialist journals, e.g. \"Scripture Bulletin\", \"Priests and People\", \"The Tablet.\" He wrote articles on the Deuterocanonical Books for \"A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1953), \"A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\" (1966), and \"International Catholic Bible Commentary\" (1996), and the articles \"\"\"Alexander Geddes\",\" 1737–1802\" and \"Mythology and Biblical Studies to 1800\" for \"Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation\" (1999).\n\nHis PhD thesis was published in 1984 under the title \"Alexander Geddes: A Pioneer of Biblical Criticism, 1737–1802\".\n\nHe outlined the history of the Church and Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, better known as \"Warwick Street Church\", where he had been a Rector from 1950 to 1963, in a small illustrated book entitled \"Steadfast in Loyalty – Warwick Street Church – A Short History and Guide\" (1956, 1973).\n\nHis friendship with Leonard Cheshire led to his editing a slender volume providing an insight into Cheshire's spiritual resources during his struggle with the effects of motor neurone disease, entitled \"Crossing the Finishing Line – Last Thoughts of Leonard Cheshire VC\" (1998, , see pp. 7–14, 80).\n\n"}

There is no official state religion, but the government shows preference for Theravada Buddhism, the majority religion.\nAccording to both the 2014 census of the Burmese government Buddhism is the dominant religion, of 88% of the population, practiced especially by the Bamar, Rakhine, Shan, Mon, Karen people and Chinese ethnic groups. Bamar people also practice the Burmese folk religion under the name of Buddhism. The new constitution provides for the freedom of religion; however, it also grants broad exceptions that allow the regime to restrict these rights at will. Ethnic minorities practice Christianity (6.2%, particularly the Chin, Kachin and Karen people), Islam (4.3%, particularly the Indians, Malays, and other minorities), and Hinduism (0.5%, particularly by Burmese Indians).\n\nNat worship is common in Myanmar. Nats are named spirits and shrines can be seen around the country, either standing alone, or as part of Buddhist temples. Nat worship has a relationship with Myanmar Buddhism and there is a recognised pantheon of 37 nats.\n\n\nBuddhism in Myanmar is predominantly of the Theravada tradition, practised by 88% of the country's population. It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion.\n\nAdherents are most likely found among the dominant ethnic Bamar, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, Karen, and Chinese who are well integrated into Burmese society. Monks, collectively known as the Sangha, are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practised in conjunction with nat worship, which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.\n\nBuddhists, although clearly professed by the majority of people in Myanmar, have their complaints regarding religious freedom. A political party, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, split from the main Karen nationalist movement, the Karen National Union (KNU), after the Buddhists were denied to rebuild and repair the stupas at Manerplaw. The top leadership of the KNU were also dominated by Christians, although roughly 65% of the Karen are Buddhist.\n\nMany monks took part in the 2007 Saffron Revolution and were reportedly arrested by government security forces. Some of the leading monks are still detained in various prisons across the country.\n\nChristianity is practised by 6.2% of the population, primarily among the Kachin, Chin and Karen people, and Eurasians because of missionary work in their respective areas. About four-fifths of the country’s Christians are Protestants, in particular Baptists of the Myanmar Baptist Convention; Roman Catholics make up the remainder.\n\nChristians were the fastest growing religious group in Burma for the last 3 decades, still even though that growth gap have narrowed close to the general population they still are the fastest growing religious group.\n\nHinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population. Most Hindus in Myanmar are Burmese Indians.\n\nHinduism, along with Buddhism, arrived in Burma during ancient times. Both names of the country are rooted in Hinduism; Burma is the British colonial officials' phonetic equivalent for the first half of \"Brahma Desha\" the ancient name of the region. Brahma is part of Hindu trinity, a deity with four heads. The name \"Myanmar\" is regional language transliteration of \"Brahma\", where \"b\" and \"m\" are interchangeable.\n\nArakan (Rakhine) Yoma is a significant natural mountainous barrier between Burma and India, and the migration of Hinduism and Buddhism into Burma occurred slowly through Manipur and by South Asian seaborne traders. Hinduism greatly influenced the royal court of Burmese kings in pre-colonial times, as seen in the architecture of cities such as Bagan. Likewise, the Burmese language adopted many words from Sanskrit and Pali, many of which relate to religion. While ancient and medieval arrival of ideas and culture fusion transformed Burma over time, it is in 19th and 20th century that over a million Hindu workers were brought in by British colonial government to serve in plantations and mines. The British also felt that surrounding the European residential centre with Indian immigrants provided a buffer and a degree of security from tribal theft and raids. According to 1931 census, 55% of Rangoon's (Yangon) population were Indian migrants, mostly Hindus. After independence from Britain, Burma Socialist Programme Party under Ne Win adopted xenophobic policies and expelled 300,000 Indian ethnic people (Hindus and Buddhists), along with 100,000 Chinese, from Burma between 1963 and 1967. The Indian policy of encouraging democratic protests in Burma increased persecution of Hindus, as well as led to Burmese retaliatory support of left-leaning rebel groups in northeastern states of India. Since the 1990s, the opening of Burma and its greater economic engagement has led to general improvement in the acceptance of Hindus and other minority religions in Myanmar.\n\nAspects of Hinduism continue in Burma today, even in the majority Buddhist culture. For example, Thagyamin is worshipped whose origins are in the Hindu god Indra. Burmese literature has also been enriched by Hinduism, including the Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana, called Yama Zatdaw. Many Hindu gods are likewise worshipped by many Burmese people, such as Saraswati (known as Thuyathadi in Burmese), the goddess of knowledge, who is often worshipped before examinations; Shiva is called \"Paramizwa\"; Vishnu is called \"Withano\", and others. Many of these ideas are part of thirty seven Nat or deities found in Burmese culture.\n\nIn modern Myanmar, most Hindus are found in the urban centres of Yangon and Mandalay. Ancient Hindu temples are present in other parts of Burma, such as the 11th-century Nathlaung Kyaung Temple dedicated to Vishnu in Bagan.\n\nAlthough Burma's Jews once numbered in the thousands, there are currently only approximately twenty Jews in Yangon (Rangoon), where the country's only synagogue is. Most Jews left Myanmar at the commencement of the Second World War, and also after General Ne Win took over in 1962.\n\nIslam, mainly of the Sunni group, is practised by 4.3% of the population according to the government census.\n\n\nAround 800,000 Muslim Rohingyas live in Burma with around 80% living in the western state of Rakhine. Some Rohingya militant have been fighting on and off since the 1940s to create an Islamic state in Western Burma. Their initial ambition during Mujahideen movements (1947-1961) was to separate the Rohingya-populated Mayu frontier region of Arakan from western Burma and annex that region into newly formed neighbouring East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh).\n\nIn the 1970s, uprisings appeared again during the period of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Recently, during the Arakan State Riots, the aspiration of the Rohingya militant groups, according to various media reports, is to create northern part of Arakan an independent or autonomous state.\n\nAccording to the US State Department’s 2009 international religious freedom report, the country's non-Buddhist populations were underestimated in the census. Islamic scholars claim the country's Muslim population at around 6 to 10% of the total populace. Muslims are divided amongst Indians, Indo-Burmese, Persians, Arabs, Panthays and the Chinese Hui people.\n\nThe Muslim population faces religious persecution in Myanmar. Since independence, successive governments (both democratic and military) did not grant the citizenship of the Muslim Rohingya of Northern Rakhine (Arakan) and forbid missionary activities. The Rohingyas have been forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh or to Muslim states.\n\nTheir claim to citizenship has been marred by disputes with the ethnic Arakanese, who are mainly Buddhists. Aye Chan, a historian at the Kanda University, has written that as a consequence of acquiring arms from the British during World War II, Rohingyas tried to destroy the Arakanese villages instead of resisting the Japanese. On 28 March 1942, Rohingya Muslims from Northern Rakhine State killed around 20,000 Arakanese. In return, around 5,000 Muslims in the Minbya and Mrohaung Townships were killed by Rakhine nationalists and Karenni.\n\n"}
{"id": "4291823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4291823", "title": "Religion in Sri Lanka", "text": "Religion in Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka's population practices a variety of religions. As of the 2011 census 70.2% of Sri Lankans were Theravada Buddhists, 12.6% were Hindus, 9.7% were Muslims (mainly Sunni) and 7.4% Christians (6.1% Roman Catholic and 1.3% other Christian). In 2008 Sri Lanka was the third most religious country in the world according to a Gallup poll, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion is an important part of their daily life.\n\nThe census carried out on 2001 covered 18 districts only. The district percentages shown are from 2001 census except where the numbers are italic, which are from 1981 census. Population movements have occurred after 1981, and accurate statistics did not exist for districts which were not covered in 2001 census until the 2011 census.\n\nTheravada Buddhism is the major religion in Sri Lanka, with about 70% of the country's population as followers. Arahath Mahinda son of Indian Buddhist emperor Ashoka, led the mission to Sri Lanka in 246 BCE where he converted the Sri Lankan king of that time Devanampiya Tissa to Buddhism. Arahath Sanghamitra, daughter of King Ashoka, brought a sapling of the Bodhi tree in Buddha Gaya to Sri Lanka. She also established the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka. The Sapling of the Bodhi tree, known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in Anuradhapura by the King Devanampiya Tissa.\n\nFrom then on, the royal families had helped to encourage the spread of Buddhism, aiding Buddhist missionaries and building monasteries. Around 200 BCE, Buddhism became the official religion of Sri Lanka. The Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka in 4th century by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala. Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation. During the periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contacts with Myanmar and Thailand. Later on, however, Hindu and European colonial influences contributed to the decline of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The religion of Buddhism originally started in India, which is now the home to most of the Hinduism.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as Upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Siamese Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy. By the mid-19th century, Buddhist leaders such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala started a successful national Buddhist movement for the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.\n\nHindus make up 12.6% of Sri Lanka's population. The origins of the religion are linked to early Tamil immigration into the island since the Chola conquests in the 10th century or even earlier with the Saivite devotional movement that swept South India.\n\nHinduism in Sri Lanka is largely identified with the Tamil population and is concentrated in the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The population declined since the 1981 census on account of Sri Lankan Tamil immigration overseas and the repatriation of 'Indian' Tamils.\n\nA significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is Satguru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna. One of the mystics of the 20th century, Yogaswami was the official satguru and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is somewhat active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts while the Shaiva Siddhanta school of philosophy of Shaivism sect of hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the Shaiva Siddhanta and he was 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.\n\nBy the 6th century, Arab traders had controlled much of the trade on the Indian Ocean, including that of Sri Lanka's. Many of these traders settled down in Sri Lanka, encouraging the spread of Islam. However, when the Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka during the 16th century, many of the Arabs' Muslim descendants were persecuted, thus forcing them to migrate to the Central Highlands and to the east coast.\n\nIn modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka have the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Today, about 9.7% of Sri Lankans adhere to Islam; mostly from the Moor and Malay ethnic communities on the island.\n\nAccording to Christian traditions, Christianity introduced by Thomas the Apostle in Sri Lanka (as well as India) during the 1st century. Legend has it small Christian settlements were recorded to have been established on Sri Lanka's coastline. However, the population of Christians in Sri Lanka didn't dramatically increase until the arrival of Portuguese missionaries during the 15th century. In the 17th century, the Dutch took over Sri Lanka and Dutch missionaries were able to convert 21% of Sri Lanka's population to Christianity by 1622.\n\nIn 1796 the Dutch were displaced by the British and in 1802 Ceylon became a Crown colony. Anglican and other Protestant missionaries arrived at Sri Lanka during the early 19th century, when the British took control of Sri Lanka from the Dutch. Under British rule missionary work was undertaken by English societies: Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, the CMS and SPG. The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses are also present in Sri Lanka.\n\nEven so, the percentage of Christians has slowly declined since the end of colonial rule from the height of 10% in 1891 to 7.61% at the latest census, the numbers were 302,000 in the former year and 1.552 million in the latter of a population of 20,650 million. By the 1980s, the population of Christians (mostly concentrated in the northwest of Sri Lanka and in the capital where they are 10% of the population). Of these Christians, about 85% are Roman Catholics and the rest are Anglicans,Methodists and other Protestants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1253138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1253138", "title": "Religion in the Inca Empire", "text": "Religion in the Inca Empire\n\nIn the heterogeneous Inca Empire, polytheistic religions were practiced. Some deities, such as Pachamama and Viracocha, were known throughout the empire, while others were localised.\n\nInca deities occupied the three realms:\n\n\nIn addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as \"chancas\" or \"conopas\". Conopa were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as \"zarap conopa\" for maize, \"papap conopa\" for potatoes and caullama for llamas.\n\nMany ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.\n\nThe earliest ancestors of the Inca were known as Ayar, the first of which was Manco Capac or Ayar Manco. Inca mythology tells of his travels, in which he and the Ayar shaped and marked the land and introduced the cultivation of maize.\n\nReligious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.\n\nA theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the \"hanan pacha\" and the \"ukhu pacha\" and \"urin pacha\". \"Hanan pacha\", the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while \"ukhu pacha\" and \"urin pacha\" were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. \"Kay pacha\", the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between \"hanan pacha\" and \"ukhu pacha\". The realms were represented by the condor (upper world), puma (outer earth) and snake (inner earth).\n\nSacred sites or things named \"wak'a\" were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a \"wak'a\" was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A \"wak'a\" could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use prayer and offerings to communicate with a \"wak'a\" for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually sacrificed a child (\"qhapaq hucha\") or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.\n\nArchaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: \"Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes.\"\n\nThe Incas also used divination. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.\n\nDivination was essential before taking any action. Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices. These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children. \n\nDivination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:\nThe rulers of the Inca empire, such as the last united Inca ruler Huayna Capac, were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces.These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Juan Polo de Ondegardo y Zárate, who was newly appointed as the Chief Magistrate of Cuzco in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the Inca from committing their “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in Lima. They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown.The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco’s plaza for the public to pay their respects. In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. Francisco Pizarro stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”. The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui’s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with Huascar in the civil war.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Spanish, the Inca started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by Juan de Betanzos. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their huaques, or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around Cuzco in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo’s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads… their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried.The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andres in Lima because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.\n\nThe Inca calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with each month having its own festival, and a five-day feast at the end, before the new year began. The Incan year started in December, and began with Qhapaq Raymi, the magnificent festival.\n\n\n"}

Klausen contends that the controversy was deliberately stoked up by people with vested interests on all sides, and argues against the view that it was based on a cultural misunderstanding about the depiction of Muhammad. The book itself caused controversy before its publication when Yale University Press removed all images from the book, including the controversial cartoons themselves and some other images of Muhammad.\n\nThe book was scheduled to be published in November 2009 by Yale University Press. Prior to publication, officials at the Press decided to remove all images of Muhammad from the forthcoming book, including all of the controversial cartoons and a number of historical images of Muhammad from both Muslim and non-Muslim sources, including a 19th-century engraving by Gustave Doré showing Muhammad being tormented in a scene from Dante's Inferno According to the \"Yale Daily News\", the story first broke in the \"New York Times\" on Thursday, August 13, 2009.\n\nThe Press defended its decision, releasing a statement explaining that the University had consulted counterterrorism officials, the highest-level Muslim official at the United Nations, foreign ambassadors from Muslim countries, and Islamic Studies scholars, and that they had \"all\" voiced serious fears about provoking more violence.\n\nSheila Blair, Calderwood Professor of Fine Arts at Boston College and an expert on the art of the Islamic world was one of the authorities consulted by the Yale University Press. She told \"The Guardian \"that she had \"strongly urged\" the Press to publish the images since, \"To deny that such images were made is to distort the historical record and to bow to the biased view of some modern zealots who would deny that others at other times and places perceived and illustrated Muhammad in different ways.\"\n\nBoston College professor Jonathan Laurence, co-author of \"Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France\", has said that he told the Press that it should reproduce the original \"Jyllands-Posten\" newspaper page that included the cartoon. \"I was consulted by the press about the decision whether or not to publish. I suggested that they publish the newspaper page in its entirety as documentary evidence of the episode being discussed,\" he told \"The Times\". \"I actually know another professor who was also consulted and also told them to go ahead, but do it in a responsible manner.\"\n\nCary Nelson, the president of the American Association of University Professors issued a statement describing the decision not to publish the illustrations as prior restraint. \"What is to stop publishers from suppressing an author's words if it appears they may offend religious fundamentalists or groups threatening violence?\" he said. \"We deplore this decision and its potential consequences.\" Nelson accused the Press of acceding to the \"anticipated demands\" of \"terrorists.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Bookseller\", the Press has come under \"heavy criticism\" for its decision to censor the illustrations.\n\nChristopher Hitchens took issue with both the decision to expunge the cartoons and with the statement by the director of the Press, John Donatich, who told the \"New York Times\" that while he has \"never blinked\" before in the face of controversy, \"when it came between that and blood on my hands, there was no question.\" Hitchens compared this line of reasoning to the reasoning of people who \"argue that women who won't wear the veil have 'provoked' those who rape or disfigure them … and now Yale has adopted that 'logic' as its own.\" Concluding, \"What a cause of shame that the campus of Nathan Hale should have pre-emptively run up the white flag and then cringingly taken the blood guilt of potential assassins and tyrants upon itself.\"\n\nAccording to Roger Kimball, Professor Klausen was informed of the decision to expunge the cartoons and other images of Muhammad from the book at a meeting in Boston attended by John Donatich, director of Yale University Press, Linda Lorimer, Vice President and Secretary of Yale University, and Marcia Inhorn, professor of Anthropology and chairman of the Council on Middle East Studies at Yale.\n\nAccording to Professor Klausen, \"My book is an academic book with footnotes and the notion that it would set off civil war in Nigeria is laughable,\" she added that her book has become part of \"a battle over the limits of freedom of speech\".\n\nIn November, 2009, Voltaire Press published all of the images expunged by Yale University in a book entitled \"\" by Professor Gary Hull of Duke University. According to Hull, the new publication is \"a 'picture book' – or errata to the bowdlerized version of Klausen's book.\"\n\nAccording to the publisher,\n\n"}

Whether the sibyl in question was the Etruscan Sibyl of Tibur or the Greek Sibyl of Cumæ is not always clear. The Christian author Lactantius identified the sibyl in question as the Tiburtine sibyl. He gave a circumstantial account of the pagan sibyls that is useful mostly as a guide to their identifications, as seen by 4th century Christians: \n\nAn apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy exists among the Sibylline Oracles, which was attributed to the Tiburtine Sibyl. Its earliest version may date from the fourth century, but in the form that it survives today it was written in the early eleventh century, and has been influenced by the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius. Its first version in Latin dates from the tenth century and may have come from Lombardy, though it was quickly picked up (and rewritten) by the Salian dynasty and the Hohenstaufens. It proved a useful rhetorical tool, valuable for many a ruler; the lists it contained of emperors and kings were revised to fit the circumstances, and hundreds of versions remain from the Middle Ages.\n\nIts conclusion purports to prophesy the advent in the world's ninth age of a final Emperor vanquishing the foes of Christianity:\nThis Emperor's reign is characterized by great wealth, victory over the foes of Christianity, an end of paganism and the conversion of the Jews. The Emperor having vanquished Gog and Magog, \n\nIn doing so, he will give way to the Antichrist:\nThe prophecy relates that Antichrist would be opposed by the Two Witnesses from the Book of Revelation, identified with Elijah and Enoch; after having killed the witnesses and started a final persecution of the Christians, \nIppolito II d'Este rebuilt the Villa d'Este at Tibur, the modern Tivoli, from 1550 onward, and commissioned elaborate fresco murals in the Villa that celebrate the Tiburtine Sibyl, as prophesying the birth of Christ to the classical world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5454053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5454053", "title": "Tichel", "text": "Tichel\n\nTichel (Yiddish טיכל \"tikhl\"), also called a \"mitpachat\" (Hebrew מִטפַּחַת \"miṭpaḥat\"), is the Yiddish word for the headscarf worn by many married Orthodox Jewish women in compliance with the code of modesty known as \"tzniut\", which requires married women to cover their hair. Tichels can range from a simple plain color cotton kerchief tied in the back to elaborate head coverings using multiple fabrics and tying techniques.\nThe Yiddish word \"tichel\" is the diminutive of \"tuch\" (\"cloth\"). Compare German \"Tuch\" (\"cloth\"), and the corresponding Bavarian diminutive \"Tiachal, Tücherl\" (\"small piece of cloth\").\n\nAfter the wedding ceremony, Orthodox Jews believe that a woman should only show her hair to her husband. According to the Mishnah in Ketuboth (7:6), hair covering is not an obligation of biblical origin. It discusses behaviors that are grounds for divorce such as, \"appearing in public with loose hair, weaving in the marketplace, and talking to any man\" and calls these violations of \"Dat Yehudit\", which means Jewish rule, as opposed to \"Dat Moshe\", Mosaic rule. However, the Talmud on this Mishna explains that if the hair is completely uncovered in public, this would indeed be a violation of \"Dat Moshe\", and the Mishna is referring to one who cover her hair with a netlike covering where hair is visible through the holes, as in this case the Biblical requirement is met, but not the \"Dat Yehudit\".. This categorization suggests that hair covering is not an absolute obligation originating from Moses at Sinai, but rather is a standard of modesty that was defined by the Jewish community. In Berakhot 24a), the rabbis define hair as sexually erotic (\"ervah\"), and prohibit men from praying in sight of a woman's hair. The rabbis base this estimation on a biblical verse: \"Your hair is like a flock of goats\" (Song of Songs 4:1), suggesting that this praise reflects the sensual nature of hair.\n\n\n"}

The mirror, ornamented on one side and polished on the other, may be made of bronze, brass or copper.\n\nToli are traditionally worn as part of a shaman's attire around the shaman's neck, or in quantity on the shaman's kaftan or apron - often called their armour as these pieces of ritual clothing help to protect the shaman from hostile spirit attack. Toli help ward off harmful or attacking spirits in their own right, and also can be thought of as an object which signifies the shaman's authority or role.\n\nToils have additional purposes as well, for example, amongst the Daur people and all the other shamanistic groups who use them, they are used for a variety of practices, including to purifying and empowering water or vodka, collecting and trapping hostile spirits, and providing a home for helper spirits. They also act as vessels for spiritual power - called 'wind horse' in Mongolia - which is the shaman's power. They can also collect and store the power of blessings, or power given from the sun, moon, stars or other parts of Creation, all of which can be given to a sick person, or which can be added to the shaman's own power. \n\nWalther Heissig, describing shamans and their incantations in Hure Banner in the 1940s, remarks that one shamaness indicated that the toli contained \"the white horses of the shamans\"; the mirror itself was seen as a vehicle for the shamans.\n\nToli may be used in different sizes; among the Daur, the front and back of the shaman's costume was covered with small toli placed like overlapping scales while the front might also feature eight large mirrors and one medium-sized mirror to protect the heart, the \"neker-toli\"; according to Heissig, in Hure Banner shamans wore nine mirrors, nine being a particularly meaningful number in Mongolian religion and mythology. The neker-toli might be plated in nickel. The number of toli collected by the Daur shaman was an indicator of his or her level of power.\n\n\n"}
