{"id": "20220083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20220083", "title": "Adon", "text": "Adon\n\nAdon () literally means \"lord.\" Adon has an uncertain etymology, although it is generally believed to be derived from the Ugaritic ad, “father.”\n\nThe pluralization of Adon \"my lord\" is \"Adonai\" \"my lords.\" Otto Eissfeldt theorizes that Adonai is a post positive element attested to in Ugaritic writing. He points to the myth of the struggle between Baal and Yam as evidence. Some theorize that Adonai was originally an epithet of the god Yahweh depicted as the chief antagonist of \"the \"Ba`al\"s\" in the Tanakh. Only later did the epithet come to be used as an euphemism to avoid invoking the deity's proper name, Yahweh.\n\nIn Canaanite/Ugaritic tradition, \"ʾadn ilm\", literally \"lord of gods\" is an epithet of El. However, \"ʾadn\" \"lord\" could also be an epithet of other gods. When Yam is described as being at the zenith of his might, he is proclaimed \"ʾadn\" or \"lord\" of the gods. In some Ugaritic texts the term \"ʾadn ʾilm rbm\" meaning \"the Lord of the Great Gods\" is used to refer to the lord and father over deceased kings Some think that this is a reference to Baal. Other suggest this is a reference to a human necromancer traveling to the land of the dead. Karel van der Toorn disagrees he believes that it is a reference to Milku, Yaqar or Yarikh or possibly El Ugarit family households were modeled after the structure of the divine world, each headed by an \" ʾadn\" meaning in this context \"master\" or \"patron\". Generally, this was the patriarch of the family and there may be some relation between \"ʾadn\" and the Ugarit word for \"father\", \"ʾad\".\n\nThe name of the Greek god Adonis is similar to a Semitic word—\"adon\" (which means \"lord\"). Yet there is no trace of a Semitic deity directly connected with Adonis, and no trace in Semitic languages of any specific mythemes connected with his Greek myth; both Greek and Near Eastern scholars have questioned the connection.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, \"adoni\" (“my lord”) is always a non-deity title usually referring to a human superior or occasionally an angel, whereas \"adonai\" (literally \"my lords\") is reserved for God alone. In Jewish tradition, the pluralization is used to distinguish God from earthly lords and to increase his majesty. However, many modern critical scholars see the use of a plural as a remnant of a polytheistic past, with the word only later coming to refer to Yahweh, the single god of Judaism. It is thought that at least some biblical authors used the word originally in a polytheist sense.\n\n"}

{"id": "59385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59385", "title": "Amanita muscaria", "text": "Amanita muscaria\n\nAmanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus \"Amanita\". It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, \"Amanita muscaria\" has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.\n\nArguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture.\n\nAlthough classified as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. \"Amanita muscaria\" is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituents being the compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol. The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.\n\nThe name of the mushroom in many European languages is thought to be derived from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from Germanic- and Slavic-speaking parts of Europe, as well as the Vosges region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania. Albertus Magnus was the first to record it in his work \"De vegetabilibus\" some time before 1256, commenting \"vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas\", \"it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies.\"\n\nThe 16th-century Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to Frankfurt in Germany, while Carl Linnaeus, the \"father of taxonomy\", reported it from Småland in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child. He described it in volume two of his \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753, giving it the name \"Agaricus muscarius\", the specific epithet deriving from Latin \"musca\" meaning \"fly\". It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus \"Amanita\" by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a name sanctioned in 1821 by the \"father of mycology\", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then \"Amanita muscaria\" (L.:Fr.) Hook. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work. Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of \"Amanita muscaria\" (L.) Lam..\n\nThe English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported that \"Amanita muscaria\" was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and \"bug agaric\" was an old alternative name for the species. French mycologist Pierre Bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work \"\" (1784), and proposed a new binomial name \"Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus\" because of this. One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein ( 1,3-Di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.\nIt has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.\nAn alternative derivation proposes that the term \"fly-\" refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness. Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the \"mad\" or \"fool's\" version of the highly regarded edible mushroom \"Amanita caesarea\". Hence there is ' \"mad oriol\" in Catalan, \"mujolo folo\" from Toulouse, ' from the Aveyron department in Southern France, \"\" from Trentino in Italy. A local dialect name in Fribourg in Switzerland is \"tsapi de diablhou\", which translates as \"Devil's hat\".\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" is the type species of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of \"Amanita\" subgenus \"Amanita\", as well as section \"Amanita\" within this subgenus. \"Amanita\" subgenus \"Amanita\" includes all \"Amanita\" with inamyloid spores. \"Amanita\" section \"Amanita\" includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. \"Amanita\" section \"Amanita\" consists of \"A. muscaria\" and its close relatives, including \"A. pantherina\" (the panther cap), \"A. gemmata\", \"A. farinosa\", and \"A. xanthocephala\". Modern fungal taxonomists have classified \"Amanita muscaria\" and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within the species. In \"The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy\", German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies, though without description: \"A. muscaria\" ssp. \"muscaria\", \"A. muscaria\" ssp. \"americana\", and \"A. muscaria\" ssp. \"flavivolvata\".\n\nHowever, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of \"A. muscaria\" by mycologist József Geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian \"subalpine\", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. \"alba\", var. \"flavivolvata\", var. \"formosa\" (including var. \"guessowii\"), and var. \"regalis\" from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties. Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak–hickory–pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species; thus \"A. muscaria\" as it stands currently is evidently a species complex. The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species: \"A. breckonii\" is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest, and the brown-capped \"A. gioiosa\" and \"A. heterochroma\" from the Mediterranean Basin and from Sardinia respectively. Both of these last two are found with \"Eucalyptus\" and \"Cistus\" trees, and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from Australia.\n\nA large, conspicuous mushroom, \"Amanita muscaria\" is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.\nFly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil; this is helpful in identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from globose to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens. Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.\n\nThe free gills are white, as is the spore print. The oval spores measure 9–13 by 6.5–9 μm; they do not turn blue with the application of iodine. The stipe is white, high by wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white ring. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.\n\nAlthough very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as \"Armillaria\" cf. \"mellea\" and the edible \"Amanita basii\"—a Mexican species similar to \"A. caesarea\" of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that \"amarill\" (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the \"A. caesarea\"-like species in Mexico. \"Amanita caesarea\" can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of \"A. caesarea\" are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette (\"Amanita xanthocephala\"), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of \"A. muscaria\" and bears no ring.\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" is a cosmopolitan mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to \"Boletus edulis\", and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, where it can be found in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nEctomycorrhizal, \"Amanita muscaria\" forms symbiotic relationships with many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, \"A. muscaria\" is the fungal equivalent of a weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (\"Nothofagus\"). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (\"Betula pendula\") in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then may appear to be the edible \"A. caesarea\".\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" contains several biologically active agents, at least one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of \"Amanita muscaria\". The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.\n\nA fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps. Deaths from this fungus \"A. muscaria\" have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports, but with modern medical treatment, fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare. Many older books list \"Amanita muscaria\" as \"deadly\", but this is an error that implies the mushroom is more toxic than it is. The North American Mycological Association has stated that there were \"no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years\".\n\nThe active constituents of this species are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies \"A. muscaria\". Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.\n\nMuscarine, discovered in 1869, was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in \"A. muscaria\". Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in \"Amanita muscaria\" are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as \"Inocybe erubescens\", the small white \"Clitocybe\" species \"C. dealbata\" and \"C. rivulosa\". The level of muscarine in \"A. muscaria\" is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning.\n\nThe major toxins involved in \"A. muscaria\" poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) and the related amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating \"A. muscaria\", which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.\n\nIbotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication.\n\nMuscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It is a product of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. \"Amanita muscaria\" and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.\n\nFly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.\n\nIn cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by \"Datura stramonium\"), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.\n\nMedical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion. Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situation.\n\nThere is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from \"A. muscaria\" and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.\n\nThe wide range of psychoactive effects have been variously described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and or deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur; the latter two effects may occur simultaneously and or alternatingly as part of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions pelopsia and teleopsia. Some users report lucid dreaming under the influence of its hypnotic effects. Unlike \"Psilocybe cubensis\", \"A. muscaria\" cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal \"A. muscaria\" began increasing.\n\nProfessor Marija Gimbutienė, a renowned Lithuanian historian, reported to R. Gordon Wasson on the use of this mushroom in Lithuania. In remote areas of Lithuania \"Amanita muscaria\" has been consumed at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. The professor also reported that the Lithuanians used to export \"A. muscaria\" to the Lapps in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in Eastern Europe.\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of \"A. muscaria\" use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of \"A. muscaria\" was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of \"A. muscaria\" was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, \"A. muscaria\" was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the \"A. muscaria\" mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.\n\nThe Koryak of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (\"wapaq\") which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity \"Vahiyinin\" (\"Existence\") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the \"wapaq\", and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the \"wapaq\", Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.\n\nThe Finnish historian T. I. Itkonen mentions that \"A. muscaria\" was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of \"A. muscaria\" among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it was known as the \"miskwedo\". This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of \"Amanita muscaria\".\n\nThe notion that Vikings used \"A. muscaria\" to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be \"very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright\".\n\n\"Amanita muscaria\" is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of ibotenic acid and muscimol.\nRecently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing \"A. muscaria\" for catching flies in Slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.\n\nIn 1968, R. Gordon Wasson proposed that \"A. muscaria\" was the \"soma\" talked about in the Rigveda of India, a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time. He noted that descriptions of \"Soma\" omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom, and used the adjective \"hári\" \"dazzling\" or \"flaming\" which the author interprets as meaning red. One line described men urinating \"Soma\"; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming \"from the mountains\", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan invaders from the north. Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the \"Manusmṛti\".\nIn 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma. In his 1976 survey, \"Hallucinogens and Culture\", anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.\n\nPhilologist, archeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro postulated that early Christian theology was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of \"A. muscaria\" in his 1970 book \"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\", but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was roundly criticized by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University, and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book \"A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth\"; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been \"the best kept secret in the world\" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.\n\nThe toxins in \"A. muscaria\" are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or finely diced and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked, it seems to be detoxified. Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified \"A. muscaria\" has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of \"A. muscaria\" consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.\n\nUse of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of \"A. muscaria\" by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.\n\nA 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of \"A. muscaria\" as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that \"Amanita muscaria\" be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.\n\nThis mushroom has been widely consumed in Nagano, Japan, and is mainly pickled for consumption there.\n\nThis mushroom also widely appears on the Central Coast of the United States in California and author Hank Shaw filled four grocery bags ' worth of them.\n\nThe red-and-white spotted toadstool is a common image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two of the most famous uses of the mushroom are in the video game series \"Super Mario Bros.\" (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms in several stages), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film \"Fantasia\".\n\nAn account of the journeys of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the \"mukhomor\" there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, \"Citizen of the World\". The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time. Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books \"The Seven Sisters of Sleep\" and \"A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi\". This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".

{"id": "2792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792", "title": "Anthropic principle", "text": "Anthropic principle\n\nThe anthropic principle is a philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.\nThe strong anthropic principle (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak anthropic principle (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of \"only\" this universe, compatible with \"our\" life) could occur.\n\nThe principle was formulated as a response to a series of observations that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on Earth. The anthropic principle states that this is a necessity, because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe \"some\" universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.\n\nThe term \"anthropic\" in \"anthropic principle\" has been argued to be a misnomer. While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require human life or some kind of carbon chauvinism. Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.\n\nThe anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking falsifiability and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, \"conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist\", is \"easy\" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a tautology or truism. However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.\n\nIn 1961, Robert Dicke noted that the age of the universe, as seen by living observers, cannot be random. Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a \"golden age\", neither too young nor too old. If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of\nmetallicity (levels of elements besides hydrogen and helium) especially carbon, by nucleosynthesis. Small rocky planets did not yet exist. If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the main sequence and would have turned into white dwarfs, aside from the dimmest red dwarfs, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired Dirac's varying-G theory.\n\nDicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the critical density needed to prevent the Big Crunch (the \"Dicke coincidences\" argument). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of baryonic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of dark matter account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a cosmological constant. Steven Weinberg gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the value particle physics predicts (this has been described as the \"worst prediction in physics\"). However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic inflation, which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.\n\nThe observed values of the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.\n\nThe phrase \"anthropic principle\" first appeared in Brandon Carter's contribution to a 1973 Kraków symposium honouring Copernicus's 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the Copernican Principle, which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the Universe. As Carter said: \"Although our situation is not necessarily \"central\", it is inevitably privileged to some extent.\" Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the Perfect Cosmological Principle, which states that all large regions \"and times\" in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the steady-state theory, which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the Big Bang).\n\nCarter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a \"weak\" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged spacetime locations in the universe, and a more controversial \"strong\" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.\n\nRoger Penrose explained the weak form as follows:\n\nOne reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make \"predictions\" about the parameters. But second, \"as a last resort\", we can convert these predictions into \"explanations\" by assuming that there \"is\" more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the multiverse (\"world ensemble\" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: \"why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another?\"\n\nSince Carter's 1973 paper, the term \"anthropic principle\" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, published that year which distinguished between \"weak\" and \"strong\" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.\n\nCarter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: \"Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.\" In 1957, Robert Dicke wrote: \"The age of the Universe 'now' is not random but conditioned by biological factors [...] [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.\"\n\nWeak anthropic principle (WAP) (Carter): \"[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is \"necessarily\" privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.\" Note that for Carter, \"location\" refers to our location in time as well as space.\n\nStrong anthropic principle (SAP) (Carter): \"[T]he universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase Descartes, \"cogito ergo mundus talis est\".\"<br>The Latin tag (\"I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]\") makes it clear that \"must\" indicates a deduction from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a truism.\n\nIn their 1986 book, \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\", John Barrow and Frank Tipler depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:\n\nWeak anthropic principle (WAP) (Barrow and Tipler): \"The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so.\"<br>Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just \"observers\". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the fine structure constant, the number of spacetime dimensions, and the cosmological constant—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.\n\nStrong anthropic principle (SAP) (Barrow and Tipler): \"The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.\"<br>This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the \"must\" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:\n\nThe philosophers John Leslie and Nick Bostrom reject the Barrow and Tipler SAP as a fundamental misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for \"anthropic bias\"—that is, the bias created by anthropic selection effects (which Bostrom calls \"observation\" selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:\n\nStrong self-sampling assumption (SSSA) (Bostrom): \"Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its reference class.\"<br> Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of \"observer-moments\" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate \"reference class\": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.\n\nAccording to Jürgen Schmidhuber, the anthropic principle essentially just says that the conditional probability of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as \"gravity won't change tomorrow\". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the prior distribution of alternative universes are necessary.\n\nPlaywright and novelist Michael Frayn describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book \"The Human Touch\", which explores what he characterises as \"the central oddity of the Universe\":\n\nCarter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the \"fundamental parameters\"—that is, the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the Big Bang. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is fine tuned to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that \"there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions\". If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the \"typical\" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.\n\nAlthough philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by Max Tegmark. An important development in the 1980s was the combination of inflation theory with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by symmetry breaking in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as \"fundamental constants\" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the string landscape emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters. As Einstein said: \"What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.\" In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a \"theory of everything\", string theory, proclaimed \"the end of the anthropic principle\" since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see below).\n\nThe modern form of a design argument is put forth by intelligent design. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the fine-tuning observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) and Ikeda and Jefferys, argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see fine-tuned universe.\n\nPaul Davies's book \"The Goldilocks Enigma\" (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:\n\nOmitted here is Lee Smolin's model of cosmological natural selection, also known as \"fecund universes\", which proposes that universes have \"offspring\" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).\n\nClearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).\n\nThe anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983) inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account cosmological and astrophysical considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the age of the universe, the evolutionary chain culminating in \"Homo sapiens\" probably admits only one or two low probability links.\n\nNo possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is \"required\" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in \"our\" portion of \"this\" universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.\n\nPhilosopher John Leslie states that the Carter SAP (with multiverse) predicts the following:\n\nHogan has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe \"not\" to support life.\n\nProbabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:\nThe probability of observing value \"X\" is then proportional to \"N\"(\"X\") \"P\"(\"X\"). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be \"over-tuned\", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the cosmological constant can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.\n\nOne thing that would \"not\" count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence that the Earth or the solar system occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the Copernican principle (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see Copernican principle), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a necessary condition for our existence as observers.\n\nFred Hoyle may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on carbon-12 atoms, that there must be an undiscovered resonance in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the triple-alpha process. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million electronvolts. Willie Fowler's research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.\n\nHowever, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.\n\nDon Page criticized the entire theory of cosmic inflation as follows. He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic arrow of time in a universe with a Big Bang origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the entropy of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. Paul Davies rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle. While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any \"ad hoc\" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.\n\nString theory predicts a large number of possible universes, called the \"backgrounds\" or \"vacua\". The set of these vacua is often called the \"multiverse\" or \"anthropic landscape\" or \"string landscape\". Leonard Susskind has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.\n\nSteven Weinberg believes the Anthropic Principle may be appropriated by cosmologists committed to nontheism, and refers to that Principle as a \"turning point\" in modern science because applying it to the string landscape \" [...] may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator\". Others—most notably David Gross but also Lubos Motl, Peter Woit, and Lee Smolin—argue that this is not predictive. Max Tegmark, Mario Livio, and Martin Rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.\n\nJürgen Schmidhuber (2000–2002) points out that Ray Solomonoff's theory of universal inductive inference and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some prior distribution on the set of possible explanations of the universe.\n\nThere are two kinds of dimensions, spatial (bidirectional) and temporal (unidirectional). Let the number of spatial dimensions be \"N\" and the number of temporal dimensions be \"T\". That \"N\" = 3 and \"T\" = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by string theory and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting \"N\" differ from 3 and \"T\" differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue. \n\nThe implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who in the Discourse on Metaphysics suggested that the world is Immanuel Kant argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square law of universal gravitation. While Kant's argument is historically important, John D. Barrow says that it \"[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa\" (Barrow 2002: 204).\n\nIn 1920, Paul Ehrenfest showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the orbit of a planet about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its galaxy. Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a wave impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are formula_1 spatial dimensions, where \"k\" is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, Hermann Weyl showed that Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism works only with three dimensions of space and one of time. Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron orbitals around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the nucleus or disperse.\n\nMax Tegmark expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner. If \"T\" differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant partial differential equations. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if \"T\" > 1, Tegmark maintains that protons and electrons would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If \"N\" < 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when \"N\" < 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.\n\nIn general, it is not clear how physical law could function if \"T\" differed from 1. If \"T\" > 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like geodesics would not be necessarily maximal. \"N\" = 1 and \"T\" = 3 has the peculiar property that the speed of light in a vacuum is a \"lower bound\" on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of tachyons. \n\nHence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except \"N\" = 3 and \"T\" = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.\n\nSome of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back Teilhard de Chardin's earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare Omega Point), expressing a \"creatio evolutiva\" instead the elder notion of \"creatio continua\". From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology. Karl W. Giberson has been sort of laconic in stating that\n\nA thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" by John D. Barrow, a cosmologist, and Frank J. Tipler, a cosmologist and mathematical physicist. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical astrophysics, it also touches on quantum physics, chemistry, and earth science. An entire chapter argues that \"Homo sapiens\" is, with high probability, the only intelligent species in the Milky Way.\n\nThe book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the history of ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of teleology and intelligent design. They discuss the writings of Fichte, Hegel, Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, and the Omega Point cosmology of Teilhard de Chardin. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from \"eutaxiological\" reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.\n\nSeeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the final anthropic principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.\n\nBarrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and \"closely connected with moral values\". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the universe, constraints developed further in Tipler's \"The Physics of Immortality\". One such constraint is that the universe must end in a big crunch, which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about dark energy, based on observations of very distant supernovas.\n\nIn his review of Barrow and Tipler, Martin Gardner ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):\n\nCarter has frequently regretted his own choice of the word \"anthropic\", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general. Others have criticised the word \"principle\" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of selection effects.\n\nA common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy deus ex machina which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: \"[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts.\"\n\nCarter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as truisms or trivial tautologies—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their logical form (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying \"if things were different, they would be different\", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.\n\nCritics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.\n\nMany criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's \"anthropic cosmological principle\", which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a \"necessary prerequisite\" for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.\n\nSome applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called \"carbon chauvinism\", see also alternative biochemistry). The range of fundamental physical constants consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine tuned universe have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a weakless universe in which the weak nuclear force is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other fundamental interactions, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nLee Smolin has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his fecund universes theory, which assumes universes have \"offspring\" through the creation of black holes whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.\n\nThe philosophers of cosmology John Earman, Ernan McMullin, and Jesús Mosterín contend that \"in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation\". A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed \"anthropic\" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:\n\n\n"}

Mackenzie Brown writes: \n\n\"Hymns to goddesses in the late portions of the great Mahabharata epic and in the Harivamsa (AD 100-300) reveal the increasing importance of female deities in Brahminical devotional life.… The re-emergence of the divine feminine in the Devi-Mahatmya was thus both the culmination of centuries-long trends and the inspirational starting point for new investigations into the nature of feminine transcendence.\"\n\nWhen she does appear in \"Markandeya Purana\", in the section known as Chandi or The Devi Mahatmya, she proclaims her preeminence:\n\nThis text recounts the tale of male demons and their destruction by the Great Goddess and traces its lineage through the Devīsūkta or the Vac Sukta in The \"Rigveda\" and also connects with the Samkhya Prakriti to establish itself as a canonical text for the Shaktas.\n\nChandi, the fiercest form of the Goddess, who is the main deity of the famous Devi Mahatmya, a great poem of seven hundred verses (also called Durga Saptasati or Chandi) which celebrates the destruction of demons. As Chandi or the destroyer of opposition, she can be invoked for removing obstacles to allow us to attain any of the four goals of life.\n\nThe designation of Chandi or Chandika is used twenty-nine times in the Devi Mahatmya, which is agreed by many scholars to have had originated in Bengal, the primary seat of the Shakta or Goddess tradition and tantric sadhana since ancient times. It is the most common epithet used for the Goddess. In Devi Mahatmya, Chandi, Chandika, Ambika and Durga have been used synonymously.\n\nThe basis for Chandi worship is found in Devi Bhagavata as well as in the Markandeya Purana, which contains the well known Saptashati. This narrates the three tales of Chandika fighting and destroying the evil forces in the forms of Madhu, Kaithabha, Mahishasura and Shumbha & Nishumbha. These stories are narrated in thirteen chapters in the form of seven hundred stanzas or half stanzas. Each of these is considered as an independent mantra by repeating which one attains profound benefits. In addition, the mantra prescribed for this is what is known as Navakshari, the nine lettered mantra that has its basis in the Atharva Shirsha Upanishad, known as the Devi Upanishad.\n\nGoddess Chandi is associated with the 9 lettered Navakshari Mantra.It is also called Navarna Mantra or Navavarna Mantra. It is one of the principal mantras in Shakti Worship apart from the Sri Vidhya Mantras. It customary to chant this mantra when chanting the Devi Mahatmya. She is supposed to live in a place called Mahakal, which is close to Kailasa.\n\nShe is considered as Kaatyayini (Durga) who had killed Mahishasura as well as Kaushiki or Ambika (forms of Parvati) who killed Shumbha, Nishumbha and their fellow demons. \"The great Goddess was born from the energies of the male divinities when the devas became impotent in the long-drawn-out battle with the asuras. All the energies of the Gods became united and became supernova, throwing out flames in all directions. Then that unique light, pervading the Three Worlds with its lustre, combined into one, and became a female form.\"\n\n\"The Devi projected an overwhelming omnipotence. The three-eyed goddess was adorned with the crescent moon. Her multiple arms held auspicious weapons and emblems, jewels and ornaments, garments and utensils, garlands and rosaries of beads, all offered by the gods. With her golden body blazing with the splendour of a thousand suns, seated on her lion vehicle, Chandi is one of the most spectacular of all personifications of Cosmic energy.\"\n\nIn other scriptures, Chandi is portrayed as \"assisting\" Kali in her battle with demon Raktabija. While Kali drank Raktabija's blood, which created new demons from his own blood on falling on the ground; Chandi would destroy the armies of demons created from his blood and finally killed Raktabija himself. In Skanda Purana, this story is retold and another story of mahakali killing demons Chanda and Munda is added.\n\nChandi Homa is one of the most popular Homas in Hindu religion. It is performed across India during various festivals, especially during the Navaratri. Chandi Homa is performed by reciting verses from the Durga Sapthasathi and offering oblations into the sacrificial fire. It could also be accompanied by the Navakshari Mantra. Kumari Puja, Suvasini Puja also form a part of the ritual.\n\nThe dhyana sloka preceding the Middle episode of Devi Mahatmya the iconographic details are given. The Goddess is described as eighteen armed bearing string of beads, battle axe, mace, arrow, thunderbolt, lotus, bow, water-pot, cudgel, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose and the discus (sudarsana). She has a complexion of coral and is seated on a lotus. In some temples the images of Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi, and Maha Saraswati are kept separately. The Goddess is also portrayed as four armed in many temples.\n\nAs Purnachandi, she is visualised as both the essence as well as transcendence i.e. the Brahman; who is beyond Laghu Chandika, who is of the combined form of Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati as represented in Durga Saptashati of Markandeya Purana. As Purnachandi, she sports with her sixteen hands, sword, arrow, spear, shakti, chakra, mace, rosary, kartarI, phalaka, karmuka, nagapasha, axe, damaru, skull, boon jesture and protection jesture.\n\nChandi is one of the most popular folk deities in Bengal, and a number of poems and literary compositions in Bengali called \"Chandi Mangala Kavyas\" were written from 13th century to early 19th century. These had the effect of merging the local folk and tribal goddesses with mainstream\nHinduism. The \"Mangal kavyas\" often associate Chandi with goddess Kali or Kalika and recognise her as a consort of Shiva and mother of Ganesha and Kartikeya, which are characteristics of goddesses like Parvati and Durga. The concept of Chandi as the supreme Goddess also underwent a change. The worship of the goddess became heterogeneous in nature.\n\nChandi is associated with good fortune. Her auspivcious forms like \"Mangal Chandi\", \"Sankat Mangal Chandi\", \"Rana Chandi\" bestow joy, riches, children, good hunting and victory in battles while other forms like \"Olai Chandi\" cure diseases like cholera, plague and cattle diseases.\n\nThese are almost all village and tribal Goddesses with the name of the village or tribe being added onto the name Chandi. The most important of these Goddesses is Mongol Chandi who is worshipped in the entire state and also in Assam. Here the word \"Mongol\" means auspicious or benign.\n\n\n \n"}

Weary of violence and bloodshed, they readily received the missionaries and their gospel of peace.\n\nParamount chief, Malietoa Vainu'upo, of noble lineage accepted Christianity. All his followers and kinsfolk immediately followed suit. Similarly, Tui-Manu'a, the sovereign ruler of the Manu'a islands also embraced the LMS emissary. The Kingdom of Manu'a became a LMS and Congregational stronghold. Within a few years, virtually the whole of Samoa was converted to Christianity. Huge numbers of people from simple and noble lineage soon offered themselves for overseas mission work. In 1839, nine years after the arrival of the LMS, the first twelve Samoan missionaries left for mission work in Melanesia. Since then, Samoans continued to take the gospel message to other Pacific islands, e.g. Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Niue, Tokelau, New Caledonia, Rotuma, Solomon Islands, Wallis and Futuna. Many of these early Samoan missionaries never returned home; they occupy many of the unnamed and unmarked graves on islands throughout the Pacific. By the 1980s Samoan missionaries could be found in Africa, evangelizing on the streets of London, to remote villages in Jamaica.\n\nMalua Theological College was established in 1844, its main objective to teach and educate local students so that each village of Samoa would have a theologically educated pastor as spiritual leader. By the end of the 19th century, a pattern of ministry had emerged. It was modeled on the Samoan village structural organization and aimed at preserving, as much as possible, the value systems of the Samoan way of life. The church community functions in the same way as the village, where five main groups – matai (titled men), spouses of matai, untitled men aumaga, unmarried women aualuma, and children – each have their own individual and corporate roles and responsibilities for the maintenance of order and welfare. The village congregation is the basic unit of the CCCS with the pastor as the spiritual leader.\n\nThe Samoan church during the missionary period engaged itself in the \"social redemption of humanity\". This vision was based on the church's understanding of God's sovereignty. It saw the divine purpose of redemption not in individual terms only but also in corporate, social and political terms. The newly acquired faith had its focus on the transformation of life and society. That legacy remains a motivating force in the nation's idealism as well as in the church's commitment to active social efforts. The church has been able to maintain five high schools, one girls' college and one theological college.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, the Samoan church has continued to forge ecumenical relationships with other churches locally, regionally and internationally. It has become a transnational church with eight districts (synod or diocese) outside Samoa: one in the United States, one in Hawaii, three in Australia and three in New Zealand. It has one congregation in Fiji and American Samoa. In the Independent state of Samoa alone the CCCS membership is over 70,000. In the U.S. Territory of American Samoa, the CCCAS has over 39,000 adherents. Samoan Congregational adherents account for nearly half of the Samoan population living abroad.\n\nWhen the London Missionary Society combined with other missions to create the Council for World Mission (CWM) in 1977, the CCCS became a part of this global missionary effort as well. A ecclesial schism took place within the Samoan church in 1980, with the American Samoa district withdrawing and forming the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa (CCCAS). The CCCAS became a member of CWM in 1994. The 2012 CWM Conference was held at the CCCAS headquarters in Kananafou. Fellow church members from over thirty-one Churches with LMS affiliations converged upon Kananafou to share in Christian fellowship. Samoan Congregational churches continue to play an active role in participating in ecumenical efforts that outreach to the world.\n\nWithin the first years of their work, the LMS missionaries developed a Samoan alphabet and put the language into written form. The setting-up of the first printing press in Samoa (1839), only the second in the Pacific region, was a mark of the missionary zeal to bring the people to understand the gospel through the written word.\n\nThe London Missionary Society missionaries, working with prominent and well-versed Samoan orators in the local vernacular, translated the Christian Bible into the Samoan language, and this Bible translation, \"O le Tusi Pa'ia\", is still used today. It provides an important grounding in the philosophical usage of the Samoan language. By 1855 the translation of the Bible in Samoan was completed. The 1886 edition of the Samoan Bible was printed by the LMS in London. This edition used Roman numerals and the word, \"Ieova\", or Jehovah, in reference to the Lord throughout the Old Testament text. This edition is popular among other Christian denominations that use the Samoan language .\n\nIn 1839, the LMS missionaries introduced a monthly journal, Sulu Samoa, the CCCS continues to print and provides online publication through its website - cccs.org.ws.\n\nThe London Missionary Society established a printing press (firstly in the village of Avao, Savaii and then in Malua, Upolu), and a theological college at Malua, where the main centre of the Congregational Christian Church in Samoa is today with its main offices in the main town of Apia, Samoa. The Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa (CCCAS) has its headquarters and theological training seminary at Kanana Fou (New Canaan)compound on Tutuila Island in the US territory of American Samoa.\n\n"}

The ‘continuing’ organizations may be old or the split between the parent Church and the Continuing Church may be recent.\n\nThe term \"Continuing Church\" has been used by a number of Christian denominations formed in response to a variety of doctrinal disagreements between members. The use of this term is meant to suggest that no new doctrines were being promoted by the dissenters, but rather that the historic faith allegedly abandoned by the parent body was being preserved—or continued—in these newly founded churches.\n\nExamples of Continuing Churches include the Free Church of England (1844), Presbyterian Church in America (1973), Continuing Anglican Movement (1977), Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly (1991), the Episcopal Missionary Church (1992), and the Free Church of Scotland (continuing) (2000). \n\nIn the USA, the ordination of women beginning in the 1970s played a major part in the formation of a number of Continuing Churches, as did Fundamentalist and Evangelical convictions. The Southern Methodist Church (1940) and the Evangelical Church (1968), for example, were both bodies which refused to join with the Methodist Church the United Methodist Church, respectively, on grounds of theology and polity. And there are many remnants of the former Congregationalist denominations which now comprise the United Church of Christ merger, such as the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (1948). The North American Baptist landscape is replete with organizations that originate from a refusal to join a larger body.\n\nIn Australia, both Fellowship of Congregational Churches and the Presbyterian Church of Australia continued after the Uniting Church in Australia formed in 1977.\n\nContinuing Churches with a Catholic or Anglican tradition have sometimes found it difficult to manage the initial separation in that there are a limited number of Anglicans or Roman Catholics who have passed on valid Apostolic succession. Prior to the 1970s, ‘Continuing Churches’ often approached English speaking Old Catholics to obtain Apostolic Succession and to place themselves within the historic episcopacy. This means that although such churches may have continued the beliefs and practices of Anglicanism, they have Apostolic Succession through the Old Catholic bishops Arnold Harris Matthew or Rudolphe De Landas Berghes. Most Continuing Anglican churches, however, descend from the \"Denver Consecrations\" of 1978 in which the consecrators were bishops in good standing in the Anglican Communion.\n\n‘Continuing Churches’ are frequently less tolerant of doctrinal diversity than the parent Church and claim that they hold on to an 'orthodox' position. The separation of the ‘continuing’ Church from the parent body often leads to a position of conflict between the two organisations.\n\n"}

It was established in 1991 and its founding chairperson is Sadhvi Rithambara. The Vishva Hindu Parishad states the purpose of the Durga Vahini is to encourage more women to participate in prayer meetings and in cultural activities. Kalpana Vyash, a senior leader of the organization, said that the Durga Vahini members dedicate themselves \"to physical, mental and knowledge development\". The aim of the organization is to establish Hindu solidarity by helping Hindu families during the time of hardship and by providing social services. According to Vyash, the total membership of the group is 8,000 as of 2002, and 1,000 members are from Ahmedabad.\n\nThe Durga Vahini is often considered to be the female face of the hardliner Bajrang Dal and have been accused of actively contributing to instigating violence against religious minorities. The organization is described as a militant outfit, right-wing religious fundamentalist group.\n\nThe Durga Vahini aggressively recruits young women from low-income earning and lower caste families. Members learn karate and \"lathi\", and receive ideological education. The organization especially recruits young girls for carrying risky tasks of militant activism in which much physical strength is required, for example confronting Muslim people who they view as enemy and to fight on the front lines in places like Ayodhya.\n\nIn the Bijnor riot in 1990, activists belonging to the Durga Vahini organized a procession of Hindu men through the Muslim quarters of Bijor shouting provocative slogans which started violence.\n\nOn 16 March 2002, Durga Vahini activists wielding tridents and sporting saffron headbands ransacked the Orissa Assembly along with VHP and Bajrang Dal members.\n\nThe Durga Vahini alleged to have participated in the 2002 Gujarat violence. Durga Vahini has denied such allegations. Regarding the Durga Vahini's role in the riots, VHP spokesman Kaushikbahi Mehta said, \"We in the VHP had nothing to do with the violence except to take care of widows and victims of the Godhra mayhem. So was the case with the Durga Vahini\". But many people claimed that white-churidar clad girls were involved in the violence. A senior police official said, \"They were found providing healing touch to the male activists, information back-up and if the ethnic cleansing theory is true, I have a feeling they played a significant role in intelligence network as well. While it will be very difficult to prove their direct involvement, women Sanghis had definitely scrutinised voters’ list or the traders’ licence papers to screen the minorities with an innocuous intention\".\n\nSix members of the Durga Vahini were arrested in Gwalior in March 2004 for blackening the face of Neetu Sapra, director of the play \"Kal Aaj Aur Kal\". The Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal claimed the play depicted Rama, Sita, Laxman and Hanuman in \"indecent\" way. The activists also damaged the furnitures in Sapra's home.\n\nIn July 2017, Durga Vahini organized a training camp for self-defence in Jammu & Kashmir, girls from 17 border towns of the state participated in the camp.\n\n\n"}

The challenge is to explain why an all-good god should be more likely than an all-evil god. Those who advance this challenge assert that, unless there is a satisfactory answer to the challenge, there is no reason to accept God is good or can provide moral guidance.\n\nPapers by Stephen Cahn, Peter Millican, Edward Stein Christopher New, and Charles B Daniels, explored the notion of an 'anti-God'—an omnipotent, omniscient God who is all evil. The Evil God challenge was developed at length and in several formats by the philosopher Stephen Law.\n\nSupporting the greater likeliness of an omnimalevolent creator, in 2015, John Zande published an extended argument for the Evil God thesis, arguing that the irresistible, self-complicating nature of this universe not only resolves the Problem of Good, but establishes unignorable teleological evidence for the wicked disposition of the Creator. Stephen Law noted this work to be an intriguing development in the theology of the Evil God.\n\nThe Evil God Challenge demands explanations for why belief in an all-powerful all-good God is significantly more reasonable than belief in an all powerful all-evil god. Most of the popular arguments for the existence of God give no clue to his moral character and thus appear, in isolation, to work just as well in support of an evil god as a good God.\n\nSeveral criticisms and responses to the Evil God Challenge have been presented. William Lane Craig, Steve Wykstra, Dan Howard-Snyder, and Mike Rea have all suggested that the evident presence of good in the world makes impossible the notion of an all-evil, omnipotent God. William Lane Craig has suggested that an all-evil God would create a world devoid of any good, owing to his nature of evil, whereas an all-good God would create a world realistically with elements of both good and evil. Law contends that even if an evil God is logically untenable, if we would nevertheless rule out an evil god in any case based on observed goods, then shouldn't we similarly rule out a good god on the basis of observed evils. This could be seen as an example of a straw man.\n\nMax Andrews objects to Law's contention here not by denying the existence of evil, but by denying the existence of evil as Law defines it. In general, Law's challenge is only valid if evil is defined as \"equal and opposite\" to good: the \"Evil God Challenge\" is premised not upon \"the existence of evil\", but upon a peculiar belief about what evil \"is\", a belief Law borrows from the \"religious fundamentalist\" described in the quotation above. Andrews instead adopts Augustine's definition of evil not as \"equal and opposite\" to good, and thus as the presence of some \"thing\", but rather as an absence of good, and thus as something with no nature of its own: according to this definition, an evil God and a good God are not comparable, making the line of argument involved in the \"Challenge\" meaningless. The comparison between a good God and an evil God according to this definition would be like a comparison between apples and no apples. Andrews further suggests, given this definition of evil, the notion of an all-evil God is incoherent, since such a God would be unable to imagine everything he did was evil.\n\nIn other words, the \"Evil God Challenge\", far from being purely \"atheistic\", is premised upon a particular theological or ontological belief about the nature of evil, which is not accepted by many theists.\n\nRebutting Andrews's characterization of evil as presented in his \"A Response to the Problem of an ‘Evil God’ as Raised by Stephen Law\", John Zande argued that maximum evil (identified as The Owner of All Infernal Names: a metaphysically necessary, maximally powerful being who does not share His creation with any other comparable spirit) is not, as Andrews proposes, \"maximally selfish\", hateful, vengeful, or even hostile, rather best described as intensely pragmatic and thoroughly observant of His needs; promoting, defending, and even admiring life in its struggle to persist and self-adorn. As presented, maximum evil is not, therefore, an Ouroboros on a colossal scale, hopelessly given over to self-indulgence and destined to defile\nitself and anything it imagined into being, for a world driven only by impetuous brutality would resemble more a raging, super-heated, short-lived bonfire than a secure, creative, and ultimately profitable marketplace desired by a Creator who, above all other\nthings, seeks to maximize his own pleasure over time.\n\nPeter Forrest has suggested an evil God is less likely than a good God, because the term ‘good’ is intrinsically linked to the notion of ‘God’ in a way that ‘evil’ is not. Edward Feser has argued with Law from a similar position. According to these arguments, an evil God, whatever this might be, would simply not be God.\n\n"}
{"id": "14780759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14780759", "title": "Evolutionary psychology of religion", "text": "Evolutionary psychology of religion\n\nThe evolutionary psychology of religion is the study of religious belief using evolutionary psychology principles. It is one approach to the psychology of religion. As with all other organs and organ functions, the brain's functional structure is argued to have a genetic basis, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and evolution. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes, religion in this case, by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.\n\nThere is general agreement among scientists that a propensity to engage in religious behavior evolved early in human history. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. There are two schools of thought. One is that religion itself evolved due to natural selection and is an adaptation, in which case religion conferred some sort of evolutionary advantage. The other is that religious beliefs and behaviors may have emerged as by-products of other adaptive traits without initially being selected for because of their own benefits.\n\nReligious behavior often involves significant costs including economic costs, celibacy, dangerous rituals, or by spending time that could be used otherwise. This would suggest that natural selection should act against religious behavior unless it or something else causing religious behavior to have significant advantages.\n\nRichard Sosis and Candace Alcorta have reviewed several of the prominent theories for the adaptive value of religion. Many are \"social solidarity theories\", which view religion as having evolved to enhance cooperation and cohesion within groups. Group membership in turn provides benefits which can enhance an individual's chances for survival and reproduction. These benefits range from coordination advantages to the facilitation of costly behavior rules.\n\nThe impetus for development of religion for group cohesion is strongly suggested by Edward O. Wilson's theory of \"eusociality\". He posited that the individuals of a small percentage of species including homo sapiens, ants, termites, bees and a few other species, replicated their genes by adhering to one of a number of competing groups. He further postulates that, in homo sapiens, thanks to our enormous forebrains, there evolved a complex interplay between group evolution and individual evolution within a group.\n\nThese social solidarity theories may help to explain the painful or dangerous nature of many religious rituals. Costly-signaling theory suggests that such rituals might serve as public and hard-to-fake signals that an individual's commitment to the group is sincere. Since there would be a considerable benefit in trying to cheat the system - taking advantage of group living benefits without taking on any possible costs - the ritual would not be something simple that can be taken lightly. Warfare is a good example of a cost of group living, and Richard Sosis, Howard C. Kress, and James S. Boster carried out a cross-cultural survey which demonstrated that men in societies which engage in war do submit to the costliest rituals.\n\nStudies that show more direct positive associations between religious practice and health and longevity are more controversial. Harold G. Koenig and Harvey J. Cohen summarized and assessed the results of 100 evidence-based studies that systematically examined the relationship between religion and human well-being, finding that 79% showed a positive influence. These studies are popular in the media, as seen in a recent NPR program including University of Miami Professor Gail Ironson's findings that belief in God and a strong sense of spirituality were good predictors of a lower viral load and improved immune cell levels in HIV patients. However, Dr. Richard P. Sloan of Columbia University was quoted in the New York Times as saying that \"...there is no really good compelling evidence that there is a relationship between religious involvement and health.\" There is still debate over the validity of these findings, and they do not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between religion and health. Mark Stibich claims there is a clear correlation but the reason for it is unclear. A criticism of such placebo effects, as well as the advantage of religion giving a sense of meaning, is that it seems likely that less complex mechanisms than religious behavior could achieve such goals.\n\nStephen Jay Gould cites religion as an example of an exaptation or spandrel, but he does not himself select a definite trait which he thinks was actually acted on by natural selection. He does, however, bring up Freud's suggestion that our large brains, which evolved for other reasons, led to consciousness. The beginning of consciousness forced humans to deal with the concept of personal mortality. Religion may have been one solution to this problem.\n\nOther researchers have proposed specific psychological processes which may have been co-opted for religion. Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events (etiology), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions (theory of mind). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.\n\nPascal Boyer suggests, in his book \"Religion Explained\", that there is no simple explanation for religious consciousness. He builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists Dan Sperber and Scott Atran, who argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology. He argues that one such factor is that it has, in most cases, been advantageous for humans to remember \"minimally counter-intuitive\" concepts which are somewhat different from the daily routine and somewhat violate innate expectations about how the world is constructed. A god that is in many aspects like humans but much more powerful is such a concept, while the often much more abstract god discussed at length by theologians is often too counter-intuitive. Experiments support that religious people think about their god in anthropomorphic terms even if this contradicts the more complex theological doctrines of their religion.\n\nPierre Lienard and Pascal Boyer suggest that humans have evolved a \"hazard-precaution system\" which allows us to detect potential threats in the environment and attempt to respond appropriately. Several features of ritual behaviors, often a major feature of religion, are held to trigger this system. These include the occasion for the ritual, often the prevention or elimination of danger or evil, the harm believed to result from nonperformance of the ritual, and the detailed proscriptions for proper performance of the ritual. Lienard and Boyer discuss the possibility that a sensitive hazard-precaution system itself may have provided fitness benefits, and that religion then \"associates individual, unmanageable anxieties with coordinated action with others and thereby makes them more tolerable or meaningful\".\n\nJustin L. Barrett in \"Why Would Anyone Believe in God?\" suggests that belief in God is natural because it depends on mental tools possessed by all human beings. He suggests that the way our minds are structured and develop make belief in the existence of a supreme god with properties such as being superknowing, superpowerful and immortal highly attractive. He also compares belief in God to belief in other minds, and devotes a chapter to looking at the evolutionary psychology of atheism. He suggests that one of the fundamental mental modules in the brain is the Hyperactive Agency Detection Device (HADD), another potential system for identifying danger. This HADD may confer a survival benefit even if it is over-sensitive: it is better to avoid an imaginary predator than be killed by a real one. This would tend to encourage belief in ghosts and spirits.\n\nThough hominids probably began using their emerging cognitive abilities to meet basic needs like nutrition and mates, Terror Management Theory argues that this happened before they had reached the point where significant self (and thus end-of-self) awareness arose. Death awareness became a highly disruptive byproduct of prior adaptive functions. The resulting anxiety threatened to undermine these very functions and thus needed amelioration. Any social formation or practice that was to be widely accepted by the masses needed to provide a means of managing this terror. The main strategy to do so was to \"become an individual of value in a world of meaning…acquiring self-esteem [via] the creation and maintenance of culture\", as this would counter the sense of insignificance represented by death and provide 1) symbolic immortality through the legacy of a culture that lives on beyond the physical self (\"earthly significance\") 2) literal immortality, the promise of an afterlife or continued existence featured in religions (\"cosmic significance\").\n\nRichard Dawkins suggests in \"The Selfish Gene\" that cultural memes function like genes in that they are subject to natural selection. In \"The God Delusion\" Dawkins further argues that because religious truths cannot be questioned, their very nature encourages religions to spread like \"mind viruses\". In such a conception, it is necessary that the individuals who are unable to question their beliefs are more biologically fit than individuals who are capable of questioning their beliefs. Thus, it could be concluded that sacred scriptures or oral traditions created a behavioral pattern that elevated biological fitness for believing individuals. Individuals who were capable of challenging such beliefs, even if the beliefs were enormously improbable, became rarer and rarer in the population. (See denialism.)\n\nThis model holds that religion is the byproduct of the cognitive modules in the human brain that arose in our evolutionary past to deal with problems of survival and reproduction. Initial concepts of supernatural agents may arise in the tendency of humans to \"overdetect\" the presence of other humans or predators (momentarily mistaking a vine for a snake). For instance, a man might report that he felt something sneaking up on him, but it vanished when he looked around.\n\nStories of these experiences are especially likely to be retold, passed on and embellished due to their descriptions of standard ontological categories (person, artifact, animal, plant, natural object) with counterintuitive properties (humans that are invisible, houses that remember what happened in them, etc.). These stories become even more salient when they are accompanied by activation of non-violated expectations for the ontological category (houses that \"remember\" activates our intuitive psychology of mind; i.e. we automatically attribute thought processes to them).\n\nOne of the attributes of our intuitive psychology of mind is that humans are interested in the affairs of other humans. This may result in the tendency for concepts of supernatural agents to inevitably cross connect with human intuitive moral feelings (evolutionary behavioral guidelines). In addition, the presence of dead bodies creates an uncomfortable cognitive state in which dreams and other mental modules (person identification and behavior prediction) continue to run decoupled from reality producing incompatible intuitions that the dead are somehow still around. When this is coupled with the human predisposition to see misfortune as a social event (as someone's responsibility rather than the outcome of mechanical processes) it may activate the intuitive \"willingness to make exchanges\" module of the human theory of minds resulting in the tendency of humans to try to interact and bargain with their supernatural agents (ritual).\n\nIn a large enough group, some individuals will seem better skilled at these rituals than others and will become specialists. As the societies grow and encounter others, competition will ensue and a \"survival of the fittest\" effect may cause the practitioners to modify their concepts to provide a more abstract, more widely acceptable version. Eventually the specialist practitioners form a cohesive group or guild with its attendant political goals (religion).\n\n\n"}

The foundation was originally set up by Venerable Hong Zong of Taiwan. The present premises are located, adjacent to Sri Sivan Temple, in front of Paya Lebar MRT Station, exit C at Geylang East Avenue 2, Singapore.\n\nFoo Hai Ch'an Monastery was founded in 1935 by Taiwan-born Japan-ordained Venerable Hong Zong who came to popularise Buddhism in Singapore. He was succeeded by Venerable Miao Shou in 1975. The monastery founded the present day Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre at Novena.\n\nBuilt in Zen-style, the Monastery has several structures, statues, Bodhi tree and Buddha relics that are of religious importance and of interest to tourists.\n\nThe main entrance of the Monastery has two Dharmapala protectors, called Heng and Ha. Heng and Ha, the Chinese name of the Dharmapala protectors. During the Chinese adoption of Buddhism, under the influence of Taoism and folk religions, where even numbers are considered sacred, two larger-than-life Dharampala protectors, Heng and Ha, made from metal, were installed on the main entrance of the monastery.\n\nInside the boundary wall from the main entrance are two towers, one each on the north and south corners of the platform housing the main monastery building, a Bell gong tower to the north side and drum tower to the south side. In the morning, the gong is played 108 times, descending from louder to gentler sound, to announce the end of the night and to awaken from deep unconscious. In the evening, the gong is played 108 times, ascending from gentler to louder sound. The sounds are played to remind listeners of illusions.\n\nThe multi-storey main monastery building has a large airy 15 m high prayer hall in the front, which houses a 4-storey high reception, office, administration, auditorium, meeting rooms and toilets at the back. The main hall houses 3.3 meters statue of Buddha and 9.9 meter tall statues of Guanyin.\n\nInside the main large prayer hall, there is a 9.9 m (32.5 feet) tall 1000-hands Guanyin (or Guan Yin) statue of Buddha, which is the South Asian adoption of the Indian-origin Bodhisattva, the feminine representation of compassionate qualities of Buddha. There is a large altar in front of the deity, several ornate statues in the roof, and several rows for praying.\n\nA five-story high pagoda, built in 2004 by the \"Siddhartha centre\" which donated Sg$6 million to Foo Hai Ch'an in 2004, lies in the central north direction. Each floor houses decorated statutes of Buddha in various styles; the top floor houses the sacred Buddha relics.\n\nInside the main entrance, to the immediate right side, there is a five-storey above-ground teaching centre, library and guest house building with toilets.\n\nSingapore Bodhi Tree is a sacred Bodhi Tree, between the main monastery building and pagoda. It is a gift given to the monastery by the then visiting president of Sri Lanka. It comes from the cutting of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree (planted at Anuradhapura in 288 BC, by king Ashoka's eldest daughter Sangamitta) after taking a sapling cutting from the original UNESCO World Heritage Site Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya in India under which Buddha attained the enlightenment.\n\nFoo Hai Ch'an Columbarium, housing urns containing ashes of cremated deceased people, lies in the basement under the pagoda and guest house building.\n\nVenerable Ming Yi of Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery as of 2015 was also imprisoned in a high-profile corruption scandal for misappropriating funds and giving false information. The Commissioner of Charities suspended him from decision-making positions in Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery and other related organisations.\n\n"}

He founded Afro-Brazilian communities in areas that are now part of those countries, and went on to become the \"chachá\" of Ouidah (the slave trading hub for the region), a title that conferred no official powers but commanded local respect in the Kingdom of Dahomey, where, after being jailed by King Adandonzan of Dahomey, he helped Ghezo ascend the throne in a coup d'etat. He became \"chacha\" to the new king, a curious phrase that has been explained as originating from his saying \"ja ja\", a Portuguese phrase meaning something will be done right away.\n\nHis early years in Africa are well documented in a long article (in Portuguese) by Alberto Costa e Silva entitled \"The Early Years of Francisco Féliz de Souza on the Slave Coast\".\n\nFrancisco Félix de Souza was a major slave trader and merchant who traded in palm oil, gold and slaves. He migrated from Brazil to what is now the African republic of Benin. He has been called, \"the greatest slave trader\".\n\nTrading slaves from what was then the Dahomey region, he was known for his extravagance and was reputed to have had at least 80 children with women in his harem. De Sousa continued to market slaves after the trade was abolished in most jurisdictions. He was apparently so trusted by the locals in Dahomey that he was awarded the status of a chieftain.\" Although a Catholic, he practiced the Vodun religion, which is consistent with his Afro-Brazilian background, and had his own family shrine. He was buried in Dahomey.\n\nDe Sousa is regarded as the \"father\" of the city of Ouidah. The city has a statue of De Sousa, a plaza named after De Sousa, and a museum dedicated to the De Sousa family.\n\nAccording to Edna Bay, De Sousa was \"deeply influential as an intermediary between European and African cultures\". Today he is known as a founding patriarch of the Afro-Brazilian communities in Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. The De Souza family has been very instrumental in fighting for the independence of Togo, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin. Figures like \nPaul-Emile de Souza, a president of Benin, and Chantal de Souza Boni Yayi, a first lady of Benin, typify the class.\n\nAccording to the de Souza family, Francisco Félix de Souza was the eighth generation descendant of Tomé de Sousa (1503-1579), a Portuguese nobleman who was the first governor-general of the Portuguese colony of Brazil from 1549-1553. If true, it would make the contemporary de Souzas members of the Portuguese nobility in addition to being an African chieftaincy family.\n\nThe protagonist of Bruce Chatwin's novel \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\" is said to be based upon the life of Francisco Félix de Sousa.\n\n"}

{"id": "47674564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47674564", "title": "History of slavery in the Muslim world", "text": "History of slavery in the Muslim world\n\nSlavery in the Muslim world first developed out of the slavery practices of pre-Islamic Arabia, and was at times radically different, depending on social-political factors such as the Arab slave trade. Throughout Islamic history, slaves served in various social and economic roles, from powerful Emirs to harshly treated workers. Early on in Muslim history they were used in plantation labor similar to that in the Americas, but this was abandoned after harsh treatment led to destructive slave revolts, the most notable being the Zanj Rebellion. Slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, but the most common use was as soldiers, guards and domestic workers. Some rulers relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that the slaves were sometimes in the position to seize power. Among black slaves, there were roughly two females to every one male. Two rough estimates by scholars of the number of slaves held over twelve centuries in the Muslim world are 11.5 million and 14 million, while other estimates indicate a number between 12 to 15 million of slaves until the 20th century.\n\nManumission of a slave was encouraged as a way of expiating sins. Many early converts to Islam, such as Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi, were the poor and former slaves. In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice. In 1990, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam declared that \"no one has the right to enslave\" another human being. Many slaves were often imported from outside the Muslim world. Bernard Lewis maintains that though slaves often suffered on the way before reaching destination, they received well-treatment and some degree of acceptance as members of the household in the owners' houses.\n\nThe Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post World War I), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France. Slavery in the Ottoman Empire was abolished in 1924 when the new Turkish Constitution disbanded the Imperial Harem and made the last concubines and eunuchs free citizens of the newly proclaimed republic. Slavery in Iran was abolished in 1929. Among the last states to abolish slavery were Saudi Arabia and Yemen, which abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; Oman in 1970, and Mauritania in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007. However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of the Sahel, and is also practiced in territories controlled by Islamist rebel groups, for instance in Libya.\n\nSlavery was widely practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, as well as in the rest of the ancient and early medieval world. The minority were European and Caucasus slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of Bedouin captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native Arab slaves had also existed, a prime example being Zayd ibn Harithah, later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes. The slave population increased by the custom of child abandonment (see also infanticide), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children. Whether enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families was common is disputed. (Abd Brunschvig argues it was rare, according to Jonathan E. Brockopp debt slavery was persistent.) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the Roman Empire.\n\nTwo classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into prostitution for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.\n\nThe historical accounts of the early years of Islam report that \"slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments. Sumayyah bint Khayyat is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by Abū Lahāb when she refused to give up her faith. Abu Bakr freed Bilal when his master, Umayya ibn Khalaf, placed a heavy rock on his chest in an attempt to force his conversion.\"\n\nW. Montgomery Watt points out that Muhammad's expansion of Pax Islamica to the Arabian peninsula reduced warfare and raiding, and therefore cut off the sources of enslaving freemen. According to Patrick Manning, the Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian peninsula and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole Umayyad Caliphate where slavery existed since the most ancient times.\n\nAccording to Bernard Lewis, the growth of internal slave populations through natural increase was insufficient to maintain numbers right through to modern times, which contrasts markedly with rapidly rising slave populations in the New World. He writes that\n\n\nBernard Lewis writes: \"In one of the sad paradoxes of human history, it was the humanitarian reforms brought by Islam that resulted in a vast development of the slave trade inside, and still more outside, the Islamic empire.\" He notes that the Islamic injunctions against the enslavement of Muslims led to massive importation of slaves from the outside. According to Patrick Manning, Islam by recognizing and codifying the slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.\n\nThe 'Arab' slave trade is sometimes called the 'Islamic' slave trade. Bernard Lewis writes that \"polytheists and idolaters were seen primarily as sources of slaves, to be imported into the Islamic world and molded in Islamic ways, and, since they possessed no religion of their own worth the mention, as natural recruits for Islam.\" Patrick Manning states that religion was hardly the point of this slavery. Also, this term suggests comparison between Islamic slave trade and Christian slave trade. Propagators of Islam in Africa often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.\nArab or Islamic slave trade lasted much longer than Atlantic or European slave trade: \"It began in the middle of the seventh century and survives today in Mauritania and Sudan. With the Islamic slave trade, we're talking of 14 centuries rather than four.\" Further, \"whereas the gender ratio of slaves in the Atlantic trade was two males to every female, in the Islamic trade, it was two females to every male,\" according to Ronald Segal\n\nIn the 8th century, Africa was dominated by Arab-Berbers in the north: Islam moved southwards along the Nile and along the desert trails. One supply of slaves was the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia which often exported Nilotic slaves from their western borderland provinces, or from newly conquered or reconquered Muslim provinces. Native Muslim Ethiopian sultanates (rulership) exported slaves as well, such as the sometimes independent sultanate (rulership) of Adal .\n\nFor a long time, until the early 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. Between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly 1 million and quite possibly as many as 1.25 million white, European Christians enslaved by the Muslims of the Barbary Coast of North Africa.\n\nOn the coast of the Indian Ocean too, slave-trading posts were set up by Muslim Arabs. The archipelago of Zanzibar, along the coast of present-day Tanzania, is undoubtedly the most notorious example of these trading colonies. Southeast Africa and the Indian Ocean continued as an important region for the Oriental slave trade up until the 19th century. Livingstone and Stanley were then the first Europeans to penetrate to the interior of the Congo basin and to discover the scale of slavery there. The Arab Tippu Tib extended his influence and made many people slaves. After Europeans had settled in the Gulf of Guinea, the trans-Saharan slave trade became less important. In Zanzibar, slavery was abolished late, in 1897, under Sultan Hamoud bin Mohammed. The rest of Africa had no direct contact with Muslim slave-traders.\n\nWhile slaves were sometimes employed for manual labour during the Arab slave trade, this was usually the exception rather than the norm. The vast majority of labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. The only known exceptions to this general rule was in the plantation economy of 9th-century southern Iraq (which led to the Zanj Revolt), in 9th-century Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia), and in 11th-century Bahrain (during the Karmatian state).\n\nA system of plantation labor, much like that which would emerge in the Americas, developed early on, but with such dire consequences that subsequent engagements were relatively rare and reduced. Moreover, the need for agricultural labor, in an Islamic world with large peasant populations, was nowhere near as acute as in the Americas. Slaves in Islam were mainly directed at the service sector — concubines and cooks, porters and soldiers — with slavery itself primarily a form of consumption rather than a factor of production. The most telling evidence for this is found in the gender ratio; among black slaves traded in Islamic empire across the centuries, there were roughly two females to every male.\nAlmost all of these female slaves had domestic occupations. For some, this also included sexual relations with their masters. This was a lawful motive for their purchase, and the most common one.\n\nMilitary service was also a common role for slaves. Barbarians from the \"martial races\" beyond the frontiers were widely recruited into the imperial armies. These recruits often advanced in the imperial and eventually metropolitan forces, sometimes obtaining high ranks.\n\nIn Classical Arabic terminology, female slaves were generally called \"jawāri\" (, s. \"jāriya\" ). Slave-girls specifically might be called \"imā’\" (, s. \"ama\" ), while female slaves who had been trained as entertainers or courtesans were usually called \"qiyān\" (, IPA /qi'jaːn/; singular \"qayna\", , IPA /'qaina/).\n\nWhen it comes to the rights of women within Islamic society, oftentimes, they were looked to have more freedoms than women from other countries – for example the freedom to divorce – and often saw marriage as a chance to change their social status. They included sometimes highly trained entertainers known as \"qiyan\". In other cases, many atrocities occurred against women who were enslaved.\n\nWomen in the Ottoman Empire were treated very similarly to those in Morocco and the Barbary States. Women were put into a subservient category because of their \"putative physical and moral weaknesses\", which \"rendered them subject to men\" (Zilfi 16). This was mostly because of \"decontextualized scriptural snippets\" from the Quran, which \"played an important role in authorizing women's social marginalization\" (Zilfi 16). Islamic law is primarily based on the Quran. Because of the way it is written, there is \"a general acceptance of women and girls as sexual commodities\" and that female slaves could be freed and married by their masters (Sexual Ethics and Islam… 40). In addition, this interpretation of the Quran was often thought of as a major factor in shaping Muslim thinking on sex and marriage.\n\nWhile the legal rights of Ottoman women were relatively the same, the customs of marriage were slightly different. Marriage was a chance to change your status – \"For slave women, emancipation sealed by marriage could make the difference between impoverished freedom and entitled socioeconomic standing\" (Zilfi 162). There were two main possibilities when it came to slave marriages: they could be married off to another slave or to a free person for a price. However, no matter which happened, a slave is still a slave and that meant that \"any property that they acquired in marriage rebounded to the slave owner\" (Zilfi 162). Slave women could be sold, freed, and then married to their new master as in the case of Sehriban (Zilfi 167), who married a statesman named Ahmed Midhat Pasha. He paid quite an amount of currency for her. This was apparently the way to be as \"harem-reared slave girls were molded into well-bred and indebted replicas of their wealthy and well-placed mistresses\" and, thus, well-trained wives (Zilfi 168).\n\nIn the end, women in slavery (and many times women in general) were seen solely as a way to give pleasure to a man and create new life. Therefore, they were only offered the job of mother and wife (Blunt 92).\n\nSome texts, written solely from European sources, definitely portray Muslim women and society in a completely negative way. While Mulai had only \"four legitimate wives\", he (Mulai) kept a vast harem. He was rumoured to only sleep with virgins (Bekkaoui 13). \"The life of the women was unspeakably monotonous\" (Blunt 92-3). T.P. Hughes wrote \"there is absolutely no limit to the number of slave girls with whom a Muhammadan may cohabit, and it is the consecration of this illimitable indulgence which so popularizes the Muhammadan religion amongst uncivilized nations, and so popularizes slavery in the Muslim religion.\"\n\nChoosing slaves to undergo the grooming process was highly selective in the Moroccan empire. There are many attributes and skills slaves can possess to win the favour and trust of their master. When examining master/slave relationships we are able to understand that slaves with white skin were especially valued in Islamic societies. Additionally, mode of acquisition as well as age when acquired heavily influenced slave value as well as could foster trusting master-slave relationships. Many times slaves acquired as adolescents or even young adults became trusted aides and confidants of their masters. Furthermore, acquiring a slave during adolescence typically lead to opportunities for education and training, as slaves acquired in their adolescent years were at an ideal age to begin military training. In Islamic societies it was normal to begin this process at the age of ten, lasting until the age of fifteen, at which point these young men would be considered ready for military service. \nSlaves with specialised skills were highly valued in Islamic slave societies. Christian slaves were often required to speak and write in Arabic. Having slaves fluent in English and Arabic was a highly valued tool for diplomatic affairs. Bi-lingual slaves like Thomas Pellow used their translating ability for important manners of diplomacy. Pellow himself worked as a translator for the ambassador in Morocco.\n\nIn some cases slaves joined to rebels or even uprose against governors. The most renowned of these rebellions was the Zanj Rebellion.\n\nThe Zanj Revolt took place near the city of Basra, located in southern Iraq over a period of fifteen years (869-883 AD). It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves who were imported from across the Muslim empire and claimed over “tens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq”. The revolt was said to have been led by Ali ibn Muhammad, who claimed to be a descendent of Caliph Ali ibn Abu Talib. Several historians, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Masudi, consider this revolt one of the “most vicious and brutal uprising” out of the many disturbances that plagued the Abbasid central government.\n\nMamluks were slave soldiers who were converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. Over time, they became a powerful military caste, often defeating the Crusaders and, on more than one occasion, they seized power for themselves, for example ruling Egypt in the Mamluk Sultanate from 1250-1517.\n\nIn the Muslim conquests in the 8th century, the armies of the Umayyad commander Muhammad bin Qasim, enslaved tens of thousands of Indian prisoners, including both soldiers and civilians. In the early 11th century Tarikh al-Yamini, the Arab historian Al-Utbi recorded that in 1001 the armies of Mahmud of Ghazna conquered Peshawar and Waihand (capital of Gandhara) after Battle of Peshawar (1001), \"in the midst of the land of Hindustan\", and captured some 100,000 youths. Later, following his twelfth expedition into India in 1018–19, Mahmud is reported to have returned with such a large number of slaves that their value was reduced to only two to ten dirhams each. This unusually low price made, according to Al-Utbi, \"merchants [come] from distant cities to purchase them, so that the countries of Central Asia, Iraq and Khurasan were swelled with them, and the fair and the dark, the rich and the poor, mingled in one common slavery\". Elliot and Dowson refer to \"five hundred thousand slaves, beautiful men and women.\". Later, during the Delhi Sultanate period (1206–1555), references to the abundant availability of low-priced Indian slaves abound. Levi attributes this primarily to the vast human resources of India, compared to its neighbors to the north and west (India's Mughal population being approximately 12 to 20 times that of Turan and Iran at the end of the 16th century).\n\nThe Delhi sultanate obtained thousands of slaves and eunuch servants from the villages of Eastern Bengal (a widespread practice which Mughal emperor Jahangir later tried to stop). Wars, famines, pestilences drove many villagers to sell their children as slaves. The Muslim conquest of Gujarat in Western India had two main objectives. The conquerors demanded and more often forcibly wrested both land owned by Hindus and Hindu women. Enslavement of women invariably led to their conversion to Islam. In battles waged by Muslims against Hindus in Malwa and Deccan plateau, a large number of captives were taken. Muslim soldiers were permitted to retain and enslave POWs as plunder.\n\nThe first Bahmani sultan, Alauddin Bahman Shah is noted to have captured 1,000 singing and dancing girls from Hindu temples after he battled the northern Carnatic chieftains. The later Bahmanis also enslaved civilian women and children in wars; many of them were converted to Islam in captivity.\n\nDuring the rule of Shah Jahan, many peasants were compelled to sell their women and children into slavery to meet the land revenue demand.\n\nSlavery was a legal and important part of the economy of the Ottoman Empire and Ottoman society until the slavery of Caucasians was banned in the early 19th century, although slaves from other groups were allowed. In Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609. Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unfazed into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire. Sexual slavery was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.\n\nA member of the Ottoman slave class, called a \"\" in Turkish, could achieve high status. Black castrated slaves, were tasked to guard the imperial harems, while white castrated slaves filled administrative functions. Janissaries were the elite soldiers of the imperial armies collected in childhood as a \"blood tax\", while galley slaves captured in slave raids or as prisoners of war, manned the imperial vessels. Slaves were actually often at the forefront of Ottoman politics. The majority of officials in the Ottoman government were bought slaves, raised free, and integral to the success of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th century into the 19th. Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the Sultan himself owned by far the largest amount. By raising and specially training slaves as officials in palace schools such as Enderun, the Ottomans created administrators with intricate knowledge of government and fanatic loyalty.\n\nOttomans practiced \"devşirme\", a sort of \"blood tax\" or \"child collection\", young Christian boys from Eastern Europe and Anatolia were taken from their homes and families, brought up as Muslims, and enlisted into the most famous branch of the \"Kapıkulu\", the Janissaries, a special soldier class of the Ottoman army that became a decisive faction in the Ottoman invasions of Europe. Most of the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators, and \"de facto\" rulers of the Empire, such as Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha and Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, were recruited in this way.\n\nIn the East Indies, slavery was common until the end of the 19th century. The slave trade was centered on the Muslim Sultanates in the Sulu Sea: the Sultanate of Sulu, the Sultanate of Maguindanao, and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao (the modern Moro people). The economies of these sultanates relied heavily on the slave trade. \n\nIt is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by Iranun and Banguingui slavers. These were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the Malacca Strait, Java, the southern coast of China and the islands beyond the Makassar Strait. Most of the slaves were Tagalogs, Visayans, and \"Malays\" (including Bugis, Mandarese, Iban, and Makassar). There were also occasional European and Chinese captives who were usually ransomed off through Tausug intermediaries of the Sulu Sultanate. \n\nThe scale was so massive that the word for \"pirate\" in Malay became \"Lanun\", an exonym of the Iranun people. Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as galley slaves on the \"lanong\" and \"garay\" warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in Jolo usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug \"datu\" from the Sultanate of Sulu who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (\"renegados\"). \n\nThe economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui slave markets. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago. \n\nChattel slaves (known as \"banyaga\", \"bisaya\", \"ipun\", or \"ammas\") were distinguished from the traditional debt bondsmen (the \"kiapangdilihan\", known as \"alipin\" elsewhere in the Philippines). The bondsmen were natives enslaved to pay for debt or crime. They were slaves only in terms of their temporary service requirement to their master, but retained most of the rights of the freemen, including protection from physical harm and the fact that they can not be sold. The \"banyaga\" on the other hand had little to no rights. \n\nMost slaves were treated like serfs and servants. Educated and skilled slaves were largely treated well. Since most of the aristocratic classes in Sulu were illiterate, they were often dependent on the educated \"banyaga\" as scribes and interpreters. Slaves part of the labor force were often given their own houses and lived in small communities with slaves of similar ethnic and religious backgrounds. However harsh punishment and abuse was not uncommon despite Islamic laws, especially for slave laborers and slaves who attempt to escape. \n\nSpanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in Manila, Cavite, Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, and Iligan. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the Visayas Islands, including the construction of war \"barangayanes\" (\"balangay\") that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, \"Lanong\" warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster \"garay\" warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired steam gunboats (\"vapor\"), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.\n\nThe slave raids on merchant ships and coastal settlements disrupted traditional trade in goods in the Sulu Sea. While this was temporarily offset by the economic prosperity brought by the slave trade, the decline of slavery in the mid-19th century also led to the economic decline of the Sultanates of Brunei, Sulu, and Maguindanao. This eventually led to the collapse of the latter two states and contributed to the widespread poverty of the Moro region in the Philippines today. By the 1850s, most slaves were local-born from slave parents as the raiding became more difficult. By the end of the 19th century and the conquest of the Sultanates by the Spanish and the Americans, the slave population were largely integrated into the native population as citizens under the Philippine government.\n\nThe Sultanate of Gowa of the Bugis people also became involved in the Sulu slave trade. They purchased slaves (as well as opium and Bengali cloth) from the Sulu Sea sultanates then sold them in the slave markets in the rest of Southeast Asia. Several hundred slaves (mostly Christian Filipinos) were sold by the Bugis annually in Batavia, Malacca, Bantam, Chirebon, Banjarmasin, and Palembang by the Bugis. The slaves were usually sold to Dutch and Chinese families as servants, sailors, laborers, and concubines. The sale of Christian Filipinos (who were Spanish subjects) in Dutch-controlled cities led to formal protests by the Spanish Empire to the Netherlands and its prohibition in 1762 by the Dutch, but it had little effect due to lax or absent enforcement. The Bugis slave trade was only stopped in the 1860s when the Spanish navy from Manila started patrolling Sulu waters to intercept Bugis slave ships and rescue Filipino captives. Also contributing to the decline was the hostility of the Sama-Bajau raiders in Tawi-Tawi who broke off their allegiance to the Sultanate of Sulu in the mid-1800s and started attacking ships trading with the Tausug ports. \n\nIn Singapore as late as 1891, there was a regular trade in Chinese slaves by Muslim slaveowners, with girls and women sold for concubinage.\n\nThe strong abolitionist movement in the 19th century in England and later in other Western countries influenced slavery in Muslim lands. Though the \"position of the domestic slave in Muslim society was in most respects better than in either classical antiquity or the nineteenth-century Americas\", due to regulation by Sharia law, the enlightened incentives and opportunities for slaves to be emancipated meant there was a strong market for new slaves and thus strong incentive to enslave and sell human beings. Appalling loss of life and hardships often resulted from the processes of acquisition and transportation of slaves to Muslim lands and this drew the attention of European opponents of slavery. The continuing pressure from European countries eventually overcame the strong resistance of religious conservatives who were holding that forbidding what God permits is just as great an offence as to permit what God forbids. Slavery, in their eyes, was \"authorized and regulated by the holy law\". Even masters persuaded of their own piety and benevolence sexually exploited their concubines, without a thought of whether this constituted a violation of their humanity. There were also many pious Muslims who refused to have slaves and persuaded others to do so. Eventually, the Ottoman Empire's orders against the traffic of slaves were issued and put into effect.\n\nAccording to Brockopp, in the 19th century, \"Some authorities made blanket pronouncements against slavery, arguing that it violated the Qurʾānic ideals of equality and freedom. The great slave markets of Cairo were closed down at the end of the nineteenth century and even conservative Qurʾān interpreters continue to regard slavery as opposed to Islamic principles of justice and equality.\"\n\nSlavery in the forms of carpetweavers, sugarcane cutters, camel jockeys, sex slaves, and even chattel exists even today in some Muslim countries (though some have questioned the use of the term slavery as an accurate description).\nAccording to a March 1886 article in \"The New York Times\", the Ottoman Empire allowed a slave trade in girls to thrive during the late 1800s, while publicly denying it. Girl sexual slaves sold in the Ottoman Empire were mainly of three ethnic groups: Circassian, Syrian, and Nubian. Circassian girls were described by the American journalist as fair and light skinned. They were frequently sent by Circassian leaders as gifts to the Ottomans. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 Turkish lira and the most popular with the Turks. The next most popular slaves were Syrian girls, with \"dark eyes and hair\", and light brown skin. Their price could reach to thirty lira. They were described by the American journalist as having \"good figures when young\". Throughout coastal regions in Anatolia, Syrian girls were sold. The \"New York Times\" journalist stated Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 lira.\n\nMurray Gordon said that, unlike Western societies which developed anti-slavery movements, no such organizations developed in Muslim societies. In Muslim politics, the state interpreted Islamic law. This then extended legitimacy to the traffic in slaves.\n\nWriting about the Arabia he visited in 1862, the English traveler W. G. Palgrave met large numbers of black slaves. The effects of slave concubinage were apparent in the number of persons of mixed race and in the emancipation of slaves he found to be common. Charles Doughty, writing about 25 years later, made similar reports.\nAccording to British explorer (and abolitionist) Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862 six decades after the British had declared slave trade illegal, slave trade was the industry \"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\". From Khartoum slave raiders attacked African villages to the south, looting and destroying so that \"surviving inhabitants would be force to collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages,\" and taking back captured women and young adults to sell in slave markets.\n\nAt Istanbul, the sale of black and Circassian women was conducted openly until the granting of the Constitution in 1908.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, slavery gradually became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, due to a combination of pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France, internal pressure from Islamic abolitionist movements, and economic pressures.\n\nBy the Treaty of Jeddah, May 1927 (art.7), concluded between the British Government and Ibn Sa'ud (King of Nejd and the Hijaz) it was agreed to suppress the slave trade in Saudi Arabia. Then by a decree issued in 1936 the importation of slaves into Saudi Arabia was prohibited unless it could be proved that they were slaves at that date.\n\nIn 1953, sheikhs from Qatar attending the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom included slaves in their retinues, and they did so again on another visit five years later.\n\nIn 1962 that all slavery practice or trafficking in Saudi Arabia was prohibited.\n\nBy 1969 it could be observed that most Muslim states had abolished slavery although it existed in the deserts of Iraq bordering Arabia and it still flourished in Saudi Arabia, the Yemen and Oman. Slavery was not formally abolished in Yemen and Oman until the following year. The last nation to formally enact the abolition of slavery practice and slave trafficking was the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in 1981.\n\nThe issue of slavery in the Islamic world in modern times is controversial. Critics argue there is hard evidence of its existence and destructive effects. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, slavery in central Islamic lands has been \"virtually extinct\" since the mid-20th century, though there are reports indicating that it is still practiced in some areas of Sudan and Somalia as a result of warfare.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, prior to the \"reopening\" of slavery by Salafi scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly supporting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith) to bemoan the \"dogged refusal of Mawlana Mawdudi to give up on slavery\" and the notable \"evasions and silences of Muhammad Qutb\".\n\nMuhammad Qutb, brother and promoter of the famous Sayyid Qutb, vigorously defended Islamic slavery from Western criticism, telling his audience that \"Islam gave spiritual enfranchisement to slaves\" and \"in the early period of Islam the slave was exalted to such a noble state of humanity as was never before witnessed in any other part of the world.\" He contrasted the adultery, prostitution, and (what he called) \"that most odious form of animalism\" casual sex, found in Europe, with (what he called) \"that clean and spiritual bond that ties a maid [i.e. slave girl] to her master in Islam.\"\n\n\nIn recent years, according to some scholars, there has been a \"reopening\" of the issue of slavery by some conservative Salafi Islamic scholars after its \"closing\" earlier in the 20th century when Muslim countries banned slavery.\n\nIn 2003, Shaykh Saleh Al-Fawzan, a member of Saudi Arabia’s highest religious body, the Senior Council of Clerics, issued a fatwa claiming\n“Slavery is a part of Islam. Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long there is Islam.”\nMuslim scholars who said otherwise were \"infidels\".\n\nWhile Saleh Al-Fawzan's fatwa does not repeal Saudi laws against slavery, the fatwa carries weight among many Salafi Muslims. According to reformist jurist and author Khaled Abou El Fadl, it \"is particularly disturbing and dangerous because it effectively legitimates the trafficking in and sexual exploitation of so-called domestic workers in the Gulf region and especially Saudi Arabia.\" Organized criminal gangs smuggle children into Saudi Arabia where they are enslaved, sometimes mutilated, and forced to work as beggars. When caught, the children are deported as illegal aliens.\n\nIn Mauritania slavery was abolished in the country's first constitution of 1961 after independence, and abolished yet again, by presidential decree, in July 1980. The \"catch\" of these abolitions was that slave \"ownership\" was not abolished. The edict \"recognized the rights of owners by stipulating that they should be compensated for their loss of property\". No financial payment was provided by the state, so that the abolition amounted to \"little more than propaganda for foreign consumption\". Religious authorities within Mauritania assailed abolition. One leader, El Hassan Ould Benyamine, imam of a mosque in Tayarat attacked it as \"not only illegal because it is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran. The abolition also amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their goods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.` \n\nIn 1994-5 a Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights documented the physically and emotionally abuse of captives by the Sudanese Army and allied militia and army. The captives were \"sold as slaves or forced to work under conditions amounting to slavery\". The Sudanese government responded with \"fury\", accusing the author, Gaspar Biro of \"harboring anti-Islam and Anti-Arab sentiments\". In 1999 the UN Commission sent another Special Rapporteur who \"also produced a detailed examination of the question of slavery incriminating the government of Sudan.\" At least in the 1980s, slavery in Sudan was developed enough for slaves to have a market price—the price of a slave boy fluctuating between $90 and $10 in 1987 and 1988.\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department as of 2005:\nSaudi Arabia is a destination for men and women from South and East Asia and East Africa trafficked for the purpose of labor exploitation, and for children from Yemen, Afghanistan, and Africa trafficking for forced begging. Hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers from India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya migrate voluntarily to Saudi Arabia; some fall into conditions of involuntary servitude, suffering from physical and sexual abuse, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, the withholding of travel documents, restrictions on their freedom of movement and non-consensual contract alterations.\n\nThe Government of Saudi Arabia does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.\n\nLibya is a major exit point for African migrants heading to Europe. International Organization for Migration (IOM) published a report in April 2017 showing that many of the migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa heading to Europe are sold as slaves after being detained by people smugglers or militia groups. African countries south of Libya were targeted for slave trading and transferred to Libyan slave markets instead. According to the victims, the price is higher for migrants with skills like painting and tiling. Slaves are often ransomed to their families and in the meantime until ransom can be paid tortured, forced to work, sometimes to death and eventually executed or left to starve if they can't pay for too long. Women are often raped and used as sex slaves and sold to brothels and private Libyan clients. Many child migrants also suffer from abuse and child rape in Libya.\n\nIn November 2017, hundreds of African migrants were being forced into slavery by human smugglers who were themselves facilitating their arrival in the country. Most of the migrants are from Nigeria, Senegal and Gambia. They however end up in cramped warehouses due to the crackdown by the Libyan Coast Guard, where they are held until they are ransomed or are sold for labor. Libyan authorities of the Government of National Accord announced that they had opened up an investigation into the auctions. A human trafficker told Al-Jazeera that hundreds of the migrants are bought and sold across the country every week. Dozens of African migrants headed for a new life in Europe in 2018 said they were sold for labor and trapped in slavery in Algeria.\n\nIn 2014, Islamic terrorist groups in the Middle East (ISIS also known as Islamic State) and Northern Nigeria (Boko Haram) have not only justified the taking of slaves in war but actually enslaved women and girls.\nAbubakar Shekau, the leader of the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram said in an interview, \"I shall capture people and make them slaves\". In the digital magazine \"Dabiq\", ISIS claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women whom they consider to be from a heretical sect. ISIS claimed that the Yazidi are idol worshipers and their enslavement part of the old shariah practice of spoils of war. \"The Economist\" reports that ISIS has taken \"as many as 2,000 women and children\" captive, selling and distributing them as sexual slaves. ISIS appealed to apocalyptic beliefs and \"claimed justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world.\" \n\nIn response to Boko Haram's Quranic justification for kidnapping and enslaving people and ISIS's religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women, 126 Islamic scholars from around the Muslim world signed an open letter in late September 2014 to the Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rejecting his group's interpretations of the Qur'an and hadith to justify its actions. The letter accuses the group of instigating fitna — sedition — by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Arabic-speaking Shias are known as Iraqiyyuns, and Arabic-speaking Sunnis are known as Jaziran Arabs. Iraq is home to many religious cities important for both Shia and Sunni Muslims. Baghdad was a hub of Islamic learning and scholarship for centuries and served as the capital of the Abassids. Baghdad also is home to two prominent Shia Imams in what is known as Kadhimiya, Iraq. The city of Karbala has substantial prominence in Shia Islam as a result of the Battle of Karbala, fought in October 10, 680. Similarly, Najaf is renowned as the site of the tomb of Alī ibn Abī Tālib (also known as \"Imām Alī\"), whom the Shia consider to be the righteous caliph and first imām. The city is now a great center of pilgrimage from throughout the Shi'a Islamic world and it is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. The city of Kufa was home to the famed scholar Abu Hanifah, whose school of thought is followed by many Sunni Muslims internationally. Kufa was also the capital of the Rashidun Caliphate during the time of Ali. Likewise, Samarra is also home to the al-Askari Mosque, containing the mausoleums of the Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, the tenth and eleventh Shia Imams respectively, as well as the maqam (or \"point\") of Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is the twelfth and final Imam of the Shia Madhhab. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for Ja'farī Shia Muslims. In addition, some female relatives of Muhammad are buried in Samarra, making the city one of the most significant sites of worship for Shia Muslims and a venerated location for Sunni Muslims. Basra Iraq is also a prominent Shia area due to its significant role during the First Fitna, where Ali defeated Aisha during the Battle of the Camel.\n\nSmaller sects of Islam exist in the country, such as the small Shaykhist community concentrated in Basra and Karbala.\n\nThe Muslim population of Iraq is approximately Shia 65% and Sunni 35%. Iraqi Kurds are mostly Sunni, with about 2% being Shi'a Faili Kurds.

Since 1990 he has directed the Science and Human Dimension Project at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he is also, since 2009, Founder and Director of the Rustat Conferences. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (University of Leicester) in 2011. He was nominated for the PEN/Ackerley Prize for best UK memoir 2007 (\"Seminary Boy\") and shortlisted Specialist Journalist of the Year (science, medicine in \"Sunday Times Magazine\"), British Press Awards 2006. He won the Scientific and Medical Network Book of the Year Award for \"Hitler's Scientists\", 2005; and received the Independent Television Authority-Tablet Award for contributions to religious journalism (1994). In 1982 he won the Gold Dagger Award Non-Fiction (1982) for \"Earth to Earth\". He is best known for his investigative journalism; memoir; and his work in public understanding of science. In addition to his books on the relationship between science, ethics and the humanities, he has written widely on the Catholic Church and the modern papacy.\n\nJohn Cornwell was born in East Ham, London, the son of Sidney Arthur Cornwell and Kathleen Egan Cornwell.\n\nRaised as a Roman Catholic, Cornwell entered the junior seminary, Cotton College, in 1953 intending to become a priest. He later wrote a memoir of his five years at Cotton. He continued to the senior seminary, Oscott College, Sutton Coldfield, in 1958.\n\nCornwell studied English Language and Literature at St Benet's Hall, Oxford and was tutored by Jonathan Wordsworth at Exeter College. He graduated in 1964, and went on to Christ's College, Cambridge as a graduate student.\n\nAfter Cambridge, Cornwell taught in East London schools, before becoming a teaching fellow in English and philosophy at McMaster University, Ontario. From 1970 to 1976 he worked as a freelance journalist, mainly for The Guardian and \"The Observer\" Magazine, with periods in Italy and Latin America as a Foreign Correspondent. In 1973 he reported from Buenos Aires, and in 1975 from Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires. From 1976 to 1988 he was on the staff at \"The Observer\", serving on the Foreign desk and later as Editor and Manager of \"The Observer\" Foreign News Service, which he took from hard copy to high speed wire delivery worldwide. In 1982 he was appointed New Media Publisher, responsible for developing seven parallel media businesses, including creation of UK’s first interactive electronic newspaper with Prestel, joint venture book publishing, and educational resources. He was \"The Observer\"’s delegate at the International Press Institute (1978-1988); investigator and raporteur on the 20th Century Fund Task Force convened in New York and Oxford in 1978-79 on the tensions between Western free-enterprise media and government media organisations: findings and analysis published in his Free and Balanced Flow (1979).\n\nHis first two books were novels: \"The Spoiled Priest\", and \"Seven Other Demons\". Two decades later he published a third novel, \"Strange Gods\". In 1973 he published a critical biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, \"Coleridge, Poet and Revolutionary, 1772–1804\".\n\nIn 1982 he published \"Earth to Earth\", the story of a farming family tragedy at Winkleigh in Devon for which he won the non-fiction Gold Dagger Award.\n\nHis 1989 book \"A Thief in the Night\" investigated the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I, which was surrounded by conspiracy theories. Though Cornwell sharply criticised Vatican prelates, he concluded that the Pope was not murdered but died of a pulmonary embolism, possibly brought on by overwork and neglect.\n\nIn 1999, Cornwell published \"Hitler's Pope\", in which he accuses Pope Pius XII of assisting in the legitimisation of the Nazi regime in Germany through the pursuit of a Reichskonkordat in 1933 and of remaining silent, like the Allies, after information about the Holocaust was released to the public in late 1942 and early 1943.\n\nOwen Chadwick praised the book's scholarly approach and the abundance of new information Cornwell had managed to unearth.\n\nIn 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII \"had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany ... But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions\". He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's \"scope for action was severely limited\", but that \"[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did.\"\n\nIn a variety of broadcasts and subsequent print commentary Cornwell has continued to insist that Pacelli's principal failure (as Cardinal Secretary of State), through the Reichsconcordat (1933), was to act as a fellow traveller, taking benefits from Hitler on behalf of Pius XI and the Catholic Church while patently distancing himself from Nazi ideology - the effect of which was to scandalise youth, demoralise opposition, and give Hitler credit in the eyes of the world.\n\nIn 2004, Cornwell followed up \"Hitler's Pope\" with \"Hitler's Scientists\".\n\nIn 2004, Cornwell also published \"A Pontiff in Winter\", a work critical of Pope John Paul II. Reviews of the book were often fiercely divided. James Carroll in \"The Washington Post\" said the book \"dissects the record of John Paul II's pontificate with an informed, dispassionate and fully convincing authority\". Writing in \"the Guardian\", Stephen Bates said: \"John Cornwell has produced a devastating report. Catholics should read it, if not to change their views – though perhaps it should – then at least to inform them\".\n\nPublished in 2010 by Continuum, this biography of Cardinal John Henry Newman coincided with renewed interest in the 19th century theologian and religious leader as a result of his beatification during the Papal visit by Pope Benedict XVI to England and Scotland. Philosopher Anthony Kenny in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" wrote that \"\"Newman's Unquiet Grave\" is a substantial achievement ... John Cornwell has taken on the task of writing a biography of Newman to make his life intelligible to the largely secular public which in a few weeks will watch on television the ceremony of his beatification. He has followed a \"via media\" between the hagiography of Meriol Trevor and the mockery of Lytton Strachey, and he has produced a Life which is readable, sympathetic and judicious ... Altogether, he has succeeded in building up a vivid picture of Newman's personality.\"\n\nAs Research Fellow (elected 1990, Fellow Commoner 1996) and Director of the \"Science and Human Dimension Project\" at Jesus College, Cambridge, Cornwell has brought together many scientists, philosophers, ethicists, authors and journalists to debate and discuss a range of topics. His books in the field of public understanding of science include \"Nature's Imagination\", \"Consciousness and Human Identity\", and \"Explanations\", all published by Oxford University Press. His journalism in this field has been published in a variety of outlets including \"Financial Times\", \"Sunday Times Magazine\", \"The Observer\", \"New Statesman\", \"New Scientist\", \"Nature\", \"Prospect\", \"Times Literary Supplement\", \"The Tablet\", \"Brain\", \"New Scientist\", \"The Guardian\", and \"The Times\". Broadcast contributions to many BBC programmes, especially on culture, science and religion, including \"Hard Talk\", \"Choice\", \"Start the Week,\" \"The Moral Maze\" (e.g. witness on genetic determinism debate), \"Today\" (e.g. debate with Richard Dawkins); \"Beyond Belief\" (on John Henry Newman’s Idea of a University), \"Thought for the Day\" (on Darwin’s birthday), \"Sunday\", and various programmes in the BBC’s World Service.\n\nIn 2009, he was appointed founding Director of the Rustat Conferences, also based at Jesus College, Cambridge. This project brings together academics with those from politics, business, the media and education to discuss the vital issues of the day in a roundtable format. The first two meetings in 2009 discussed the global Economic Crisis, and the Future of Democracy. The third Rustat Conferences meeting addressed Infrastructure and the Future of Society – infrastructure for energy security, cities of the future, and water.\n\n\n\n"}

His formative experiences as Christian missionary and educator in early 20th century China shaped his life's work. Although he did not learn the Chinese language, he became known for his magisterial scholarly surveys of the history of world Christianity, the history of China, and of American relations with East Asia.\n\nLatourette was born in Oregon City, Oregon, the son of DeWitt Clinton Latourette and Ella (Scott) Latourette. His mother and father both attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, where they graduated in 1878. DeWitt Clinton Latourette was a lawyer in Oregon City.\n\nIn 1904, Latourette was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree from Linfield College in Oregon. He continued his education in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale, earning a BA in 1906, an MA in 1907 and PhD in 1909.\n\nFrom 1909 through 1910, Latourette served as a traveling secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. In 1910, he joined the faculty of Yale-in China's Yali School at Changsha in Hunan Province. He began to study the Chinese language, but in the summer of 1911 he contracted a severe case of amoeibic dysentery and was forced to return to the United States.\n\nAs he began his recovery, Latourette joined the faculty at Reed College in Portland, Oregon; and from 1914 through 1916, he was a professor of history at Reed. In 1916, he accepted a position at Denison University, an institution with Baptist affiliations, in Granville, Ohio. His time at Denison lasted from 1916 through 1921. In 1918, while at Denison, Latourette was ordained as a Baptist minister.\n\nLatourette joined the faculty of the Yale University Divinity School in 1921. Latourette lived in a college dormitory suite during his time at Yale. He welcomed student groups to meet in the living room and was known as \"Uncle Ken.\" He accepted appointment as the D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity (1921–49), and he was later made the Sterling Professor of Missions and Oriental History (1949–53). In 1938, he was named Chairman of the Department of Religion at Yale. He took on greater responsibilities in 1946 as Director of Graduate Studies at the Yale Divinity School. From his retirement in 1953 until his death in 1968, he was Sterling Professor Emeritus at the Divinity School.\n\nLatourette was killed at age 84 when an automobile accidentally hit him in front of his family home in Oregon City, Oregon.\n\nLatourette served as president of the American Historical Association, the Association for Asian Studies, the American Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and the Japan International Christian University Foundation.\n\nHe was a leader in the ecumenical movement, and he held leadership positions in the American Baptist Missionary Union, the International Board of the Y.M.C.A., the United Board for Christian Colleges in China and the World Council of Churches.\n\nThroughout his life he remained active in the Yale-in-China Association.\n\nAt the Yale Divinity School, the \"Latourette Initiative\" is a proactive program to preserve and provide access to the documentation of world Christianity. It provides funding for the microfilming of published and archival resources documenting the history of Christian missions and Christian life.\n\nLatourette was awarded honorary doctorates from seventeen universities in five countries.\n\nIn 1938 he received the Order of Jade from the Government of China.\nHe is also honored at the campus of William Carey International University in Pasadena, California. The institution's main library is called the Latourette Library.\n\nLinfield College named a residence hall in his honor in 1946.\n\nLatourette was the author of over 80 books on Christianity, Oriental history and customs, and theological subjects.\n\nHe also wrote and spoke out about issues of his time, as for example, when he warned his fellow Americans in 1943 about the unwanted consequences of revenge after Japan should eventually lose the war they started with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In addition, Latourette later wrote extensively on China.\n\nThe single work for which Latourette is most remembered is the seven-volume \"\"A History of the Expansion of Christianity\".\" Latourette noted within Volume 4 that only 5% of Americans in 1790 had formal ties to churches or synagogues.\n\nLatourette's papers are archived in the Divinity Library Special Collections of the Yale University Library.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33590179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33590179", "title": "Lhasa Newar", "text": "Lhasa Newar\n\nLhasa Newar (alternate name: Lhasa Newah) () refers to the expatriate Newar traders and artisans who traveled between the Kathmandu Valley and Tibet from centuries ago. The Nepalese merchants conducted trade between Nepal, Tibet and Bengal, India over the Silk Road, and acted as a bridge for economic and cultural exchanges between South Asia and Central Asia.\n\nAlong with the merchants, there were colonies of artisans in various parts of Tibet who were engaged in creating Buddhist art. They were major players in the exchange of art styles across the Himalaya.\n\nThe thousand-year-old Lhasa Newar tradition came to an end after the caravan route linking India and Tibet through Sikkim was shut down by the Sino-Indian War in 1962. Subsequently, the merchants and craftsmen based in Tibet closed up shop and returned home to Nepal for the last time.\n\nAccording to folklore, Singha Sartha Aju was the first merchant to travel to Tibet. The history of the Lhasa Newars officially dates from the seventh century with the marriage of Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti with Tibetan King Songtsän Gampo. The traders and artisans who accompanied Bhrikuti to Lhasa as part of her retinue established commercial and cultural ties between Nepal and Tibet.\n\nIn the 1640s, a treaty was negotiated under which Newar merchants were allowed to establish 32 business houses in Lhasa. It was also agreed that Nepal would mint coins for Tibet. By this time, the number of traders had risen considerably. Eighteenth-century traveller Ippolito Desideri noted that merchants of Nepal were \"numerous\" in Lhasá.\n\nThe Newars were also organized into \"pala\" () societies which arranged the celebration of festivals and provided a place for get-togethers. The merchants celebrated Mohani and other feasts like they did in Kathmandu. There were 10 \"palas\" originally in Lhasa, and seven remained active until recent times—Chyatangya, Chhusingsyar, Ghorasyar, Jhwala, Lhakam, Kun and Tarunsyar. The Newars in Shigatse and other places in Tibet had their own \"palas\". Returning merchants and craftsmen were called \"Lhasa Newars\". Most of them were Buddhist Newars like the Uray, Bajracharya, Shakya and Dhakhwa. There were also many Shresthas and Maharjans among them.\n\nNewar traders exported finished products from Nepal and India to Tibet and brought back goods from Tibet and other parts of Central Asia. Metal utensils, sacred statues and rice from Nepal, and textiles and other factory products from India were the main exports to Tibet. The Lhasa Newars brought back gold dust, wool, musk pods, pelts and yak tails which were forwarded to Kolkata.\n\nMule, donkey and yak caravans transported the trade goods over the Himalaya and across the Tibetan Plateau. In Nepal, porters carried the loads over the mountains on their backs.\n\nThe trade route connecting India and Tibet goes over the Himalaya. The Lhasa Newars used the Gyirong (Kyirong, Nepali: , ) and \"Kuti\" (Nepali: ) (Nyalam Tong La) passes to the north of Kathmandu to travel to Lhasa. From the 1930s, a new caravan route over the lower Nathu La and Jelep La passes on the border between Sikkim and Tibet became more popular. These passes were approached through Gangtok in Sikkim and Kalimpong in West Bengal, India.\n\nThe Lhasa Newars lived in Lhasa, Shigatse and Gyantse in Tibet and in Kolkata and Kalimpong in India for years at a time. Lhasa, as a center on the Silk Road, attracted merchant caravans from across Central Asia with whom the Lhasa Newars engaged in trade. A few business houses also maintained shops in Leh, Ladakh which lies on the caravan route to Kashgar in Chinese Central Asia. Kolkata was a center of wholesale trade.\n\nLhasa Newar artisans created statues, painted paubhas and frescoes and built temples in Tibet and other parts of Central Asia, and were instrumental in the spread and development of Buddhist art throughout the region. The Jokhang Temple in Lhasa and the Kumbum Stupa in Gyantse are examples of their artistic legacy in Tibet. The White Dagoba in Beijing, China, built by Arniko in the 13th century, is another specimen of the artistry of the Lhasa Newars.\n\nNewar artists were the most sought after among the foreign artists living in Tibet. French missionary traveller Évariste Régis Huc has written that it is they who construct for the Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist all the inclemencies of the seasons and always retain a marvellous freshness and glitter. They are so skilful at this class of work that they are sent to the very interior of Tartary to decorate the Lamaseries.\n\nNewar artists gained importance after the destruction of Indian Buddhism in 1203 as they were the only remaining experts in traditional Buddhist art. Tibetan artists thus turned to them for inspiration and learned the Newar style, or Beri as it is now known. The style prevailed for more than four centuries, and reached its peak from 1360-1460 when it was adopted as Tibet's universal painting style.\n\nThe period from the 14th to the 16th centuries is considered a golden age of Nepalese art. During this time, Newar artists travelled widely and left their mark on the artistic styles of Tibet, Bhutan, China and Mongolia.\n\nLhasa Newars have been the subject of ballads, epic poetry and novels in Nepal Bhasa and other languages, mostly on the theme of loneliness and couples forced to endure long periods of separation.\n\n\n\n"}

According to local folklore the story is based on events that took place during the reign of King Rama IV.\n\nThe story is about a beautiful young woman named Nak, who lived on the banks of the Phra Khanong Canal, and her undying love for her husband, Mak.\n\nWith Nak pregnant, Mak is conscripted and sent to war (in some versions of the story the war is against the Shan tribe, while others are not specific), where he is seriously wounded. While he is being nursed back to health in central Bangkok, Nak and their child both die during a difficult childbirth. When Mak returns home, however, he finds his loving wife and child waiting for him. Neighbors who try to warn him that he is living with a ghost are all killed.\n\nOne day, as Nak is preparing \"nam phrik\", she drops a lime off the porch. In her haste to retrieve it, she stretches her arm to pick it up from the ground below. Mak sees it and at last realizes his wife is a ghost. Terrified, he tries to find a way to flee without alarming her. \n\nThat night, Mak says he has to go downstairs to urinate. He then runs away into the night.\n\nDiscovering her husband has fled, Nak pursues him. Mak sees her and conceals himself behind a \"Blumea balsamifera\" (; pronounced \"Nat\") bush. According to folklore, ghosts are afraid of the sticky \"Blumea\" leaves. Mak then runs to Wat Mahabut temple, which a ghost cannot enter, as it is holy ground. \n\nIn her grief, Nak terrorizes the people of Phra Khanong, furious at them for causing Mak to leave her. However, Nak's ghost is captured by a powerful exorcist. Confining her in an earthen jar, he throws it into the canal.\n\nThere are differing versions of the rest of the story. In one, an old couple new to Phra Khanong finds the jar while fishing; in another two fishermen dredge up the jar. Nak is freed when they opened it.\n\nNak is conquered again by the venerable monk Somdet Phra Phutthachan (To Phrommarangsi). The learned monk confines her spirit in the bone of her forehead and binds it in his waistband. Legend says the waistband is currently in the possession of the royal family. Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, also claimed to have had the relic. In an alternative version, the monk assured Nak that in a future life she would be reunited with her beloved husband, and thus she voluntarily departed for the afterlife.\n\nA shrine dedicated to Mae Nak is at Wat Mahabut. In 1997, the shrine was relocated to the nearby Suan Luang District of modern Bangkok.\n\nAnek Nawikamul, a Thai historian, researched the story and found an article in the \"Siam Praphet\" newspaper written by K.S.R. Kularb, dated 10 March 10 1899. Kularb claimed the story of Mae Nak was based on the life of Amdaeng Nak (อำแดงนาก, 'Mrs Nak'), daughter of a Tambon Phra Khanong leader named Khun Si. Amdaeng Nak died while she was pregnant. Her son, worried that his father might remarry and his inheritance shared with his step-mother, invented the ghost story. He dressed in women's clothing and threw rocks at passing boats to make people think Nak's ghost had done it. Kularb also suggested that Nak's husband was named \"Chum\", not Mak. No one knows how true this is, or even it was the same Nak, as it does not agree with the traditional tale.\n\nThe shrine of Mae Nak stands next to Klong Phra Khanong, at Wat Mahabut, a large temple on Soi 77 off Sukhumvit Road (On Nut Road). The shrine is a low building under large trees with a roof that encompasses the tree trunks. The main shrine has several minor shrines around it.\n\nA statue of Mae Nak and her infant form the centerpiece of the shrine. Devotees often make offerings, accompanied by a request for help, generally by women seeking easy childbirth or for their husband to be exempted from military conscription.. Offerings are usually lengths of colored cloth, wrapped around the trunk of the Bo tree. Other offerings include fruit, lotuses, and incense sticks. \n\nToys for her child and portraits of the ghost are displayed in the shrine's inner sanctum. A collection of fine dresses offered to her are displayed behind her statue. \n\nOfferings are also made at Phra Khanong Canal, where fish purchased live at markets are brought in buckets to the edge of the canal and freed. Stalls at the shrine sell toys, fish, lotus buds, incense sticks, and garlands for those who wish to make an offering.\n\nMae Nak's story has enjoyed sustained popularity because her undying devotion to her husband inspires people of all ages. Prince Damrong, a son of King Mongkut, revealed that when he was a child, he kept asking Wat Phra Kaeo visitors who was the most popular person in their opinion, and most people answered \"Mae Nak\".\n\nThe story of Mae Nak Phra Khanong is also the subject of many films, television series, and printed media. Among these are:\n\n\nRepresentations of Mae Nak, sometimes humorous, are very common in Thai comic books. and animated cartoons.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7904002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7904002", "title": "Nathan Adler", "text": "Nathan Adler\n\nNathan Adler (1741–1800) was a German kabbalist born in Frankfurt, December 16, 1741. As a precocious child he won the admiration of Chaim Joseph David Azulai (Chida), who, in 1752, came to Frankfurt to solicit contributions for the poor of the Jewish communities in Eretz Yisrael. Adler attended the rabbinical school of Jacob Joshua, author of \"Pene Yehoshua\", who was at that time rabbi at Frankfurt, but his principal teacher was David Tevele Schiff, afterward chief rabbi of the United Kingdom. In 1761 he established a yeshivah himself, in which several prominent rabbis received their early teachings, notable among whom were Abraham Auerbach, Abraham Bing, rabbi in Würzburg, Sekl Loeb Wormser, and especially Moses Sofer (Schreiber), rabbi in Presburg.\n\nNathan Adler devoted himself to the study of the Kabbala, and adopted the liturgical system of Isaac Luria, assembling about himself a select community of kabbalistic adepts. He was one of the first Ashkenazim to adopt the Sephardi pronunciation of Hebrew, and gave hospitality to a Sephardi scholar for several months to ensure that he learnt that pronunciation accurately. He prayed according to the Halebi ritual, pronounced the priestly blessing every day, and in other ways approached the school of the Hasidim, who had at that time provoked the strongest censures on the part of the Talmudists of the old school. His followers claimed that he had performed miracles (Moses Sofer, \"Ḥatam Sofer, Oraḥ Ḥayyim,\" 197), and turned visionaries themselves, frightening many persons with predictions of misfortunes which would befall them. Finally, the rabbis and congregational leaders intervened in 1779 and prohibited, under penalty of excommunication, the assemblies in Nathan Adler's house.\n\nRabbi Nathan, however, paid no attention to these orders. He even excommunicated a man who had disregarded his orders, although this was contrary to the laws of the congregation. His doors remained open day and night, and he declared all his possessions to be common property, that thus he might prevent the punishment of those who might carry away by mistake anything with them. Moreover, he commanded Moses Sofer, who had quarreled with his father, never to speak to his parent again. When the same disciple reported to him that he had gone through the whole Talmud, he advised him to celebrate that event by a fast of three days.\n\nIn spite of the continued conflict with the congregational authorities, the fame of Rabbi Nathan's piety and scholarship grew, and in 1782 he was elected rabbi of Boskowitz in Moravia. But his excessive and mystical piety having made enemies for him, he was forced to leave his congregation, and in 1785 returned to Frankfurt. As he still persisted in his former ways, the threat of excommunication was renewed in 1789, which act was not repealed until shortly before his death at Frankfurt on September 17, 1800. His wife, Rachel, daughter of Feist Cohen of Giessen, survived him. He left no children, though Nathan Marcus Adler, chief rabbi of London, was named after him.\n\nHis mysticism seems to have been the cause of his repugnance to literary publications. The kabbalists claimed that real esoteric theology should never be published, but should only be orally transmitted to worthy disciples. In his copy of the Mishnah he wrote brief marginal notes, mostly cross-references. Some of them were collected and explained ingeniously by B. H. Auerbach under the title \"Mishnat Rabbi Natan\". One responsum is found among those of Moses Sofer on \"Yoreh De'ah,\" 261.\n\n\n"}

He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees.\n\nHe preached that \"Kayakave Kailasa\" (Work is worship) and that \"Madidastu Needu Bhikshe\" (Your reward will be as per your work).\n\nThe details of his early life are not clearly documented. Though there are several legends and references to his origins and early life before arrival at Nayakanahatti (also spelled as Nayakanahatty), they are mostly constrained to oral history.\n\nThe date of his birth, place of birth and details of his parents or siblings are not known.\n\nAs for the time period of the Guru’s life in Nayakanahatti; the Temple Information System website of the Hindu Religious Institutions & Charitable endowments Department (Government of Karnataka) mentions a rough time period between the 15th and the 16th century, possibly 1570 - 1646 AD.\n\nLegend has it that Thipperudraswamy was an incarnation of one of the five Ganadheeswaras (Pancha Ganadheeshwara), who originally spread Shaivism (Worship of Shiva) as they were ordered by Lord Shiva himself. These five Gurus were reincarnated across various places in India at various periods of time, with an intention to spread Shiva Dharma in that specific area.\n\nDuring Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy’s times, the other four Ganadheeshwaras were reincarnated as Sri Vrishabhendra Swamy of Sarasipur (Kottur), Sri Kolashanteshwara of Arasikere, Sri Kempaiah Swamy of Harapura (Harpanahalli) and Sri Maddanaswamy of Kulahalli.\n\nThipperudra Swamy’s purpose of life was to spread the word of Dharma and provide guidance and solace to fellow human beings.\n\nThe Guru’s original name was Rudraswamy. During the course of his travels across Southern India, he met one of the other reincarnated Ganadheeshwaras, Sri Kempaiah Swamy, who had forgotten his original purpose of life and was caught up in the mundane pleasures, problems and desires of human life.\n\nWith the intent to enlighten Kempaiah Swamy, Rudraswamy sat in meditation on a big mound of refuse and cow dung (referred to as ‘Thippe’ in the local languages). This foul smelling mound was intended to be composted for use as a fertilizer in the fields and such mounds can be seen even today in the fields of rural India.\n\nSince the ‘Thippe’ was along the path that Kempaiah had to take to reach his fields, he could not help but notice the divine looking Sadhu seated on the foul heap of refuse. Slowly other passersby too noticed this Sadhu and began referring to him as ‘Thippe’ swamy – the Swamy who was seated on the mound.\nThough the locals started to stop by to pay their respects and leave food and other offerings for the meditating Sadhu, he continued to sit in silence for many days, undisturbed by the Sun, the Wind and the Rain.\n\nEventually, Kempaiah walked up to the seated Guru, paid his respects and was wondering as to why the Guru was seated on this mound of refuse, when there were plenty of shady trees around or caves in the nearby hills where the Swamy could have meditated.\n\nRudraswamy then opened his eyes and revealed his identity to Kempaiah. He stated that even though he was seated on the mound of refuse, he was not letting the smell or the dirt affect his senses and he continued with his original purpose of meditating on Shiva.\n\nKempaiah realized the allegory wherein he had been distracted from his original purpose of life by the pains and pleasures of normal human life and he remembered his true identity and purpose. Eventually Kempaiah Swamy let go of his worldly pursuits and went on to become the Sri Guru Kempaiah Swamy of Harapura (Harpanahalli).\n\nNayakanahatti is a small town located 35 km from the District headquarters, Chitradurga. Its original name was Nishadapura, however it slowly came to be referred as ‘Nayakana Hatti’ – The Leader’s place; after Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy took up residence there.\n\nOne of the Guru’s early disciples, a trader named Phaniyappa, requested Thipperudraswamy to visit his town, Nishadapura. When Thipperudraswamy arrived, he wished to stay at the temple of a local deity.\n\nAs per legend, the local deity refused to allow the Guru to enter the temple and the doors could not be opened. Realizing the background, Thipperudraswamy prayed to the deity that though he could not stay in the temple premises, he should at least be allowed to keep his ‘Betta’ (Walking stick) and ‘Jolige’ (Shoulder bag) in the temple for safekeeping, as they were his only essential worldly possessions.\n\nThe doors of the temple could then be opened and the Guru left his Betta and Jolige inside and walked away. Overnight the two objects expanded to become so large that they pushed out the statue of the local deity, who then left the place. The temple became the residence of the Guru Thipperudraswamy, who installed a Shivalinga there.\n\nWhile the above legend can be discounted as a local myth, since the Guru Thipperudraswamy was spreading the worship of Shiva, at some point in his lifetime, the popularity of the previous local deity Mariamma seems to have waned and her temple were converted into the current Nayakanahatti Shiva temple.\n\nWhile Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy preached the worship of Shiva, the highlight of his teachings and philosophy seem to be the importance he gave to work.\nHe preached and practiced ‘Kayakave Kailasa’ – work is worship. During his lifetime, apart from his religious work, he was also instrumental in the creation and expansion of water reservoirs around Nayakanahatti, some of which continue to store and provide water in the drought prone region.\n\nHe also preached ‘Madidastu Needu Bhikshe’ (Your reward will be as per your work), whereby he paid men and women equal wages for their work on the reservoirs. He also started a custom of paying one and a half times the wages for any pregnant ladies working on the projects; with the logic that even the unborn child was involved in the effort and should be paid at least half the normal wages.\n\nWhen the Guru was still new in Nayakanahatti, there was a noble widow in the village, with two young children. Her only source of income to feed her family was from selling the milk of a water buffalo she owned. Even on days when she could not earn enough, she would not seek help from others. Preferring to go hungry and give her children water to try and quell their hunger.\n\nOne day, the buffalo fell ill and died. Without any other source of income and too self-respecting to beg help from anyone, she contemplated committing suicide along with her children, by jumping into a deep well. The next evening, she was walking towards a well outside the town along with her children who were excited to be going on a trip with their mother, blissfully unaware that this would be their last walk.\n\nOn the way, she encountered Guru Sri Thipperudraswamy sitting in discussion under a tree, with a group of people from the village. She stopped briefly to pay respect to the Guru and was turning around to continue on her journey.\n\nThe Guru called out to her and said “We are feeling very hungry and thirsty sitting here all day, go and get us a pitcher of milk from your buffalo.” \nWith a tear in her eye, the lady replied that her buffalo had died the previous day.\n\nThe Guru rebuked her with a smile and said “What do you mean the buffalo has died? It is hale and hearty and can give enough milk for your family and also for all of us. Don’t waste time, go quickly and fetch the milk.”\n\nWhen the widow walked back to her house, she found the buffalo in full health and from that day onwards, the widow and her children did not face any paucity of food.\n\nThe episode is used to indicate that if you persist in the right path through difficult times, the Guru appreciates your efforts and you will be rewarded.\n\nWhen Hyder Ali’s son Sultan Sayyid was severely ill as a child and could not be cured for a long time, Hyder Ali, who then happened to be engaged in the assault on the nearby Chitradurga fort, prayed for his recovery at Thipperudraswamy’s Samadhi.\n\nWhen Sultan Sayyid eventually recovered, a grateful Hyder Ali had a structure built around the Guru’s Samadhi. The Indo-Saracenic style tomb existing on the Samadhi stands as a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity; and is revered by believers from both religions.\n\nThe legend also mentions that Hyder Ali added the word 'Thippu' to Sultan Sayyid's name in honor Thipperudraswamy; and the boy was called 'Thippu Sultan' who would eventually go on to become the famous Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhile it is a historical fact that Hyder Ali donated various articles to the Nayakanahatti Temple and he got the structure constructed on the Guru's Samadhi, the part of the legend about how Tipu Sultan got his name may be contested as it is generally believed that Sultan Sayyid was called 'Tipu' after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of Arcot.\n\nWhen a severe drought hit the region around Nayakanahatti, the local farmers could do nothing but sit idle. With every passing week, their stores of grain and food diminished and even their cattle started to die due to lack of fodder and water.\n\nGuru Sri Thipperudraswamy realized that there had to be a short-term fix and a long-term solution for the problem on hand. People immediately needed some regular work to earn a living till the rains arrived. Also, there was a need to store water from the rains and the small seasonal streams, to be used during the dry periods.\n\nThe Guru then requested the local Palegar (Administrator) to build a water reservoir in Nayakanahatti. Due to the drought, even the tax collections had fallen drastically and the Palegar expressed his inability to fund the reservoir construction. The Guru then assured the Palegar that if he could get the construction of the reservoir started, he would take care of the payments to the workers.\n\nWith the Guru’s blessings, a suitable location was finalized and the construction began in earnest. At the end of the first day, the Guru asked the laborers to make small mounds of earth. He then proceeded to touch each mound with his ‘Betta’ – walking stick.\n\nWhen the workers dug up the mounds they had made, they found Gold, Silver or Copper coins commensurate with the work that they had done during the day.\n\nThis miracle continued every evening for several months and the people of Nayakanahatti and the surrounding villages could earn enough to feed themselves and their families.\n\nSome unscrupulous men tried to take advantage of the Guru’s largess by arriving just before the day ended, mingling with the crowd of workers and building their own mounds of earth. However, miraculously, only the people who actually worked on the reservoir would find the coins. The Guru had noticed this and proclaimed Madidastu Needu Bhikshe (Your reward will be as per your work).\n\nWhen a woman working on the project found one and a half times the normal sum she was expecting, she mentioned this to the Guru that she had been paid more. The Guru then told the lady that she was pregnant and since her unborn child was also toiling with her on the project, it was but fair that the child too should get at least half the amount as would be paid to an adult worker.\n\nThe Nayakanahatti reservoir is still in use and continues to provide water for drinking and irrigation in the region.\n\nOn Chitra nakshatra Phalguna Bahula day as per the Hindu Calendar, Thipperudraswamy is said to have been entered Jeeva Samadhi, i.e. he was buried alive as per his wishes. There is a temple car - Rathothsava festival organized every year in the memory of the famous saint, which is attended by lakhs of people from across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nThere are three Matha’s or Temples in Nayakanahatti.\n\nThe Olamatha, also referred to as Hirematha or Darbarmatha is the focal point of Nayakanahatti. It was the primary residence of the Guru Thipperudraswamy and he would normally entertain visitors here.\n\nThis structure was originally a temple of a local deity Maramma. After the Guru took up residence here, a Shivaling was installed here, converting it into a Shiva temple.\n\nThe temple has 18 stone pillars with various carvings and elegantly designed stone roof. The ‘Rajagopura’ at the entrance was added at a later date and is said to be around 200 years old.\n\nThe Horamatha, located in the outskirts of the town has the Jeeva Samadhi of the Guru Thipperudraswamy.\n\nThe Horamatha was originally built by Raja Bhichchugatti Bharamanna, the ruler Palegar of Chitradurga in the year 1721 AD. Subsequent additions were made to the Horamatha, including the Indo-Saracenic structure added by Hyder Ali.\n\nThe Sanctum of the temple is covered with a dome that is typically seen in Islamic structures such as Mosques or Dargahs. The rest of the temple is built like a typical Hindu structure. This temple is therefore considered to be a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity and visited by believers from both religions.\n\nThe Ekantha matha, also called the Ekanthaswamy matha is located at a distance of 3 Kilometers from the Olamatha, on the route leading towards Challakere. This was a small place where the Guru would retreat for penance.\n\nA unique custom that is practiced in the Nayakanahatti temple is to burn dry coconut meat (copra) and consuming a portion of it as a 'prasad' - holy offering. The custom is attributed to Guru Thipperudraswamy's liking for the burnt coconut.\n\nLocal experts believe that the custom may have been originally started to burn dry coconut husks (Instead of the dried coconut meat, as it is done now.) over an enclosed low fire, which would then become activated charcoal. This activated charcoal was consumed by the devotees for its medicinal and purifying properties.\n\nDuring the annual Jathra days, thousands of devotees would arrive at Nayakanahatti, leading to sanitation issues and there would be a general increase in caes of diarrhea, indigestion, food poisoning and flatulence. Activated charcoal may be an effective remedy for such cases.\n\nOver the centuries, the purpose and reasons behind the old custom was forgotten and today devotees burn copra over a fire outside the temple as prasad.\n\nShree Guru Thipperudraswamy has been the subject of a full-length feature film in Kannada language.\n\nHe has also been the subject of documentary in an episode of TV9's series \"OM\".\n\nAn annual Jatra (Fair and Festival) and Rathotsava (Chariot festival) are held annually in Nayakanahatti, over a period of three to eight days in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna.\n\nLakhs of people from across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana arrive to participate in the festivities.\n\nThe highlight of the festival is the Rathothsava, where the wooden temple car is pulled by thousands of devotees through a predetermined route.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "98929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98929", "title": "Odinani", "text": "Odinani\n\nOdinani () comprises the traditional religious practices and cultural beliefs of the Igbo people of southern Nigeria. Odinani has monotheistic and panentheistic attributes, having a single God as the source of all things. Although a pantheon of spirits exists, these are lesser spirits prevalent in Odinani expressly serving as elements of Chineke (or Chukwu), the supreme being or high god. Chineke is a compound word encompassing the concept of \"chí\" is the creator (\"nà\") is a verb meaning 'that' while \"ékè\" means create. Chineke therefore means the Creator or the God that created all things. The concept of \"Chúkwú\" ('supreme chi') was largely propagated by the Aro-Igbo of Arochukwu in eastern Igboland who wielded much spiritual force over the eastern Niger Delta in the 18th century due to their operating of the Ibini Ukpabi oracle.\n\nLesser spirits known as \"ágbàrà\" or \"álúsí\" operate below the high god Chineke and are parts of him divided by gender in his mind. These spirits represent natural forces; agbara as a divine force manifests as separate alusi in the Igbo pantheon. A concept of 'the eye of sun or god' (\"ányá ánwụ́\") exists as a feminine solar deity which forms a part of the solar veneration among the Nri-Igbo in northern Igboland. Alusi are mediated by \"dibia\" and other priests who do not contact the high god directly. Through \"áfà\", 'divination', the laws and demands of the alusi are communicated to the living. Alusi are venerated in community shrines around roadsides and forests while smaller shrines are located in the household for ancestral veneration. Deceased ancestors live in the spirit world where they can be contacted. Below the alusi are minor and more general spirits known as \"mmúọ\" loosely defined by their perceived malevolent or benign natures. These minor spirits are not venerated and are sometimes considered the lost souls of the dead.\n\nThe number of people practicing Igbo religion decreased drastically in the 20th century with the influx of Christian missionaries under the auspices of the British colonial government of Nigeria. In some cases Igbo traditional religion was syncretised with Christianity, but in many cases indigenous rites were demonised by Christian missionaries who pointed out the practice of human sacrifice and some other cultural practices that were illegal under the colonial government. Earlier missionaries referred to many indigenous religious practices as \"juju\". Igbo religion is most present today in harvest ceremonies such as new yam festival (\"ị́wá jí\") and masquerading traditions such as mmanwu and Ekpe.\n\nRemnants of Igbo religious rites spread among African descendants in the Caribbean and North America in era of the Atlantic slave trade. Igbo \"ọ́bị̀à\" was transferred to the former British Caribbean and Guyana as obeah and aspects of Igbo masquerading traditions can be found among the festivals of the Garifuna people and jonkonnu of the British Caribbean and North Carolina.\n\n\"Odinani\" in northern Igbo dialects is the compound of the words \"ọ̀ dị̀\" ('located') + \"n\" (\"nà\", 'within') + \"ànị̀\" (the one god) [consisting of anu (E nu) above (the heavens) and Ana, below (the earth)]. Other dialectal variants include \"odinala\", \"odinana\", \"omenala\", \"omenana\", and \"omenani\". The word odinani and all its variations is also associated with the culture and customary laws of the Igbo people. Many of the laws and culture were counterparts with religion such as taboos and laws concerning sacred spaces like a deities sacred forest. Since customary law is recognised in Nigeria, many in Igbo society find themselves syncretising these beliefs with other beliefs and religions.\n\nOdinani could loosely be described as a monotheistic and panentheistic faith with a strong central spiritual force at its head from which all things are believed to spring; however, the contextual diversity of the system may encompass theistic perspectives that derive from a variety of beliefs held within the religion. Chukwu as the central deity is classed among the \"ndi mmuo\", 'invisible beings', an ontological category of beings which includes \"Ala\" the divine feminine earth force, \"chi\" the 'personal deity', \"ndichie\" the ancestors, and \"mmuo\" the minor spirits. The other ontological category consists of \"ndi mmadu\", 'visible beings', which include \"ánụ́\" animals, \"ósísí\" plants, and the final class \"ùrò\" which consists of elements, minerals and inanimate beings. Chukwu as the creator of everything visible and invisible and the source of lesser divinities is also referred to as Chineke. Chukwu is genderless and is reached through various spiritual forces mainly under the spirit class of Alusi who are incarnations of the high god; no sacrifices, however, are given to Chukwu and no shrines and altars are erected for him. If an Arushi is assigned to an individual, it becomes a chi, a personal guardian god. The chi manifests as mmuo, spirits, and as a persons spirit is earth bound it chooses sex, type, and lifespan before incarnation in the human world.\n\nChi is the personal spirit of a person \"ḿmúọ́\", in Igbo culture it is this spirit which determines destiny. Hence the saying, \"onye kwe, Chi ya ekwe\" (\"If a person agrees to a thing, his spirit agrees also\"). Culturally, people are seen as the creators or makers of their own destiny. The breath of life is in the heart, \"óbì\". Chi refers to the light and the day in contrast to the dark. The universal \"chi\" indirectly in charge of everything is Chukwu who is the supreme being that is beyond the limits of time and space. Chukwu's name is a compound of the words \"chí\" + \"úkwú\" ('great in size, supreme'). Chi is believed to be a spiritual connection between an individual and the high god and it dictates the trajectory of a person's spiritual journey on earth. Each chi is personal and is in communion with and inseparable from the universal chi of all things. The high god, Chukwu, is believed to assign chi before and at the time of an individuals birth. It is a guardian spirit providing care, guardianship, and providence, in this respect, the concept of chi is analogous to the concept of a guardian angel in Christianity, the daemon in ancient Greek religion, and the genius in ancient Roman religion. Unlike Chukwu who is genderless, chi can be masculine. A dibia can identify a person’s chi through divination (\"áfà\") and advise adherents of ways to placate it. Chukwu is also referred to as Chineke which is a compound of the words \"chí\" the divine masculine force and \"ékè\" the creative and divisive feminine force. Eke came out of the hands of Chi but are considered one; Chi created the world while Eke divided it incorporating a divisive trickster energy that introduced death and suffering. \"Chineke\" is also interpreted as \"chí ne ké\", 'chi the creatrix', and \"chí nne éké\", 'chi the creative mother'. Eke is ones ancestral guardian spirit. Chineke or Chukwu is high up away at the periphery of human life and remains a mystery to the people. Households usually contain a chi shrine which could be focused on a tree. In marriage a woman takes her chi shrine along with all her belongings to her matrimonial home. Around Nkarahia, in southern Igboland, there are the most elaborate chi shrines which are decorated with colourful china plates inset into the clay walls of the chi shrine building; the altars hold sacred emblems, while the polished mud benches hold offerings of china, glass, manillas, and food. As a marker of personal fortune or misfortune, good acts or ill, chi can be described as a focal point for 'personal religion'.\n\nThe community of visible interacting beings and the cosmos is referred to as \"ụ̀wà\", which includes all living things \"íhẹ́ ndi dị́ ńdụ̀\", including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world. These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, perhaps, with a preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore. In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to \"èké\" \"órìè\" \"àfọ̀\" \"ǹkwọ́\" which are the days of the week in the Igbo calendar regarded as market days. The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as \"élú nà àlà\". In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days. The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (\"ńsọ́\") to the Igbo. The \"élú nà àlà\" space is defined by two boundaries: \"élú ígwé\", 'sky's limit' composed of heavenly bodies under the main forces of the 'masculine' sun and 'feminine' moon, and \"élú àlà\", 'earth or lands limit' consisting of the four material elements of fire and air (masculine), and earth and water (feminine).\nThe pattern of two and four reoccur in Chukwu's creations. The days correspond to the four cardinal points and are its names in Igbo, èké east, órìè west, àfọ̀ north, ǹkwọ́ south. The Nri-Igbo claim the market days to have been introduced to the Igbo by their divine progenitor and king Eri in the 9th century after encountering the days as deities. These alusi are venerated as the primary or as a major deity under Chineke in parts of Igboland. In terms of hierarchy, some communities recognise èké as the head of these alusi, while others prioritise órìè and ǹkwọ́ first after the high god. Market days may have local deities representing the spirits in some places, in many southern Igbo towns Agwu is the patron of Eke, Ogwugwu the patron of Orie, Amadioha the patron of Afo and Ala for Nkwo.\n\nOfo and ogu is a law of retributive justice. It vindicates anyone that is wrongly accused of a crime as long as their \"hands are clean\". It is only a person who is on the righteous side of \"Ogu-na-Ofo\" that can call its name in prayer, otherwise such a person will face the wrath of Amadioha (the god of thunder and lightning). Kola nut is used in ceremonies honour Chukwu, chi, Arushi and ancestors and is used as a method of professing innocence when coupled with libations. The Igbo often make clay altars and shrines of their deities which are sometimes anthropomorphic, the most popular example being the wooden statues of Ikenga. Typically, only men are allowed to make representational figures of supernatural forces.\n\nThe Igbo have traditionally believed in reincarnation, \"ilo-uwa\". People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. People can usually reincarnate seven times, giving seven opportunities to enter the spirit world successfully as an ancestor. The person's cycle number on earth is unknown to them. Unlike in Hinduism, humans can only reincarnate as humans. Families hire fortune tellers to reveal the ancestral identity of the child in their former life, the baby is sometimes named after this relative. The personality of the ancestor is not identical to the child's but rather the concept establishes a vital relationship with the child and characteristics of the ancestor. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behaviour, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female. An ancestor may reincarnate as multiple people in which case share a mortal bond; upon the death of one person, it is believed that the others may die a sudden death if they see the corpse.\n\nAn ogbanje is a reincarnating evil spirit that would deliberately plague a family with misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under a certain amount of time (usually before puberty), would deliberately die and then come back and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits \"Iyi-uwa\", which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The \"Iyi-uwa\" is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.\n\nChukwu's incarnations and ministers in the world (\"ụ̀wà\") are the Alusi, supernatural forces that regulate human life. In southern Igbo dialects especially, ágbàrà is the term for these forces. The alusi are regarded as channels to Chukwu. The alusi, who are also known as \"arushi\", \"anusi\", or \"arusi\" in differing dialects all spring from Ala the earth spirit who embodies the workings of the world. There are lesser alusi in Odinani, each of whom are responsible for a specific aspect of nature or abstract concept. According to Igbo belief, these lesser alusi, as elements of Chukwu, have their own specific purpose. Alusi manifest in natural elements and their shrines are usually found in forests in which they are based around specific trees. At shrines, \"íhú mmúọ́\", an object such as a hung piece of cloth or a group of statues are placed at an alusi's group of trees to focus worship. Deities are described as 'hot' and often capricious so that much of the public approach shrines cautiously and are advised to avoid them at most times, priests are entrusted in the maintenance of most shrines. Many of these shrines are by the roadside in rural areas. Tender palm fronds symbolise spiritual power and are objects of sacralisation, shrines are cordoned off with omu to caution the public of the deities presence. Larger clay modelings in honour of an alusi also exist around forests and rivers. Other alusi figures may be found in and around peoples homes and the shrines of dibia, much of these are related to personal chi, cults, and ancestral worship.\n\nAla (meaning 'earth' and 'land' in Igbo, also \"Ájá-ànà\") is the feminine earth spirit who is responsible for morality, fertility and the dead ancestors who are stored in the underworld in her womb. Ala is at the head of the Igbo pantheon, maintaining order and carrying out justice against wrongdoers. Ala is the most prominent and worshipped alusi, almost every Igbo village has a shrine dedicated to her called \"íhú Ala\" where major decisions are taken. Ala is believed to be involved in all aspects of human affairs including festivals and at offerings. Ala stands for fertility and things that generate life including water, stone and vegetation, colour (\"àgwà\"), beauty (\"mmá\") which is connected to goodness in Igbo society, and uniqueness (\"áfà\"). She's a symbol of morality who sanctioned \"omenala\" Igbo customs from which these moral and ethical behaviours are upheld in Igbo society. Ala is the ground itself, and for this reason taboos and crimes are known as \"ńsọ́ Ala\" ('desecration of Ala'), all land is holy as the embodiment of Ala making her the principal legal sanctioning authority. Prohibitions include murder, suicide, theft, incest, and abnormalities of birth such as in many places the birth of twins and the killing and eating of pregnant animals, if a slaughtered animal is found to be pregnant sacrifices are made to Ala and the foetus is buried. People who commit suicides are not buried in the ground or given burial rites but cast away in order not to further offend and pollute the land, their ability to become ancestors is therefore nullified. When an individual dies a 'bad death' in the society, such as from the effects of divine retributive justice or breaking a taboo, they are not buried in the earth, but are discarded in a forest so as not to offend Ala. As in cases of most alusi, Ala has the ability to be malevolent if perceived to be offended and can cause harm against those who offend her.\nWithin the earth's spherical limit, in a cosmological sense, is a designation of the 'earth's bosom' within, \"ímé àlà\", a hemispherical base to the earth with an opening or 'mouth' at its highest point, \"ónụ́ àlà\". This is composed of mainly deep dark sea water (\"ohimiri\"). Ime ala is considered as the underworld. Ala in addition to embodying nature, is the cosmic base on which the vault of heaven, \"ígwé\", rests. As the foundation of all existence, children's umbilical cords are saved and symbolically buried under a tree to mark the child's first sharing of family owned lands; this tree could either be an oil palm, bread-fruit tree, raffia palm, or plantain tree depending on the cultural region. In some places, such as Nri, the royal python, \"éké\", is considered a sacred and tame agent of Ala and a harbinger of good fortune when found in a home. The python is referred to as \"nne\" 'mother' in areas where the python is revered, it is a symbol of female beauty and gentleness. Killing of the python is expressly forbidden in these places and sanctions are taken against the killer including the funding of expensive human sized burials that are given to slain pythons.\n\nAmadioha (from \"ámádí\" + \"ọ̀hà\", 'free will of the people' in Igbo) is the Alusi of justice, thunder, lightning and the sky. He is referred to as \"Amadioha\" in southern Igboland, \"Kamalu\", \"Kamanu\", \"Kalu\" among the Aro and other Cross River Igbo people, \"Igwe\" among the Isuama Igbo and in northwestern Igboland, and \"Ofufe\" in certain parts of Igboland. His governing planet is the Sun. His color is red, and his symbol is a white ram. Metaphysically, Amadioha represents the collective will of the people and he is often associated with Anyanwu. He is the expression of divine justice and wrath against taboos and crimes; in oaths he is sworn by and strikes down those who swear falsely with thunder and lightning. Amadioha shrines exist around Igboland, his main shrine is located at Ozuzu in the riverine Igbo region in northern Rivers State. While Anyanwu is more prominent in northern Igboland, Amadioha is more prominent in the south. His day is Afo, which is the second market day. In mbari houses Amadioha is depicted beside Ala as her consort.\n\nIkenga (literally 'place of strength') is an alusi and a cult figure of the right hand and success found among the northern Igbo people. He is an icon of meditation exclusive to men and owners of the sculpture dedicate and refer to it as their 'right hand' which is considered instrumental to personal power and success. Ikenga is a source of encoded knowledge unraveled through psychological principles. The image of Ikenga comprises someone's \"chi\" ('personal god'), his \"ndichie\" (ancestors), \"aka Ikenga\" (right hand), \"ike\" (power) as well as spiritual activation through prayer and sacrifice. Igbo cultures value of resourcefulness and individualism in society utilises the concept of Ikenga to regulate the relationship between individuality and family relations and obligations, as well as free will and industriousness balanced with destiny decided persons chi. Ikenga acts as a physical medium to the consciousness and emphasises individual initiative through reflection and meditation. Success validates the Ikenga and the sculptures act as visual representation of a persons inner success, people give offerings in thanks to the Ikenga after providing energy to overcome any unwanted pre-life choices. These choices are at the hands of the persons earth bound spirit, mmuo, who chooses sex, type, and lifespan before incarnation. The successful Ikenga influenced the saying of well being 'íkéǹgàm kwụ̀ ọ̀tọ́ ta ta' meaning that 'my Ikenga stands upright today'. During festivals of \"Ogbalido\" or \"olili Ikenga\" ('feast of Ikenga') sculptures of him may be paraded around a village or displayed at the village centre if too monumental to transport. When a person does not become successful with hard work the Ikenga has 'fallen' and is seen as a sign of danger, if meditation and cajoling the Ikenga fails, the sculpture is 'thrown down' and broken which spiritually kills the Ikenga; a new one is carved to replace it.\n\nIkenga figures are common cultural artefacts ranging for six inches to 6 feet high and can be humanistic or highly stylised. There are anthropomorphic, architectonic, and abstract cylindrical Ikenga sculptures. Ikenga is a symbol of success and personal achievement. Ikenga is mostly maintained, kept or owned by men and occasionally by women of high reputation and integrity in the society. At burials, a mans Ikenga is broken into two with one piece buried with him and the other destroyed.\n\nThis Alusi was adept at bargains and trade, and praying to Ekwensu was said to guarantee victory in negotiations. As a force of change and chaos, Ekwensu also represented the spirit of war among the Igbo, invoked during times of conflict and banished during peacetime to avoid his influences inciting bloodshed in the community, warriors set up shrines to Ekwensu to help war efforts. This is based upon the finding of old shrines dedicated to the worship of the spirit as well as the recounting of old oral stories which depict the character of Ekwensu. Ekwensu was a bringer of violence and possessed people with anger. Ekwensu holds the propensity of bringing misfortune and is regarded as an evil spirit in this sense. Among the Christian Igbo Ekwensu is representative of Satan and is seen as a force which places itself opposite to that of Chukwu. Ekwensu festivals are held in some Igbo towns where military success is celebrated and wealth is flaunted.\n\nMmuo is a broad class of minor spirits or divinities manifesting in natural elements under the class of elder divinities with major cults. Feminine mmuo inhabit earth and water and masculine mmuo inhabit fire and air. This class can be broken down by the \"alusi\", serviceable mmuo, \"agwu\" are related to unusual and deranged human behaviours, these spirits interact with human in a capricious nature that often makes them dangerous. Other cult deities exist around Igboland such as Njoku Ji, yam and fire deity overseeing agriculture, Idemili, 'the pillar of water', the female alusi based in Idemili North and South who holds up the waters, and Mkpataku the 'bringer of wealth' or 'coming in of wealth'. In addition to minor spirits there are evil wondering spirits of wrong doers called \"ogbonuke\".\n\nDibia are the mystic mediators between the human world and the spirit world and act as healers, scribes, teachers, diviners and advisors of people in the community. They are usually consulted at the shrine of a communities major deity. \"Dibia\" is a compound of the words \"di\" ('professional, master, husband') + \"ọ́bị̀à\" ('doctoring, sciences'). The dibia are believed to be destined for spiritual work. The dibia sees the spiritual world at any time and interprets what messages being sent and sees the spiritual problems of living people. They are given the power by the spirit world to identify any alusi by name and the possible ways of placating and negotiating with the deity. Dibia are thought to be revealed to possess the power over one of three elements namely water (and large bodies of water), fire and vegetation. Dibia whose elements are vegetation can go on to become herbalists by their supposed instinctual knowledge of the health benefits of certain plants they are instinctually drawn to, fire element dibia can handle fire unscathed during their initiation, and water element dibia do not drown. Dibia can partially enter the spirit world and communicate this by rubbing chalk on one half of their face. Dibia and obia practices were transported to the British Caribbean during the slave trade and became known as obeah.\n\nThe name of divination in Igbo derives from \"ígbá áfà\" or \"áhà\" meaning 'to name' coming from the diviners skill in rooting out problems hence naming them. The dibia or \"ogba afa\", 'interpreter of afa', is considered a master of esoteric knowledge and wisdom and igba afa is a way in which people can find out the cause of such things as misfortunes. The diviner interprets codes from \"àlà mmuọ\" the unseen by throwing divination seeds, cowries, and beads, or observing a divination board sometimes called \"osho\" which can be used in pronouncing curses on the evil. In this way the diviner is endowed with special sight. it is related the sciences of homeopathic medicine known as \"ọ́gwụ̀\", a practitioner consciously picks to either of these abilities. \nAnimals that are special in divination and sacrifice include a white he-goat, a white ram, a tortoise and male wall gecko. These animals are prized for their rarity, price and therefore the journey taken to obtain. Chameleons and rats are used for more stronger medicines and deadly poisons, and antidotes can include lambs, small chickens, eggs, and oils. Nzu is used in rites from birth to death and is used to mark sacred buildings and spaces. Agwu Nsi is the Igbo patron deity of health and divination and is related to insanity, confusion, and unusual human behaviour which is linked to possession of Agwu by the diviner. Agwu can be manifested by other alusi so that there could be images of a divination Ikenga or \"Ikenga Agwu\" for instance.\n\nNdebunze, or Ndichie, are the deceased ancestors who are considered to be in the spirit world, \"àlà mmúọ́\". In Odinani, it is believed that the dead ancestors are invisible members of the community; their role in the community, in conjunction with Ala, is to protect the community from epidemics and strife such as famine and smallpox. Ancestors helped chi look after men. Shrines for the ancestors in Igbo society were made in the central house, or \"òbí\" or \"òbú\", of the patriarch of a housing compound. The patriarchal head of the household is in charge of venerating the patriarchal ancestors through libations and offerings, through this the living maintain contact with the dead. Only a patriarch whose father is dead, and therefore in the spirit world where they await reincarnation into the community, were able to venerate ancestors. Female ancestors were called upon by matriarchs. At the funeral of a mans father there is a hierarchy in Igbo culture of animals that will be killed and eaten in his honor. Usually this depended on the rarity and price of the animal, so a goat or a sheep were common and relatively cheaper, and therefore carried less prestige, while a cow is considered a great honor, and a horse the most exceptional. Horses cannot be given for women. Horses were more common among the northeastern Igbo due to tsetse fly zone that Igboland is situated in and renders it an unsuitable climate for horses. Horse heads are traditionally decorated and kept in a reliquary and at shrines.\n\nA number of major masking institutions exist around Igboland that honour ancestors and reflect the spirit world in the land of the living. Young women, for example, are incarnated in the society through the àgbọ́ghọ̀ mmúọ́ masking tradition in which mean represent ideal and benevolent spirits of maidens of the spirit world in the form of feminine masks. These masks are performed at festivals at agricultural cycles and at funerals of prominent individuals in the society.\n\nKola nut (\"ọ́jị̀\", or \"ọ́jị̀ Ìgbò\") offerings and prayers (\"ị́gọ́ ọ́jị̀\", 'kola nut blessing', \"ị́wá ọ́jị̀\", 'kola nut breaking') can be performed personally between one and his spirit or in a group in a form of a prayer or chant. The saluter addresses their personal god or chi as well as alusi and their ancestors. These kola nuts are held in a special round bowl called \"ọ́kwá\" with a compartment at the centre of the bowl for condiments for the kola nut such as alligator pepper (or \"capsicum cayene\", \"ósẹ̀ ọ́jị́\") and ground peanuts. The bowl and kola nut rite is used to welcome visitors into a household. After the prayer, the ceremony ends with the saluter sharing pieces of the kola with the group, known as \"ị́ké ọ́jị̀\". The kola is supposed to cut by hand, but more recently knives have become acceptable. When the cola has three cotyledons, or parts, it is considered an \"ọ́jị̀ ìkéǹgà\" in some northern communities (going by other names in communities Ikenga doesn't operate) and is considered a sign of great luck, bravery and nobility. \"O wetalu oji wetalu ndu\" — 'one who brings kola brings life' is a popular saying that points to the auspiciousness of the kola rite.\n\nAmong a small area of the Urata-Igbo cultural area, near Owerri, there is a tradition of building votive monument houses called \"ḿbàrí\" primarily dedicated to the \"ágbàrà\" Àlà specific to the community and sometimes other community deities. The name joins the word \"ḿbà\" ('nation, town, society') + \"rí\" ('eat') in reference to the 'festival of life' held after its completion. These votive shrines are typically designed with four columns and a central volt, around the columns are modelled deities, spirits, and depictions of human life, the entire building built out of clay from termite mounds symbolically named \"jí\" ('yam') by the initiated spirit workers called \"ńdí m̀gbè\". Ndi mgbe are secluded from the community for a couple of months during the rites of building the mbari to a deity. Mbari are requested by a deity who the diviner tells the community feels neglected and cannot feel pride in the face of other deities in the spirit world. A string of unusual and unfortunate events befalling the community is linked to the aggrieved deity. An mbari is commissioned and artists are chosen. After the completion of the mbari the spirit workers are reincorporated into the community and a feast is held for the opening of the mbari house where elders and the community come to exhibit the critique the expensive mbari. The mbari house is not a source of worship and is left to dilapidate, being reabsorbed by nature in symbolic sense related to Ala.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, circular stepped pyramids were built in reverence of Ala at the town of Nsude in northern Igboland. In total ten clay/mud pyramidal structures were still existing in 1935. The base section of a pyramid was 60 ft. in circumference and 3 ft. in height. The next stack was 45 ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto who was believed to live at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1276423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1276423", "title": "Operating Thetan", "text": "Operating Thetan\n\nIn Scientology, Operating Thetan (OT) is a spiritual state above Clear. It is defined as \"knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time (MEST).\" According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, \"[i]t's basically a variation of the Gnostic myth about souls falling into matter and the encumbrances that come with that\".\n\nScientology doctrine defines OT as the \"highest state there is.\" The OT is able to \"control or operate thought, life, matter, energy, space, and time\" whether he or she has a body and mind or not. The state of Operating Thetan is represented by a symbol consisting of the letters OT with the T inside the O and each of the points of the T ending at the O's circumference, evoking not only the level's initials but also the medieval O-T map representing the known world and, metaphorically, the entirety of the observable universe, over which a fully developed OT is believed to have immediate control. Operating Thetan is a state of godliness in Scientology teaching, a state \"in which one is ‘at cause’ over the confines of matter, energy, space and time (MEST).\" Hubbard also claimed that an Operating Thetan would be considered \"beyond God.\" Scholar Hugh B. Urban writes that according to Hubbard, \"the thetan has been deceived into worshiping such a god by mainstream religion and so forgotten its own godlike power to create and destroy universes.\"\n\nAfter having removed one's own \"reactive mind\" and thus attaining the state of Clear, Scientologists may then go on to the OT levels. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Church claims that the OT is not dependent on the universe around him. Scientologists that are Operating Thetan claim that they have control over their lives and can \"go exterior\" from their bodies. The Church of Scientology claims that an OT is able to operate independently of his or her body. While there are 15 levels listed in Scientology teaching, the Church only offers eight.\n\nAccording to L. Ron Hubbard, as scholar Donald A. Westbrook writes, the universe is in existence because of the \"continual co-creation of omnipotent thetans\" who work with each other in unison. Therefore, becoming an Operating Thetan as Scientology teaches \"is to rediscover this true nature and recover unlimited spiritual potential, despite the encumbrances of the physical universe that were unwittingly created by thetans in the first place.\"\n\n\"This Solo-audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities, and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the MEST universe and other beings.\" The cost to move to level OT I is $2,750.\n\n\"By confronting hidden areas of one's existence on the whole track [that is, by confronting past incarnations], vast amounts of energy and attention are released. Those on this Solo-audited level experience a resurgence of self-determinism and native ability. OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track.\" The cost to move from OT I to OT II is $5,225.\n\nHubbard announced discovering an important breakthrough within less than a month of founding the Sea Org, the religious order of the church that consists of its most dedicated members.

Arising from the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and nationalist campaigns of the mid to late twentieth century elsewhere, the increasing numbers of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of poverty, violence, and war. According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist Jean-Marc Éla, African Christianity \"has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today.\" African theology is heavily influenced by liberation theology, global black theology, and postcolonial theology.\n\nMuch of African political theology owes to distinctively African readings of the Bible. African theologians interpret the Bible through the lens the African experience, oppression and poverty being frequent themes.\n\nItumeleng Mosala argues that the Bible itself must be understood has having arisen from the ideology of its compilers and that an uncritical acceptance of the Bible as the word of God leads to a notion that it has no ideology itself. Mosala says that this idea is wrong and that the Bible's compilation makes it inherently ideological, reflecting that of its compilers, and that the ideology it presents is harmful to colonized peoples. Mosala, like several others, also includes Marxist elements in his reading of the Bible.\n\nThe Tswana theologian Musa Dube employs a \"decolonizing feminist biblical practice\" she calls \"Rahab's reading prism.\" Named for the prostitute who protected Israelite spies who came to investigate Jericho before it was besieged by the Israelite army. Dube says her prism highlights \"the historical fact of colonizing and decolonizing communities inhabiting the feminist space of liberation practice.\" She argues for a new reading of the Bible by colonized peoples in order to create new narratives that speak of equity and freedom. For her, the interests of the decolonizing project are a part of the feminist agenda.\n\nFor some, the biblical text may be disregarded in favour of perceived direction from the Holy Spirit.\n\nArising out of the distinctive African hermeneutic, several themes are common among African theologians as concerns for a Christian response in the public sphere.\n\nJesse N. K. Mugambi and Laurenti Magesa have written that \"theology is not Christian at all when it does not offer Jesus Christ of Nazareth as the answer to the human quest\", including politics. For many African theologians, Jesus is seen as a liberating figure, including liberation from inequality, oppression, and poverty in opposition to what Jean-Marc Éla identifies as a \"Babylonian captivity\" of Christianity to Greco-Latin philosophies and Christologies that do not relate to the African experience. Among these are the image of an \"imperial\" Christ used to justify oppression and a \"slave-trader\" Christ used to promote faith in a distant salvation rather than earthly liberation. Éla's use of the terms \"imperial\" and \"slave-holder\" in reference to Jesus are not literal but serve to show the effects of traditional readings which serve to keep subjugated peoples from attempting to free themselves out of a belief that a distant salvation will come.\n\nHaving been subjected and treated as less than human, African theologians seek to validate their humanity on par with that of others. For example, Ananias Mpunzi writes that \"we have the task both of affirming the humanity of others and helping them to affirm it for themselves.\"\n\nThough religious leaders like South Africa's Desmond Tutu play important roles in several African states as public commentators on moral issues, only Zambia has declared itself to be officially a Christian nation. The Ugandan Catholic priest Emmanuel Katongole has written that the Christian gospel is deeply political and that the most urgent task for Christianity is to make politics work better, become more democratic and transparent, thus promoting stability and encouraging development. Éla calls on the church to be the link between revelation and history, or to push for political change, shaping the world of today rather than waiting for an otherworldly salvation.\n\nAfter decades of colonial rule and mismanagement by postcolonial governments, many Africans became embittered. According to Emmanuel Katongole, Christianity must engage with that past in order to move forward. Opinions on how that is to be done vary. Katongole sees the way forward in overcoming tribal divisions, forgiveness, and working together, something he sees Christianity uniquely capable of doing. Willa Boesek, on the other hand, writing shortly after the end of South African apartheid encouraged a righteous anger that could lead to change but differentiated it from hate-filled rage. He admonished victims to control their anger, urging them to not indict all white people for the oppression. At the same time, he urged white South African churches to help their members overcome their fear of blacks and to not expect immediate reconciliation. Bitterness, anger, and aggression were natural consequences of the situation in South Africa, he believed, \"a kind of unnatural 'Christian' patience and reasonableness \"vis-à-vis\" this history is not Christian at all, but a distorted ethos of submissiveness forced upon oppressed people\". Others, like Desmond Tutu in his Ubuntu theology, press for a peaceful reconciliation.\n\nUnder colonialism, Africa's land and resources were expropriated by white settlers and colonial agents, leaving the indigenous inhabitants with little of the continent's wealth. The issue of land restoration and redistribution are common topics for African theologians in the postcolonial era. An oft-repeated refrain from the missionary enterprise is that white people came to Africa with the Bible and the people had the land. The white missionaries taught the people to pray and when they opened their eyes, the Africans had the Bible and the whites had the land. Boesak encouraged white churches in South Africa to examine their role in the historical appropriation of black land. Itumeleng Mosala addresses land and poverty in his reading of the Book of Micah, emphasizing the sin of Israel in neglecting the poor.\n\nAs a contextual theology, African political theology lacks universality. It has been criticized it for being provisional, tentative, halting, and imprecise. Shawn Copeland points out an insufficiently rigorous analysis of imperialism, capitalism, and democracy. She identifies gaps in the discussions within African theology, specifically noting that a lack of theological critique in Zimbabwe and Nigeria \"mock the rhetoric of black theology as public theology and further distort the church's ministerial praxis.\"\n"}

It is generally carried up from the bottom of the temple to the superstructure. The corners of each ratha touch notional circles on the plan of the temple, centred on the murti image in the sanctum. The sides are oriented along the main horizontal axis of the temple (normally running east-west) or at right angles to it, generating (except around the entrance to the sanctum) a multi-faceted plan that harmonizes the square and the circle, becoming more circular in overall shape as the number of rathas increases. \n\nIn Sanskrit, the word \"ratha\" means \"cart\" or \"chariot\", but the link with this meaning is not clear. A ratha, meaning cart, is also the temple chariot used for processing the murti at festivals, and a \"ratha temple\" is one designed to resemble a cart, with wheels on the sides, and often horses. The most famous example is the Sun Temple, Konarak. \n\nThe rathas (facets) are decorated with geometric figures or statues, such as statues of a gatekeeper watching outside or a niche with a statue of a deity. Sometimes, the facet of the ratha is hollowed to the interior; these are rathas with recesses. If there is only one facet, this is a temple with three rathas (triratha): the wall and the facet on the left and on the right.\n\nIf there are a main facet and a secondary one, the temple has five rathas (pancharatha). There are also temples with seven rathas (saptaratha). and nine rathas (navaratha).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These are known as the triple gems (or jewels) of Jainism and hence also known as \"Ratnatr\nThe very first \"sloka\" (aphorism) of the Sacred Jain text, Tattvartha sutra reads:\n\nĀcārya Pujyapada writes in \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" (translated by Prof. S.A. Jain):\n\nAcharya Umaswami has written in \"Tattvārthasūtra\" that Tattvarthasraddhanam Samyak-darshanam (1-2), which means \"Belief in substances ascertained as they are is right faith.\"\n\nThese seven substances also called \"tattva\" are:-\n\nMany disciplines of knowledge are developed based on certain fundamental givens, or axioms. For example, Euclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (\"true statements given the axioms\") are derived from a finite number of axioms. Special theory of relativity bases itself on one of the fundamental principles called \"The Principle of Invariant Light Speed\". It takes it as given that light in vacuum propagates with the constant speed in terms of any system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source. These seven fundamental concepts, provide the metaphysical structure of Jain philosophy.\n\nIn the human state of existence, right faith acquired from destruction as well as from destruction-cum- subsidence. An intelligent conviction and profound faith in the essential nature of the soul, of matter, and of their mutual relationships, actions and reactions, is a necessary condition for launching upon the path of liberation. Jainism declares that a person with the right faith will have spiritual calmness (\"Prasanna\"), desire for liberation from the endless birth-life-death cycles (\"Samvega\"), without any attachment or aversion to anything (\"Nirveda\"), kindness (\"Anukampa\"), and belief in the \"tattvas\" (fundamental principles) described just above (\"āstika\").\n\nJain texts mention that knowledge is of five kinds – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy, and omniscience. Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge. Most of our knowledge is sensory-based (\"mati\") and based on recorded knowledge developed by our ancestors in the form of books, articles, papers and other medium (\"sruta\"). Jain philosophers also include knowledge acquired directly without any medium. This is achieved by removing the karmic veil on the soul.\n\n\nRight conduct is the application of the knowledge developed, so as to exercise control over our inner desires and reach a stage where there is no attachment or aversion.\n\nRight conduct includes:\n\n\nThe interesting aspect is that on this path there is a place for every one from the beginner to the most advanced seekers. Further, it encompasses all aspects of human life, namely social, personal, economic and spiritual leading to integrated development of the individual.\n\nRight view and right knowledge are inter-dependent. For instance, when the clouds disappear, both the heat and the light of the sun are manifested simultaneously. Similarly, when right faith is attained by the soul owing to the subsidence, destruction or destruction- cum-subsidence of faith-deluding karmas, right sensory knowledge and right scriptural knowledge are attained by the soul\nat the same time by the removal of wrong sensory and wrong scriptural knowledge.\n\nRight Knowledge must be accompanied by Right conduct which is necessary for the destruction of karmic bonds. Without it there is no release from the cycle of transmigration, i.e., repeated births and deaths. Just like the light from millions of lamps is of no avail to a blind person, studying scriptures alone is of no use to a person who does not apply them.\n\nJainism acknowledges that the soul advances to its liberated stage in various steps, called \"Gunasthana\". Jain literature describes these states in detail. The following provides a concise summary on the various statuses of soul on its journey to spiritual advancement.\n\n\n5. The soul now begins to observe some of the rules of right conduct with a view to perfecting itself. With the discipline of introductory or minor vows, the soul starts on the process of climbing the spiritual ladder.\n6. Major vows taken up with firm resolve to control passions. There may be failures due to lack of full control over passions or carelessness.\n\n7. Intense practice of vows assisted in better self-control and virtually replaced carelessness with spiritual vigilance and vigor.\n8. Closer to perfect self-control over actions, higher control over mind, thought and passions with the soul ready for reduction of the effects of conduct-deluding karma.\n9. Higher control over removal of passions, and elimination of conduct-deluding karma begins.\n10. Complete elimination of all passions except for subtle degree of attachment.\n\n11. Suppressed passions and lingering conduct-deluding karma may rise to drag the soul to lower stages; fleeting experiences of equanimity.\n12. This is the point of no return. All passions as well as conduct-deluding karma are eliminated. Permanent internal peace achieved. No new bondage from this point onwards.\n13. All inimical karma destroyed. Omniscience achieved and Arihant stage reached. However the perfected soul is still trapped in the physical body (with right knowledge attained).\n14. This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the \"aghātiā karmas\". Those who pass this stage are called \"siddha\" and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18079815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18079815", "title": "Secular religion", "text": "Secular religion\n\nA secular religion is a communal belief system that often rejects or neglects the metaphysical aspects of the supernatural, commonly associated with traditional religion, instead placing typical religious qualities in earthly entities. Among systems that have been characterized as secular religions are capitalism, communism, anarchism, fascism, nationalism, Auguste Comte's Religion of Humanity and the Cult of Reason and Cult of the Supreme Being that developed after the French Revolution.\n\nThe term secular religion is often applied today to communal belief systems—as for example with the view of love as our postmodern secular religion. Paul Vitz applied the term to modern psychology in as much as it fosters a cult of the self, explicitly calling \"the self-theory ethic [...] this secular religion\". Sport has also been considered as a new secular religion, particularly with respect to Olympism. For Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, belief in them as a new secular religion was explicit and lifelong.\n\nThe theory of political religion concerns governmental ideologies whose cultural and political backing is so strong that they are said to attain power equivalent to those of a state religion, with which they often exhibit significant similarities in both theory and practice. In addition to basic forms of politics, like parliament and elections, it also holds an aspect of \"sacralization\" related to the institutions contained within the regime and also provides the inner measures traditionally considered to be religious territory, such as ethics, values, symbols, myths, rituals, archetypes and for example a national liturgical calendar.\n\nPolitical religious organizations, such as the Nazi Party, adhered to the idealization of cultural and political power over the country at large. The church body of the state no longer held control over the practices of religious identity. Because of this, Nazism was countered by many political and religious organizations as being a political religion, based on the dominance which the Nazi regime had (Gates and Steane). Political religions generally vie with existing traditional religions, and may try to replace or eradicate them. The term was given new attention by the political scientist Hans Maier.\n\nTotalitarian societies are perhaps more prone to political religion, but various scholars have described features of political religion even in democracies, for instance American civil religion as described by Robert Bellah in 1967.\n\nThe term is sometimes treated as synonymous with civil religion, but although some scholars use the terms equivalently, others see a useful distinction, using \"civil religion\" as something weaker, which functions more as a socially unifying and essentially conservative force, whereas a political religion is radically transformational, even apocalyptic.\n\nThe term \"political religion\" is based on the observation that sometimes political ideologies or political systems display features more commonly associated with religion. Scholars who have studied these phenomena include William Connolly in political science, Christoph Deutschmann in sociology, Emilio Gentile in history, Oliver O'Donovan in theology and others in psychology. A political religion often occupies the same ethical, psychological and sociological space as a traditional religion, and as a result it often displaces or co-opts existing religious organizations and beliefs. The most central marker of a political religion involves the \"sacralization\" of politics, for example an overwhelming religious feeling when serving one's country, or the devotion towards the Founding Fathers of the United States. Although a political religion may co-opt existing religious structures or symbolism, it does not itself have any independent spiritual or theocratic elements—it is essentially secular, using religious motifs and methods for political purposes, if it does not reject religious faith outright. Typically, a political religion is considered to be secular, but more radical forms of it are also transcendental.\n\nThe 18th-century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) argued that all societies need a religion to hold men together. Because Christianity tended to pull men away from earthly matters, Rousseau advocated a \"civil religion\" that would create the links necessary for political unity around the state. The Swiss Protestant theologian Adolf Keller (1872–1963) argued that Marxism in the Soviet Union had been transformed into a secular religion. Before emigrating to the United States, the German-born political philosopher Eric Voegelin wrote a book entitled \"The political religions\". Other contributions on \"political religion\" (or associated terms such as \"secular religion\", \"lay religion\" or \"public religion\") were made by Luigi Sturzo (1871–1959), Paul Tillich (1886–1965), Gerhard Leibholz (1901–1982), Waldemar Gurian (1902–1954), Raymond Aron (1905–1983) and Walter Benjamin (1892–1940). Some saw such \"religions\" as a response to the existential void and nihilism caused by modernity, mass society and the rise of a bureaucratic state, and in political religions \"the rebellion against the religion of God\" reached its climax. They also described them as \"pseudo-religions\", \"substitute religions\", \"surrogate religions\", \"religions manipulated by man\" and \"anti-religions\". Yale political scientist Juan Linz and others have noted that the secularization of the twentieth century had created a void which could be filled by an ideology claiming a hold on ethical and identical matters as well, making the political religions based on totalitarianism, universalism and messianic missions (such as Manifest Destiny) possible.\n\nAn academic journal with the name \"Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions\" started publication in 2000. It was renamed \"Politics, Religion & Ideology\" in 2011. It is published by Taylor & Francis.\n\nKey qualities often (not all are always present) shared by political religion include:\n\nNot all of these aspects are present in any one \"political religion\"; this is only a list of some common aspects.\n\nPolitical religions compete with existing religions, and try, if possible, to replace or eradicate them. Loyalty to other entities, such as a church or a deity are often viewed as interfering with loyalty to the political religion. The authority of potential religious leaders also presents a threat to the authority of the political religion. As a result, some or all religious sects are either suppressed or banned. An existing sect may be converted into a state religion, but dogma and personnel may be modified to suit the needs of the party or state. Where there is suppression of religious institutions and beliefs, this might be explicitly accompanied by atheistic doctrine as in state atheism.\n\nJuan Linz has posited the friendly form of separation of church and state as the counterpole of political religion but describes the hostile form of separation of church and state as moving toward political religion as found in totalitarianism.\n\nLoyalty to the state or political party and acceptance of the government/party ideology are paramount. Dissenters may be expelled, ostracized, discriminated against, imprisoned, \"re-educated\", or killed. Loyalty oaths or membership in a dominant (or sole) political party may be required for employment, government services, or simply as routine. Criticism of the government may be a serious crime. Enforcements range from ostracism by one's neighbors to execution. In a fundamental political religion you are either with the system or against it.\n\nA political religion often elevates its leaders to near-godlike status. Displays of leaders in the form of posters or statues may be mandated in public areas and even private homes. Children may be required to learn the state's version of the leaders' biographies in school.\n\nPolitical religions often rely on a myth of origin that may have some historical basis but is usually idealized and sacralized. Current leaders may be venerated as descendants of the original fathers. There may also be holy places or shrines that relate to the myth of origin.\n\nRevolutionary France was well noted for being the first state to reject religion altogether. Radicals intended to replace Christianity with a new state religion, or an atheistic ideology. Maximilien Robespierre rejected atheistic ideologies and intended to create a new religion. Churches were closed, and Catholic Mass was forbidden. The Cult of the Supreme Being was well known for its derided festival, which led to the Thermidorian reaction and the fall of Robespierre.\n\nAccording to Emilio Gentile, \"Fascism was the first and prime instance of a modern political religion.\" \"This religion sacralized the state and assigned it the primary educational task of transforming the mentality, the character, and the customs of Italians. The aim was to create a 'new man', a believer in and an observing member of the cult of Fascism.\"\n\n\"The argument <nowiki>[that fascism was a ‘political religion’]</nowiki> tends to involve three main claims: I) that fascism was characterized by a religious form, particularly in terms of language and ritual; II) that fascism was a sacralized form of totalitarianism, which legitimized violence in defence of the nation and regeneration of a fascist 'new man'; and III) that fascism took on many of the functions of religion for a broad swathe of society.\"\n\n\"Among committed [Nazi] believers, a mythic world of eternally strong heroes, demons, fire and sword—in a word, the fantasy world of the nursery—displaced reality.\" Heinrich Himmler was fascinated by the occult, and sought to turn the SS into the basis of an official state cult.\n\nIn 1936 a Protestant priest referred explicitly to communism as a new secular religion. A couple of years later, on the eve of World War II, F. A. Voigt characterised both Marxism and National Socialism as secular religions, akin at a fundamental level in their authoritarianism and messianic beliefs as well as in their eschatological view of human History. Both, he considered, were waging religious war against the liberal enquiring mind of the European heritage.\n\nAfter the war, the social philosopher Raymond Aron would expand on the exploration of communism in terms of a secular religion; while A. J. P. Taylor, for example, would characterise it as \"a great secular religion...the \"Communist Manifesto\" must be counted as a holy book in the same class as the Bible\".\n\nKlaus-Georg Riegel argued that \"Lenin's utopian design of a revolutionary community of virtuosi as a typical political religion of an intelligentsia longing for an inner-worldly salvation, a socialist paradise without exploitation and alienation, to be implanted in the Russian backward society at the outskirts of the industrialised and modernised Western Europe.\"\n\nThe North Korean government has promulgated Juche as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and is fundamentally opposed to Christianity and Buddhism, the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. Juche theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology. According to government figures, Juche is the largest political religion in North Korea. The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.\n\nDuring the long rule of president Saparmurat Niyazov large pictures and statues of him could be seen in public places in Turkmenistan. In an interview with the television news program \"60 Minutes\", Niyazov said the people of Turkmenistan placed them there voluntarily because they love him so much, and that he did not originally want them there. In addition, he granted himself the title \"Türkmenbaşy\", meaning \"Leader of all Ethnic Turkmens\" in the Turkmen language. A book purportedly authored by Niyazov, \"Ruhnama\" (\"Book of the Soul\") was required reading in educational institutions and was often displayed and treated with the same respect as the Qur'an. The study of Ruhnama in the academic system was scaled down but to some extent continued after Niyazov's death (in 2006), as of 2008.\n\nSince its foundation in 1982, Hezbollah, the Shi'a Islamist political party and paramilitary group has produced public media in order to maintain the Lebanese population under a permanent state of order. The nominally terrorist organisation that now has Members in the Parliament and the government uses European-inspired techniques such as the cult of personality, cult of martyrdom, antisemitism and conspirationnism. Latest example of terror is dated from October 2017 when angry citizens criticized Hezbollah's leader and political allies before being forced into apologizing publicly in a humiliating way.\n\n\n"}

They are a microcommunity of around 85,000 (around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu). Tamil Jains are predominantly scattered in northern Tamil Nadu, largely in the districts of Madurai, Viluppuram, Kanchipuram, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Cuddalore and Thanjavur.\nEarly Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions in Tamil Nadu date to the 3rd century BCE and describe the livelihoods of Tamil Jains. \"Camaṇar\" wrote much Tamil literature, including the important Sangam literature, such as the \"Nālaṭiyār\", the \"Silappatikaram\", the \"Manimekalai\" and the \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\". Three of the five great epics of Tamil literature are attributed to Jains.\n\nSome scholars believe that Jain philosophy must have entered South India some time in the sixth century BCE. Literary sources and inscription state that Bhadrabahu came over to Shravanabelagola with a 12,000-strong retinue of Jain sages when north India found it hard to negotiate with the 12-year long famine in the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. Even Chandragupta accompanied this constellation of sages. On reaching Shravanabelagola, Bhadrabahu felt his end approaching and decided stay back along with Chandragupta and he instructed the Jain saints to tour over the Chola- and Pandyan-ruled domains.\n\nAccording to other scholars, Jainism must have existed in South India well before the visit of Bhadrabhu and Chandragupta. There are plenty of caves as old as the fourth century found with Jain inscriptions and Jain deities around Madurai, Tiruchirāppaḷḷi, Kanyakumari and Thanjavur.\n\nA number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the second century BCE. They are regarded as associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.\n\nThe exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the Sangam period. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. The Ramayana mentions that Rama paid homage to Jaina monks living in South India on his way to Sri Lanka. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), Tolkāppiyam, was a Jain.\n\nTirukkural by Thiruvalluvar is considered by many to be the work of a Jain by scholars like V. Kalyanasundarnar, Vaiyapuri Pillai, Swaminatha Iyer, and P. S. Sundaram. It emphatically supports strict vegetarianism (or veganism) (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than thousand burnt offerings (verse 259).\n\nSilappatikaram, the earliest surviving epic in Tamil literature, was written by a Samaṇa, Ilango Adigal. This epic is a major work in Tamil literature, describing the historical events of its time and also of then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and Shaivism. The main characters of this work, Kannagi and Kovalan, who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.\n\nAccording to George L. Hart, who holds the endowed Chair in Tamil Studies by University of California, Berkeley, has written that the legend of the Tamil Sangams or \"literary assemblies\", was based on the Jain \"sangham\" at Madurai:\nThere was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 A.D. in Madurai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the Sangam legend.\n\nJainism became dominant in Tamil Nadu in the fifth and sixth century CE, during a period known as the \"Kalabhra interregnum.\n\nJainism began to decline around the 8th century A.D., with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially Shaivism. Still, the Chalukya, Pallava and Pandya dynasties embraced Jainism. The Shaivite legend about the impalement of the Jains in Madurai claims that 8000 Jains were impaled after they lost a contest against the Saivites, Thirugnana Sambandhar was invited by the queen of Madurai to check the atrocities of Jains and their influence on the King; however, this legend is not mentioned in any Jain text According to Paul Dundas, the story represents the abandonment of Madurai by Jains for economic reasons or the gradual loss of their political influence.\n\nWhen India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became Madras State, comprising present day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\".\n\nThe ruins of Anandamangalam vestiges were discovered in \"Anandamangalam\", a small hamlet near \"Orathi\" village in Kancheepuram district of Tamil Nadu. The ruins had the rock-cut sculptures of \"yakshini\" (tutelary deity) Ambika and tirthankara Neminatha and Parshvanatha.\n\nThe total number of Tamil Jains as per 2011 Indian census is 83,359, which forms 0.12% of the total population of Tamil Nadu (72,138,958).\nThe occupation of the majority of the Tamil Jain families is agriculture. Many are teachers. A considerable number of them are settled in urban areas, they are employed in public and private sectors. A small population has settled overseas (US, Canada, UK, Australia and other places).\n\nCuisine: Tamil Jains are ardent vegetarians. Until the turn of the 20th century, they were a self-sustained rural based farming community. They were landowners and used contract labourers for their agricultural activities. Their household included large tracts of land, cattle, and milch cows. They had kitchen gardens growing vegetables for their daily need. Dairy food such as milk, curd, butter and ghee were cooked in house. Daily food was very simple consisting of a brunch with rice, cooked lentils (paruppu), ghee, vegetable sambar, curd, sun dried pickles of mango, lemon or citron, deep fried sun dried 'crispies' (vadavam) made from rice pie. Evening snacks of deep fired lentil preparations and before sunset dinner consisting either idli, dosa or rice with buttermilk and lentil chutney (thogaiyal). While seniors, people undergoing religious fast and ardent followers of religious principles avoided garlic, onions and tubers in their daily food, these were occasionally used by others in the household.\n\nTamil Jains are well assimilated in Tamil society, without any outward differentiation. Their physical features are similar to Tamils. Apart from certain religious adherences, practices and vegetarianism, their culture is similar to the rest of Tamil Nadu. However, they name their children by the names of Tirthankaras and characters from Jaina literature.\n\nEzhankaapu - on the seventh day of its birth, a new born baby is adorned with bracelets.\nKaathu Kutthal - ear piercing and adorning child with earrings. This ceremony is mostly performed in either Aarpakkam temple or Thirunarangkondai i.e.Thirunarungkundram. (Appandai Nathar is the deity).\n\nUpadesam - the formal induction into religious practices and adherences is called Upadesam. This is done to both boys and girls, at around the age of 15. After Upadesam, one is supposed to follow religious practices with vigor and seriousness.\n\nMarriage - outwardly, Jain marriages resemble Hindu marriages. However, the mantras chanted are Jain. There is no Brahmin priest; instead there is a Samaṇar called a \"Koyil Vaadhiyar\" or temple priest, who conducts the ceremonies.\n\nPilgrimage - most Jains go on pilgrimage to tirthas and major Jain temples in North India - Sammed Shikharji, Pavapuri, Champapuri and Urjayanta Giri - as well as places in South India such as Shravanabelagola, Humcha or Hombuja Humbaj, Simmanagadde in Karnataka and Ponnur Malai in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThere are private amateur tour operators as well who take pilgrims to newly identified ancient Tamil jain sites in western Tamil Nadu (kongunadu) and northern Kerala (vayanadu).\n\nFuneral rites - the dead are placed on a pyre and incinerated. Ashes are then disbursed in water courses and ceremonies are performed on 10th or 16th day. Annual remembrance ceremonies similar to Hindu practice are not performed. But no festivities or functions are followed that year on the paternal side.\n\n\nFull moon days, Chaturdasi (14th day of the fortnight), Ashtami (8th day of the fortnight) are days chosen for fasting and religious observations. Women take food only after reciting the name of a tirthankara five times. People undertake such practices as a vow for certain period of time - sometimes even for years. On completion, Udhyapana festivals (special prayer services) are performed, religious books and memorabilia are distributed. People who take certain vows eat only after sunrise and before sunset.\n\nCave Temples :\n\nPuja is done in the following old (built several centuries ago) and new (built in the last 100 years) Tamil Digambara Jain temples (in Alphabetical order):\n\nBhattaraka Laxmisena of Jina Kanchi Jain Mutt or madam at Mel-Sithamoor (near Tindivanam, Villupuram District) is the religious head of the community. He performs the Upadesam ceremony (similar to Baptism) for Jain children. In the past, this mutt had been the centre for religious study, guiding and helping the economic activities of its members, organising religious discourses, maintenance of temples and such activities. The mutt was able to achieve such multifarious operations with the help and contributions of its members. At present the mutt is also maintaining A Gousala (Cows & others).\n\nThe present finance position of the mutt is inadequate for even day-to-day maintenance. Planting of coconut and mango trees has been started to increase the revenue of the fund for the purpose of day-to-day maintenance of the mutt. The car ('ther') in the mutt requires replacement of wooden wheels.\n\nIn addition to the above, a new mutt named Arahanthgiri Jain Math located at Thirumalai near Polur, Tiruvannamalai district, has been functioning from February 8, 1998 with the name Dhavalakeerthi Swamigal. Now in the mutt around 2300 students are studying from primary to higher secondary school including Jain philosophy with free boarding and lodging. Maintenance of the above is done through contributions from donors.\n\n\"Jeevaka Chinthamani\", \"Sripurana\" by J Srichandran.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "192520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192520", "title": "Tawhid", "text": "Tawhid\n\nTawhid ( ', meaning \"oneness [of God]\" also romanized as \"tawheed\", \"touheed\", or \"tevhid\") is the indivisible oneness concept of monotheism in Islam. Tawhid is the religion's central and single-most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire faith rests. It unequivocally holds that God is One (') and Single (\"\"); therefore, the Islamic belief in God is considered Unitarian.\"\n\nTawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith. The first part of the shahada (the Islamic declaration of faith) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is \"shirk\" - an unpardonable sin according to the Qur'an, if repentance is not sought afterwards. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.\n\nThere is an uncompromising monotheism at the heart of the Islamic beliefs (aqidah) which is seen, from an Islamic standpoint, as distinguishing Islam from other major religions. However, Tawhid is analogous to the monotheistic concept of God in Judaism, as declared in the Shema Yisrael, the Jewish declaration of faith. Tawhid is also analogous to Christian Unitarianism adhered to by a minority of Christian denominations which reject a trinitarian position of God in Christianity, which is in contrast to most Christian faiths that ascribe to the Trinity (God as three persons in one being; the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Further Tawhid requires Muslims not only to avoid worshiping multiple gods, but also to relinquish to strive for money, social status or egoism.\n\nThe Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is independent of the entire creation. God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal, or parochial one—God is an absolute, who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.\n\nIslamic intellectual history can be understood as a gradual unfolding of the manner in which successive generations of believers have understood the meaning and implications of professing God's Unity. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it. Islamic theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, Sufism, even to some degree the Islamic understanding of natural sciences, all seek to explain at some level the principle of tawhid.\n\nThe classical definition of \"tawhid\" was limited to declaring or preferring belief in one God and the unity of God. Although the monotheistic definition has persisted into modern Arabic, it is now more generally used to connote \"unification, union, combination, fusion; standardization, regularization; consolidation, amalgamation, merger\".\n\nAccording to Edward Lane's Lexicon on classical Arabic, \"tawhid\" is an infinite noun that means \"He asserted, or declared, God to be one; he asserted, declared, or preferred belief in the unity of God\" and is derived from the Arabic verb \"wahhada\", which means \"He made it one; or called it one\". In modern Arabic, the verbs \"wahhada\" or \"yuwahhidu\" mean \"to unite\" or \"bring together\" something that which wasn't one, which reflects the struggle of monotheism against polytheism.\n\nIn order to explain the complexity of the unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as \"Excellent Names of God\" (Sura 7:180).The divine names project divine attributes, which, in turn, project all the levels of the creation down to the physical plane. Aside from the supreme name \"Allah\" and the neologism \"ar-Rahman\" (referring to the divine beneficence that creates and maintains the universe) and a few other specific names like al-Maalik al-Mulook ('King of Kings') in an authentic narration of Muhammad, other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's immanence rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature. Attribution of divinity to a created entity, \"shirk\", is considered a denial of the truth of God and thus a major sin.\n\nAssociating others with God is known as \"shirk\" and is the antithesis of Tawhid. It is usually but not always in the form of idolatry and supplicating to others than Allah, or believing that they hold the same attributes as him in an equal or lesser degree. Shirk is divided into two categories:\n\nGreater Shirk consists of the above-mentioned deeds. A person commits lesser shirk (Shirk-al-Asghar) or hidden polytheism when he claims to believe in God but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief. There are also minor forms of Shirk, they must be avoided as well; these include committing a good deed to show off, making an oath in the name of anyone except God. Within Islam, shirk is an unforgivable crime; God may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing shirk, repentance is required for its forgiveness.\n\nAccording to Hossein Nasr, Ali, the first imam (Shia view) and fourth Rashid Caliph (Sunni view), is credited with having established Islamic theology. His quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the Unity of God.\n\nAli states that \"God is One\" means that God is away from likeness and numeration and he is not divisible even in imagination.\nVincent J. Cornell, a scholar of Islamic studies quotes the following statement from Ali:\n\nTheologians usually use reason and deduction to prove the existence, unity and oneness of God. They use a teleological argument for the existence of God as a creator based on perceived evidence of order, purpose, design, or direction—or some combination of these—in nature. Teleology is the supposition that there is a purpose or directive principle in the works and processes of nature.\n\nAnother argument which is used frequently by theologians is Reductio ad absurdum. They use it instead of positive arguments as a more efficient way to reject the ideas of opponents.\n\nAgainst the polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia, the Qur'an argues that the knowledge of God as the creator of everything rules out the possibility of lesser gods since these beings must be themselves created. For the Qur'an, God is an immanent and transcendent deity who actively creates, maintains and destroys the universe. The reality of God as the ultimate cause of things is the belief that God is veiled from human understanding because of the secondary causes and contingent realities of things in the world. Thus the belief in the oneness of God is equated in the Qur'an with the \"belief in the unseen\" (Sura ). The Qur'an summarizes its task in making this \"unseen\", to a greater or lesser degree \"seen\" so that belief in the existence of God becomes a Master-Truth rather than an unreasonable belief. The Qur'an states that God's signals are so near and yet so far, demanding that its students listen to what it has to say with humility (Sura , Sura ). The Qur'an draws attention to certain observable facts, to present them as \"reminders\" of God instead of providing lengthy \"theological\" proofs for the existence and unity of God.\n\nAsh'ari theologians rejected cause and effect in essence, but accepted it as something that facilitates humankind's investigation and comprehension of natural processes. These medieval scholars argued that nature was composed of uniform atoms that were \"re-created\" at every instant by God. The laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes (customs of God), the ultimate cause of each accident being God himself.\n\nAn ontological argument for the existence of God was first proposed by Avicenna (965-1037) in the \"Metaphysics\" section of \"The Book of Healing\" Other forms of the argument also appear in Avicenna's other works, and this argument became known as the Proof of the Truthful.\n\nAvicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (\"Mahiat\") and existence (\"Wujud\"). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.\n\nThis was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. \"It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent\". The proof is also \"cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent\". Another argument Avicenna presented for God's existence was the problem of the mind-body dichotomy.\n\nAccording to Avicenna, the universe consists of a chain of actual beings, each giving existence to the one below it and responsible for the existence of the rest of the chain below. Because an actual infinite is deemed impossible by Avicenna, this chain as a whole must terminate in a being that is wholly simple and one, whose essence is its very existence, and therefore is self-sufficient and not in need of something else to give it existence. Because its existence is not contingent on or necessitated by something else but is necessary and eternal in itself, it satisfies the condition of being the necessitating cause of the entire chain that constitutes the eternal world of contingent existing things. Thus his ontological system rests on the conception of God as the \"Wajib al-Wujud\" (necessary existent). There is a gradual multiplication of beings through a timeless emanation from God as a result of his self-knowledge.\n\nThe Qur'an argues that there can be no multiple sources of divine sovereignty since \"behold, each god would have taken away what [each] had created, And some would have Lorded it over others!\" The Qur'an argues that the stability and order prevailing throughout the universe shows that it was created and is being administered by only one God (Sura ).\n\nThe Qur'an in verse 21:22 states: \"If there were numerous gods instead of one, [the heavens and the earth] would be in a sorry state\". Later Muslim theologians elaborated on this verse saying that the existence of at least two gods would inevitably arise between them, at one time or another, a conflict of wills. Since two contrary wills could not possibly be realized at the same time, one of them must admit himself powerless in that particular instance. On the other hand, a powerless being can not by definition be a god. Therefore, the possibility of having more than one god is ruled out.\n\nThe Qur'an argues that human beings have an instinctive distaste for polytheism: At times of crisis, for example, even the idolaters forget the false deities and call upon the one true God for help. As soon as they are relieved from the danger, they however start associating other beings with God. \"So when they ride in the ships they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo! they associate others (with Him)\" (Sura ).\n\nNext, the Qur'an argues that polytheism takes away from human dignity: God has honored human beings and given them charge of the physical world, and yet they disgrace their position in the world by worshipping what they carve out with their own hands.\n\nLastly, the Qur'an argues that monotheism is not a later discovery made by the human race, but rather there is the combined evidence of the prophetic call for monotheism throughout human history starting from Adam. The Qur'an suggests several causes for deviation from monotheism to polytheism: Great temporal power, regarded by the holder and his subjects as 'absolute' — may lead the holder to think that he is God-like; such claims were commonly forced upon, and accepted by, those who were subject to the ruler. Also, certain natural phenomena (such as the sun, the moon and the stars) inspire feelings of awe, wonder or admiration that could lead some to regard these celestial bodies as deities. Another reason for deviation from monotheism is when one becomes a slave to his or her base desires and passions. In seeking to always satisfy the desires, he or she may commit a kind of polytheism.\n\nUnderstanding of the meaning of Tawhid is one of the most controversial issues among Muslims. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it, comprising textualistic approach, theological approach, philosophical approach and Sufism and Irfani approach. These different approaches lead to different and in some cases opposite understanding of the issue.\n\nThe Textualistists by reason of their conception of the divine Attributes, came to represent the divinity as a complex of names and qualifications alongside the divine essence itself. The Athari methodology of textual interpretation is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation. With regard to their belief in Tawheed-al-Asma was-Sifaat, or \"Belief in the Oneness of the Names and the Attributes of Allah\", they take a stance of affirmation of all the Divine Names and Attributes of Allah in a manner that suits His Majesty, as mentioned in the Qu’ran and the Sunnah. This tenet is further divided into four aspects regarding the affirmation that it is without tashbih (establishing likeness), takyeef (speculating as to \"how\" they are manifested in the divine), ta'teel (negating/denying their apparent meaning) and ta'weel (giving it secondary/symbolic meaning which is different from the apparent meaning). This is strongly opposed to the extremes of either speculative philosophy as was warned against by the Imams of the Salaf, chiefly Imam Al-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, or of anthropomorphism which was strongly refuted by Sheikh Ibn Taymiyyah in his monumental al`Aqeedat al`Wasatiyah who defined the aqeedah or 'creed' of the Salaf to be the balanced middle path far from the extremities of the various sects prevalent in the Muslim world. This is generally summed and codified into the Athari school of theology.\n\nCertain theologians use the term Tawhid in a much broader meaning to denote the totality of discussion of God, his existence and his various attributes. Others go yet further and use the term to ultimately represent the totality of the \"principles of religion\". In its current usage, the expressions \"Tawhid\" or \"knowledge of Tawhid\" are sometimes used as an equivalent for the whole Kalam, the Islamic theology.\n\nAccording to Sunni Islam, the orthodox understanding of theology is taken directly from the teachings of Muhammad with the understanding and methodology of his companions, sourced directly from the revealed scripture the Qur'an; being the main information source for understanding the oneness of God in Islam. All Muslim authorities maintain that a true understanding of God is impossible unless He introduces Himself due to the fact that God is beyond the range of human vision and senses. Therefore, God tells people who He is by speaking through the prophets. According to this view, the fundamental message of all of the prophets is: \"There is no god but God.\" \n\nThe Mu'tazilis liked to call themselves the \"men of the tawhid\" (ahl al-tawhid). In Maqalat al-Islamiyin, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari describes the Mu'tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows:\nGod is unique, nothing is like him; he is neither body, nor individual, nor substance, nor accident. He is beyond time. He cannot dwell in a place or within a being; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification. He is neither conditioned nor determined, neither engendered nor engendering. He is beyond the perception of the senses. The eyes cannot see him, observation cannot attain him, the imagination cannot comprehend him. He is a thing, but he is not like other things; he is omniscient, all-powerful, but his omniscience and his all-mightiness cannot be compared to anything created. He created the world without any pre-established archetype and without an auxiliary.\nAccording to Henry Corbin, the result of this interpretation is the negation of the divine attributes, the affirmation of the created Quran, and the denial of all possibility of the vision of God in the world beyond. Mu'tazilis believed that God is deprived of all positive attributes, in the sense that all divine qualifications must be understood as being the essence itself, and declaring that God is existing ubiquitously and in everything. They resorted to metaphorical interpretations of Qur'anic verses or Prophetic reports with seemingly anthropomorphic content, e.g., the hand is the metaphorical designation of power; the face signifies the essence; the fact that God is seated on the Throne is a metaphorical image of the divine reign, and so on.\n\nThe solution proposed by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari to solve the problems of tashbih and ta'til concedes that the divine Being possesses in a real sense the Attributes and Names mentioned in the Qur'an. Insofar as these Names and Attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ash'ari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level—something which Mu'tazilis thinking had failed to grasp.\n\nAsh'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such questions as God's creation of evil and the apparent anthropomorphism of God's attributes, revelation has to accepted \"bila kayfa\" (without [asking] how).\n\nTwelvers theology is based on the Hadith which have been narrated from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Imams and compiled by Shia scholars such as Al-Shaykh al-Saduq in \"al-Tawhid\".\nAccording to Shia theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of these attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail polytheism. It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence. Also God has no physical form and he is insensible.\n\nTwelvers believe God is alone in being, along with his names, his attributes, his actions, his theophanies. The totality of being therefore is he, through him, comes from him, and returns to him. God is not a being next to or above other beings, his creatures; he is being, the absolute act of being (wujud mutlaq). For, if there were being other than he (i.e., creatural being), God would no longer be the Unique, i.e., the only one to be. As this Divine Essence is infinite, his qualities are the same as his essence, Essentially there is one Reality which is one and indivisible. The border between theoretical Tawhid and Shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him(from Him-ness), it is Tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God's permission as Quran points to it. The border between the Tawhid and Shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God(to Him-ness).\n\nAl-Farabi, Al-Razi and especially Avicenna put forward an interpretation of Tawhid in light of reason, with the Qur'an and Hadith serving as a basis. Before Avicenna the discussions among Muslim philosophers were about the unity of God as divine creator and his relationship with the world as creation. The earlier philosophers were profoundly affected by the emphasis of Plotinus on Divine simplicity.\n\nَWhether this view can be reconciled with Islam, particularly given the question of what role is left for God's will, was to become a subject of considerable controversy within intellectual Islamic discourse.\n\nIn Islamic mysticism (Sufism and Irfan), Tawhid is not only the affirmation in speech of God's unity, but also as importantly a practical and existential realization of that unity. This is done by rejecting the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity, to isolate the eternal from the temporal in a practical way. The ideal is a radical purification from all worldliness. According to Vincent J. Cornall, it is possible to draw up a monist image of God (\"see Sufi metaphysics\") by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things: \"He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full knowledge of all things.\"(Sura )\" However many Muslims criticize monism for it blurs the distinction between the creator and the creature, something incompatibility with the genuine and absolute monotheism of Islam.\n\nFor Muslim mystics (sufis), the affirmation in speech of God's unity is only the first step of Tawhid. Further steps involve a spiritual experience for the existential realization of that unity. Categorizations of different steps of Tawhid could be found in the works of Muslims Sufis like Junayd Baghdadi and al-Ghazali. It involves a practical rejection of the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity. Al-Junayd for example \"distinguishes four steps, starting from the simple attestation of unicity which is sufficient for ordinary believers, and culminating in the highest rank reserved for the elite, when the creature totally ceases to exist before his Lord, thus achieving al-fanā fi al-tawhīd [annihilation in unity]\".\n\nAccording to the concept of Fana, Annihilation and Subsistence, \"Man's existence, or ego, or self-hood ... must be annihilated so that he can attain to his true self which is his existence and \"subsistence\" with God. All of man's character traits and habits, everything that pertains to his individual existence must become completely naughted and \"obliterated\" (mahw). Then God will give back to him his character traits and everything positive he ever possessed. But at this stage, he will know consciously and actually - not just theoretically - and with a through spiritual realization, that everything he is derives absolutely from God. He is nothing but a ray of God's Attributes manifesting the Hidden Treasure.\" \n\nThe first detailed formulation of \"Unity of Existence\" (\"wahdat al-wujud\") is closely associated to Ibn Arabi. Widely different interpretations of the meaning of the \"Unity of Existence\" have been proposed throughout the centuries by critics, defenders, and Western scholars. Ibn Arabi himself didn't use the term \"Unity of Existence\" and similar statements had been made by those before him. For example, according to al-Ghazali \"There is nothing in wujud [existence] except God...Wujud [Existence] only belongs to the Real One\". Ghazali explains that the fruit of spiritual ascent of the Sufi is to \"witness that there is no existence in the world save God and that 'All things are perishing except his face' (Qur'an 28:88)\" \n\nMany authors consider being or existence to be the proper designation for the reality of God. While all Muslims believe the reality of God to be one, critics hold that the term \"existence\" (wujud) is also used for the existence of things in this world and that the doctrine blurs the distinction between the existence of the creator and that of the creation. Defenders argued that Ibn Arabi and his followers are offering a \"subtle metaphysics following the line of the Asharite formula: \"The attributes are neither God nor other than God.\" God's \"signs\" (ayat) and \"traces\" (athar)—the creatures—are neither the same as God nor different from him, because God must be understood as both absent and present, both transcendent and immanent. Understood correctly, wahdat al-wujud elucidates the delicate balance that needs to be maintained between these two perspectives.\" Shah Wali Allah of Delhi argued that the Ibn Arabi's \"unity of being\" was experiential and based on a subjective experience of illumination or ecstasy, rather than an ontological reality.\n\nThe Islamic doctrine of Tawhid puts forth a God whose rule, will or law are comprehensive and extend to all creatures and to all aspects of the human life. Early Muslims understood religion to thus cover the domains of state, law and society. It is believed that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid. In the following, we provide a few examples of the influences of Tawhid on the Muslim culture:\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, one consequence of properly conceived relationship between God and man as the served and servant, is the proper relationship among humans. In order to achieve the former, the Qur'an consistently \"reminds\" men of two points: 1. That God is one; everything except God (including the entirety of nature) is contingent upon God. 2. With all His might and glory, God is essentially the all-merciful God.\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, Allah is the progenitor of all things, both good and evil. As is written in the Qur'an, all of humanity is created at the will of Allah, both the good and the evil; and that their natures have been predisposed as such since the beginning of creation.\n\nAccording to the Qur'an, Satan deviated from the oneness of Allah in the story of creation of man by permitting his own hierarchical value system to supersede Allah's will: Allah asked the angels to bow to Adam, who he had created from clay. Satan refused, saying that \"I am better than him; you created me from fire and created him from clay\". The Medieval Muslim scholar, Al-Ghazali pointing out that the only legitimate \"preference principle\" in the sight of Allah is piety, writes: \"Every time a rich man believes that he is better than a poor one, or a white man believes that he is better than a black one, then he is being arrogant. He is adopting the same hierarchical principles adopted by Iblis [Satan] in his jahl [ignorance], and thus falling into shirk [opposite of Tawhid].\" \n\nIn many jurisdictions of the world, the laws and the general attitude of the population hold that the sphere of public life should be secular, and that belief in and practice of religion should remain in the sphere of private life. One motive for adopting this stance has been to reduce the effects of conflict between followers of different religions or between adherents of secularism and those of a religion. In public life, this view insists that the authority of the state prevails over any religious authorities.\n\nFor some Islamic thinkers, these propositions infringe the doctrine of Tawhid, and are therefore anathema. If the cosmos is a unified and harmonious whole, centered around the omnipotent and omnipresent God, they hold that recognising any other authority as superior is wrong. According to one writer: \"Traditionally, a Muslim is not a nationalist, or citizen of a nation-state; he has no political identity, only a religious membership in the Umma. For a traditional Muslim, Islam is the sole and sufficient identification tag and nationalism and nation-states are obstacles\". Hence the idea of creating a wholly Islamic state, or a revived caliphate. \n\nIn practice, nearly all Muslims live their daily lives under some national jurisdiction and accept at least part of the constraints this involves.\n\nThe desire to preserve the unity and transcendence of God led to the prohibition of Muslims from creating representation or visual depictions of God, or of any Prophet including Muhammad. Representations in art of the human form are a disputed matter in fiqh. The key concern is that the use of statues or images may lead to idolatry. The dominant forms of expression in the Islamic art, thus, became calligraphy and arabesque.\n\nEncyclopedias\nBooks\nJournal articles\n\n"}

Belonging to the Thai Forest Tradition, for 22 years he studied under the forest master Ajahn Fuang Jotiko (himself a student of Ajahn Lee). Since 1993 he has served as abbot of the Metta Forest Monastery in San Diego County, California — the first monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition in the US — which he cofounded with Ajahn Suwat Suvaco.\n\nṬhānissaro Bhikkhu is perhaps best known for his translations of the \"Dhammapada\" and the \"Sutta Pitaka\" - almost 1000 suttas in all - providing the majority of the sutta translations for the reference website Access to Insight, as well as for his translations from the dhamma talks of the Thai forest ajahns. He has also authored several dhamma-related works of his own, and has compiled study-guides of his Pali translations.\n\nṬhānissaro Bhikkhu was born Geoffrey DeGraff in 1949 and was introduced to the Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths as a high schooler, during a plane ride from the Philippines. Tricycle writes: \"he grew up 'a very serious, independent little kid\", spending his early childhood on a potato farm on Long Island, New York, and later living in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.\n\nAt Oberlin College in the early 1970s, \"he eschewed campus political activism because 'I didn't feel comfortable following a crowd.' For him, the defining issue of the day wasn't Vietnam, but a friend's attempted suicide.\" Ṭhānissaro took a religious studies class when he found out there was meditation involved. Ṭhānissaro writes: \"I saw it as a skill I could master, whereas Christianity only had prayer, which was pretty hit-or-miss.\"\n\nAfter graduating in 1971 with a degree in European Intellectual History from Oberlin College, he traveled on a university fellowship to Thailand. After a two-year search Ṭhānissaro found a forest teacher — Ajahn Fuang Jotiko, a Kammatthana monk who studied under Ajahn Lee Dhammadaro — who insisted that his scholarly American student put his books aside.\n\nAfter a brief stay with the teacher was cut short by malaria, he returned to the U.S. to weigh the merits of academia and monasticism.\n\nṬhānissaro states that when he returned to Thailand he originally planned on becoming a monk tentatively for five years. When he said that he wanted to be ordained, Ajahn Fuang made him promise to either \"succeed in the meditation or die in Thailand. There was to be no equivocating.\" Ṭhānissaro felt certain upon hearing this.\n\nBy Ṭhānissaro's third year ordained as a monk, he became Ajahn Fuang's attendant. Ajahn Fuang's case of psoriasis deteriorated. It reached a point where Taan Geoff had to be at his side constantly.\n\nṬhānissaro writes: \"When I talked with Ajahn Fuang about going back to the West, about taking the tradition to America, he was very explicit. 'This will probably be your life's work,' he said. He felt, as many teachers have, that the forest tradition would die out in Thailand but would then take root in the West.\"\n\nBefore Ajahn Fuang's death in 1986, he expressed his wish for Ajahn Geoff to become abbot of Wat Dhammasathit. \nṬhānissaro says that in spite of Ajahn Fuang's wish there were a lot of people maneuvering to become abbot. After Ajahn Fuang died, Wat Dhammasathit had already come far from the outlying forest hermitage that Taan Geoff had once arrived at. Ṭhānissaro said: \"Ajahn Fuang said to keep moving; this is not a tradition that works well in big groups.\" Taan Geoff declined the offer of abbot of Wat Dhammasathit, which came with strings attached, and no authority since he was a Westerner in a monastery founded by and for Thai monks.\n\nInstead of taking that position, he travelled to San Diego County in 1991, upon request of Ajahn Suwat Suvaco, where he helped start Metta Forest Monastery. He became abbot of the monastery in 1993. In 1995, Ajahn Geoff became the first American-born, non-Thai bhikkhu to be given the title, authority, and responsibility of Preceptor (Upajjhaya) in the Dhammayut Order. He also serves as Treasurer of that order in the United States.\n\nṬhānissaro rejects the practice of kasina outlined in the Visuddhimagga, and warns against forms of \"deep jhana\" practiced by contemporary meditation teachers who draw from the commentaries. Ṭhānissaro calls these meditations \"wrong concentration\", and says that they have no basis in the Pali Canon, which he argues should be considered ultimately authoritative.\n\nṬhānissaro talks about the importance of the forest to give rise to the qualities of mind necessary to succeed in Buddhist practice. Barbara Roether writes:\n\nṬhānissaro Bhikkhu's publications include:\n\nAside from \"Buddhist Religions\", all of the books and articles mentioned above are available for free distribution; many are online. Audio recordings of Dhamma talks are also given freely.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3269825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3269825", "title": "The Future of an Illusion", "text": "The Future of an Illusion\n\nThe Future of an Illusion () is a 1927 work by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in which Freud discusses religion's origins, development, and its future. He provides a psychoanalysis of religion, which he views as a false belief system.\n\nFreud defines religion as an illusion, consisting of \"certain dogmas, assertions about facts and conditions of external and internal reality which tells one something that one has not oneself discovered, and which claim that one should give them credence.\" Religious concepts are transmitted in three ways and thereby claim our belief. \"Firstly because our primal ancestors already believed them; secondly, because we possess proofs which have been handed down to us from antiquity, and thirdly because it is forbidden to raise the question of their authenticity at all.\" Psychologically speaking, these beliefs present the phenomena of wish fulfillment, \"fulfillments of the oldest, strongest, and most urgent wishes of mankind.\" (Ch. 6 pg.38).\n\nAmong these are the necessity to cling to the existence of the father, the prolongation of earthly existence by a future life, and the immortality of the human soul. To differentiate between an illusion and an error, Freud lists scientific beliefs such as \"\"Aristotle's belief that vermin are developed out of dung\" (pg.39) as errors, but \"the assertion made by certain nationalists that the Indo-Germanic race is the only one capable of civilization\" is an illusion, simply because of the wishing involved. Put forth more explicitly, \"what is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes\".\" (pg. 39)\n\nFreud adds, however, that, \"Illusions need not necessarily be false.\" (pg.39) He gives the example of a middle-class girl having the illusion that a prince will marry her. While this is unlikely, it is not impossible. The fact that it is grounded in her wishes is what makes it an illusion.\n\nFreud explains religion in a similar term to that of totemism. The individual is essentially an enemy of society and has instinctual urges that must be restrained to help society function. \"Among these instinctual wishes are those of incest, cannibalism, and lust for killing.\" (pg. 10)\n\nFreud's view of human nature is that it is anti-social, rebellious, and has high sexual and destructive tendencies. The destructive nature of humans sets a pre-inclination for disaster when humans must interact with others in society. \"\"For masses are lazy and unintelligent; they have no love for instinctual renunciation, and they are not to be convinced by argument of its inevitability; and the individuals composing them support one another in giving free rein to their indiscipline\".\" (pg. 7)\n\nSo destructive is human nature, he claims, that \"\"it is only through the influence of individuals who can set an example and whom masses recognize as their leaders that they can be induced to perform the work and undergo the renunciations on which the existence of civilization depends\".\" (pg. 8) All this sets a terribly hostile society that could implode if it were not for civilizing forces and developing government.\n\nHe elaborates further on the development of religion, as the emphasis on acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of instinctual drives (sex, wealth, glory, happiness, immortality) moves from \"the material to the mental.\" As compensation for good behaviors, religion promises a reward.\n\nIn Freud's view, religion is an outshoot of the Oedipus complex, and represents man's helplessness in the world, having to face the ultimate fate of death, the struggle of civilization, and the forces of nature. He views God as a manifestation of a childlike \"longing for [a] father.\" (pg. 18)\n\nFreud's description of religious belief as a form of illusion is based on the idea that it is derived from human wishes with no basis in reality. He says, \"Thus we call a belief an illusion when a wish-fulfillment is a prominent factor in its motivation, and in doing so we disregard its relations to reality, just as the illusion itself sets no store by verification.\"\n\nIn Freud's words \"The gods retain the threefold task: they must exorcise the terrors of nature, they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate, particularly as it is shown in death, and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them.\" (pg. 19)\n\nFreud sent a copy of \"The Future of an Illusion\" to his friend Romain Rolland. While Rolland generally agreed with Freud's assessment of religion, he questioned whether Freud had discovered the true source of religious sentiment, which he ascribed to an \"oceanic\" feeling. The psychiatrist Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychology, wrote in \"Symbols of Transformation\" that \"The Future of an Illusion\" \"gives the best possible account\" of Freud's earlier views, \"which move within the confines of the outmoded rationalism and scientific materialism of the late nineteenth century.\" The critic Harold Bloom, writing in \"The American Religion\" (1992), calls \"The Future of an Illusion\" \"one of the great failures of religious criticism.\" Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion and was therefore unable to criticize it effectively. Today, some scholars see Freud's arguments as a manifestation of the genetic fallacy, in which a belief is considered false or inverifiable based on its origin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30523623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30523623", "title": "U-Vistract", "text": "U-Vistract\n\nU-Vistract is a pyramid scheme created by Noah Musingku in Papua New Guinea (PNG) around 1999 as a means of providing a sovereign wealth source for an independent Bougainville. Eventually, it was established, and expelled, from Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands, but continues to exist in some form in the island Bougainville under the rule of Musingku as King David Peii II.\n\nU-Vistract is considered by many to be a Ponzi scheme. The founders have stated that the plan has always been to back the assets of the plan with the in-ground natural resources, including copper, silver, gold, zinc and other products.\n\nIn 1997, seven years after the unilateral declaration of independence, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army was fully in control of the island, but its leadership was starting to split into different factions. Francis Ona continued in full control of the army, and intended to achieve full independence. His co-president in the Bougainville Interim Government, Joseph Kabui, was seeking rapprochement with PNG and formation of an Autonomous Bougainville Government, while the army General Sam Kauona had his own path. Musingku met with each of them as a mediator, and by 19 December had signed agreements with each. They realized that it would be impossible to join the three parties together without a source of funding, and that it would be impossible to achieve political independence without financial sovereignty. As Musingku’s wrote,\n\nThus began the creation of the U-Vistract System. At first, the “U-Vistract Mission” was established as a Christian mission program in Australia. After Musingku was arrested and publicly denigrated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) for an unlicensed securities and investment program, churches continued to invest.\n\"On October 19th 1999 in one of my trips to Australia the ASIC placed me under house-arrest….After a heavy interrogatory session they demanded me to shut down all my operations in the country. The ASIC publicized the matter in the media to let the world of Australia know about the so-called illegal operations. However, U-Vistract grew even stronger, gaining momentum almost overnight. The number of my agencies grew in Kempsey, Sydney, Brisbane, Gold coast, etc.\"\nFrom Australia, Musingku took his U-Vistract program to Pt Moresby, Papua New Guinea. While in Pt Moresby, he attempted to set up a bank in the old Hawaiian Bank building, but he was shut down by the PNG government and forced to leave to the Solomon Islands. He began again to set up his system, but the Australian police in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) forced him out. In 2003 he travelled to Ona’s headquarters in Guava, Panguna, Bougainville, and established a bank there. Two years later he was able to travel to his ancestral village of Tonu, where he established his bank headquarters in an old cattle farm owned by the paramount chief. This, he said, was the manger from which would issue salvation of the world.\n\nU-V was established in several countries besides Bougainville. In 2002, it was already in 4 nations, including PNG. Its branches were considered to be branches of a government, with governors of different districts and regions in foreign nations. Along with a system of banks, branches and governorships in several countries, U-Vistract established an “alternate UN” called ‘’’Royal Assembly of Nations and Kingdoms’’’. Emissaries were sent from U-Vistract and RAONK to several nations, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, the UK and Netherlands.\n\nInitially, deposits were made in several currencies into bank accounts. Later, accounts were offered in ordinary and several high-yield investment categories.\n\nIn 2005 in Bougainville, the U-Vistract system began using bank cards to allow members to purchase goods in “U-Vistract’s Royal International Trade and Commerce System”. Merchants were promised reimbursement for member purchases.\n\nOne U-Vistract official said that “only born-again Christians would be paid” since only they could handle wealth morally.\n\nIn 2010, the International Bank of Me’ekamui, one of Musingku’s bank group, established relations with a group of companies and individuals engaged in commerce outside of the usual financial system. This group has provided billions of dollars in capital to U-Vistract through IBOM, and provided the means for capitalization of the in-ground assets that Bougainville contains, while IBOM has provided access to the international banking system.\n\nA new, gold backed currency is pending issuance. It will be a gold-backed “Kina” (not PNG Kina) worth 1 gm of gold. Currently, the exchange is the UVD at 10 USD to 1 UVD, now at 1 mg gold. This issue will include bills with the likenesses of Muskingku/King David, as well as Jesus Christ.\n\nMost Bougainvillians believed that Noah Muskingku is a Self -Proclaimed King who hides from the Legitimate Government Authority as he had deceived the ordinary people of PNG and other nations to invest in his failed financial scheme. His lust to form his own Government has no foundation as he only depends on the current government to provide goods and service to his people.\n\n"}

The family claimed Sasanian Persian descent, but were in reality a branch of the Parthian Mihranid family of Ray. Although the family of Varsken originally practiced Zoroastrianism, it converted to Christianity during the family's service in Caucasus.\n\nVarsken's mother was Anushvram Artsruni, an Armenian noblewomen from the Artsruni family, who was the sister-in-law of the Armenian aristocrat Hmayeak Mamikonian, himself brother of the Armenian rebel and martyr Vardan Mamikonian. Varsken's father, Arshusha II, was a hostage of the Sasanian court at Ctesiphon, and could not participate in the Christian Armenian rebellion in 451, led by Vardan Mamikonian. After the defeat of the Armenian rebels at Avarayr, Hmayeak Mamikonian was killed at Tao.

Upon the death of his Arsusha, Varsken went to Ctesiphon with the Sasanian shah Peroz I, and converted to the family's former religion, Zoroastrianism. He shortly married a daughter of Peroz and was given the governorship of Caucasian Albania. He later went back to Armenia, where he tried to force his first wife, Shushanik, to convert to Zoroastrianism, but the latter refused.\n\nVarsken then threatened her to send her on a donkey to Ctesiphon, where she would get executed. Shushanik, however, once again refused, and eventually died from the violence inflicted by her husband. Varsken later sought to conquer Iberia, and was given support by Peroz.

Its Middle Persian equivalent, as attested in the Pahlavi script texts of Zoroastrian tradition, is Wahman, which is a borrowing of the Avestan language expression and has the same meaning, and which continues in New Persian as Bahman and variants. Manah is cognate with the Sanskrit word Manas suggesting some commonality between the ideas of the Gathas and those of the Rigveda. The opposite of Vohu Manah is Aka Manah, \"evil purpose\" or \"evil mind\".\n\nThe term is a compound of the words \"vohu\" \"good\" and \"manah\" \"mind, thought, purpose\", cognate with the Vedic words \"vásu\" and \"mánas\", both with the same meaning.

In the case of Vohu Manah, this is all animal creation, with a particular stress on cattle. Vohu Manah is of neutral gender in Avestan grammar but in Zoroastrian tradition is considered masculine.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian calendar, the second day of each month as well as the eleventh month of each year are dedicated to Vohu Manah. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits the names of the months from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 11th month is likewise named Bahman.\n\nThe Achaemenid emperor Artaxerxes II (as it is rendered in Greek) had 'Vohu Manah' as the second part of his throne name, which when \"translated\" into Greek appeared as 'Mnemon'.

{"id": "20243097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20243097", "title": "White horse (mythology)", "text": "White horse (mythology)\n\nWhite horses have a special significance in the mythologies of cultures around the world. They are often associated with the sun chariot, with warrior-heroes, with fertility (in both mare and stallion manifestations), or with an end-of-time saviour, but other interpretations exist as well. Both truly white horses and the more common grey horses, with completely white hair coats, were identified as \"white\" by various religious and cultural traditions.\n\nFrom earliest times, white horses have been mythologised as possessing exceptional properties, transcending the normal world by having wings (e.g. Pegasus from Greek mythology), or having horns (the unicorn). As part of its legendary dimension, the white horse in myth may be depicted with seven heads (Uchaishravas) or eight feet (Sleipnir), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also white horses which are divinatory, who prophesy or warn of danger.\n\nAs a rare or distinguished symbol, a white horse typically bears the hero- or god-figure in ceremonial roles or in triumph over negative forces. Herodotus reported that white horses were held as sacred animals in the Achaemenid court of Xerxes the Great (ruled 486–465 BC), while in other traditions the reverse happens when it was sacrificed to the gods.\n\nIn more than one tradition, the white horse carries patron saints or the world saviour in the end times (as in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam), is associated with the sun or sun chariot (Ossetia) or bursts into existence in a fantastic way, emerging from the sea or a lightning bolt.\n\nThough some mythologies are stories from earliest beliefs, other tales, though visionary or metaphorical, are found in liturgical sources as part of preserved, on-going traditions (see, for example, \"Iranian tradition\" below).\n\nIn Celtic mythology, Rhiannon, a mythic figure in the Mabinogion collection of legends, rides a \"pale-white\" horse. Because of this, she has been linked to the Romano-Celtic fertility horse goddess Epona and other instances of the veneration of horses in early Indo-European culture.\nWhite horses are the most common type of hill figure in England. Though many are modern, the Uffington White Horse at least dates back to the Bronze Age.\n\nIn Scottish folklore, the kelpie or each uisge, a deadly supernatural water demon in the shape of a horse, is sometimes described as white, though other stories say it is black.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the white winged horse Pegasus was the son of Poseidon and the gorgon Medusa. Poseidon was also the creator of horses, creating them out of the breaking waves when challenged to make a beautiful land animal.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, \"the best horse among gods and men\", is described as grey. Sleipnir is also the ancestor of another grey horse, Grani, who is owned by the hero Sigurd.\n\nIn Slavic mythology, the war and fertility deity Svantovit owned an oracular white horse; the historian Saxo Grammaticus, in descriptions similar to those of Tacitus centuries before, says the priests divined the future by leading the white stallion between a series of fences and watching which leg, right or left, stepped first in each row.\n\nOne of the titles of God in Hungarian mythology was Hadúr, who, according to an unconfirmed source, wears pure copper and is a metalsmith. The Hungarian name for God was, and remains \"Isten\" and they followed Steppe Tengriism. The ancient Magyars sacrificed white stallions to him before a battle.\nAdditionally, there is a story (mentioned for example in \"Gesta Hungarorum\") that the Magyars paid a white horse to Moravian chieftain Svatopluk I (in other forms of the story, it is instead the Bulgarian chieftain Salan) for a part of the land that later became the Kingdom of Hungary. \nActual historical background of the story is dubious because Svatopluk I was already dead when the first Hungarian tribes arrived. On the other hand, even Herodotus mentions in his \"Histories\" an Eastern custom, where sending a white horse as payment in exchange for land means casus belli. This custom roots in the ancient Eastern belief that stolen land would lose its fertility.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, one of the three representations of Tishtrya, the hypostasis of the star Sirius, is that of a white stallion (the other two are as a young man, and as a bull). The divinity takes this form during the last 10 days of every month of the Zoroastrian calendar, and also in a cosmogonical battle for control of rain. In this latter tale (\"Yasht\" 8.21–29), which appears in the Avesta's hymns dedicated to Tishtrya, the divinity is opposed by Apaosha, the demon of drought, which appears as a black stallion.\n\nWhite horses are also said to draw divine chariots, such as that of Aredvi Sura Anahita, who is the Avesta's divinity of the waters. Representing various forms of water, her four horses are named \"wind\", \"rain\", \"clouds\" and \"sleet\" (\"Yasht\" 5.120).\n\nWhite horses appear many times in Hindu mythology and stand for the sun. The Vedic horse sacrifice or \"Ashvamedha\" was a fertility and kingship ritual involving the sacrifice of a sacred grey or white stallion. Similar rituals may have taken place among Roman, Celtic and Norse people, but the descriptions are not so complete.\n\nIn the Puranas, one of the precious objects that emerged while the devas and demons were churning the milky ocean was Uchaishravas, a snow-white horse with seven heads.Turaga was another divine white horse that emerged out of the ocean and taken by the sun god Surya. Uchaishravas was at times ridden by Indra, lord of the devas. Indra is depicted as having a liking for white horses in several legends – he often steals the sacrificial horse to the consternation of all involved, such as in the story of Sagara, or the story of King Prithu.\n\nThe chariot of the solar deity Surya is drawn by seven horses, alternately described as all white, or as the colours of the rainbow.\n\nHayagriva the Avatar of Vishnu is worshipped as the God of knowledge and wisdom, with a human body and a horse's head, brilliant white in colour, with white garments and seated on a white lotus. Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Vishnu and final world saviour, is predicted to appear riding a white horse, or in the form of a white horse.\n\nKanthaka was a white horse that was a royal servant and favourite horse of Prince Siddhartha, who later became Gautama Buddha. Siddhartha used Kanthaka in all major events described in Buddhist texts prior to his renunciation of the world. Following the departure of Siddhartha, it was said that Kanthaka died of a broken heart.\n\nThe Book of Zechariah twice mentions coloured horses; in the first passage there are three colours (red, dappled, and \"white\"), and in the second there are four teams of horses (red, black, \"white\", and finally dappled) pulling chariots. The second set of horses are referred to as \"the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.\" They are described as patrolling the earth and keeping it peaceful.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse include one seated on a white horse and one on a pale horse – the \"white\" horse carried the rider Conquest (traditionally, Pestilence) while the \"pale\" horse carried the rider Death. However, the Greek word \"chloros\", translated as \"pale,\" is often interpreted as sickly green or ashen grey rather than white. Later in the Book of Revelation, Christ rides a white horse out of heaven at the head of the armies of heaven to judge and make war upon the earth.\n\nTwo Christian saints are associated with white steeds: Saint James, as patron saint of Spain, rides a white horse in his martial aspect. Saint George, the patron saint of horsemen among other things, also rides a white horse. In Ossetia, the deity Uastyrdzhi, who embodied both the warrior and sun motifs often associated with white horses, became identified with the figure of St. George after the region adopted Christianity.\n\n\"Gesta Francorum\" contains a description of the First Crusade, where soldiers fighting at Antioch claimed to have been heartened by a vision of St. George and white horses during the battle: \"There came out from the mountains, also, countless armies with white horses, whose standards were all white. And so, when our leaders saw this army, they ... recognised the aid of Christ, whose leaders were St. George, Mercurius, and Demetrius.\"\n\nIslamic culture tells of a white creature named \"Al-Buraq\" who brought Muhammad to Jerusalem during the Night Journey. Al-Buraq was also said to transport Abraham (Ibrâhîm) when he visited his wife Hagar (Hājar) and son Ishmael (Ismâ'îl). According to tradition, Abraham lived with one wife (Sarah) in Syria, but Al-Buraq would transport him in the morning to Makkah to see his family there, and then take him back to his Syrian wife in the evening. \"Al-Burāq\" ( \"al-Burāq\" \"lightning\") isn't mentioned in the \"Quran\" but in some \"hadith\" (\"tradition\") literature.\n\nTwelver Shī'a Islamic traditions envisage that the Mahdi will appear riding a white horse.\n\nA huge white horse appears in Korean mythology in the story of the kingdom of Silla. When the people gathered to pray for a king, the horse emerged from a bolt of lightning, bowing to a shining egg. After the horse flew back to heaven, the egg opened and the boy Park Hyeokgeose emerged. When he grew up, he united six warring states.\n\nThe city of Pangantucan has as its symbol a white stallion who saved an ancient tribe from massacre by uprooting a bamboo and thus warning them of the enemy's approach.\n\nThe city of Hanoi honours a white horse as its patron saint with a temple dedicated to this revered spirit, the \"White Horse\" or \"Bach Ma Temple\" ( \"bach\" means \"white\" and \"ma\" is \"horse\"). The 11th-century king, Lý Công Uẩn (also known as King Lý Thái Tổ) had a vision of a white horse representing a river spirit which showed him where to build his citadel.\n\nIn Blackfoot mythology, the snow deity Aisoyimstan is a white-coloured man in white clothing who rides a white horse.\n\nThe mythological symbolism of white horses has been picked up as a trope in literature, film, and other storytelling. For example, the heroic prince or white knight of fairy tales often rides a white horse. Unicorns are (generally white) horse-like creatures with a single horn. And the English nursery rhyme \"Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross\" refers to a lady on a white horse who may be associated with the Celtic goddess Rhiannon.\n\nA \"white palfrey\" appears in the fairy tale \"Virgilius the Sorcerer\" by Andrew Lang. It appears in \"The Violet Fairy Book\" and attributes more than usual magical powers to the ancient Roman poet Virgil (see also Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings).\n\nThe British author G. K. Chesterton wrote an epic poem titled \"Ballad of the White Horse.\" In Book I, \"The Vision of the King,\" he writes of earliest England, invoking the white horse hill figure and the gods:\nBefore the gods that made the gods<br>\nHad seen their sunrise pass,<br>\nThe White Horse of the White Horse Vale<br>\nWas cut out of the grass.\n\nThe white horse is a recurring motif in Ibsen's play \"Rosmersholm\", making use of the common Norse folklore that its appearance was a portent of death. The basis for the superstition may have been that the horse was a form of Church Grim, buried alive at the original consecration of the church building (the doomed protagonist in the play was a pastor), or that it was a materialisation of the \"fylgje\", an individual's or family's guardian spirit.\n\n"}
