She was the author of numerous novels and of some non-fiction, including cookery books. Although her married name was Anna Haycraft, she is best known by her nom-de-plume. Ellis was born in Liverpool. Her father was half Finnish, and her mother Welsh. She spent some of her childhood as an evacuee in North Wales, a period later wrote about in \"A Welsh Childhood\". She later moved to Camden in North London.\n\nEllis' parents belonged to the positivist and atheist Church of Humanity founded by Auguste Comte, but she left to become a Roman Catholic at the age of 19. Shortly afterwards, she entered a convent as a postulant, but had to leave due to a health condition.\n\nIn 1956, she married Colin Haycraft, owner of the publishing company, Duckworth. They were happily married until his death in 1995. The couple had seven children (William being the oldest, and an enthusiastic player of Avalon Hill war games), raised in Anna's religion, but they were also struck by tragedy: their daughter Mary died in infancy at the age of two days, and their son Joshua spent ten months in a coma after an accident and died at the age of nineteen in 1978. To him is dedicated \"The Birds of the Air\", with the following inscription: \n\nShe published her first novel, \"The Sin Eater\", in 1977 under the pen name Alice Thomas Ellis, which she used in all her subsequent writing.\n\nShe was well known as a hostess; her skill at cooking and entertaining was a considerable asset to the Duckworth company. Her cookery books include \"All-natural Baby Food\" (published Fontana/Collins, 1977) and \"Darling, you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble\", co-written with Caroline Blackwood. Caroline Blackwood and her husband, the American poet Robert Lowell, were frequent visitors to the Haycraft home. She was also a close friend of Beryl Bainbridge.\n\nHer best-known novel was probably \"Unexplained Laughter\" (1985), which was adapted for British television, as was her \"Summerhouse Trilogy\". Her novel \"The 27th Kingdom\" (1982) was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Her \"Home Life\" column in \"The Spectator\" was published in four volumes. All her work was livened by a dry, dark sense of humour. One of her most famous witticisms is: \"There is no reciprocity. Men love women. Women love children. Children love hamsters. Hamsters don't love anyone\".\n\nAs a conservative Roman Catholic who was unhappy with the changes in the Church triggered by the Second Vatican Council, she became a sharp polemicist in the press against what she believed were abuses of liturgy and practice that, she believed, led to a watering-down of the faith. Though her fiction often seems feminist, with women usually the leads, she opposed radical feminists' activism in the Church, and claimed that since the change from the Tridentine Mass she could barely bring herself to attend on Sundays. A regular columnist of the \"Catholic Herald\" newspaper, she criticised Derek Worlock, the former Archbishop of Liverpool, shortly after his death in 1996, accusing him of being responsible for a strong fall in Mass attendance in the previous decade. Cardinal Hume demanded and achieved her sacking. Thereafter she was the Catholic Herald's cookery columnist.\n\nEllis was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999.\n\nShe survived a bout of lung cancer but later developed secondary complications and died a year later, on 8 March 2005, at the age of 72.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "173436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173436", "title": "Arya Samaj", "text": "Arya Samaj\n\nArya Samaj (Sanskrit: \"\" \"Noble Society\" Hindi: आर्य समाज, Bengali: আর্য সমাজ, Punjabi: ਆਰੀਆ ਸਮਾਜ, Gujarati: આર્ય સમાજ) is an Indian Hindu reform movement that promotes values and practices based on the belief in the infallible authority of the Vedas. The samaj was founded by the sannyasi (ascetic) Dayanand Saraswati on 10 April 1875. Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one God and reject the worship of idols.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India in his book, The Discovery of India credits Arya Samaj in introducing proselytization in Hinduism\n\nThe Arya Samaj was established in Bombay on 7 April 1875 by Dayananda Saraswati (born \"Mool Shankar\" in Kathiawar, Gujarat 1824 died Ajmer, 1883)\n\nAn alternative date for the foundation of the samaj is 24 June 1877 because it was then, in Lahore when the samaj became more than just a regional movement based in Punjab.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1873, Saraswati began his efforts to reform orthodox Hinduism in India. He established \"Gurukul\" (Vedic schools) which emphasised Vedic values, culture, \"Satya\" (virtue) and \"Sanatana Dharma\" (the essence of living). The schools gave separate educations to boys and girls based on ancient Vedic principles. The Vedic school system was also to relieve Indians from the pattern of a British education.\n\nThe first Vedic school was established at Farrukhabad in 1869. Fifty students were enrolled in its first year. This success led to the founding of schools at Mirzapur (1870), Kasganj (1870), Chhalesar (Aligarh) (1870) and Varanasi (1873). \n\nAt the schools, students received all meals, lodging, clothing and books free of charge. Discipline was strict. Students were not allowed to perform \"murti puja\" (worship of sculpted stone idols). Rather, they performed \"Sandhyavandanam\" (meditative prayer using Vedic mantras with divine sound) and \"agnihotra\" (making a heated milk offering twice daily).\nThe study of Sanskrit scriptural texts which accepted the authority of the Vedas were taught. They included the \"Vedas\", \"Upanishads\", \"Aranyaka\", \"Kashika\", \"Nirukta\", \"Mahabhasya\", \"Ashtadhyayi\", \"Darshanas\". The teaching was open to girls and to children who were not of the Brahmins class. \n\nDayanand had difficulty finding qualified teachers who agreed with his views on religious reform. There were few textbooks which he considered suitable. Funding was sporadic, attendance fluctuated and students did not achieve desired standards and so some schools closed soon after opening. The last remaining school at Farrukhabad closed in 1876. \nIn 1872 and 1873, Dayanand travelled and came to know some pro-Western Indian intellectuals including Navin Chandra Roy, Rajnarayan Basu, Debendranath Tagore and Hemendranath Tagore who were actively involved in the Brahmo Samaj. This reform organization, founded in 1828, held many views similar to those of Dayanand. The organisation promoted monotheism and the eternality of the soul; and the abolishment of the hereditary caste or varna system and uplifting people through education. Dayanand disagreed with the Brahmo Samaj about the proper position of the Vedas. Dayanand strongly held the Vedas to be divine revelation.\n\nAfter visiting Calcutta, Dayanand's work changed. He began lecturing in Hindi rather than in Sanskrit. Although Sanskrit garnered respect, in Hindi, Dayanand reached a much larger audience. His ideas of reform began to reach the poorest people. \n\nIn Varanasi, after hearing Dayanand speak, a local government official called Jaikishen Das encouraged Dayanand to publish a book about his ideas. From June to September 1874, Dayanand dictated a series of lectures to his scribe, Bhimsen Sharma. The lectures recorded Dayanand's views on a wide range of subjects. They were published in 1875 in Varanasi with the title \"Satyarth Prakash\" (\"the light of truth\").\n\nWhile his manuscript for \"Satyarth Prakash\" was being edited in Varanasi, Dayanand received an invitation to travel to Bombay. There, he was to debate representatives of the Vallabhacharya sect. On 20 October, 1874, Dayanand arrived in Bombay. The debate, though well publicized, never took place. Nonetheless, two members of the Prarthana Samaj approached Dayanand and invited him to speak at one of their gatherings. He did so and was well received. They recognized Dayanand's desire to uplift the Hindu community and protect Hindus from the pressures to convert to Christianity or Islam. Dayanand spent over one month in Bombay and attracted sixty people to his cause. They proposed founding a new samaj with Dayanand's ideas as its spiritual and intellectual basis.\n\nOn 11 December 1874, Dayanand arrived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat on the invitation of Gopal Hari Deshmukh. There, he debated with interested parties.\n\nOn 31 December, 1874, Dayanand arrived in Rajkot, Gujarat, on the invitation of Hargovind Das Dvarkadas, the secretary of the local Prarthana Samaj. He invited topics of discourse from the audience and spoke on eight. Again, Dayanand was well received and the Rajkot group elected to join his cause. The Samaj was renamed \"Arya Samaj\" (Society of Nobles). Dayanand published a list of twenty-eight rules and regulations for the followers. After leaving Rajkot, Dayanand went to Ahmedabad but his audience at a meeting on 27 January, 1875, did not elect to form a new Arya Samaj. Meanwhile, the Rajkot group had become in a political row.\n\nOn his return to Bombay, Dayanand began a membership drive for a local Arya samaj and received one hundred enrolees. \nOn 7 April 1875, the Bombay Arya Samaj was established. Dayanand himself enrolled as a member rather than the leader of the Bombay group. The samaj began to grow.\n\nDayanand died in 1883. The Arya Samaj continued to grow, especially in Punjab. The early leaders of the samaj were Pandit Lekh Ram (1858 1897) and Swami Shraddhanand (Mahatma Munshi Ram Vij) (1856 1926). In Punjab, the Arya Samaj was opposed by the Sikh dominated Singh Sabha, the forerunner of the Akali Dal.\n\nSome authors claim that the activities of the Samaj led to increased antagonism between Muslims and Hindus. Shraddhanand led the Shuddhi movement that aimed to bring Hindus who had converted to other religions back to Hinduism. \n\nIn 1893, the Arya Samaj members of Punjab were divided on the question of vegetarianism. The group that refrained from eating meat were called the \"Mahatma\" group and the other group, the \"Cultured Party\".\n\nIn the early 1900s, the samaj (or organizations inspired by it such as \"Jat Pat Todak Mandal\") campaigned against caste discrimination. They also campaigned for widow remarriage and women's education. The samaj also established chapters in British colonies with an Indian diaspora such as South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nProminent Indian Nationalists such as Lala Lajpat Rai belonged to Arya Samaj and were active in its campaigning. The British colonial government in the early part of 20th century viewed the Samaj as a political body.Some samajist in government service were dismissed for belonging to the samaj\n\nIn the 1930s, when the Hindu Nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh grew in prominence in Northern India, they found support in the Arya Samaj of Punjab. \n\nPandit Lekh Ram (1858 1897) was an Arya Samaj leader who was a contemporary of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835 1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Ram contested Ahmad's text, \"Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya\" in a work entitled \"Takzeeb e Barahin Ahmadiyya\" (\"A falsification of the Barahin e Ahmadiyya\"). Ram was assassinated on 6 March 1897. Members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community claimed that this was in accordance with the prophecies of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.\n\nIan Talbot of the University of Southampton wrote, \"Relations grew particularly bad between the Aryas and the Muslims. Serious violence broke out in 1897 when Pandit Lekh Ram was assassinated. Lekh Ram's greatest influence was in the north-west of Punjab. He had in fact joined the Peshawar Arya Samaj in 1880 and rose to prominence first as a missionary and then as editor of the Arya Gazette. At first he had limited his attacks to the Ahmadi movement of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, but he increasingly attacked orthodox Muslims as well. His pamphlet, Risala-i-Jihad ya'ri Din-i-Muhammad ki Bunyad (A treatise on waging holy war, or the foundation of the Muhammadan Religion) caused a considerable outcry, when it was published in 1892. Until his murder by a Muslim five years later, Lekh Ram continued to stir up animosity by his vituperative writings.\"\n\nThe Arya Samaj of Gujarat members were missionaries from Punjab who had been encouraged to move to Gujarat to carry out educational work amongst the untouchable castes by the maharaja, Sayajirao Gaekwad III. The Gujarat samaj opened orphanages. In 1915, the samaj lost its following to Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn 1921, during a rebellion by the Muslim Moplah community of Malabar Indian newspapers reported that a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. The Arya Samaj extended its efforts to the region to reconvert these people back to Hinduism through Shuddhi ceremonies.\nArya Samaj promoted the use of Hindi in Punjab and discouraged the use of Punjabi. This was a serious point of difference between the Sikhs, represented by the Shiromani Akali Dal group and the Arya Samaj. The difference was marked during the period immediately following the independence of India and the time of the Punjabi Suba movement (demand for a Punjabi speaking state).\n\nArya Samaj was a charitable organisation. For example, donations were made to victims of the 1905 Kangra earthquake. The samaj campaigned for women's right to vote, and for the protection of widows.\n\nArya Samaj schools and temples are found in almost all major cities and as well as in rural areas (esp in North region) of India. Some are authorised to conduct weddings. The samaj is associated with the Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) schools which number over two hundred. \n\nThe former Indian prime minister Charan Singh, as a young man, was a member of Arya Samaj in Ghaziabad.\n\nA branch of Arya Samaj was established in 2015 in Angul district in the state of Odisha\n\nArya Samaj is active in countries including Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Australia, South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius and other countries where a significant Hindu diaspora is present. \n\nImmigrants to Canada and the United States from Eastern Africa, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries form Arya Samaj for their communities in many Canadian cities including Toronto. Most major metropolitan areas of United States have chapters of Arya Samaj.\n\nMembers of the Arya Samaj believe in one almighty creator known as \"Aum\" who is mentioned in the Yajur Veda (40:17). They believe the Vedas is an infallible authority. The Arya Samaj members reject other Hindu religious texts because they are not \"revealed\" works. For instance, they believe books like the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\" are legends of historical figures, which secondarily have been used as reference to supreme beings and avatars. The members of Arya Samaj reject other scriptural works such as the Bible, and the Quran. They reject the worship of idols. The Arya Samaj promotes the equality of all human beings and the empowerment of women.\n\nThe Arya Samaj members recite the Gayatri Mantra, meditation and make offering to the holy fire '('havan). The havan can be performed without a priest in acts of personal worship. Members celebrate \"Holi\" (the start of spring) and \"Diwali\" (a harvest festival and the victory of good over evil).\n\nArya Samaj advocates a lacto-vegetarian diet and in particular, the eating of beef is strictly prohibited.\n\nAfter a death, Arya samaji will often conduct a havan and collect the ashes on the fourth day.\n\nThe Arya Samaj celebration of \"Diwali\" is typified by the celebration in Suriname. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil. A vegetarian fast is kept. The Gayatri mantra is spoken while oil lamps are lit. One Diya lamp, which is of a larger size has two wicks crossed to produce four lights, one in each direction and is lit first. The smaller lamp has one wick. The recitation of the Gayatri mantra occurs in front of a fire altar lit with sandalwood. A lamp is kept in every room except the bathroom and restroom. More lamps can be lit, which can be placed arbitrarily in the yard, living room and so on.\n\nHoli is celebrated as the conclusion of winter and the start of spring to sow the land and hope for a good harvest. This day is marked by colors and song (\"Chautal\"). It does not require specific prayer or fasting, however some people keep a vegetarian fast on this day. The Arya Samaj does not associate Holi with a particular deity such as Vishnu or Shiva and in comparison to some interpretations of the festival, the Arya Samaj version in more sober and is as per the 4 Vedas.\n\n"}

At this point, it is traditional for the Rabbi to pronounce a blessing upon the couple. The bride wears this veil until the conclusion of the chuppah ceremony. \n\nThe custom of a virgin bride wearing a veil is mentioned in the Talmud. \n\nThe veiling itself is a symbol of modesty, based upon the verse in connection with Rebecca meeting Isaac, \"[T]hen she took her veil and covered herself.\" The practice of the groom uncovering the veil comes from when Jacob married Leah by accident because her face was veiled, when he really wanted to marry Rachel.\n\nSome maintain that the Badeken ceremony is the meaning of the term \"chuppah\" (Hebrew for \"covering\") mentioned in the Talmud and thus has legal ramifications.\n\n"}
{"id": "28580580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28580580", "title": "Bahá'í Faith and Hinduism", "text": "Bahá'í Faith and Hinduism\n\nHinduism is recognized in the Bahá'í Faith as one of nine known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of Bahá'u'lláh (Kalki avatar). Krishna is included in the succession of Manifestations of God. The authenticity of the Hindu scriptures is seen as uncertain.\n\nBahá'u'lláh was familiar with Hinduism, which is clear from a tablet to Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl, the English translation of which is included in the volume \"Tabernacle of Unity\". In this tablet Bahá'u'lláh answered questions about Hinduism and Zoroastrianism by Maneckji Limji Hataria. The subjects include comparative religion, and constitute, while much remains implicit, a dialogue of Bahá'u'lláh with Hinduism and the other religions discussed, giving an understanding of what Baha'u'llah meant with the unity of the world religions.\n\nIn another tablet (published in \"Gleanings\", section LXXXVII) Bahá'u'lláh discussed the absence of records about history before Adam. Here he refers to the \"Jug-Basisht\" (\"Book of Juk\"), which is the Persian translation of the \"Yoga Vasistha\", a syncretic philosophic text. The translation was done during the Mughal Dynasty in the sixteenth century A.D. and became popular in Persia among intellectuals with Indo-Persian interests since then. In the \"\", a chapter of the \"Yoga Vasistha\", a very old sage, Bhusunda, recalls a succession of epochs in the earth's history, as described in Hindu cosmology. Juan Cole states that this means that in dating Creation, Bahá'u'lláh promotes the theory of a long chronology over a short one.\n\nIn Hinduism Brahman is believed to be the Absolute Reality. Followers of Vedanta see Brahman as an impersonal reality, of which each soul (ātman) is a part. The theistic traditions of Hinduism, which include Vaishnavism and Shaivism, consider Brahman as a personal God, whom they call Bhagwan or Ishvara (Lord). According to the Bahá'í teachings these differing views are all valid, as they represent different points of view looking at the Absolute Reality.\n\nBoth Hinduism and the Bahá'í Faith teach that God manifests himself at different times and places. These messengers are termed Avatars in Hinduism and Manifestations of God in the Bahá'í teachings. However the difference is that Hinduism teaches that Avatars are God himself in human form and are thus divine while Bahá'í teachings stress that the Manifestations of God are not God but his representatives. \n\nThe Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God as God cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of a Manifestation of God emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man. A common Bahá'í analogy used to explain the relationship between the Manifestation of God and God is that of a perfect mirror. In the analogy, God is likened to the Sun – the source of physical life on earth. The spirit and attributes of God are likened to the rays of the Sun, and the Manifestations of God are likened to perfect mirrors reflecting the rays of the Sun. Thus, the Manifestations of God act as pure mirrors that reflect the attributes of God onto this material world.\n\nIn Hinduism many deities, depicted in images and murti (statues), are worshipped. Many Hindus realize that all these deities represent different aspects of the one God, Brahman. The Bahá'í teachings state that in this day, when mankind is reaching the state of maturity, images are not needed anymore to form an idea of God.\n\nThere are many similarities in the ethical and moral teachings of Hinduism and the Bahá'í Faith. These include subject as contemplation, detachment, faith, love, non-violence, purity, respect for parents, righteousness, self-control, right speech, not stealing, truth, virtue, work as worship.\n\nThe speedy growth of the Indian Bahá'í community since the 1960s was influenced by adapting the Bahá'í teachings for presentation in a clearly Hindu context familiar to the people of the countryside - using principles and language familiar to them:\n\nMahatma Gandhi and writer Rabindranath Tagore, both Hindus, had contact with Bahá'ís on several occasions. In his book \"Mahatma Gandhi and the Bahá'ís\", M.V. Gandhimohan analyzes similarities and differences between Gandhi's thought and the Bahá'í teachings. Gandhi called the Bahá'í Faith \"a solace to humankind\". \n\nTagore met 'Abdu'l-Bahá in Chicago, United States, in 1912, a few months before his Nobel-prize winning collection of poetry \"Gitanjali\" was first published in English. 'Abdu'l-Bahá later wrote about Tagore that \"he is one of the promoters of peace and reconciliation. He is kind to all people\". Tagore, who was also the secretary of the Hindu reform movement Adi Brahmo Samaj, stated that \"the ideals of my university (Visva-Bharati) Santiniketan, Bengal, India, are quite akin to the universal ideals of Bahá’u’lláh. Visva-Bharati cherishes the ideal of an active co-operation between the different religions and cultures of the East and the West, and nothing would please me more than to offer a permanent place at my university to the culture and research of the great religion founded by the Prophet Bahá’u’lláh.\". On another occasion he stated that Bahá’u’lláh \"is the latest Prophet to come out of Asia. His life is certainly a glorious record of unflinching human search after truth; and his message is of great importance for the progress of civilization.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4388950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4388950", "title": "Bahá'í prophecies", "text": "Bahá'í prophecies\n\nThroughout the Bahá'í writings, future events have been prophesied. The most specific prophecies are related to the rise and fall of leaders and organizations. Most of these prophesies can be found in Bahá'u'lláh's tablets to the kings and rulers of the world and in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.\n\nParticularly potent to early Bahá'ís was Bahá'u'lláh's prediction in 1868–69 of the fall of Sultan Abdülaziz, who was deposed in 1876. Other prophecies, including statements from `Abdu'l-Bahá, are general in nature, relating to the nature of future society, and the rise of the Bahá'í Faith to prominence.\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote a condemnatory letter to then Sultan `Abdu'l-`Azíz (r. 1861-1876), the original of which has been lost. Originals of three other letters addressing two of the Sultan's ministers are recorded in \"Summons of the Lord of Hosts\", which also mention the Sultan. The letters condemn their misrule, abuse of civil power, and character; especially their role in Bahá'u'lláh's banishments and imprisonment.\n\nTwo of the three letters, the \"Súriy-i-Ra'ís\" and the \"Lawh-i-Fu'ád\", predict that `Abdu'l-`Azíz will lose control of the Ottoman Empire. In 1868 Bahá'u'lláh wrote,\n\nLater in 1869, Bahá'u'lláh compares the Sultan and his Prime Minister `Alí Páshá to Nimrod and Pharaoh who rose up against Abraham and Moses and writes that they will lose power:\nSultan `Abdu'l-`Azíz was deposed on May 30, 1876 and a fortnight later he was found dead in the palace where he had been confined, and trustworthy medical evidence attributed his death to suicide although many people believed he was murdered by a conspiracy.\n\nThe prophecies regarding the downfall of the Sultan played an important role in the conversion of Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl, one of the Bahá'í Faith's foremost scholars, after the fulfilment of the prophecies.\n\nBahá'u'lláh addressed two letters to `Alí Páshá (\"Súriy-i-Ra'ís\" and \"Lawh-i-Ra'ís\") and an additional letter written reflecting on the death of Fu'ád Páshá (\"Lawh-i-Fu'ád\"), both of whom served at different times as Grand Viziers of Sultan `Abdu'l-`Azíz. Among the strong condemnations of the ministers, written from 1868-1869, Bahá'u'lláh also predicts the downfall of `Alí Pashá (referred to as the \"Chief\"). Writing to him in the Súriy-i-Ra’ís, Bahá'u'lláh says:\n\nWriting to him in the Lawh-i-Ra'ís, Bahá'u'lláh says:\n\nFu'ád Páshá died of a heart disorder in February 1869. `Alí Páshá tried to perform the vacant role of foreign minister as well as prime minister, but also began having health problems, later getting tuberculosis and dying in September of 1871. After his death, his reforms were changed and his enemies returned from exile. Five years later the government was reformed, and the steady decline of the empire culminated in its dissolution during World War I. \n\nJuan Cole wrote a commentary on the prophecies, suggesting that \"predictions of the Sultán's downfall, such as Bahá'u'lláh made in that Tablet, were not unusual but rather were commonplaces...\" He continues, \nNapoleon III was the Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1870. In 1869 Bahá'u'lláh wrote to him in one of the five chapters that compose the \"Súriy-i-Haykal\". In the tablet Bahá'u'lláh writes that if Napoleon III does not follow Bahá'u'lláh he will lose his kingdom and that commotion will occur in France:\n\nWithin the year, in battle against Prussia in July 1870, the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan (September 2) and was deposed by the forces of the Third Republic in Paris two days later; he was sent into exile to England where he died.\n\nAfter Napoleon's capture by the Prussians, General Louis Jules Trochu and the politician Léon Gambetta overthrew the Second Empire and established the \"Government of National Defence\" which later became the conservative Third Republic. Its creation was overshadowed by the subsequent revolution in Paris known as the Paris Commune, which maintained a radical regime for two months until its bloody suppression in May 1871.\n\nBahá'u'lláh prophesied the fall of the Caliphate, the title of the head of state in Sunni Islam. From 1517 onwards, the Ottoman sultan was also the Caliph of Islam, and the Ottoman Empire was, from 1517 until 1922 (or 1924), synonymous with the Caliphate or the Islamic State. Addressing the people of Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Bahá'u'lláh, in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" which was completed in 1873, claims that the leaders of Constantinople, the Caliph, has been a source of tyranny, and that they will lose control:\n\nOn March 3, 1924, the first President of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Atatürk, constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers were transferred to the Turkish Grand National Assembly (parliament) of the newly formed Turkish nation-state and the title has since been inactive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote:\n\nSome point to this as a statement about the discovery of nuclear energy and the use of nuclear weapons. Bahá'u'lláh also wrote that planets would be found around other star systems, and that life would be found on those planets:\n\nIn 1873 Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\":\n\nThis is elaborated specifically:\n\nShoghi Effendi wrote:\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\":\n\nThe first sign refers to the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script:\nThe second sign refers to the emergence of a \"divine philosophy\" which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements:\nIn Bahá'u'lláh's tablet addressed to Shaykh Salmán, he mentions a third sign, which is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship:\n\nShoghi Effendi wrote:\n\nThis commonwealth must consist of:\n\nFurther features:\n\nShoghi Effendi wrote:\n\nOn Ridván 1863, the period in which Bahá'u'lláh made public his claim to have received a revelation from God, he stated that the next Manifestation of God will not appear before 1000 years have passed:\n\nIn the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" Bahá'u'lláh stated:\n\nIn a similar verse he says:\n\nIn the \"Ma’idiy-i-Asmani\", Bahá’u’lláh anticipates a different “proof ” for the next Manifestation of God:\n\n\n \n"}

Lower ranks of Privy Chamberlains (Honorary Chamberlains of Purple Robes, Chamberlains \"extra Urbem\", Honorary Privy Chaplains, and Honorary Chaplains \"extra Urbem\") were abolished, making Chaplain of His Holiness the first (lowest) of the three ranks of Monsignor.\n\nThe role of Chaplain of His Holiness dates to the time of Pope Urban VIII. Such Chaplains have provided unpaid service since the pontificate of Pope Pius VI. The nomination of candidates \"extra urbem\" may be granted at the request of their bishop through the Apostolic Nunciature, subject to the examination of the merits of the person considered for this rank and to the criteria of the Holy See.

According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.19 billion Christians around the world in 2010, more than three times as much from the 600 million recorded in 1910, however this rate of growth is slower than the overall population growth over the same time period. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, by 2050, the Christian population is expected to be 3.0 billion.\n\nChristian fertility rate is 2.7 children per woman, which is higher than the global average fertility rate of 2.5. Globally, Christians were only slightly older (median age of 30) than the global average median age of 28 in 2010. According to Pew Research religious switching is projected to have a modest impact on changes in the Christian population. According to the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\", approximately 2.7 million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" also cited that Christianity rank at first place in net gains through religious conversion. While according to \"The Oxford Handbook of Religious Conversion\", approximately 15.5 million converting to Christianity annually from another religion, while approximately 11.7 million leave Christianity annually, and most of them become irreligious, resulting in a net gain of 3.8 million. Christianity earns about 65.1 million people annually due to factors such as birth rate, religious conversion and migration, while losing 27.4 million people annually due to factors such as death rate, religious apostasy and immigration. Most of the net growth in the numbers of Christians is in Africa, Latin America and Asia.\n\nChristian fertility rate is 2.7 children per woman, which is higher than the global average fertility rate of 2.5. Globally, Christians were only slightly older (median age of 30) than the global average median age of 28 in 2010. According to Pew Research religious switching is projected to have a modest impact on changes in the Christian population.\n\nThe Christian fertility rate has varied throughout history, as with other fertility figures. The Christian fertility rate also varies from country to country. In the 20-year period from 1989–2009, the average world fertility rate decreased from 3.50 to 2.58, a fall of 0.92 children per women, or 26%. The weighted average fertility rate for Christian nations decreased in the same period from 3.26 to 2.58, a fall of 0.68 children per women, or 21%. The weighted average fertility rate for Muslim nations decreased in the same period from 5.17 to 3.23, a fall of 1.94 children per women, or 38%. While Muslims have an average of 3.1 children per woman—the highest rate of all religious groups—Christians are second, with 2.7 children per woman.\n\nThe gap in fertility between the Christian- and Muslim-dominated nations fell from 67% in 1990 to 17% in 2010. If the trend continues, the Muslim and Christian fertility rates will converge in around 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2015 study estimates 60,000 Muslims converted to Christianity in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 1991/2001/2011-Census, the number of Christians in Canada has decreased from 22.5 million to 22.1 million.\n\nThe United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\n\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \"What is your religion, if any?\" Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\n\nAmong the Asian population in the United States, conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. By 2012 the percentage of Christians in these communities was 71%, 31%, and 38% respectively.\n\nData from the Pew Research Center states that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, most as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jew or are Jews by ancestry.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, Christianity loses more people than it gains from religious conversion. It found that 23% of Americans raised as Christians no longer identified with Christianity, whereas 6% of current Christians were converts. This was in contrast to Islam in America, where the number of people who leave the religion is roughly equal to the number who convert to it. The National Catholic Register claims that in 2015 there were 450,000 American Muslim converts to Christianity and that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the United States.\n\nReligious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008<br>Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group.\n\nHighlights:\n\n"}

{"id": "22765675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22765675", "title": "Harper's Songs", "text": "Harper's Songs\n\nHarper's Songs are ancient Egyptian texts that originated in tomb inscriptions of the Middle Kingdom (but found on papyrus texts until the Papyrus Harris 500 of the New Kingdom) which in the main praise life after death and were often used in funerary contexts. These songs display varying degrees of hope in an afterlife that range from the skeptical through to the more traditional expressions of confidence. These texts are accompanied by drawings of blind harpists and are therefore thought to have been sung. Thematically they have been compared with The Immortality of Writers in their expression of rational skepticism.\n\nThe distinction between songs, hymns and poetry in Ancient Egyptian texts is not always clear. The convention is to treat as songs those poetic texts which are depicted with musical instruments. If the songs are seen to have a clear connection with temple cults and festivals then they are commonly described as hymns. Poetic texts which are found in some tombs which are shown with scenes of labor are compared with songs sung by Egyptian laborers in the modern era and are also therefore classified as songs. Other songs relate to the cult of the dead and are nearly always depicted with harps from which the title \"Harper's Songs\" is derived. Since the songs are reflections on death, rather than being part of the rituals associated with burial, freer expression of thoughts is encountered in these texts. Songs sought to reassure the owner of the tomb about his fate after death by way of praise. The greater freedom, in the case Harper's Song from the Tomb of King Intef, even went so far as to doubt the reality of an afterlife, lamenting death and advising that life should be enjoyed whilst it could. Miriam Lichtheim viewed this as introducing a more skeptical strand of thought which would be reflected in works such as the \"Dispute between a Man and His Ba\" and other Harper's Songs.\n\nThe short song from the funerary stela of Iki is depicted with the deceased sitting at an offering table with his wife and the rotund harpist Neferhotep sitting in front of them:\n\nO tomb, you were built for festivity,\nYou were founded for happiness!\nThe singer Neferhotep, born of Henu.\n\nThe stela of Nebankh from Abydos contains a Harper's Song with the deceased shown seated at the offering table with the harpist squatting in front of him:\n\nThe singer Tjeniaa says:\nHow firm you are in your seat of eternity,\nYour monument of everlastingness!\nIt is filled with offerings of food,\nIt contains every good thing.\nYour ka is with you,\nIt does not leave you,\nO Royal Seal-Bearer, Great Steward, Nebankha!\nYours is the sweet breath of the northwind!\nSo says his singer who keeps his name alive,\nThe honorable singer Tjeniaa, whom he loved,\nWho sings to his ka every day.\nA song from the tomb of Paatenemheb, which dates from the reign of Akhenaten, is described in its introductory line as having been copied from the tomb of a King Intef, (a name used by several kings from 11th and 17th dynasties) It is also preserved in the Ramesside New Kingdom Harris 500 papyrus. These works are accepted by scholars as being a copy of a genuine Middle Kingdom text. The song suggests a person should enjoy the good things in life, avoid contemplation of death and expresses doubt about the reality of an afterlife. \nMake holiday, don't weary of it!!\nLook, there is no one allowed to take their things with them, \nand there is no one who goes away comes back again.\n\nComparison have been made between the sentiments expressed in the above text with a description by Herodotus from a much later period of how a banquet for the rich in Egypt would culminate with a wooden effigy of the deceased being passed around with the saying \"Look upon this!\" and \"drink and rejoice, for thou shalt be as this.\"\n\nHarpers Songs from the New Kingdom period respond to the rational skepticism displayed in this song by way of outright rejection of impiety or by moderating the skepticism.\n\nIn the case of the priest Neferhotep the three Harper's songs found in his tomb display a full range of viewpoints. In one the sceptical position is blended with the more conventional expressions of hope, the second rejects skepticism, whilst the third is a ritualistic affirmation in life after death.\n\nI have heard those songs that are in the ancient tombs,\nAnd what they tell\nExtolling life on earth and belittling the region of the dead.\nWherefore do they thus, concerning the land of eternity,\nThe just and the fair,\nWhich has no terrors?\n\nWrangling is its abhorrence; no man there girds himself against his fellow.\nIt is a land against which none can rebel.\nAll our kinsfolk rest within it, since the earliest day of time;\nThe offspring of millions are come hither, every one.\nFor none may tarry in the land of Egypt,\nNone there is who has not passed yonder.\n\nThe span of earthly things is as a dream;\nBut a fair welcome is given him who has reached the West.\n\n\nHarper´s song sung in Spanish by Macarena Fajardo Vicente-Ortega\n"}

It was brought to the West from India by Sri Swami Satchidananda Saraswati. Its aim is to integrate body, mind, and spirit by combining physical practices and philosophical approaches to life in order to develop the physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of individuals. \nThe system includes the practices of asana, pranayama, and meditation as a way to develop physical and mental stillness in order to access inner peace and joy, which Swami Satchidananda believed was a person's true nature. It also encourages practitioners to live service-oriented lives.\n\nIntegral Yoga is also based on interfaith understanding. Swami Satchidananda taught that all religions share essential universal principles and encouraged Integral Yogis to respect and honor the unity in diversity, summarized by his motto, \"Truth is one, paths are many.\" It is not a religion, but a combination of teachings that form the foundation of spiritual practice. Its branches are not hierarchical in nature; practitioners can find a combination of practices that suits their individual needs.\n\nClasses in all facets of Integral Yoga are taught at Integral Yoga Institutes, Integral Yoga Teaching Centers around the world, and its headquarters, Satchidananda Ashram–Yogaville, in Buckingham, Virginia.\n\nThe main practices of Integral Yoga focus on restoring the ease and peace of the body and mind. Swami Satchidananda said that \"dis-ease\"—the disturbance of one's natural ease—is the cause of disease, so prevention and restoration are the hallmarks of Integral Yoga practices.\n\nThe teachings of Integral Yoga are rooted in the system of Yoga formalized by the sage Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Foundational teachings include moral and ethical precepts (yama and niyama), which include non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, moderation, non-greed, purity, contentment, self-discipline, spiritual study, and leading a dedicated or selfless life.\nIntegral Yoga synthesizes the following six branches of classical Yoga.\n\n\n\nIn 1966, filmmaker Conrad Rooks invited Swami Satchidananda to visit Europe. During this visit, he was invited to give talks and classes at Divine Life Societies throughout Europe. He returned to Europe thereafter, having received invitations to speak on Integral Yoga at Yoga conferences, at Yoga centers, and to serve as an advisor to Yoga organizations.\n\nDuring the first European visit, Pop artist Peter Max consulted with Rooks and then suggested that Swami Satchidananda visit America on his return to the East. A two-day visit led to an extended stay in order to teach Integral Yoga to American students.\n\nOn October 7, 1966, the first Integral Yoga Institute was founded on the Upper West Side of New York City. There, Swami Satchidananda, and some of his newly trained students began leading classes for the general public in Hatha, meditation, breath work, and stress management. In August 1968, a group of students took up residence in an apartment in the 500 West End Avenue building to immerse themselves in the yogic lifestyle, forming the first Integral Yoga ashram.\n\nSwami Satchidananda's students in New York City planned and organized a public lecture on Integral Yoga for him to deliver at Carnegie Hall. There, a sold-out Hatha demonstration and lecture took place in January 1969. Later that year in August, Swami Satchidananda was invited to give the invocation at the opening of the Woodstock Music and Art Festival.\n\nSoon after, Swami Satchidananda's weekly lectures on Integral Yoga moved to the Universalist Church on Central Park West, as crowds became larger. Finally, in 1970, a large building in New York's West Village was purchased, which continues to be the site of the Integral Yoga Institute today. The members of the Institute opened New York's first vegetarian food store, Integral Yoga Natural Foods, in 1972. It remains the only all-vegetarian health food store in Manhattan.\n\nMore Integral Yoga Institutes, teaching centers, and ashrams opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s across America. In 1975, Integral Yoga established one of the first Yoga teacher training certification programs and, in 1999, joined with other US-based Yoga lineages to form the Yoga Alliance.\n\nSome followers criticised the founder for sexual misconduct and protested against him at Woodstock in 1991.\n\nToday, Integral Yoga Institutes and Centers exist on six continents. The international headquarters of Integral Yoga, Satchidananda Ashram–Yogaville, in Buckingham, Virginia, is a large community and programs center dedicated to the teachings of Swami Satchidananda and Integral Yoga.\n\nIn 1972, many people attending programs at the Integral Yoga centers and institutes in America expressed interest in developing residential Yoga communities, or ashrams. Yogaville West, the first Satchidananda Ashram was located in Seigler Springs, California. In 1973, a second ashram opened in Pomfret, Connecticut, which became the headquarters for the Integral Yoga organization.\n\nIn 1980, due to severe winters, Swami Satchidananda closed the Connecticut ashram and moved the community to Buckingham, Virginia. Satchidananda Ashram–Yogaville, serves as Integral Yoga's world headquarters and is home to the Light Of Truth Universal Shrine (LOTUS). As of 2015, around 220 people lived permanently in Yogaville, and 2,000 to 3,000 guests were visiting each year. Yogaville operates as a residential spiritual community, Yoga retreat and programs center, and as a Yoga training center, offering teacher trainings, workshops, vegetarian cooking courses, and programs designed around the teachings of Integral Yoga.\n\nLocated on the grounds of Satchidananda Ashram—Yogaville, the Integral Yoga Academy is a training center that offers certification courses in Hatha Yoga and therapeutic Yoga, as well as continuing education courses for health care professionals. This academy operates year-round, offering residential programs that encourage students to immerse themselves in a \"yogic lifestyle\" based on the teachings of Integral Yoga.\n\nIntegral Yoga provides a methodology for the prevention and rehabilitation of a wide range of health concerns. The integrated approach of Integral Yoga can be used to address specific issues such as pain management, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, backache, hypertension, and various types of mobility-related health challenges promoting optimal health and wellness.\n\nNumerous students of Swami Satchidananda have developed successful applications of therapeutic Yoga based on the wellness foundations of Integral Yoga. One of the most well-researched applications is Dr. Dean Ornish's program for preventing and reversing heart disease. Programs such as Sonia Sumar's Yoga for the Special Child, Nischala Devi's Yoga for the Heart, Mala Cunningham's Cardiac Yoga, Jnani Chapman's Yoga Therapy in Cancer and Chronic Illness, and Jivana Heyman's Accessible Yoga are a few further examples of such therapeutic applications.\n\n"}

{"id": "40950307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40950307", "title": "Jainism and Hinduism", "text": "Jainism and Hinduism\n\nJainism and Hinduism are two ancient Indian religions. There are some similarities and differences between the two religions. Temples, gods, rituals, fasts and other religious components of Jainism are different from those of Hinduism.\n\n\"Jain\" is derived from the word \"Jina\", referring to a human being who has conquered all inner passions (like anger, attachment, greed and pride) and possesses Kevala Jnana (pure infinite knowledge). Followers of the path shown by the Jinas are called Jains. Followers of Hinduism are called Hindus.\n\nJainism and Hinduism have many similar characteristic features, including the concepts of \"samsara\", \"karma\" and \"moksha\". However, they differ over the precise nature and meaning of these concepts. The doctrine of Jainism has minor similarities with the Nyaya-Vaisheshika and samkhya school. The Jain doctrine teaches atomism which is also found in the Vaisheshika system and atheism which is found in Samkhya. Within the doctrine of Jainism, there exist many metaphysical concepts which are not known in Hinduism, some of which are \"dharma\" and Adharma tattva (which are seen as substances within the Jain metaphysical system), Gunasthanas and Lesyas. The epistemological concepts of Anekantavada and Syadvada are not found in the Hindu system. There were, in the past, attempts made to merge the concepts of Hindu gods and the Tirthankara of Jainism. The cosmography of Hindus resembles that of the Jains and there are similar names of heavenly gods within these systems.\n\nIn the Upanishads, there also occur the first statements of the view, dominant in Jainist teachings and elsewhere, that rebirth is undesirable and that it is possible by controlling or stopping one's actions to put an end to it and attain a state of deliverance (moksha) which lies beyond action.\n\nIn Hinduism, moksha means merging of soul with universal soul or eternal being and escaping the cycle of births and deaths; in Jainism, it is action-less and peaceful existence. In Vedic philosophy or Sanatana Dharma, salvation is giving up the sense of being a doer and realizing Self to be the same as Universe and God. In Jainism, salvation can be achieved only through self-effort and is considered to be the right of human beings.\n\nIn Jainism, one definite path to attain liberation (moksha) is prescribed. The prescribed threefold path consists of the three jewels of Jainism (Right belief, Right knowledge, Right conduct). In Hinduism, no one definite path to salvation is prescribed.\n\nAccording to Jain cosmology, the universe is eternal, it is neither created nor it can be destroyed. In Hinduism, it is believed to by a creator, and destroyed by God, to be created again. \n\nKarma is an invisible force in Hinduism, whereas in Jainism it is a form of matter which can stick to the soul.\n\nIn Hinduism, Gods are worshiped in several ways and for several reasons such as knowledge, peace, wisdom, health, and it also believed to be one's duty to pray god as God is considered as our maker (as we originated from them and we are staying in them and at last will merge with them), for moksham (by attaining moksham we can join him and escape this Maya or dualistic nature which makes us think that we are different from the universal soul) and are also offered food as a respect, etc. In Jainism, the Tirthankaras represent the true goal of all human beings, their qualities are worshiped by the Jains.\n\nThe religion of Jains included women in their fourfold \"sangha\"; the religious order of Jain laymen, laywomen, monks and nuns. There was a disagreement between early Hinduism, and ascetic movements such as Jainism with the scriptural access to women. However, the early svetambara scriptures prevented pregnant women, young women or those who have a small child, to enter to the ranks of nun. Regardless, the number of nuns given in those texts were always double the number of monks. Parshvanatha and Mahavira, the two historical teachers of Jainism, had large numbers of female devotees and ascetics. Tirthankara Mahavira and Jain monks are credited with raising the status of women.\n\nHindus do not accept any Jain text and Jains do not recognize any Hindu scripture.\n\nThe scriptures known as Vedas are regarded by Hindus as one of the foundations of Hinduism. Those who rejected the Vedas as the prime source of religious knowledge were labeled \"nāstika\". As a consequence, Jainism and Buddhism were categorized as \"nāstika darśana\".\n\nThe orthodox schools of Hinduism, such as Vedanta, Mimamsa and Samkhya, claim the Sruti do not have any author and hence are supreme to other religious scriptures. This position was countered by Jains who said that saying Vedas are authorless was equivalent to saying that anonymous poems are written by nobody. Jain scriptures, on the contrary, were believed by them to be of human origin, brought through omniscient teachers, and hence claimed greater worth. According to Jains, the origin of Vedas lies with Marichi, the son of Bharata Chakravarti, who was the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabha. Jains maintain that these scriptures were later modified. Jains pointed that Hindus do not know their own scriptures since they were unaware of the names of tirthankaras present in Vedas.\n\nJains had a long-standing debate with Mimamsa school of Hinduism. Kumarila Bhatta, a proponent of Mimamsa school, argued that the Vedas are the source of all knowledge and it is through them that humans can differentiate between right and wrong. Jain monks, such as Haribhadra, held that humans are already in possession of all the knowledge, which only needs to be illuminated or uncovered in order to gain the status of omniscience.\n\nThe practice of Vedic animal sacrifices was opposed by Jains. Hemachandra, a Jain monk, cites passages from Manusmriti, one of the law book of Hindus, to demonstrate how, in light of false scriptures, Hindus have resorted to violence. Akalanka, another Jain monk, sarcastically said that if killing can result in enlightenment, one should become a hunter or fisherman.\n\nThe rejection of Hindu epics and scriptures were dominant in Jainism since very early times. The central Hindu scriptures and epics like Vedas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are categorized as false scriptures in Nandi-sutra, one of the svetambara's canonical literature. Later, Jains adapted various Hindu epics in accordance with their own system. There were disputes between Jains and Hindus in form of these epics.\n\nWithin the doctrine of Jainism, the \"tirthankara\" holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a \"deva\" (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus are considered worldly having desires for women and weapons. Hence their path for spiritual upliftment and salvation is rejected by the Jains.\n\nSome personage mentioned in the Vedas and Jain scriptures are same. There is mention of the first tirthankara, Rishabhanatha in Rig Veda and Vishnu Purana. Rig Veda, X. 12. 166 states- \n\nVishnu Purāna mentions:\n\nIn the Skanda Purana (chapter 37) it is stated that \"Rishabha was the son of Nabhiraja, and Rishabha had a son named Bharata, and after the name of this Bharata, this country is known as Bharata-varsha.\"\n\nIn the \"Brahmottara-candam\" section of the \"Brahma Purana\", the narrator Suta describes many matters relating to Shaivism and in the 16th portion, there is a story about Bhadrabahu receiving instructions in a mantra from Rishabha yogi.\n\nThe \"Linga Purana\" mentions that in every kali yuga, Lord Shiva has incarnated, and that in one kali yuga he was a Yogeshwara (one of His 28 incarnations) named Rishabha.\n\nJainism is considered by some to be distinct from Vedic religion and from a pre-Aryan tradition viz. \"Sramana\" or \"Aarahata\" tradition.\n\nJains and Hindus have coexisted in Tamil country since at least the second century BCE.\n\nCompetition between Jains and Brahmans, between Jains and Shaivas, is a frequent motif of all medieval western Indian narratives, but the two communities for the most part coexisted and coprospered. Shaiva kings patronised Jain mendicants, and Jain officials patronised Brahmana poets.\n\nAround the 8th century CE, Hindu philosopher Ādi Śaṅkarācārya tried to restore the Vedic religion. Śaṅkarācārya brought forward the doctrine of Advaita. The Vaishnavism and Shaivism also began to rise. This was particularly in the southern Indian states.\n\nAccording to a Saivite legend, the Pandya king Koon Pandiyan ordered a massacre of 8,000 Jain monks. This event is depicted graphically in walls of Tivatur in North Arcot. However, this legend is not found in any Jain text, and is believed to be a fabrication made up by the Saivites to prove their dominance.\n\nJain scholars and some monks in general allowed a sort of cautious integration with the Hindu society. In today's date, there are a lot of common aspects in social and cultural life of Hindus and Jains. It is quite difficult to differentiate a lay Jain from a lay Hindu. The Jain code of conduct is quite similar to that which is found in Hindu Dharmasashtra, Manusmriti and other Law books of Brahmans. Many Jains now worship Hindu gods and celebrate Hindu festivals. The difference in the rituals of practitioners of the two religions would be that the Jains do not give any importance to bathing in holy water, cremating or burying ascetics. According to religious scholar M. Whitney Kelting, some of the \"names and narratives\" in the Hindu's list of satis are also found in the Jain tradition. In the Hindu context, a sati is a virtuous wife who protects her husband and his family and has the \"intention to die before, or with,\" her husband. Kelting notes that those satis who die on the funeral pyre of their husband, or who \"intended to die\" but were prevented from death, may attain a status called satimata. Kelting says that the Jain tradition, due to principle of non-violence and equanimity, doesn't allow self-immolation. They, instead, see renunciation rather than self-sacrifice as the highest ideal for a Jain sati. Hindus think Jainism is simply another branch of Hinduism. Jain apologist like Champat Rai Jain, held that Hindus are Jaina allegorists who have allegorised the Jain teachings. However, such claims are not supported by historical facts.\n\nWith the onset of British colonialism, select groups of Indians developed responses to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism. In this context, various responses toward Jainism developed.\n\nThe Arya Samaj was founded by Dayanand Saraswati (1824-1883), who \"was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Satyarth Prakash, a book containing the basic teachings of Saraswati and the Arya Samaj. It contains \"Dayananda's bitter criticisms of the major \"non-Vedic\" religions of Indian origins.\" In the \"Satyarth Prakash\", he writes that he regarded Jainism as \"the most dreadful religion\", and that Jains are \"possessed of defective and childish understanding.\"\n\nA recent strategy, exemplified by Rajiv Malhotra, is the use of the term \"dharma\" as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism.\n\nDharmasthala Temple shows the communal harmony between Jains and Hindus, as the priests of the temple are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a Jain Bunt family.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1972, coming out of Jesus People Milwaukee during the Jesus movement, it is one of the largest continuing communities. In 1989, JPUSA joined the Evangelical Covenant Church as a member congregation, and currently has eight pastors credentialed with the ECC. The community organized the annual Cornerstone Festival from 1984 until 2012.\n\nToday Jesus People USA is \"one of the largest single-site communes in the United States\" and is certainly one of the few communes with such an eclectic cultural mix of hippies, punks, \"crusties\" and other members from various subcultures.\n\n\"Cornerstone\" magazine and the Christian rock band the Resurrection Band are part of the JPUSA community. In recent years, Resurrection Band disbanded, but Glenn Kaiser continues touring and playing, both solo and with the blues-based GKB (Glenn Kaiser Band). JPUSA also has its own recording company, Grrr Records. JPUSA was once the home of film producer/art promoter Anthony Cox (who was formerly the husband of Yoko Ono) and their daughter Kyoko, singer/songwriter Daniel Smith as well as bass player/vocalist Christian Wargo.\n\nIn 1993 JPUSA elders learned that Dr. Ronald Enroth was researching a sequel to his book \"Churches That Abuse\", which was said to mention issues of abuse within JPUSA. Despite efforts of elders to convince Enroth to edit JPUSA out of the book, it was published in 1994 and included a full chapter of accounts of alleged abuse within the group. The release of the book set off a \"firestorm of debate among religious scholars.\" JPUSA elders referred to the book as \"poison in the well.\" Ruth Tucker, a professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, defended the movement, saying Enroth was \"sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed.\" Paul R. Martin, the director of Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of \"abusive groups,\" supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA \"displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly authoritarian and totalistic groups.\" Ronald Enroth himself responded to JPUSA in the book, in part, with:\n\nThere has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.\n\nAccording to a later newspaper article, as a result of the book's mention of JPUSA, \"scores\" of members decided to leave the group.\n\nIn 2001, the \"Chicago Tribune\" published a two-part article primarily critical of the movement, with quotes from several ex-members accusing the group of authoritarian practices. One of the JPUSA activities criticized in the article includes \"adult spankings,\" employed after charismatic leader Jack Winters introduced it as a means to heal the \"inner child.\" The practice, which lasted approximately four years in the mid 1970s, was abandoned by the group, with leaders citing it as reflective of how \"spiritually immature\" the group was at the time.\n\nJPUSA issued a response to the two-part article, found on their website, which accuses the article of \"anti-religious bias and cultural intolerance.\"\n\nA lawsuit was filed in January 2014 against JPUSA and its parent denomination, the Evangelical Covenant Church claiming that children were sexually abused by members of JPUSA and its leadership covered it up for years. \"No Place to Call Home\" is a documentary that shares the stories of former children of JPUSA members who allegedly were sexually abused. As of March 3, 2015, the case was dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\nJPUSA's social significance stems more from the group's continued presence in Chicago and its historic roots in the 1960s, according to sociologist Shawn Young, one of the most contemporary significant groups from the Jesus movement era:\n\nFounded in 1972, this community is one of the most significant surviving expressions of the original Jesus Movement of the sixties and seventies and represents a radical expression of contemporary countercultural evangelicalism. JPUSA's blend of Christian Socialism, theological orthodoxy, postmodern theory and ethos of edgy artistic expression (as demonstrated at their annual music festival) prove what some scholars have longed suspected: evangelicalism is a diverse, complex movement, which simply does not yield to any attempt at categorization.\n\n"}

{"id": "449278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449278", "title": "Mohammedan", "text": "Mohammedan\n\nMohammedan (also spelled \"Muhammadan\", \"Mahommedan\", \"Mahomedan\" or \"Mahometan\") is a term for a follower of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is used as both a noun and an adjective, meaning belonging or relating to, either Muhammad or the religion, doctrines, institutions and practices that he established. The word was formerly common in usage, but the terms Muslim and Islamic are more common today. Though sometimes used stylistically by some Muslims, a vast majority consider the term a misnomer.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites 1663 as the first recorded usage of the English term; the older spelling \"Mahometan\" dates back to at least 1529. The English word is derived from New Latin \"Mahometanus\", from Medieval Latin \"Mahometus\", Muhammad. It meant simply a follower of Mohammad.\n\nIn Western Europe, down to the 13th century or so, some Christians had a mistaken belief that Muhammad had either been a heretical Christian or that he was a god worshipped by Muslims. Some works of Medieval European literature referred to Muslims as \"pagans\" or by sobriquets such as the \"paynim foe\" (enemy). Depictions, such as those in the \"Song of Roland\", show Muslims praying to a variety of \"idols\", including Apollo, Lucifer, Termagant, and Mahound. When the Knights Templar were being tried for heresy, reference was often made to their worship of a demon Baphomet; this is similar to \"Mahomet\", the Latin transliteration of Muhammad's name, and Latin was, for another 500 years, the language of scholarship and erudition for most of Europe.\n\nThese and other variations on the theme were all set in the \"temper of the times\" of the Muslim–Christian conflict, as Medieval Europe was becoming aware of its great enemy in the wake of the quickfire success of the Muslims through a series of conquests shortly after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.\n\nThe term has been largely superseded by \"Muslim\" (formerly transliterated as \"Moslem\") or \"Islamic\". \"Mohammedan\" was commonly used in European literature until at least the mid-1960s. Muslim is more commonly used today, and the term Mohammedan is widely considered archaic or in some cases even offensive.\n\nThe term remains in limited use. The Government Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College in Lahore, Pakistan retains its original name, while the similarly named \"Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College\" in Aligarh, India was renamed Aligarh Muslim University in 1920. There are also a number of sporting clubs in Bangladesh and India which include the word, such as Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka), Mohammedan Sporting Club (Chittagong), Mohammedan Sporting Club (Jhenaidah) and Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata).\n\nSome modern Muslims have objected to the term, saying that the term was not used by Muhammad himself or his early followers, and that the religion teaches the worship of Allah alone (see \"shirk\" and \"tawhid\") and not Muhammad or any other of Allah´s prophets. Thus modern Muslims believe \"Mohammedan\" is a misnomer, \"which seem[s] to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.\" Also, the term \"al-Muḥammadīya\" has been used in Islam to denote several sects considered heretical.\n\nIslam has, and has had, many schools and branches. \"Tariqa Muhammadiyya\" (the Way of Mohammad) is a school of reform Sufism that arose in the 18th century and seeks to redirect and harmonize Sufi philosophy and practices with the authority and example of the prophet and hadith.\n\nIn Indonesia, Muhammadiyah (followers of Muhammad) is the name of a Sunni socioreligious reform movement that shuns syncretistic and Sufi practices and advocates a return to a purer form of Islam based on the hadith and examples from the life of the prophet. It has adapted institutions such as the Boy Scouts to Islamic ends as the Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia.\n\n"}
{"id": "42456709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42456709", "title": "Mu (shaman)", "text": "Mu (shaman)\n\nMu 무 is an ancient Korean word defining a shaman, that is to say intermediary between the first god, gods of nature, and men, in the Korean traditional religion. Korean shamans hold rituals called \"gut\" (literally \"good\") for the welfare of the individuals and the society. In modern Korea different terms are used to define shamans, including mudang (mostly for females), baksu (only for males), tangol (for hereditary shamans) and musogin (\"people who do shamanism\", used in the context of organised shamanism).\n\nThe Korean word 무 \"mu\" is related to the Chinese 巫 \"wu\", which defines shamans of either sex. Korean shamanic terminology has, however, at least a partial origin in Siberian languages. Already in records from the Yi dynasty, \"mudang\" has a prevalent usage. \"Mudang\" itself is explained in relation to Chinese characters, as originally referring to the \"hall\", 堂 \"tang\", of a shaman. A different etymology, however, explains \"mudang\" as stemming directly from the Siberian term for female shamans, \"utagan\" or \"utakan\".\n\n\"Mudang\" is used mostly, but not exclusively, for female shamans. Male shamans are called by a variety of names, including \"sana mudang\" (literally \"male \"mudang\"\") in the Seoul area, or \"baksu mudang\", also shortened \"baksu\" (\"doctor\", \"healer\"), in the Pyongyang area. According to some scholars, \"baksu\" is an ancient authentic designation of male shamans, and locutions like \"sana mudang\" or \"baksu mudang\" are recent coinages due to the prevalence of female shamans in recent centuries. \"Baksu\" may be a Korean adaptation of terms loaned from Siberian languages, such as \"baksi\", \"balsi\" or \"bahsih\".\n\nThe theory of a Siberian origin of Korean shamanic terminology is more reasonable than theories which explain such terminology as originating in Chinese, given that Chinese culture influenced Korea only at a relatively recent stage of Korean history. Likely, when Koreans adopted Chinese characters they filtered their previously oral religious culture through the sieve of Chinese culture. Another term, mostly used in contemporary South Korea in the context of shamanic associations, is \"musogin\", which means \"people who do shamanism\".\n\nThe work of the \"mu\" is based on the holistic model, which takes into consideration, not only the whole person, but the individual's interaction with his environment, thus both the inner and outer world. The soul is considered the source of life breath, and any physical illness is considered to be inextricably linked with sickness of the soul. Illness of the mind has its cause in soul loss, intrusion or possession by malevolent spirits.\n\nThe \"gut\", rites practised by Korean shamans, have gone through a number of changes since the Silla and Goryeo periods. Even during the Joseon dynasty, which established Korean Confucianism as the state religion, shamanic rites persisted. In the past, such rites included agricultural rites, such as prayers for abundant harvest. With a shift away from agriculture in modern Korea, agricultural rites have largely been lost and modern-day shamans are more focused on the spiritual issues of urban life.\n\nIn all the myths which figuratively explain the role of the shamans, it is implied that they are media, intermediaries, of higher forms of being. They are not ordained institutionally, but receive ordination from Heaven itself. The supreme God, \"King of Heaven\"—\"Haneullim\" or \"Hwanin\"—has a key role in all the myths regarding the shamans.\n\nGenerally, these myths explain that shamans, whom in the most recent history of Korea are regarded as belonging to the lowest class of society (\"cheonmin\" 천민), have a forgotten divine or princely nature, often coming from a blood lineage that may be traced back to the early founders of civilisation. Further features of these myths are symbols of divine presence, such as the holy mountain and the holy tree, and tragic or painful experiences.\n\nThe bear is an animal often present in such myths, with parallels in the mythologies of Siberia. In such Siberian traditions, in the Chinese tradition of the Yellow Emperor and other divine progenitors, and in Korean shamanism as well, the bear is a symbol of the Big Dipper (i.e. Ursa Major), itself a symbol of the supreme God. In Korean shamanism the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and the associated divine influence, are considered fundamental for childbearing.\n\nIn a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to a mother goddess associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the \"Heavenly King\". She has different names according to different regions and associated mountains: \"Sungmo\" (\"Holy Mother\"), \"Daemo\" (\"Great Mother\"), \"Jamo\" (\"Benevolent Mother\"), \"Sinmo\" (\"Divine Mother\"), \"Nogo\" (\"Olden Maiden\"), and others. In other myths she is a mortal princess who is later turned into a goddess.\n\nThese myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the \"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\" on the top of a mountain. The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first \"mudang\". According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the Silla period, when Buddhism and influences from China had already penetrated the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region. In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland. The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people. Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers. The first \"mudang\" were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the \"mudang\" are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes.\n\nIn the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as \"Chil Kongju\" (the \"Seventh Princess\"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king. The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and casted it in a pond, but she was rescued by a Dragon King sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters. Names of the goddess in other local traditions \"Pali Kongju\" and \"Kongsim\". In the tradition of Jeju Island, where there are more male \"baksu\" than female \"mudang\", the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans.\n\nDangun is traditionally considered to be the son of \"Hwanin\", the \"Heavenly King\", and founder of the Korean nation. This myth is reputed to be older than that of the mother goddess. Myths similar to that of Dangun are found in Ainu and Siberian cultures.\n\nThe myth starts with prince \"Hwanung\" (\"Heavenly Prince\"), son of \"Hwanin\". The prince asked his father to grant him governance over Korea. Hwanin accepted, and Hwanung was sent to Earth bearing three Heavenly Seals and accompanied by three thousand followers. The prince arrived under the holy tree of sandalwood (\"Sintansu\" 신단수, 神檀樹) on the holy mountain, where he founded his holy city.\n\nAt the time of his reign, \"Ungnyeo\" or \"Ungnye\" (웅녀, 熊女)—who was a she-bear—and a tiger were living in a cave near the holy city, praying earnestly that their wish to become part of mankind might be fulfilled. \"Ungnyeo\" patiently endured weariness and hunger, and after twenty-one days she was transformed into a beautiful woman, while the tiger ran away for it could not tolerate the effort. The woman \"Ungnyeo\" was overjoyed, and visiting the sandalwood city she prayed that she might become the mother of a child.\n\nUngnye's wish was fulfilled, so that she became the queen and gave birth to a prince who was given the royal name of \"Dangun\", the \"Sandalwood King\". Dangun reigned as the first human king of Korea, giving to his kingdom the name of Joseon, \"Land of the Morning Calm\".\n\nDangun was the first shaman, intermediary between mankind and \"Haneullim\", to whom he worshipped and prayed on the behalf of his people. The importance of the worship of ancestors and gods reside in their being the mean of communion with the supreme God, \"Haneullim\". According to some scholars, the name \"Dangun\" is related to the Siberian \"Tengri\" (\"Heaven\"), while the bear is a symbol of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Later in the myth, Dangun becomes the \"Sansin\", the \"Mountain God\" (metaphorically of civilising growth, prosperity).\n\nKorean shamans may be classified into two categories: ❶ \"sessǔmu\" or \"tangol\" (당골), people who are shamans and have the right to perform rites by family lineage; and ❷ \"kangshinmu\", people who become shamans through an initiation ceremony. Hereditary shamans were historically concentrated in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, while initiated shamans were found throughout the entire peninsula but were peculiar to the northern half, the contiguous areas of China inhabited by Koreans, and the central regions along the Han River.\n\n\"Kangshinmu\" (강신무; 降神巫) are historically found throughout Korea, but they are peculiar to the central and northern regions of the peninsula and the lands of modern-day China contiguous to the northern part of the peninsula. The essential characteristic of the \"kangshinmu\" is that they acquire their status by being \"chosen\" and possessed by a god. There are two subtypes of \"kangshinmu\": ① General \"mudang\" and ② \"myǒngdu\".\n\nA person becomes a \"kangshinmu\" undergoing a period of \"shinbyeong\" (神病), \"divine illness\". The possession by the god is said to be accompanied by physical pain and psychosis. Believers assert that the \"divine illness\" may not be healed through medical treatments, but only through the full communion with the spirit.\n\n\"Mudang\" are shamans who are possessed by a god, called a \"momju\". They perform fortune telling using spiritual powers derived from their possession, and lead \"gut\" rituals involving song and dance. A sub-type of \"mudang\" is the \"sǒnmudang\" or \"posal\", who are thought to have acquired power through spiritual experience, but are still not worthy of holding an orthodox \"gut\". Many male shamans, \"baksu\", belong to this category.\n\n\"Myǒngdu\" differ from the general \"mudang\" in that they channel the spirit of a dead person, usually a young child related to the \"myǒngdu\" himself, rather than a god, and invite such spirits to take residence into shrines set up in their homes. \"Myǒngdu\" are found primarily in the Honam region of Korea.\n\n\"Seseummu\" (세습무; 世襲巫), found in the area south of the Han River, receive their status as shamans by family bloodline. There are two subtypes of \"seseummu\": ① \"Shimbang\" and ② \"tangol\".\n\n\"Shimbang\" are similar to initiated shamans, because the relationship with a god and spiritual experience are important elements in their tradition, though the right to conduct ceremonies is hereditary. Furthermore, \"shimbang\" differ from \"kangshimu\" because their bodies are not actually possessed by the god and led to celebrate the \"gut\" rite. Rather, \"shimbang\" contact the god through a medium (\"mujǒmgu\") and do not enter in full identification with the god. Endly, \"Shimbang\" do not set up and keep shrines.\n\n\"Tangol\" are a type of shaman found predominantly in the southernmost regions of the Korean peninsula, especially in Yeongnam (Gyeongsang) and Honam area (Jeolla). Each one of the \"tangol\" families of Honam had districts of influence (\"tangolpan\") in which they had the exclusive right to perform \"gut\" rites. Rituals performed by \"tangol\" involve song and dance to entertain a god or goddess. Both the rights of succession and the ceremonies have been systematised, so that they now bear the characteristics of a religious institution. Unlike other types of Korean shamans, \"tangol\" do not receive a particular god as part of an initiation ceremony and may therefore work with a variety of gods. They do not keep shrines in their homes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54778935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54778935", "title": "Our Lady of Consolation", "text": "Our Lady of Consolation\n\nStarting in the 2nd century, Catholics venerated Mary as Our Lady of Consolation, one of her earliest titles of honor. The title of \"Our Lady of Consolation\", or \"Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted\", comes from the Latin \"Consolatrix Afflictorum\". It is found in the Litany of Loreto.\n\nThe origin of this invocation is derived from the Augustinian monks who propagated this particular devotion. In 1436 the Confraternity of the Holy Cincture of Our Lady of Consolation was founded in Bologna, Italy. It was based on an Augustinian tradition which holds that Saint Monica in the fourth century, was distraught with anxiety for her wayward son, Augustine, and that Mary gave her a sash which the Virgin wore, with the assurance that whoever wore this belt would receive her special consolation and protection. Along with Augustine, and Monica, Our Lady of Consolation is one of the three patrons of the Augustinians. The \"Augustinian Rosary\" is sometimes called the \"Corona (or Crown) of Our Mother of Consolation\".\n\nIn the 1700s members of the Augustinian Order introduced devotion to Our Lady of Consolation to the island of Malta. On December 1, 1722 the Prior General of the Augustinian Order Fr Thomas Cervioni issued the Decree for the erection of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Consolation in the church of St Mark, run by the Augustinians at Rabat, although the devotion had been practiced for some time before. By this time the custom of asking for the final blessing before death in the name of Our Lady of Consolation was very popular, and the monks were given a dispensation to leave the monastery at any time to confer it. Processions in Our Lady's honor were suspended during the French occupation of 1798 to discourage the gathering of crowds. The feast day is celebrated on the last Sunday of October with pyrotechnic displays by Our Lady of Consolation Fireworks Factory.\n\nAn ancient story relates St Eusebius of Vercelli brought back an icon of Our Lady of Consolation when he was returning from exile in Egypt in 363. This icon was presented to the city of Turin. Later St Maximus, Bishop of Turin, established a small shrine to house the icon in a church dedicated to St Andrew. The icon became the object of great veneration, and the church became the Santuario della Consolata. Giuseppe Allamano, rector of the Santuario della Consolata founded the Consolata Missionaries in 1902; they brought the devotion to Africa. At the age of nineteen Joseph Marello of Turin contracted typhus. He attributed his recovery to Our Lady of Consolation and went on to found the Oblates of St. Joseph.\n\nThere are several versions of the image of Our Lady of Consolation. The original one is in Turin at the Santuario della Consolata. A star on her shoulder is characteristic of almost all the images. The traditional depiction of Our Mother of Consolation in Augustinian houses shows Mary holding the child Jesus on her lap. Jesus and Mary both hold the Augustinian cincture in their hands.\n\nIn France the dioceses of Vannes, Valence, Montpelier, Laval, Nantes, Périgueux, Tours and many others, possessed churches or chapels dedicated to Mary under this title. In 1652, Pope Innocent X encouraged devotion to Our Lady of Consolation by establishing a confraternity.\n\nThe devotion to Our Lady of Luxembourg, Comforter of the Afflicted, was initiated by the Jesuits in 1624 and led to the election of Our Lady as the protectress of the City in 1666 and of the Duchy in 1678. After the destruction of the old pilgrimage chapel at the time of the French Revolution, the statue of Our Lady of Luxembourg was moved to St. Peter church, today's Notre-Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg City. Statues depicting her can be found in niches in buildings throughout the city of Luxembourg. From there the devotion was adopted by the English Benedictine nuns of Cambrai.\n\nImmigrants from Luxembourg transposed the devotion to Our Lady of Consolation to the United States.\n\nAnother center of veneration and pilgrimage, which also adopted Our Lady, Comforter of the Afflicted is Kevelaer in Germany, not far from the Dutch border. In 1642 a copperplate engraving, representing Our Lady of Luxembourg, was installed in a sanctuary erected the same year. It is one of the best visited Catholic pilgrimage locations in north-western Europe. Pope John Paul II visited in 1987.\n\nThere is a shrine of Our Lady of Consolation in West Grinstead, in the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in England. The Shrine Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis dates from 1876 and is the first Shrine in honour of Mary to be established in England since before the Reformation. There was in the Church of St. John the Baptist at Perth, an altar inscribed to \"St. Mary of Consolation\".\n\nWith the approval of the Archbishop of Turin in northern Italy, the new church was affiliated to the original sanctuary of Our Lady of Consolation, and a painting, closely resembling the miraculous Shrine Painting in the Santuario della Consolata of Turin, enriched with similar indulgences and privileges, was brought to West Grinstead. The Shrine Statue was canonically crowned by the Papal Delegate, Bishop Butt, on behalf of Pope Leo XIII, in July 1893.\n\nThe Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación is located in Táriba, Venezuela. The Augustinian church of Our Mother of Consolation in the Shiroyama district of Nagasaki is also named in her honor.\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of Consolation is one of the solemnities not inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, but which are observed in particular places, regions, churches or religious institutes. Augustinians observe September 4; the Benedictines July 5.\n\nThe popular girls name \"Consuela\" is derived from this title.\n"}

{"id": "29861326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29861326", "title": "Red Basilica", "text": "Red Basilica\n\nThe \"Red Basilica\" (Turkish: \"Kızıl Avlu\"), also called variously the Red Hall and Red Courtyard, is a monumental ruined temple in the ancient city of Pergamon, now Bergama, in western Turkey. The temple was built by the Roman Empire, probably in the time of Hadrian and possibly on his orders. It is one of the largest Roman structures still surviving in the ancient Greek world. The temple is thought to have been used for the worship of the Egyptian gods – specifically Isis and/or Serapis, and possibly also Osiris, Harpocrates and other lesser gods, who may have been worshipped in a pair of drum-shaped rotundas, both of which are virtually intact, alongside the main temple.\n\nAlthough the building itself is of an immense size, it was only one part of a much larger sacred complex, surrounded by high walls, that dwarfed even the colossal Temple of Jupiter in Baalbek. The entire complex was built directly over the River Selinus in a remarkable feat of engineering that involved the construction of an immense bridge wide to channel the river through two channels under the temple. The Pergamon Bridge still stands today, supporting modern buildings and even vehicle traffic. A series of tunnels and chambers lies under the main temple, connecting it with the side rotundas and giving private access to different areas of the complex. Various drains, water channels and basins are located in, around and under the main temple and may have been used for symbolic reenactments of the flooding of the Nile.\n\nThe temple was converted by the Byzantines into a Christian church dedicated to St John but was subsequently destroyed. Today the ruins of the main temple and one of the side rotundas can be visited, while the other side rotunda is still in use as a small mosque.\n\nThe temple's date of construction is not recorded, but from the style of the sculptures and the building techniques a date in the first half of the second century AD has been proposed. Its use of red brick on a massive scale, unique in Asia Minor but relatively common in Italy at the time, indicates that the architect was not local. The immense size and lavish construction of the complex points to an extremely wealthy patron who sent a Roman architect and brick masons to Pergamon to build the temple. The most likely candidate is the emperor Hadrian himself. He is known to have been an enthusiastic sponsor of the Egyptian gods; he built temples of Isis and Serapis at various places in the Roman world, including at his own villa in Tivoli.\n\nAt some point during the Christian era the temple was gutted by fire. It was not restored, but was redeveloped in the 5th century AD as a Christian basilica, built inside the shell of the destroyed temple. Arcades were built dividing the interior into a central nave and two side aisles. The eastern wall was demolished and replaced with an apse. The floor level was raised by about , obscuring the original Roman floor, though the former floor level has since been restored by archaeologists. The church was probably destroyed by the forces of the Arab general Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, who besieged and looted the city in 716–717 during his unsuccessful bid to conquer Constantinople. Pergamon fell into Turkish hands in 1336 and the building was converted into a mosque.\n\nThe complex has been investigated and excavated in a series of campaigns by the German Archaeological Institute. In 1906–1909 P. Schazmann prepared detailed drawings of the ruins during a German excavation of the Hellenistic city. The temple and \"temenos\" were excavated by Theodor Wiegand from 1927. New archaeological studies were carried out from 2002 to 2005 under A. Hoffmann. Restoration efforts have also been pursued, first in the 1930s under O. Bayatlı, the Director of the Bergama Museum, and later in the 1950s and 1960s. Further restoration work was conducted on the main temple in 2006 and the south rotunda was restored between 2006 and 2009.\n\nThe temple was built in the lower city of Pergamon at the foot of the hill on which the ancient city's acropolis stood. It was located at the eastern end of what was originally an immense sacred precinct or \"temenos\", 270 m long by 100 m wide (890 ft × 330 ft), which was surrounded by stone walls standing at least high. Most of the \"temenos\" was destroyed and built over long ago, but substantial fragments of the walls remain standing to a height of 13 m today. The main entrance lay on the western side of the \"temenos\" through a colossal marble gateway; smaller gateways were located on the same side, north and south of the main gate. From there, visitors walked some to an immense \"propylon\" (or monumental gateway) in front of the temple, supported by a row of columns standing high.\n\nThe \"temenos\" was built on top of the River Selinus, presumably because the person who commissioned the complex wished it to be located in the city centre rather than in an outlying district. As the city was already substantially built up, the river bed offered an otherwise unused location for the temple complex and reduced the number of properties that would have to be demolished to make way for it. The river was channelled into two tunnels passing diagonally for a distance of about , northwest to southeast, under the \"temenos\" and temple. This structure, the Pergamon Bridge, still stands today and continues to drain the river underneath the complex.\n\nThe temple measures from east to west and from north to south. Its walls still survive up to a height of , though its roof and eastern wall no longer exist and much of the original interior was destroyed when it was converted into a Christian basilica. The building was originally a vast hall, rather than a basilica, covered by a wooden roof that had no interior support or colonnade. Its walls were built entirely of red bricks that gave the building its modern Turkish name (which means literally \"Red Courtyard\"). They were covered in marble in various colours, though this has entirely disappeared; some important structural parts were also constructed from marble.\n\nThere appear to have been windows only in the western half of the main temple, meaning that the eastern half did not receive any natural light (unless there were windows in the eastern wall, which no longer stands). The building was entered from the west through an immense door measuring more than wide by at least high. Its door-sill is still in place and was made from a single piece of marble weighing over 30 tons. It seems, however, that the door was kept open continuously as there are no traces of the rollers that would have been necessary to open and close it. In front of the door stood an iron grating, which presumably had an opening in it to permit access to the interior of the temple.\n\nA total of twelve arched niches are embedded in the walls of the western end of the temple, five each lining the north and south walls and another two flanking the door on the west wall. They stand wide by high and presumably held statues of deities – perhaps the twelve gods of the zodiac. In his novel \"Metamorphoses\", the Roman writer Apuleius described a visit to the temple in which his protagonist \"saw the gods infernal and the gods celestial, before whom I presented myself and worshipped.\" Near the centre of the hall is a shallow basin, deep by long, in which three rectangular tubs stood, placed parallel to each other. It had no inflow pipe or drain. The eastern and western halves of the hall are divided by an alabaster-lined water channel, wide and deep, extending the full width of the temple. This did have a substantial inflow or outlet point, high by wide, which exited somewhere to the west in the direction of the river. The floor of the temple was constructed from plates of marble and granite imported from as far away as Egypt.\n\nThe eastern end of the hall would have been closed to the public and could only be accessed by the temple priests and their attendants. It housed the cult statue, which stood on a base that stood in turn on a podium raised by above the temple floor. The statue was at least high, approaching the size of the great Statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. An entry-hole in the base indicates that priests could climb inside the body of the statue, perhaps to make it \"speak\" during ceremonies.\n\nAt the far end of the temple were two massive towers, projecting some distance out from the eastern wall of the \"temenos\". The original wall no longer exists but from the foundations it can be seen that it would have been in the shape of an inverted semicircle. During the Christian era it was demolished and replaced with an apsidal wall.\n\nTwo rotundas topped by domes stand on either side of the main temple. Although they have been stripped of their original marble cladding, they are still substantially intact. Each stands high, with a diameter of , and had doors standing high. They were lit by an opening (an \"opaion\" or \"oculus\") that was originally wide. The two rotundas had different fates in the modern era. The one on the south side, which is part of the Red Basilica archaeological site and is open to visitors, was re-used and modified in the Ottoman period, and in the 19th century became the machinery room for an olive oil factory. Its inside walls are still covered with black soot from the smoke produced by the machinery. The north rotunda is currently used as a mosque.\n\nThe two rotundas stood within courtyards to the north and south of the main temple. They were surrounded on all sides by stoas measuring some deep, supported on the eastern side by atlantes and caryatids that each consisted of two figures standing back-to-back supporting the stoa roof. The figures were clearly intended to represent Egyptians, as they are depicted wearing Egyptian headgear.\n\nA pair of water basins was located in front of each rotunda, measuring long by wide and deep. These basins each had a smaller round basin of diameter at each end.\n\nAn underground complex lies below the temple and rotundas. Spiral ramps lead down from the rotundas to connect with a north-south passageway that links all three buildings. Branching passageways lead to secondary entrances in the \"temenos\" and to several pillared underground chambers – two on the south side have been excavated and it is presumed that a corresponding pair of chambers exist under the mosque/rotunda on the north side. The passageways gave access to the hidden entrance to the cult statue and also to the side walls of the temple, linking to shafts that connected with the temple roof.\n\nThe tunnels are all about high by between to wide. They appear to have been generally unadorned, but some pieces of coloured stucco are reported to be visible in one area – perhaps the remainder of some kind of decoration. The chambers to which they link are substantial structures. Two are rectangular rooms on either side of the main temple, measuring by , high, supported by pillars arranged in a 3 x 3 pattern. The other two, situated on the far side of each rotunda, are significantly larger; they measure by with a 4 x 4 pattern of columns. The two excavated chambers beside the south rotunda are today used as storage space for the archaeological site.\n\nThe temple was certainly used to worship Egyptian gods, as the presence of Egyptianised atlantids indicates. Which specific gods were worshipped there is, however, unclear. An inscription referring to the temple mentions \"Serapis, Isis, Harpocrates, Osiris, Apis, Helios on a horse ... Ares and the Dioskouroi\". Another inscription mentions Serapis, and a small terracotta head of Isis was discovered in the area of the \"temenos\". One of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri from Egypt refers to Isis as \"ὲν Περγάμῳ δεσπότις\" (\"she who rules in Pergamon\"). The temple may well have been dedicated to Isis, though some historians have interpreted it as a Serapeum (temple of Serapis) instead. The two rotundas may have been used for the worship of Horus and Anubis.\n\nThe layout of the temple provides more clues about how it was used. Unlike Greek temples, where the entire building was considered to be the house of the divinity, the god worshipped in the \"Red Basilica\" was confined to the eastern half of the temple. Similar layouts are found in other Isis and Serapis temples elsewhere in Asia Minor and Greece. The \"temenos\" is a vastly enlarged equivalent of enclosures found elsewhere in Greek mystery sanctuaries, such as the one as Eleusis in Greece where the Eleusinian Mysteries were performed annually. The purpose of its high walls was to prevent outsiders from witnessing ceremonies held within the \"temenos\" and temple precinct, thus preserving the mystery of the rituals.\n\nWater appears to have been a central theme of the ceremonies held at the temple, judging from the number of water features (basins, troughs and so on) in the complex. The basins outside the temple may have been purely decorative but those inside seem to have been intended for use in ceremonies. These may have included purification rituals – sprinkling the faithful with water – and possibly also a ritual re-enactment of the flooding of the Nile. Robert A. Wild suggests that the deep basin dividing the temple into its eastern and western halves may have been designed to convey flood- or rainwater into the temple during peak rainfall periods in the winter. The basin also served to separate the public western half of the temple from the sacred eastern half. Initiates may have been taken through the underground passages to the cultic area, where they would be presented to the worshippers filling the western end of the temple. Something of this nature is hinted at by Apuleius in \"Metamorphoses\": \"There in the middle of this sacred temple before the image of the goddess I was made to stand on a wooden pulpit.\"\n\n"}

It was the first building in the United States designated as a Jain temple, since it was a temple in India, although there were no Jains in the United States at that time. It later stood in Las Vegas where some members of the Los Angeles Jain community discovered it in 1980. It now stands within the Jain Center of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the Louisiana Purchase Exposition it stood within the India pavilion. It was described thus:\n\n\"The pavilion, a reproduction of the famous mosque of Itmad-ul-Dowlah at Agra, India, was much admired, as were the interior decorations and exhibits. Rising from the center of the court was a Jain temple of teakwood .., being a copy of a white marble temple eight times as large at Palitana, Central India. The reproduction represented two years' work of sixty-five artists and was made expressly for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.”\n\nAfter the exposition, the temple was dismantled, but was not shipped back to India as originally planned.\n\nIn 1957, San Souci Hotel was built in Las Vegas. It was bought and refurbished in 1963 and given the name Castaways which used Polynesian Islands in the Pacific Ocean as a theme. Instead of constructing a Polynesian temple, the St. Louis Jain temple structure was acquired, and reconstructed beside the pool. It was given the name Gateway to Luck. It is unclear when the temple arrived there. It could be seen from across the blue waters of the pool. Then image of the temple was widely used in the hotels postcards.\nThe site is now occupied by The Mirage.\n\nThe Jain Center of Southern California was established in 1979, with Mahendra Khandar as the President. In 1980, Lalit Shah and Shirish Seth visited Las Vegas and discovered the temple. In 1981, some of the Jains accompanied by Acharya Sushil Kumar and Chitrabhanu saw the temple, and agreed that the temple should belong to a Jain organization. Lalit Shah, then vice-president of the Jain Center of Southern California approached the Castaways manager Bill Friedman. He offered to have the value of the Temple appraised and sell it to them. The Jains instead requested the estate of Howard Hughes to donate it to them. In 1987, Castaways was bought by Steve Wynn. Castaways was demolished to make place for the new 3,044-room megaresort Mirage. The Temple was boxed up again and was acquired by the Jain Center of Southern California through the efforts of Dr. Manibhai Mehta, a former president. In 1995, the 1600 parts were transported to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2004, the Southern California Jain Center initiated reconstruction of the 42,000 square feet center. The wood temple has been carefully restored with the assistance of Manubhai Shah and MS International who carefully studied who the temple would be put together again. The coating put on it at Las Vegas was removed to restore the original teak look. The structure is 15 ft x 20 ft x 35 ft high and weighs nearly 10,000 lbs. It now forms the centerpiece of the Center. In 2008 the new building was inaugurated.\n\nThe 1904 St. Louis temple is not only one of a kind in USA, but is a rare surviving example of Indian tradition of wooden architecture. It has been suggested that it was originally carved at the Ahmadabad Woodcarving Company jointly run by Muggenbhai Hutheesing of Ahmedabad and Lockwood de Forest, a painter, orientalist and interior architect of New York City.\n\nThe temple is located within the Jain Center at Buena Park, California.\n\n"}

{"id": "229666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229666", "title": "Taxila", "text": "Taxila\n\nTaxila (from Pāli: Takkasilā, Sanskrit: तक्षशिला, , meaning \"City of Cut Stone\" or \" Rock\") is an important archaeological site of ancient India, located in Taxila city, Rawalpindi District of the Punjab, Pakistan, situated about north-west of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, just off the famous Grand Trunk Road. \n\nAncient Taxila was situated at the pivotal junction of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. The origin of Taxila as a city goes back to c. 1000 BCE. Some ruins at Taxila date to the time of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE, followed successively by Mauryan Empire, Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Kushan Empire periods.\n\nOwing to its strategic location, Taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control. When the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed by the nomadic Hunas in the 5th century. The renowned archaeologist Sir Alexander Cunningham rediscovered the ruins of Taxila in the mid-19th century. In 1980, Taxila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2006 it was ranked as the top tourist destination in Pakistan by \"The Guardian\" newspaper.\n\nBy some accounts, the University of Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world. Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.\n\nIn a 2010 report, Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most \"On the Verge\" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. However, significant preservation efforts have been carried out since then by the government which have resulted in the site being declared as \"well-preserved\" by different international publications. Because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep, the site is a popular tourist spot, attracting up to one million tourists every year. \n\nTaxila was known in Pali as \"Takkasilā\", and in Sanskrit as तक्षशिला (\"Takshashila\", ; \"City of Cut Stone\"). The Greeks pared the city's name down to Taxila which became the name that the Europeans were familiar with ever since the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nTakshashila can also alternately be translated to \"Rock of \"Taksha\"\" in reference to the Ramayana which states that the city was named in honour of Bharata's son and first ruler, Taksha. According to another derivation, Takshashila is related to Takshaka (Sanskrit for \"carpenter\") and is an alternate name for the Nāga, a non-Indo-Iranian people of ancient India.\n\nFaxian who had visited the city had given its name's meaning as \"Cut off Head\". With the help of a Jataka, he had interperted it to be the place where Buddha in his previous birth as Pusa or Chandaprabha cut off his head to feed a hungry lion. This tradition still persists with the area in front of Sirkap (also meaning \"cut off head\") was known in the 19th century as \"Babur Khana\" (\"House of Tiger\"), which alludes to the place where Buddha offered his head. In addition, a hill range to south of Taxila valley is called \"Margala\" (\"cut off throat\").\n\nIn Vedic texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, it is mentioned that the Vedic philosopher Uddalaka Aruni (c. 8th century BCE) had travelled to the region of Gandhara. In later Buddhist texts, the Jatakas, it is specified that Taxila was the city where Aruni and his son Setaketu each had received their education.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of Taxila is in Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\", a Sanskrit grammar treatise dated to the 5th century BCE.\n\nMuch of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, is a conversation between Vaishampayana (a pupil of the sage, Vyasa) and King Janamejaya. It is traditionally believed that the story was first recited by Vaishampayana at the behest of Vyasa during the snake sacrifice performed by Janamejaya at Takshashila. The audience also included Ugrashravas, an itinerant bard, who would later recite the story to a group of priests at an ashram in the Naimisha Forest from where the story was further disseminated. The Kuru Kingdom's heir, Parikshit (grandson of Arjuna) is said to have been enthroned at Takshashila.\n\nThe Ramayana describes Takshashila as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of Rama. Bharata, who also founded nearby Pushkalavati, installed his two sons, Taksha and Pushkala, as the rulers of the two cities.\n\nIn the Buddhist Jatakas, Taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of Gandhara and a great centre of learning with world-famous teachers. The Takkasila Jataka, more commonly known as the Telapatta Jataka, tells the tale of a prince of Benares who is told that he would become the king of Takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the yakkhinis who waylaid travellers in the forest. According to the Dipavamsa, one of Taxila's early kings was a Kshatriya named Dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons. , mentioned in the Avadanakalpalata, is another king associated with the city.\n\nIn the Jain tradition, it is said that Rishabha, the first of the Tirthankaras, visited Taxila millions of years ago. His footprints were subsequently consecrated by Bahubali who erected a throne and a dharmachakra (\"wheel of the law\") over them several miles in height and circumference.\n\nThe region around Taxila was settled by the neolithic era, with some ruins at Taxila dating to 3360 BCE. Ruins dating from the Early Harappan period around 2900 BCE have also been discovered in the Taxila area, though the area was eventually abandoned after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nThe first major settlement at Taxila was established around 1000 BCE. By 900 BCE, the city was already involved in regional commerce, as discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and Puṣkalāvatī. Taxila was sometimes ruled as part of the Gandhara kingdom (whose capital was Pushkalavati), particularly after the Achaemenid period, but Taxila sometimes formed its own independent district or city-state.\n\nTaxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient \"Royal Highway\" that connected the Mauryan capital at Pataliputra in Bihar, with ancient Peshawar, Puṣkalāvatī, and onwards towards Central Asia via Kashmir, Bactria, and Kāpiśa. Taxila thus changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control.\n\nArchaeological excavations show that the city may have grown significantly during the rule of the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE. In 516 BCE, Darius I embarked on a campaign to conquer Central Asia, \"Ariana\" and \"Bactria\", before marching onto what is now Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Emperor Darius spent the winter of 516-515 BCE in the \"Gandhara\" region surrounding Taxila, and prepared to conquer the Indus Valley, which he did in 515 BCE, after which he appointed Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to the Suez. Darius then returned to Persia via the Bolan Pass. The region continued under Achaemenid suzerainty under the reign of Xerxes I, and continued under Achaemenid rule for over a century.\n\nDuring his invasion of the Indus Valley, Alexander the Great was able to gain control of Taxila in 326 BCE without a battle, as the city was surrendered by its ruler, king Omphis (Āmbhi). Greek historians accompanying Alexander described Taxila as “wealthy, prosperous, and well governed.”\n\nBy 317 BCE, the Greek satraps left by Alexander were driven out, and Taxila came under the control of Chandragupta Maurya, who turned Taxila into a regional capital. His advisor, Kautilya/Chanakya, was said to have taught at Taxila's university. Under the reign of Ashoka, Chandragupta's grandson, the city was made a great seat of Buddhist learning, though the city was home to a minor rebellion during this time.\n\nIn the 2nd century BCE, Taxila was annexed by the Indo-Greek kingdom of Bactria. Indo-Greeks built a new capital, Sirkap, on the opposite bank of the river from Taxila. During this new period of Bactrian Greek rule, several dynasties (like Antialcidas) likely ruled from the city as their capital. During lulls in Greek rule, the city managed profitably on its own, to independently control several local trade guilds, who also minted most of the city's autonomous coinage. In about the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, an Indo-Scythian king named Azilises had three mints, one of which was at Taxila, and struck coins with obverse legends in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.\n\nThe last Greek king of Taxila was overthrown by the Indo-Scythian chief Maues around 90 BCE. Gondophares, founder of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, conquered Taxila around 20 BCE, and made Taxila his capital. According to early Christian legend, Thomas the Apostle visited Gondophares IV around 46 CE, possibly at Taxila given that that city was Gondophares' capital city.\n\nIn the first century CE, the Greek Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited Taxila, which his team described as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan, similar in size to \"Nineveh.\" Inscriptions dating to 76 CE demonstrate that the city had come under Kushan rule by this time, after the city was captured from the Parthians by Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan Empire. The great Kushan ruler Kanishka later founded \"Sirsukh\", the most recent of the ancient settlements at Taxila.\n\nIn the mid fourth century CE, the Gupta Empire occupied the territories in Eastern Gandhara, establishing a Kumaratya's post at Taxila. The City became well known for its Trade links- including Silk, Sandalwood, Horses, Cotton, Silverware, Pearls, and Spices. It is during this time that the City heavily features in Classical Indian Literature- both as a centre of Culture as well as a militarised border City.\n\nTaxila's university remained in existence during the travels of Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited Taxila around 400 CE. He wrote that Taxila's name translated as \"the Severed Head\", and was the site of a story in the life of Buddha \"where he gave his head to a man\".\n\nThe Kidarites, vassals of the Hephthalite Empire are known to have invaded Taxila in c. 450 CE. Though repelled by the Gupta Emperor Skandagupta, the city would not recover- probably on account of the strong Hunnic presence in the area, breakdown of trade as well as the three-way war between Persia, the Kidarite State, and the Huns in Western Gandhara.\n\nThe White Huns swept over \"Gandhāra\" and Punjab around 470 CE, causing widespread devastation and destruction of Taxila's famous Buddhist monasteries and stupas, a blow from which the city would never recover. From 500 CE to 540 CE, the city fell under the control of the Hunnic Empire in South Asia and languished.\n\nXuanzang visited India between 629 to 645 CE. Taxila which was desolate and half-ruined was visited by him in 630 CE, and found most of its sangharamas still ruined and desolate. Only a few monks remained there. He adds that the kingdom had become a dependency of Kashmir with the local leaders fighting amongst themselves for power. He noted that it had some time previously been a subject of Kapisa. By the ninth century, it became a dependency of the Kabul Shahis. The Turki Shahi dynasty of Kabul was replaced by the Hindu Shahi dynasty which was overthrown by Mahmud of Ghazni with the defeat of Trilochanpala.\n\nBy some accounts, Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world. Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.\n\nTaxila became a noted centre of learning (including the religious teachings of Buddhism) at least several centuries BCE, and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century. It has been suggested that at its height, Taxila exerted a sort of \"intellectual suzerainty\" over other centres of learning in India and its primary concern was not with elementary, but higher education. Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The ancient and the most revered scriptures, and the Eighteen \"Silpas\" or Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. Students came to Taxila from far-off places such as Kashi, Kosala and Magadha, in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo, on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there, all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects.\n\nTaxila had great influence on Hindu culture and the Sanskrit language. It is perhaps best known for its association with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, the strategist who guided Chandragupta Maurya and assisted in the founding of the Mauryan empire. Chanakya's Arthashastra (\"The knowledge of Economics\") is said to have been composed in Taxila. The Ayurvedic healer Charaka also studied at Taxila. He also started teaching at Taxila in the later period. Pāṇini, the grammarian who codified the rules that would define Classical Sanskrit, has also been part of the community at Taxila.\n\nThe institution is significant in Buddhist tradition since it is believed that the Mahāyāna branch of Buddhism took shape there. Jīvaka, the court physician of the Magadha emperor Bimbisara who once cured the Buddha, and the Buddhism-supporting ruler of Kosala, Prasenajit, are some important personalities mentioned in Pali texts who studied at Taxila.\n\nNo external authorities like kings or local leaders subjected the scholastic activities at Taxila to their control. Each teacher formed his own institution, enjoying complete autonomy in work, teaching as many students as he liked and teaching subjects he liked without conforming to any centralised syllabus. Study terminated when the teacher was satisfied with the student's level of achievement. In general, specialisation in a subject took around eight years, though this could be lengthened or shortened in accordance with the intellectual abilities and dedication of the student in question. In most cases the \"schools\" were located within the teachers' private houses, and at times students were advised to quit their studies if they were unable to fit into the social, intellectual and moral atmosphere there.\n\nKnowledge was considered too sacred to be bartered for money, and hence any stipulation that fees ought to be paid was vigorously condemned. Financial support came from the society at large, as well as from rich merchants and wealthy parents. Though the number of students studying under a single Guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds, teachers did not deny education even if the student was poor; free boarding and lodging was provided, and students had to do manual work in the household. Paying students, such as princes, were taught during the day, while non-paying ones were taught at night. Gurudakshina was usually expected at the completion of a student's studies, but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude - many times being nothing more than a turban, a pair of sandals, or an umbrella. In cases of poor students being unable to afford even that, they could approach the king, who would then step in and provide something. Not providing a poor student a means to supply his Guru's Dakshina was considered the greatest slur on a King's reputation.\n\nExaminations were treated as superfluous, and not considered part of the requirements to complete one's studies. The process of teaching was critical and thorough- unless one unit was mastered completely, the student was not allowed to proceed to the next. No convocations were held upon completion, and no written \"degrees\" were awarded, since it was believed that knowledge was its own reward. Using knowledge for earning a living or for any selfish end was considered sacrilegious.\n\nStudents arriving at Taxila usually had completed their primary education at home (until the age of eight), and their secondary education in the Ashrams (between the ages of eight and twelve), and therefore came to Taxila chiefly to reach the ends of knowledge in specific disciplines.\n\nThe sites of a number of important cities noted in ancient Indian texts were identified by scholars early in the 19th century. The lost city of Taxila, however, was not identified until later, in 1863-64. Its identification was made difficult partly due to errors in the distances recorded by Pliny in his Naturalis Historia which pointed to a location somewhere on the Haro river, two days march from the Indus. Alexander Cunningham, the founder and the first director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, noticed that this position did not agree with the descriptions provided in the itineraries of Chinese pilgrims and in particular, that of Xuanzang, the 7th-century Buddhist monk. Unlike Pliny, these sources noted that the journey to Taxila from the Indus took three days and not two. Cunningham's subsequent explorations in 1863–64 of a site at Shah-dheri convinced him that his hypothesis was correct.\nTaxila's archaeological sites lie near modern Taxila about northwest of the city of Rawalpindi. The sites were first excavated by John Marshall, who worked at Taxila over a period of twenty years from 1913.\nThe vast archaeological site includes neolithic remains dating to 3360 BCE, and Early Harappan remains dating to 2900–2600 BCE at \"Sarai Kala\". Taxila, however, is most famous for ruins of several settlements, the earliest dating from around 1000 BCE. It is also known for its collection of Buddhist religious monuments, including the Dharmarajika stupa, the Jaulian monastery, and the Mohra Muradu monastery.\n\nThe main ruins of Taxila include four major cities, each belonging to a distinct time period, at three different sites. The earliest settlement at Taxila is found in the Hathial section, which yielded pottery shards that date from as early as the late 2nd millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE. The Bhir Mound ruins at the site date from the 6th century BCE, and are adjacent to \"Hathial\". The ruins of Sirkap date to the 2nd century BCE, and were built by the region's Greco-Bactrian kings who ruled in the region following Alexander the Great's invasion of the region in 326 BCE. The third and most recent settlement is that of Sirsukh, which was built by rulers of the Kushan empire, who ruled from nearby \"Purushapura\" (modern Peshawar).\n\nTaxila was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 in particular for the ruins of the four settlement sites which \"reveal the pattern of urban evolution on the Indian subcontinent through more than five centuries\". The serial site includes a number of monuments and other historical places of note in the area besides the four settlements at Bhir, Saraikala, Sirkap, and Sirsukh. They number 18 in all:\n\nIn a 2010 report, Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most \"on the Verge\" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. In 2017, it was announced that Thailand would assist in conservation efforts at Taxila, as well as at Buddhist sites in the Swat Valley.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11786314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11786314", "title": "The Satanic Verses controversy", "text": "The Satanic Verses controversy\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" controversy, also known as the Rushdie Affair, was the heated and frequently violent reaction of Muslims to the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses\", which was first published in the United Kingdom in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. Many Muslims accused Rushdie of blasphemy or unbelief and in 1989 the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie. Numerous killings, attempted killings, and bombings resulted from violent Muslims over the novel.\n\nThe Iranian government backed the fatwa against Rushdie until 1998, when the succeeding government of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said it no longer supported the killing of Rushdie. However, the fatwa remains in place.\n\nThe issue was said to have divided \"Muslims from Westerners along the fault line of culture,\" and to have pitted a core Western value of freedom of expression—that no one \"should be killed, or face a serious threat of being killed, for what they say or write\"—against the view of many Muslims—that no one should be free to \"insult and malign Muslims\" by disparaging the \"honour of the Prophet\". English writer Hanif Kureishi called the fatwa \"one of the most significant events in postwar literary history.\"\n\nEven before the publication of \"The Satanic Verses\", the books of Salman Rushdie had stoked controversy. Rushdie saw his role as a writer \"as including the function of antagonist to the state\". His second book \"Midnight's Children\" angered Indira Gandhi because it seemed to suggest \"that Mrs. Gandhi was responsible for the death of her husband through neglect\". His 1983 \"roman à clef\" \"Shame\" \"took an aim on Pakistan, its political characters, its culture and its religion... [It covered] a central episode in Pakistan's internal life, which portrays as a family squabble between Iskander Harappa (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and his successor and executioner Raza Hyder (Zia ul-Haq)... 'The Virgin Ironpants'... has been identified as Benazir Bhutto, a Prime Minister of Pakistan\".\n\nPositions Rushdie took as a committed leftist prior to the publication of his book were the source of some controversy. He defended many of those who would later attack him during the controversy. Rushdie forcefully denounced the Shah's government and supported the Islamic Revolution of Iran, at least in its early stages. He condemned the US bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 but found himself threatened by Libya's leader Muammar al-Gaddafi three years later. He wrote a book bitterly critical of US foreign policy in general and its war in Nicaragua in particular, for example calling the United States government, \"the bandit posing as sheriff\". After the Ayatollah's fatwa however, he was accused by Iranian government of being \"an inferior CIA agent\". A few years earlier, an official jury appointed by a ministry of the Iranian Islamic government had bestowed an award on the Persian translation of Rushdie's book \"Shame\", which up until then was the only time a government had awarded Rushdie's work a prize.\n\n\"[V]ehement protest against Rushdie's book\" began with the title itself. The title refers to a legend of the Islamic Prophet Mohammad, when a few verses were supposedly spoken by him as part of the Qur'an, and then withdrawn on the grounds that the devil had sent them to deceive Mohammad into thinking they came from God. These \"Satanic Verses\" are found in verses eighteen to twenty-two in surah An-Najim of the Qur'an, and by accounts from Tabari, but is seldom mentioned in the first biography of Mohammad by Ibn Ishaq. The verses also appear in other accounts of the prophet's life. They permitted prayer to three pre-Islamic Meccan goddesses: Al-lāt, Uzza, and Manāt—a violation of monotheism. The utterance and withdrawal of the so-called Satanic Verses forms an important sub-plot in the novel, which recounts several episodes in the life of Muhammad. The phrase Arab historians and later Muslims used to describe the incident of the withdrawn verses was not \"Satanic verses\", but the \"gharaniq\" verses; the phrase 'Satanic verses' was unknown to Muslims, and was coined by Western academics specialising in the study of Middle Eastern culture. The story itself is not found in the six Sahih of the sunni or the shiite sources, so much so that Muraghi, in his commentary, says: \"These traditions are undoubtedly a fabrication of the heretics and foreign hands, and have not been found in any of the authentic books\" ... According to Daniel Pipes, when attention was drawn to a book with this title, \"Muslims found [it] incredibly sacrilegious\", and took it to imply that the book's author claimed that verses of the Qur'an were \"the work of the Devil\".\n\nAccording to McRoy (2007), other controversial elements included the use of the name Mahound, said to be a derogatory term for Muhammad used by the English during the Crusades; the use of the term Jahilia, denoting the 'time of ignorance' before Islam, for the holy city of Mecca; the use of the name of the Angel Gibreel (Gabriel) for a film star, of the name of Saladin, the great Muslim hero of the Crusades, for a devil, and the name of Ayesha the wife of Muhammad for a fanatical Indian girl who leads her village on a fatal pilgrimage. Moreover, the brothel of the city of Jahilia was staffed by prostitutes with the same names as Muhammad's wives, who are viewed by Muslims as 'the Mothers of all Believers'.\n\nOther issues many Muslims have found offensive include Abraham being called a \"bastard\" for casting Hagar and Ishmael in the desert; and a character named Salman the Persian who serves as one of the Prophet's scribes, an apparent reference to the story, controversial among Muslims, of a Meccan convert by the name of Ibn Abi Sarh, who left Islam after the Prophet failed to notice small changes he had made in the dictation of the Qur'an.\n\nDaniel Pipes identified other more general issues in the book likely to have angered pious Muslims: A complaint in the book by one of Mahound's companions: \"rules about every damn thing, if a man farts let him turn his face to the wind, a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one's behind ...\", which was said to mix up \"Islamic law with its opposite and with the author's whimsy\"; the prophet of Rushdie's novel, as he lies dying, being visited in a dream by the Goddess Al-lāt, on the grounds that this suggested either that she exists or that the prophet thought she did; the angel Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being in another dream as \"not abstract in the least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as himself\", balding, wearing glasses and \"seeming to suffer from dandruff\". A complaint by one of the characters about communal violence in India: \"Fact is, religious faith, which encodes the highest aspirations of human race, is now, in our country, the servant of lowest instincts, and God is the creature of evil\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" newspaper published on 14 September 2012 a series of recollections of various British people involved in the controversy. Lisa Appignanesi, ex-president of English PEN, observed \"Intransigence is never so great as when it feels it has a god on its side.\" One of the lawyers involved, Geoffrey Robertson QC, rehearsed the arguments and replies made when 13 Muslim barristers had lodged a formal indictment against Rushdie for the crime of blasphemous libel: it was said that God was described in the book as \"the Destroyer of Man\", yet he is described as such in the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation, especially of men who are unbelievers or enemies of the Jews; that the book contained criticisms of the prophet Abraham, yet the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions themselves see Abraham as not without fault and deserving of criticism; that Rushdie referred to Mohammed as \"Mahound\", a conjurer, a magician and a false prophet, yet these remarks are made by a drunken apostate, a character with whom neither reader nor author has any sympathy; that the book insults the wives of the Prophet by having whores use their names, yet the wives are explicitly said to be chaste and the adoption of their names by whores is to symbolise the corruption of the city then being described (perhaps symbolising Mecca in its pre-Islamic state); that the book vilified the companions of the Prophet, calling them \"bums from Persia\" and \"clowns\", yet the character saying this is a hack poet hired to write propaganda against the Prophet and does not reflect the author's beliefs; that the book criticised Islam for having too many rules and seeking to control every aspect of life, yet while characters in the book do make such remarks these cannot constitute blasphemy since they do not vilify God or the Prophet.\n\nBefore the publication of \"The Satanic Verses\", the publisher received \"warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant\" that the book might be controversial. Later, Rushdie would reflect upon the time that the book was about to be published. Speaking to an interviewer, he said, \"I expected a few mullahs would be offended, call me names, and then I could defend myself in public... I honestly never expected anything like this\".\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was published by Viking Penguin on 26 September 1988 in the UK, and on 22 February 1989 in the US. Upon its publication the book garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United Kingdom. On 8 November 1988, the work received the Whitbread Award for novel of the year, worth £20,000. According to one observer, \"almost all the British book reviewers\" were unaware of the book's connection to Islam because Rushdie has used the name Mahound instead of Muhammad for his chapter on Islam.\n\nIn Islamic communities, the novel became instantly controversial, because of what some Muslims considered blasphemous references. Rushdie was accused of misusing freedom of speech. By October 1988, letters and phone calls arrived at Viking Penguin from Muslims, angry with the book and demanding that it be withdrawn. Before the end of the month, the import of the book was banned in India, although possession of the book is not a criminal offence.\n\nIn November 1988, it was also banned in Bangladesh, Sudan, and South Africa. By December 1988, it was also banned in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn Britain on 2 December 1988, 7,000 Muslims in the town of Bolton staged the first ever demonstration against \"The Satanic Verses\". After the Friday prayers, a certain section of the congregation marched from the Zakariyya Jame Masjid to the town centre and then burned the book. The organisers claimed \"It was a peaceful protest, and we burned the book to try and attract public attention\".\n\nThe City of Bradford gained international attention in January 1989 when some of its members organised a public book-burning of \"The Satanic Verses\", evoking as the journalist Robert Winder recalled \"images of medieval (not to mention Nazi) intolerance\".\n\nIn February, when the US edition was published, a new round of reviews and criticism began. \nMarch 1989 saw it banned in Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Singapore. The last nation to ban the book was Venezuela, in June 1989.\n\nIn the United States, the FBI was notified of 78 threats to bookstores in early March 1989, thought to be a small proportion of the total number of threats. B. Dalton bookstore chain received 30 threats in less than three hours. Bombings of book stores included two in Berkeley, California. In New York, the office of a community newspaper, \"The Riverdale Press\", was all but destroyed by firebombs following the publication of an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticising the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves. But the United Kingdom was the country where violence against bookstores occurred most often and persisted the longest. Two large bookstores in Charing Cross Road, London, (Collets and Dillons) were bombed on 9 April. In May, explosions went off in the town of High Wycombe and again in London, on Kings Road. Other bombings included one at a large London department store (Liberty's), in connection with the Penguin Bookshop inside the store, and at the Penguin store in York. Unexploded devices were found at Penguin stores in Guildford, Nottingham, and Peterborough.\n\nIn the United States, it was unavailable in about one-third of bookstores. In many others that carried the book, it was kept under the counter.\n\nAfter the book was first published in the United Kingdom, in September 1988, there were protests by Muslims mainly in India and the UK. \nWhen it was published in the United States, six months later (in February 1989), it received renewed attention, and the protests took a more deadly form. \nOn 12 February 1989, a 10,000-strong protest against Rushdie and the book took place in Islamabad, Pakistan. Six protesters were killed in an attack on the American Cultural Center, and an American Express office was ransacked.\n\nOn 14 February, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran and one of the most prominent Shi'a Muslim leaders, issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers. This created a major international incident that persisted for decades.\n\nBroadcast on Iranian radio, the judgement read:\n\nKhomeini did not give a legal reasoning for his judgement. It is thought to be based on the ninth chapter of the Qur'an, called At-Tawba, verse 61: \"Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, 'He is all ears!' Say, 'It is better for you that he listens to you. He believes in God, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.' Those who hurt God's messenger have incurred a painful retribution\".\nHowever it was not explained how that chapter could support such a judgement.\n\nOver the next few days, Iranian officials offered a bounty of $6 million for killing Rushdie, who was thus forced to live under police protection for the next nine years. On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations over the Rushdie controversy.\n\nOn 18 February, Iran's President Ali Khamenei (who would later that year succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader) suggested that if Rushdie \"apologises and disowns the book, people may forgive him\". \nFollowing this, Rushdie issued \"a carefully worded statement\", saying:\n\nI recognize that Muslims in many parts of the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret the distress the publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam. Living as we do in a world of many faiths, this experience has served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others.\n\nThis was relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran \"via official channels\" before being released to the press.\n\nOn 19 February 1990, Ayatollah Khomeini's office replied:\n\nThe Imam added:\n\nIf a non-Muslim becomes aware of Rushdie's whereabouts and has the ability to execute him quicker than Muslims, it is incumbent on Muslims to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action.\n\nMcRoy (2007) stated that Khomeini's interpretation of the Islamic law that led him to refuse the apology follows the same line of reasoning as Al-Shafi'i (9th century jurist), who in his \"Risala\" (Maliki Manual 37.19 \"Crimes Against Islam\") ruled that an \"apostate is also killed unless he repents... Whoever abuses the Messenger of God ... is to be executed, and his repentance is not accepted\".\n\nIn Britain, the Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe issued a statement offering its services to Khomeini. Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom, one London property developer told reporters, \"If I see him, I will kill him straight away. Take my name and address. One day I will kill him\".\n\nOther leaders, while supporting the fatwa, claimed that British Muslims were not allowed to carry out the fatwa themselves. Prominent amongst these were the Muslim Parliament and its leader Kalim Siddiqui, and after his death in 1996, his successor, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui. His support for the fatwa continued, even after the Iranian leadership said it would not pursue the fatwa, and re-iterated his support in 2000.\n\nMeanwhile, in America, the director of the Near East Studies Center at UCLA, George Sabbagh, told an interviewer that Khomeini was \"completely within his rights\" to call for Rushdie's death.\n\nIn May 1989 in Beirut, Lebanon, British citizen Jackie Mann was abducted \"in response to Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the publication of book the Satanic Verses and more specifically, for his refuge and protection in the United Kingdom\". He joined several Westerners held hostage there. Two months earlier a photograph of three teachers held hostage was released by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine with the message that it \"would take revenge against\" all institutions and organisations that insulted in one way or another \"members of the Prophet Mohammed's family\".\n\nMcRoy (2007) claimed that \"In Islamic society a blasphemer is held in the same hostile contempt as a pedophile in the West. Just as few if any people in the West mourn the murder of a child molester, few Muslims mourn the killing of a blasphemer\".\n\nKhomeini's fatwa was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and that Khomeini had no right to condemn to death a citizen of another country living in that country. The 12 members of the European Economic Community removed their ambassadors from Tehran for three weeks.\n\nIn addition to criticism of the death sentence on the basis of humans rights, the sentence was also criticised on Islamic grounds. According to Bernard Lewis, a death warrant without trial, defence and other legal aspects of sharia violates Islamic jurisprudence. In Islamic fiqh, apostasy by a mentally sound adult male is indeed a capital crime. However, fiqh also:\n\nOther Islamic scholars outside Iran took issue with the fact that the sentence was not passed by an Islamic court, or that it did not limit its \"jurisdiction only [to] countries under Islamic law\". Muhammad Hussan ad-Din, a theologian at Al-Azhar University, argued \"Blood must not be shed except after a trial [when the accused has been] given a chance to defend himself and repent\". Abdallah al-Mushidd, head of Azhar's Fatwā Council stated \"We must try the author in a legal fashion as Islam does not accept killing as a legal instrument\".\n\nThe Islamic Jurisprudence Academy in Mecca urged that Rushdie be tried and, if found guilty, be given a chance to repent, (p. 93) and Ayatollah Mehdi Rohani, head of the Shi'i community in Europe and a cousin of Khomeini, criticised Khomeini for 'respect[ing] neither international law nor that of Islam.'\n\nThere was also criticism of the fatwa issued against Rushdie's publishers. According to Daniel Pipes: \"The Sharia clearly establishes that disseminating false information is not the same as expressing it. \"Transmitting blasphemy is not blasphemy\" (\"naql al-kufr laysa kufr\"). In addition, the publishers were not Muslim and so could not be \"sentenced under the Islamic laws of apostasy\". If there was another legal justification for sentencing them to death, \"Khomeini failed to provide\" it.\n\nIran's response to calls for a trial was to denounce its Islamic proponents as \"deceitful\". President Khomeini accused them of attempting to use religious law as \"a flag under which they can crush revolutionary Islam\".\n\nSome speculate that the fatwa (or at least the reaffirmation of the death threat four days later) was issued with motives other than a sense of duty to protect Islam by punishing blasphemy/apostasy. Namely:\n\n\nDespite claims by Iranian officials that \"Rushdie's book did not insult Iran or Iranian leaders\" and so they had no selfish personal motivation to attack the book, the book does include an eleven-page sketch of Khomeini's stay in Paris that could well be considered an insult to him. It describes him as having \"grown monstrous, lying in the palace forecourt with his mouth yawning open at the gates; as the people march through the gates he swallows them whole\". In the words of one observer, \"If this is not an insult, Khomeini was far more tolerant than one might suppose\", John Crowley has noted that the section of the book depicting the Khomeini-like character was selected to be read publicly by Rushdie in the promotional events leading up to and following the book's release. In Crowley's opinion, the fatwa was most likely declared because of this section of the novel and its public exposure, rather than the overall parodic treatment of Islam.\n\nOn 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Britain, the Iranian government, then headed by moderate Muhammad Khatami, gave a public commitment that it would \"neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie\".\nHowever, some in Iran have continued to reaffirm the death sentence. In early 2005, Khomeini's fatwa was reaffirmed by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Additionally, the Revolutionary Guards have declared that the death sentence on him is still valid. Iran has rejected requests to withdraw the fatwa on the basis that only the person who issued it may withdraw it, with Ruhollah Khomeini having died in 1989.\n\nOn 14 February 2006, the Iranian state news agency reported that the fatwa will remain in place permanently.\n\nIn 2007, Salman Rushdie reported that he still receives a \"sort of Valentine's card\" from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him. He was also quoted saying, \"It's reached the point where it's a piece of rhetoric rather than a real threat\".\n\nOne of the immediate consequences of the fatwa was a worsening of Islamic-Western relations.\n\nRushdie lamented that the controversy fed the Western stereotype of \"the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer\",\nwhile another British writer compared the Ayatollah Khomeini \"with a familiar ghost from the past – one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a Faqir of Ipi or a mad Mullah, who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire\". Media expressions of this included a banner headline in the popular British newspaper the \"Daily Mirror\" referring to Khomeini as \"that Mad Mullah\".\n\n\"The Independent\" newspaper worried that Muslim book burning demonstrations were \"following the example of the Inquisition and Hitler's National Socialists\", and that if Rushdie was killed, \"it would be the first burning of a heretic in Europe in two centuries\". Peregrine Worsthorne of the \"Sunday Telegraph\" feared that with Europe's growing Muslim population, \"Islamic fundamentalism is rapidly growing into a much bigger threat of violence and intolerance than anything emanating from, say, the fascist National Front; and a threat, moreover, infinitely more difficult to contain since it is virtually impossible to monitor, let alone stamp out ...\".\n\nOn the Muslim side, the Iranian government saw the book as part of a British conspiracy against Islam. It broke diplomatic relations with UK on 7 March 1989 giving the explanation that \"in the past two centuries Britain has been in the frontline of plots and treachery against Islam and Muslims\", It accused the British of sponsoring Rushdie's book to use it as a political and cultural tact on earlier military plots that no longer worked. It also saw itself as the victor of the controversy, with the European Community countries capitulating under Iranian pressure. \"When Europeans saw that their economic interests in Muslim countries could be damaged, they began to correct their position on the issue of the insulting book. Every official started to condemn the book in one way or another. When they realised that Iran's reaction, its breaking of diplomatic relations with London, could also include them, they quickly sent back their ambassadors to Tehran to prevent further Iranian reaction\".\n\nAlthough British bookseller W.H. Smith sold \"a mere hundred copies a week of the book in mid-January 1989\", it \"flew off the shelves\" following the fatwa. In America it sold an \"unprecedented\" five times more copies than the number two book, \"Star\" by Danielle Steel, selling more than 750,000 copies of the book by May 1989. B. Dalton, a bookstore chain that decided not to stock the book for security reasons, changed its mind when it found the book \"was selling so fast that even as we tried to stop it, it was flying off the shelves\". Rushdie earned about $2 million within the first year of the book's publication, and the book is Viking's all-time best seller.\n\nThe author of the book himself was not killed or injured as many militants wished, but visibly frustrated by a life locked in 24-hour armed guard – alternately defiant against his would-be killers and attempting overtures of reconciliation against the death threat. A week after the death threat, and after his unsuccessful apology to the Iranian government, Rushdie described succumbing to \"a curious lethargy, the soporific torpor that overcomes ... while under attack\"; then, a couple of weeks after that, wrote a poem vowing \"not to shut up\" but \"to sing on, in spite of attacks\". But in June, following the death of Khomeini, he asked his supporters \"to tone down their criticism of Iran\".\n\nHis wife, Marianne Wiggins, reported that in the first few months following the fatwa the couple moved 56 times, once every three days. In late July Rushdie separated from Wiggins, \"the tension of being at the centre of an international controversy, and the irritations of spending all hours of the day together in seclusion\", being too much for their \"shaky\" relationship.\n\nLate the next year Rushdie declared, \"I want to reclaim my life\", and in December signed a declaration \"affirming his Islamic faith and calling for Viking-Penguin, the publisher of \"The Satanic Verses\", neither to issue the book in paperback nor to allow it to be translated\". This also failed to move supporters of the fatwa and by mid-2005 Rushdie was condemning Islamic fundamentalism as a\n\nA memoir of his years of hiding, titled \"Joseph Anton\", was published on 18 September 2012. Joseph Anton was Rushdie's secret alias.\n\nThe passionate international rage of Muslims towards the book surprised many Western readers because the book was written in English, not Arabic, Urdu, Persian or other languages for which the majority of mother tongue speakers are Muslims; it was never published or even sold in the countries where most Muslims lived; and was a work of fiction—a demanding, densely written novel unlikely to appeal to the average reader.\n\nSome of the explanations for the unprecedented rage unleashed against the book were that:\n\nWhoever is familiar with the history of colonialism and the Islamic world knows that whenever they wanted to get a foothold in a place, the first thing they did in order to clear their paths – whether overtly or covertly – was to undermine the people's genuine Islamic morals. \n\nand claimed an unnamed British foreign secretary once told the British parliament, \"So long as the Qur'an is revered by Muslims, we will not be able to consolidate a foothold among the Muslims\".\n\n\nDespite the passionate intensity of Muslim feeling on the issue no Western government banned \"The Satanic Verses.\" This is primarily because most Western governments explicitly or implicitly allow for freedom of expression, which includes forbidding censorship in the vast majority of cases. Western attitudes regarding freedom of expression differ from those in the Arab world because:\n\n\nThe last point also explains why one of the few groups to speak out in Muslim countries against Khomeini and for Rushdie's right to publish his book were other writers. Nobel prize winners Wole Soyinka of Nigeria and Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, both attacked Khomeini, and both received death threats as a result, with Mahfouz later getting stabbed in the neck by a Muslim fundamentalist.\n\nSome Western politicians and writers did criticise Rushdie. Former United States president Jimmy Carter, while condemning the threats and fatwa against Rushdie, stated, \"we have tended to promote him and his book with little acknowledgment that it is a direct insult to those millions of Moslems whose sacred beliefs have been violated and are suffering in restrained silence the added embarrassment of the Ayatollah's irresponsibility\". He also held that Rushdie must have been aware of the response his book would evoke: \"The author, a well-versed analyst of Moslem beliefs, must have anticipated a horrified reaction throughout the Islamic world\". He saw a need to be \"sensitive to the concern and anger\" of Muslims and thought severing diplomatic relations with Iran would be an \"overreaction\".\n\nAmong authors, Roald Dahl was scathing and called Rushdie's book sensationalist and Rushdie \"a dangerous opportunist\". John le Carré thought the death sentence to be outrageous, but he also criticised Rushdie's action: \"I don't think it is given to any of us to be impertinent to great religions with impunity\", although he later expressed regret over his dispute with Rushdie. Rushdie, however, was supported by major bodies in the literary world such as PEN and Association of American Publishers, and prominent figures such as Günter Grass, Martin Amis, Saul Bellow, Nadine Gordimer and Derek Walcott. Another major supporter of Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens, said that the fatwa persuaded him that Islamic fundamentalism was an urgent menace, and later wrote \"God Is Not Great\", a polemic against religion. The affair however led to greater caution and some degree of self-censorship when dealing with Islamic issues in the literary and other creative arts.\n\nMany religious figures in the United States and United Kingdom shared the aversion to blasphemy of pious Muslims (if not as intensely) and did not defend Rushdie like their secular compatriots. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, demanded that the government expand the Blasphemy Act to cover other religions, including Islam.\n\nMichael Walzer wrote that the response revealed an evolution of the meaning of blasphemy; it moved away from a crime against God and toward something more temporal.\n\nToday we are concerned for our pain and sometimes, for other people's. Blasphemy has become an offence against the faithful – in much the same way as pornography is an offence against the innocent and the virtuous. Given this meaning, blasphemy is an ecumenical crime and so it is not surprising ... that Christians and Jews should join Muslims in calling Salman Rushdie's [book] a blasphemous book.\n\nSome rabbis, such as Immanuel Jakobovits, chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, opposed the book's publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention, nor is it going to take any action whatsoever, to threaten the life of the author of 'The Satanic Verses' or anybody associated with his work, nor will it encourage or assist anybody to do so\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "277079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277079", "title": "Triratna Buddhist Community", "text": "Triratna Buddhist Community\n\nThe Triratna Buddhist Community (formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO)) is an international fellowship of Buddhists, and others who aspire to its path of mindfulness, under the leadership of the Triratna Buddhist Order (formerly the Western Buddhist Order). It was founded by Sangharakshita in the UK in 1967, and describes itself as \"an international network dedicated to communicating Buddhist truths in ways appropriate to the modern world\". In keeping with Buddhist traditions, it also pays attention to contemporary ideas, particularly drawn from Western philosophy, psychotherapy, and art.\n\nWorldwide, more than 100 groups are affiliated with the community, including in North America, Australasia and Europe. In the UK, it is one of the largest Buddhist movements, with some 30 urban centres and retreat centres. Its centre there is at Coddington, Herefordshire. Its largest following, however, is in India, where it is known as Triratna Bauddha Mahāsaṅgha (TBM) (formerly the Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana (TBMSG)).\n\nThe community has been described as \"perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization,\" and \"an important contributor to Buddhism on the world stage.\" It has also been criticised, most notably for lacking \"spiritual lineage\" and over claims of sexual exploitation and misogyny during the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nMeditation is the common thread through activities. Order members teach two practices: (a) \"The mindfulness of breathing\" (anapanasati), in which practitioners focus on the rise and fall of the breath; and (b) \"The metta bhavana\", which approximately translates from the original Pali as \"the cultivation of lovingkindness\". These practices are felt to be complementary in promoting equanimity and friendliness towards others. Some friends of the Order may have little, if any, other involvement in its activities; but friendship, Sangha, and community are encouraged at all levels as essential contexts for meditation.\n\nThe founder, Sangharakshita, described meditation as having four phases. The first two according to his system ('integration' and 'positive emotion', can be correlated to the traditional category of \"calming\" \"samatha\" practices, and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to \"insight\" or \"vipassana\" practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught.\n\nThese phases are:\n\n\nCentres also teach scripture, yoga and other methods of self-improvement, some of which are felt by some commentators to come from outside the Buddhist tradition. Recently, community activities have begun to include outdoor festivals, online meditation courses, arts festivals, poetry and writing workshops, tai chi, karate, and pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India. For many years, the community charity Karuna Trust (UK) has raised money for aid projects in India.\n\nAs among Buddhists generally, Puja is a ritual practice at some events, intended to awaken the desire to liberate all beings from suffering. The most common ritual consists of a puja, derived and adapted from the \"Bodhicaryavatara\" of Shantideva.\n\nRetreats provide a chance to focus on meditational practice more intensely, in a residential context outside of a retreatant's everyday life. community retreats can be broadly categorised into meditation retreats, study retreats, and solitary retreats. Retreat lengths vary from short weekends to one or two weeks.\n\nBusinesses, said to operate to the principle of \"right livelihood\", generate funds for the movement, as well seeking to provide environments for spiritual growth through employment. Emphasis is placed on teamwork, and on contributing to the welfare of others: for example by funding social projects and by considering ethical matters such as fair trade. The largest community business was Windhorse:Evolution, a gift wholesaling business and a chain of gift shops. Windhorse:Evolution closed down in 2015.\n\nMany cities with a Triratna centre also have a residential community. The first of these was formed after a retreat where some participants wanted to continue retreat-style living. Since it was felt that the most stable communities tended to be single sex, this has become the paradigm for communities. Support from fellow practitioners in a community is seen to be effective in helping members make spiritual progress.\n\nThe largest Triratna centre in the UK is the London Buddhist Centre in Bethnal Green, East London, which offers drop-in lunchtime meditation sessions each weekday, open to beginners, as well as courses and classes through the week. The centre's courses for depression, based on the mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy methodology of Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, featured in the \"Financial Times\" in 2008. This initiative is supported by the local authority, the London borough of Tower Hamlets. \"The Times\" has also reported on the centre's work with those affected by alcohol dependency \n\nAccording to the community, six characteristics define it:\n\n\"The FWBO's attitude to spreading the Dharma is one of heartfelt urgency,\" wrote Stephen Batchelor, a prominent British Buddhist author, in a book published in 1994. \"For the FWBO, Western Society as such needs to be subject to the unflinching scrutiny of Buddhist values.\"\n\nThe Triratna Buddhist Order is the focal-point of the community, and is a network of friendships between individuals who have made personal commitments to the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, in communion with others.\nMembers are known as dharmacharis (masculine) or dharmacharinis (feminine), and are ordained in accord with a ceremony formulated by the founder. At ordination they are given a religious name in Pali or Sanskrit. While there is an informal hierarchy within the order, there are no higher ordinations. A small number of members, however, take vows of celibacy and adopt a simpler lifestyle. Contrary to the traditional Buddhist structure of separating lay and monastic members, the order combines monastic and lay lifestyles under one ordination, a practice not dissimilar to that which evolved in some Japanese schools of Buddhism.\n\nAs with followers of the Shingon school of Buddhism, order members observe ten precepts (ethical training rules). These precepts are different from monastic vows and do not appear in the Vinaya Pitaka, but were formulated on the basis of the so-called \"dasa-kusala-dhammas\" (ten wholesome actions). These are found in several places in the Pāli Canon, as well as in some Sanskrit sources. The karma sections of the fundamental meditation texts of all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism also list these acts as basic guidelines for lay or ordained practitioners intent on observing the law of cause and effect.\n\nBeyond this, a commitment to personal dharma practice and to remain in communication with other members are the only expectations. Ordination confers no special status, nor any specific responsibilities, although many order members choose to take on responsibilities for such things as teaching meditation and dharma. In mid-2008, there were around 1,500 members of the order, in more than 20 countries.\n\nIn the Triratna community, as in the Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, \"sangha\" is interpreted as the Buddhist community as a whole. Someone who regularly attends community activities is considered to be a \"friend\". Friends do not have to regard themselves as Buddhists, and can be of any faith, or none. Some choose, after some time, to participate in a formal ceremony of affiliation, and thus become a \"mitra.\" \"Mitra\" is Sanskrit for \"friend\", which in this case denotes a person who considers themselves Buddhist, who makes an effort to live in accordance with the five ethical precepts, and who feels that this spiritual community is the appropriate one for them.\n\nThose who wish to join the Order must request this in writing. It will then take several years to prepare for ordination. This is an informal process, the focus of which is to deepen one's commitment.\n\nSome Friends, Mitras and Order members decide, at least for a while, to study teachings from outside the community, including non-Buddhist traditions such as Sufism.\n\nAs the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by Sangharakshita. He had then recently returned to England after spending two decades as a Buddhist and monk in India, following demobilisation from the British army. He had been born in south London as Dennis Lingwood, in August 1925. He would lead the organisation until his formal retirement in 1995, and would continue to exert a decisive influence on its thinking and practices thereafter.\n\nIn the 1990s, the order grew in India, and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Indian members now make up about half the movement's formal membership. In a book published in 2005, the FWBO's members and supporters were estimated to number 100,000, the majority of whom were in India.\n\nIn 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a \"preceptor's college\", based in Birmingham. In 2000, the first chair of a preceptor's council was chosen by Sangharakshita. In future, this position will be elected by the WBO to five-year terms.\n\nIn 2003, the public preceptors, responding to feedback, decided to move away from a formal relationship to the order and movement, and to concentrate on the ordination of new order members, teaching and dharma practice. At the same time, to increase flexibility, the number of preceptors was expanded.\n\nIn the spring of 2010, the Western Buddhist Order and Friends of the Western Buddhist Order changed their names to the Triratna Buddhist Order (which approximates in English to the name used in India - Triratna Bauddha Mahasangha) and the Triratna Buddhist Community. Since its western foundation the movement had spread to other parts of the world, including India where it was known by a different, non-western, name, and Indian members had long wished for one single worldwide name. An official history acknowledges this to have been controversial among some Order members. (\"Triratna\", Sanskrit term meaning Three Jewels)\n\nAlthough Sangharakshita studied under, and in some cases received initiations from, eminent Buddhist teachers during his two decades in India, including Jagdish Kashyap, Dhardo Rinpoche, HH Dudjom Rinpoche, HH Dilgo Khyentse, and Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, author James William Coleman has noted that \"he never worked closely enough with any teacher to be recognized as a dharma-heir\".\n\nRather than leadership by a guru, the community instead operates through what has been called a \"friendly hierarchy,\" which some critics have said can cause problems. In 1997, Stephen Batchelor, a prominent Buddhist commentator, was quoted as saying that the FWBO operated as \"a self-enclosed system\" and that their writings \"have the predictability of those who believe they have all the answers\".\n\nIn 1980 Sangharakshita wrote of his \"conviction that the less the FWBO is involved with 'Buddhist groups' and with individuals affiliated to existing Buddhist traditions, the better.\" Currently, however, the community is a member of the European Buddhist Union and the Network of Buddhist Organisations, individual members of the order serve on the board of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, and the FWBO's former magazine, \"Dharma Life\", frequently carried articles by Buddhists from other organisations.\n\nIn October 1997, the FWBO and Western Buddhist Order were rocked by a report by the religious affairs correspondent of the UK newspaper \"The Guardian\", which made wide-ranging allegations of sexual misconduct, dogmatism and misogyny within the movement during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe most detailed complaints reported were claims by Mark Dunlop, who had lived with the movement's founder for a number of years in the early 1970s, and left the order in 1985. The report described intimate details of what Dunlop characterised as their relationship, and claimed that Sangharakshita, who declined to comment, had told him “that to develop spiritually he had to get over his anti-homosexual conditioning.”\n\nThe report contained further allegations from an anonymous source, who said that he had been persuaded into a sexual relationship with the leader of FWBO's centre in Croydon, south of London. “The head of the community was a very powerful, intrusive personality and incredibly manipulative. He would intuitively become aware of people's vulnerabilities,” the source was reported to have said.\n\nA third concern drew on complaints by the mother of a former FWBO member who had committed suicide in 1990, following a history of depression. A report by a clinical psychologist said, among other things: “He feels the community attempted to alienate him from his family and from women, and that direct attempts were made to encourage him to practise homosexuality. He stated that he did not indulge in homosexual practices, although attempts were made for him to do so both by using inducements and by using threats.”\n\nFollowing \"The Guardian\" report, a widespread debate ensued. Critics pointed to writings by Sangharakshita, and his senior advisor Dharmachari Subhuti, which placed such emphasis on single-sex activities, and what the Triratna Buddhist Community calls “spiritual friendship”, that the potential for misunderstandings or inappropriate behaviour appeared to some to be inevitable.\n\nThe FWBO had long been known for questioning assumptions about family life, and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism:\n\nIn an official biography of Sangharakshita, published in 1994, and reissued in 2009, Subhuti says: “Sangharakshita believes that men must break down their fear of homosexuality by facing the fact that there may be some element of sexual attraction towards their friends.”\n\n\"The Guardian\" report also raised controversy over statements by Sangharakshita which it interpreted as adverse to women and the family. Expressing views found in Buddhist texts from their earliest times, he has argued, for example, that, at least in the early stages of their spiritual careers, men are more apt to commit themselves to the spiritual life than women. In 1986, he wrote that the couple and nuclear family can be sources of neurosis.\n\nAlthough scriptures and historians recognize that the Buddha himself had concerns over such issues, particularly after the birth of his son Rahula, when he left home convinced that \"family life was incompatible with the highest forms of spirituality\", critics cite Sangharakshita's conservative views as evidence that misogynystic attitudes persisted in the FWBO during the 1980s.\nEvidence that those ideas may have been more widely held is also found in the writings of Subhuti, who echoes the sutras when he says in his book, 'Women, men and angels,' that to be reborn as a woman is to be less spiritually able than to be reborn as a man.\n\nAs a movement, what was then the FWBO gave detailed responses and staunchly supported its founder, while in 2010 the renamed movement published an official history which acknowledged widespread concern among order members that, at least in the 1980s and before, the founder had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men.\n\nThe controversies have attracted little public interest, and in recent years both \"The Guardian\", and its sister Sunday newspaper, \"The Observer\", have run many supportive items, recommending community activities.\nA \"Guardian\" Web directory listed the FWBO website as \"a good starting point for children.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He is a spokesman for the organisation. \n\nAt a July 2014 demonstration in Sydney, Doureihi described the conflict against Israel as, \"a civilizational struggle between Islam and between kufir,\" further saying that, \"this is an Islamic struggle to liberate Islamic lands, to re-institute Islamic rule over what is, and will always be, Islamic land.\" Regarding Jews who currently live in Israel, Doureihi said, \"our advice, very clearly, is to return to the lands from which you immigrated, to do so peacefully before you will do so forcefully.\"\n\nIn September 2014, in a speech to supporters at Lakemba, he said, \"Let me say clearly, even if a single bomb went off, even if a thousand bombs went off in this country, all it will prove is that Muslims are angry\".\n\nIn an October 2014 interview with ABC's Emma Alberici, Doureihi was asked his opinion on tactics employed by ISIS but instead he repeatedly diverted the topic in question to discuss Hizb ut-Tahrir's view about the origins of the crisis in Iraq and Syria and to express his condemnation of the role of Western nations in the Muslim world. Following the interview, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, \"Hizb ut-Tahrir is an organisation with an ideology which justifies terrorism, and that's why I say it's un-Australian, it's also un-Islamic.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1451759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1451759", "title": "Yated Ne'eman (Israel)", "text": "Yated Ne'eman (Israel)\n\nYated Ne'eman () is an Israeli daily Hebrew language newspaper based in Bnei Brak. The Hebrew edition is published daily except on the Jewish Sabbath. A weekly English language edition was published in Israel and distributed in Israel, South Africa and Britain until December 2006.\n\nAn English language newspaper by the same name is published in New York. It was formerly affiliated with the Israeli newspaper, but is currently independent. This article concentrates on the Israeli Yated Ne'eman.\n\nThe paper was founded in 1985 by Rabbis Elazar Shach (1898–2001) and Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky (1899–1985). In 1988 Rabbi Shach went on to found the Degel HaTorah political party that later joined forces with Agudath Israel and is called United Torah Judaism. The paper was founded as part of a broad initiative to have a full range of social and communal organizations that specifically serve the Lithuanian Torah community, after it was felt that Agudat Israel, its institutions, and their paper Hamodia no longer represented their point of view.\n\n\"Yated Ne'eman\" is controlled by its rabbinic board which defers to Rabbi Nissim Karelitz and Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman on all matters pertaining to the content of the newspaper.\n\nIn the spirit of Rabbi Shach, its ideology is anti-Zionist, with strong opposition to both religious Zionism as well as secular Zionism. In practice, these particular views are reflected in only a handful of articles each year. Most of the content reports news related to the religious community and articles supporting their ideology which is based on Torah study and mitzvah observance and does not define its basic identity in political terms.\n\nSince December 2006, the Dei'ah Vedibur website has continued offering only limited news coverage and occasional religious content in English. The website is edited by Mordecai Plaut.\n\nThe Yated Neeman newspaper published in New York was originally affiliated with the Jerusalem paper of the same name, but is no longer affiliated due to a schism.\n\nThe Hebrew phrase \"yated ne'eman\" literally refers to a peg strongly anchored in the ground, and is used figuratively to describe a secure connection or something which can be relied upon. The name was supposedly given by Rabbi Kanievsky and comes from Isaiah 22 verse 23, \"ותקעתיו יתד, במקום נאמן\", translated as \"And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place\", or as \"I will drive him like a peg in a firm place\".\n\nOn April 3, 2009, the paper published a manipulated picture of Israeli cabinet ministers. Female cabinet ministers Limor Livnat and Sofa Landver were digitally removed from the published picture and replaced with male ministers Ariel Atias and Moshe Kahlon.\n\nIn 2015, the newspaper refused to print advertisements for the political campaign of U'Bizchutan, a newly formed political party dedicated to the needs of Haredi women and including female candidates on its slate. Ruth Kolian, head of the party, then petitioned the court to stop the discriminatory practice. The party prevailed and the court ordered the newspaper to accept the advertisements. The court rejected the claims made by the news organizations that they might offend customers by publishing ads for the Haredi women's party. The head of the Rackman Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women at Bar-Ilan University's Law Faculty, Professor Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, called the court decision \"a historic legal precedent which determines that in certain circumstances, considerations of equality for women and election equality, as well as preventing discrimination against women and their preventing their exclusion, surpass property rights of commercial bodies like newspapers. This is the height of women's exclusion. Haredi women are not only prevented in practice from realizing the basic human right of running and being elected for Knesset, they are also denied the equal opportunity to inform their potential voters that they are running independently.\" Nevertheless, the paper still refused to publish the advertisement and it never ran.\n\n\n"}
