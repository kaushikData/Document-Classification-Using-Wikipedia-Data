She was the mother of the warlord Nong Zhigao (1025–1055). Alongside her son, father, and husband, she led the Zhuang and Nùng minorities of the Sino-Vietnamese frontier against Vietnamese and Chinese foes.\n\nA Nong was born around 1005, the daughter of a chieftain who was enfeoffed as a zhou-level official by the Han Chinese. Her brother, Nong Dang-dao, inherited the Zhuang heartland region. A Nong married the chieftain and zhou-level official Nong Quan-fu (Nùng Tồn Phúc) around 1020. She had several children, chief among them Nong Zhigao (born 1025).\n\nAccording to a legend of Zhetu villagers from Guangnan County, A Nong was both brave and wise. She is called \"Yah Woeng\" (Powerful Mother), with the legend recounting that she became accidentally pregnant one day. Her husband was unknown to her, as he always visited her at night. Per her father's suggestion, she tied a silk thread to his leg one night, only to discover the thread tied to the leg of one of their family dogs. Before fleeing to escape the wrath of her father, the dog told her that she would give birth when she met a deer. She gave birth, though when she met a buffalo. The legend relates that her son, Nong Zhigao, was defeated by a Chinese emperor because he was born prematurely.\n\nAlthough the \"History of Song\" describes A Nong as a shamaness who engaged in magic, including ritual human sacrifice, but Confucian prejudices may color the data. The Zhuang gender system was egalitarian, relative to Confucian orthodoxy. Confucian historians usually minimized or ignored powerful women, attributing their actions to their fathers, husbands, or sons. But the importance of Zhuang matriarch A Nong can be perceived, despite their veil of Confucian prejudices.\n\nLater events suggest that A Nong influenced her husband to kill his brother and take lands belonging to the Cen clan. The Nong clan then grew in power, with Nong Quan-fu founding the kingdom of Longevity (長生國) and styling himself Tu Dan Chao, the first king of Dali. In 1039, Vietnamese emperor Lý Thái Tông led an army into the region and captured Nong Quan-fu and much of his family. They were executed, though A Nong and her son Nong Zhigao both escaped.\n\nA Nong was reputed to be resourceful; \"Zhigao often asked for and adopted her strategies when conquering cities and towns. She arrogated herself the title of Empress Dowager.\"\n\nA Nong and Nong Zhigao developed close relationships with Chinese traders who made regular trips from Guangzhou to purchase gold. A Nong, with a trader known as Huang Wei, advised Nong Zhigao to engage Song forces at Yong. He was successful and went on to capture Hengzhou and Wuzhou before laying an unsuccessful siege on Canton in 1052. The court of Song placed bounties on the heads of Nong Zhigao and A Nong. A Nong's head fetched a 3,000 guan bounty and an official post — a greater bounty than those placed on two Cantonese traitors. Following the mobilization of Song forces and a military defeat at Yong, A Nong and Nong Zhigao fled to Temo in Yunnan, where they attempted to raise more troops. They were caught and A Nong was executed in 1055.\n\nA Nong led a long struggle to preserve the unity of her people, but the forces arrayed against her were too great. Zhuang women have continued to act as leaders in the region, some of them worthy successors to A Nong, including the remarkable Zhuang woman Wa Shi.\n\n\nCitations\nWorks cited\n\n"}

Anagarika simply means a practicing Buddhist who leads a nomadic life without attachment in order to focus on the dharma. \n\nAnagarika was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh and descended from Buddhists of India forced east by the eleventh century Muslim invasion.\n\nHe was an active member of the Maha Bodhi Society whose purpose was the resuscitation of Buddhism in India and the restoration of ancient Buddhist shrines there. Munindra was the superintendent of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya from 1953 to 1957, the first Buddhist to hold this position in modern times. From 1957 to 1966 he lived in Burma, where he was a close disciple of Mahasi Sayadaw, who authorized him to teach vipassana meditation. While in Burma he also studied the Pali canon thoroughly, before returning to India, where he taught vipassana for many years in Bodh Gaya. He was known to be very open-minded and relaxed in the way he taught. He would encourage his students to study with other teachers, and investigate other traditions.\n\nDuring his stay in Burma he came in close contact with S. N. Goenka and had dhamma discussions with him. Subsequently, he wished to learn Vipassana from Sayagyi U Ba Khin but since he had already learnt Vipassana from a monk, Sayagyi expressed his inability to teach him Vipassana in the tradition of Ledi Sayadaw.\n\nFinally, his wish was fulfilled a few years later when S. N. Goenka started teaching Vipassana in India. Munindra joined a 10-day course conducted by Goenka at Bodhgaya. He was very impressed by the technique, as expressed in a letter of appreciation that he wrote to Sayagyi U Ba Khin after the course.\n\nHe spent the last part of his life living at the Vipassana Research Institute's main meditation centre, Dhamma Giri, at the village of Igatpuri, India, as a guest of his close friend S.

{"id": "18598148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18598148", "title": "Arthur C. Clarke", "text": "Arthur C. Clarke\n\nSir Arthur Charles Clarke (16 December 1917 – 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.\n\nHe is famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the 1968 film \"\", widely considered to be one of the most influential films of all time. Clarke was a science writer, who was both an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability. On these subjects he wrote over a dozen books and many essays, which appeared in various popular magazines. In 1961 he was awarded the Kalinga Prize, an award which is given by UNESCO for popularising science. These along with his science fiction writings eventually earned him the moniker \"Prophet of the Space Age\". His other science fiction writings earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership made him one of the towering figures of science fiction. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction.\n\nClarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–47 and again in 1951–53.\n\nClarke emigrated from England to Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving. That year he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his fame later on in the 1980s, from being the host of several television shows such as \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\". He lived in Sri Lanka until his death. He was knighted in 1998 and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.\nClarke was born in Minehead, Somerset, England, and grew up in nearby Bishops Lydeard. As a boy, he lived on a farm, where he enjoyed stargazing, fossil collecting, and reading American science fiction pulp magazines. He received his secondary education at Huish Grammar school in Taunton. Early influences included dinosaur cigarette cards, which led to an enthusiasm for fossils starting about 1925. Clarke attributed his interest in science fiction to reading three items: the November 1928 issue of \"Amazing Stories\" in 1929; \"Last and First Men\" by Olaf Stapledon in 1930; and \"The Conquest of Space\" by David Lasser in 1931.\n\nIn his teens, he joined the Junior Astronomical Association and contributed to \"Urania\", the society's journal, which was edited in Glasgow by Marion Eadie. At Clarke's request, she added an Astronautics Section, which featured a series of articles by him on spacecraft and space travel. Clarke also contributed pieces to the Debates and Discussions Corner, a counterblast to a \"Urania\" article offering the case against space travel, and also his recollections of the Walt Disney film \"Fantasia\". He moved to London in 1936 and joined the Board of Education as a pensions auditor. He and some fellow science fiction writers shared a flat in Gray’s Inn Road, where he got the nickname \"Ego\" because of his absorption in subjects that interested him, and would later name his office filled with memorabilia as his \"ego chamber\".\n\nDuring the Second World War from 1941 to 1946 he served in the Royal Air Force as a radar specialist and was involved in the early-warning radar defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on ground-controlled approach (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical \"Glide Path\", his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a corporal instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. He was commissioned as a pilot officer (technical branch) on 27 May 1943. He was promoted flying officer on 27 November 1943. He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley in Warwickshire and was demobilised with the rank of flight lieutenant.\n\nAfter the war he attained a first-class degree in mathematics and physics from King's College London. After this he worked as assistant editor at \"Physics Abstracts\". Clarke then served as president of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and again from 1951 to 1953.\n\nAlthough he was not the originator of the concept of geostationary satellites, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in \"Wireless World\" in October of that year. Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be \"\" (1950), \"The Exploration of Space\" (1951) and \"The Promise of Space\" (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the geostationary orbit above the equator is officially recognised by the International Astronomical Union as the Clarke Orbit.\n\nFollowing the 1968 release of \"2001\", Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the Apollo space program. On 20 July 1969 Clarke appeared as a commentator for CBS for the Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nClarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, first in Unawatuna on the south coast, and then in Colombo. Initially, he and his friend Mike Wilson travelled around Sri Lanka, diving in the coral waters around the coast with the Beachcombers club. In 1957, during a dive trip off Trincomalee, Clarke discovered the underwater ruins of a temple which would subsequently make the region popular with divers. He subsequently described it in his 1957 book \"The Reefs of Taprobane\". This was his second diving book after the 1956 \"The Coast of Coral\". Though Clarke lived mostly in Colombo, he set up a small diving school and a simple dive shop near Trincomalee. He dived often at Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee and Nilaveli.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government offered Clarke resident guest status in 1975. He was held in such high esteem that when fellow science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein came to visit, the Sri Lanka Air Force provided a helicopter to take them around the country. \nIn the early 1970s, Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was \"Rendezvous with Rama\" in 1973, which won all the main genre awards and spawned sequels that along with the \"2001\" series formed the backbone of his later career.\nIn 1986 Clarke was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.\n\nIn 1988 he was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, having originally contracted polio in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter. Clarke was for many years a Vice-Patron of the British Polio Fellowship.\n\nIn the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\". The same year he became the first Chancellor of the International Space University, serving from 1989 to 2004. He also served as Chancellor of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002.\n\nIn 1994, Clarke appeared in a science fiction film; he portrayed himself in the telefilm \"Without Warning\", an American production about an apocalyptic alien first-contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast.\n\nClarke also became active in promoting the protection of gorillas and became a patron of the Gorilla Organization which fights for the preservation of gorillas. When tantalum mining for cell phone manufacture threatened the gorillas in 2001, he lent his voice to their cause. The dive shop that he set up continues to operate from Trincomalee through the Arthur C Clarke foundation.\n\nIn the 1980s Clarke became well known to many for his television programmes \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\", \"Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers\" and \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe\".\n\nOn a trip to Florida in 1953 Clarke met and quickly married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American divorcee with a young son. They separated permanently after six months, although the divorce was not finalised until 1964. \"The marriage was incompatible from the beginning\", said Clarke. Clarke never remarried, but was close to a Sri Lankan man, Leslie Ekanayake (13 July 1947 – 4 July 1977), whom Clarke called his \"only perfect friend of a lifetime\" in the dedication to his novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\". Clarke is buried with Ekanayake, who predeceased him by three decades, in Colombo's central cemetery. In his biography of Stanley Kubrick, John Baxter cites Clarke's homosexuality as a reason why he relocated, due to more tolerant laws with regard to homosexuality in Sri Lanka. Journalists who enquired of Clarke whether he was gay were told, \"No, merely mildly cheerful.\" However, Michael Moorcock wrote: \nIn an interview in the July 1986 issue of \"Playboy\" magazine, when asked if he had had a bisexual experience, Clarke stated \"Of course. Who hasn't?\" In his obituary, Clarke's friend Kerry O'Quinn wrote: \"Yes, Arthur was gay ... As Isaac Asimov once told me, 'I think he simply found he preferred men.' Arthur didn't publicise his sexuality—that wasn't the focus of his life—but if asked, he was open and honest.\"\n\nClarke accumulated a vast collection of manuscripts and personal memoirs, maintained by his brother Fred Clarke in Taunton, Somerset, England, and referred to as the \"Clarkives\". Clarke said that some of his private diaries will not be published until 30 years after his death. When asked why they were sealed, he answered, \"Well, there might be all sorts of embarrassing things in them.\"\n\nOn 26 May 2000 he was made a Knight Bachelor \"for services to literature\" at a ceremony in Colombo. The award of a knighthood had been announced in the 1998 New Year Honours list, but investiture with the award had been delayed, at Clarke's request, because of an accusation, by the British tabloid \"The Sunday Mirror\", of paedophilia. The charge was subsequently found to be baseless by the Sri Lankan police. According to \"The Daily Telegraph\" (London), the \"Mirror\" subsequently published an apology, and Clarke chose not to sue for defamation. Clarke himself said that \"I take an extremely dim view of people mucking about with boys\", and Rupert Murdoch promised him the reporters responsible would never work in Fleet Street again. Clarke was then duly knighted.\n\nAlthough he and his home were unharmed by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami, his \"Arthur C. Clarke Diving School\" (also called \"Underwater safaris\") at Hikkaduwa near Trincomalee was destroyed. He made humanitarian appeals, and the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation worked towards better disaster notification systems. The school has since been rebuilt.\n\nBecause of his post-polio deficits, which limited his ability to travel and gave him halting speech, most of Clarke's communications in his last years were in the form of recorded addresses. In July 2007, he provided a video address for the Robert A. Heinlein Centennial in which he closed his comments with a goodbye to his fans. In September 2007, he provided a video greeting for NASA's Cassini probe's flyby of Iapetus (which plays an important role in the book of \"\"). In December 2007 on his 90th birthday, Clarke recorded a video message to his friends and fans bidding them good-bye.\n\nClarke died in Sri Lanka on 19 March 2008 after suffering from respiratory failure, according to Rohan de Silva, one of his aides. His aide described the cause as respiratory complications and heart failure stemming from post-polio syndrome.\n\nJust hours before Clarke's death a massive gamma-ray burst (GRB) reached Earth. Known as GRB 080319B, the burst set a new record as the farthest object that could be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago (roughly equal to half the time since the Big Bang), taking the light that long to reach Earth. It was suggested by Larry Sessions, a science writer for \"Sky and Telescope\" magazine blogging on earthsky.org, that the burst be named \"The Clarke Event\". \"American Atheist Magazine \"wrote of the idea: \"It would be a fitting tribute to a man who contributed so much, and helped lift our eyes and our minds to a cosmos once thought to be province only of gods.\"\n\nA few days before he died, he had reviewed the manuscript of his final work, \"The Last Theorem\", on which he had collaborated by e-mail with his contemporary Frederik Pohl. The book was published after Clarke's death. Clarke was buried alongside Leslie Ekanayake in Colombo in traditional Sri Lankan fashion on 22 March. His younger brother, Fred Clarke, and his Sri Lankan adoptive family were among the thousands in attendance.\n\nWhile Clarke had a few stories published in fanzines, between 1937 and 1945, his first professional sale appeared in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" in 1946: \"Loophole\" was published in April, while \"Rescue Party\", his first sale, was published in May. Along with his writing Clarke briefly worked as assistant editor of \"Science Abstracts\" (1949) before devoting himself in 1951 to full-time writing.\n\nClarke began carving out his reputation as a \"scientific\" science fiction writer with his first science fiction novel, \"Against the Fall of Night\", published as a novella in 1948. It was very popular and considered ground-breaking work for some of the concepts it contained. Clarke revised and expanded the novella into a full novel which was published in 1953. Clarke would later rewrite and expand this work a third time to become \"The City and the Stars\" in 1956, which rapidly became a definitive must-read in the field. His third science fiction novel, \"Childhood's End\", was also published in 1953, cementing his popularity. Clarke capped the first phase of his writing career with his sixth novel, \"A Fall of Moondust\", in 1961, which is also an acknowledged classic of the period.\n\nDuring this time, Clarke corresponded with C. S. Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, The Eastgate, to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke voiced great praise for Lewis upon his death, saying that the Ransom trilogy was one of the few works of science fiction that should be considered literature.\n\nIn 1948 he wrote \"The Sentinel\" for a BBC competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only was it the basis for \"\", but \"The Sentinel\" also introduced a more cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but still-prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of \"Childhood's End\", and the \"2001\" series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution. This also applies in the far-distant past (but our future) in \"The City and the Stars\" (and its original version, \"Against the Fall of Night\").\n\nIn Clarke's authorised biography, Neil McAleer writes that: \"many readers and critics still consider \"Childhood's End\" Arthur C. Clarke's best novel.\" But Clarke did not use ESP in any of his later stories, saying \"I've always been interested in ESP and, of course, Childhood's End was about that. But I've grown disillusioned, partly because after all this time they're still arguing about whether these things happen. I suspect that telepathy does happen.\"\n\nA collection of early essays was published in \"The View from Serendip\" (1977), which also included one short piece of fiction, \"When the Twerms Came\". Clarke also wrote short stories under the pseudonyms of E. G. O'Brien and Charles Willis. Almost all of his short stories can be found in the book \"The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke\" (2001).\n\nFor much of the later 20th century, Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein were informally known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction writers. Clarke and Heinlein began writing to each other after \"The Exploration of Space\" was published in 1951, and first met in person the following year. They remained on cordial terms for many years, including visits in the United States and Sri Lanka.\n\nClarke and Asimov first met in New York City in 1953, and they traded friendly insults and gibes for decades. They established an oral agreement, the \"Clarke–Asimov Treaty\", that when asked who was better, the two would say Clarke was the better science fiction writer and Asimov was the better science writer. In 1972, Clarke put the \"treaty\" on paper in his dedication to \"Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations\".\n\nIn 1984, Clarke testified before Congress against the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Later, at the home of Larry Niven in California, a concerned Heinlein attacked Clarke's views on United States foreign and space policy (especially the SDI), vigorously advocating a strong defence posture. Although the two later reconciled formally, they remained distant until Heinlein's death in 1988.\n\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey\", Clarke's most famous work, was extended well beyond the 1968 movie as the Space Odyssey series. In 1982, Clarke wrote a sequel to \"2001\" titled \"\", which was made into a film in 1984. Clarke wrote two further sequels that have not been adapted into motion pictures: \"\" (published in 1987) and \"\" (published in 1997).\n\n\"2061: Odyssey Three\" involves a visit to Halley's Comet on its next plunge through the Inner Solar System and a spaceship crash on the Jovian moon Europa. The whereabouts of astronaut Dave Bowman (the \"Star Child\"), the artificial intelligence HAL 9000, and the development of native life on Europa, protected by the alien Monolith, are revealed.\n\nFinally, in \"3001: The Final Odyssey\", astronaut Frank Poole's freeze-dried body, found by a spaceship beyond the orbit of Neptune, is revived by advanced medical science. The novel details the threat posed to humanity by the alien monoliths, whose actions are not always as their builders had intended.\n\nClarke's first venture into film was \"\", directed by Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick and Clarke had met in New York City in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, they decided to loosely base the story on Clarke's short story, \"The Sentinel\", written in 1948 as an entry in a BBC short story competition. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but Kubrick suggested during one of their brainstorming meetings that before beginning on the actual script, they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first, on which they would base the film. \"This is more or less the way it worked out, though toward the end, novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously, with feedback in both directions. Thus I rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushes—a rather expensive method of literary creation, which few other authors can have enjoyed.\" The novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie.\n\nDue to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation, that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film contains little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of \"cause and effect\" for the events in the novel. James Randi later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of \"2001\", Clarke left the theatre at the intermission in tears, after having watched an eleven-minute scene (which did not make it into general release) where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship, which was Kubrick's idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be.\n\nIn 1972, Clarke published \"The Lost Worlds of 2001\", which included his accounts of the production, and alternative versions of key scenes. The \"special edition\" of the novel \"\" (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film.\n\nIn 1982 Clarke continued the \"2001\" epic with a sequel, \"\". This novel was also made into a film, \"2010\", directed by Peter Hyams for release in 1984. Because of the political environment in America in the 1980s, the film presents a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear warfare not featured in the novel. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as \"2001\", but the reviews were still positive.\n\nClarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984. Titled \"The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010\", and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world. The book also included Clarke's personal list of the best science-fiction films ever made.\n\nClarke appeared in the film, first as the man feeding the pigeons while Dr. Heywood Floyd is engaged in a conversation in front of the White House. Later, in the hospital scene with David Bowman's mother, an image of the cover of \"Time\" portrays Clarke as the American President and Kubrick as the Soviet Premier.\n\nClarke's award-winning novel \"Rendezvous with Rama\" (1973) was optioned for filmmaking in the early 21st century but this motion picture is in \"development hell\" . In the early 2000s, the actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a movie based on \"Rendezvous with Rama\". After a drawn-out development process – which Freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing – it appeared that in 2003 this project might be proceeding, but this is very dubious. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, Revelations Entertainment, and David Fincher has been touted on Revelations' \"Rama\" web page as far back as 2001 as the film's director. After years of no progress, Fincher stated in an interview in late 2007 (in which he also credited the novel as being influential on the films \"Alien\" and \"\") that he is still attached to helm. Revelations indicated that Stel Pavlou had written the adaptation.\n\nIn late 2008, Fincher stated the movie is unlikely to be made. \"It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen.\" However, in 2010 it was announced that the film was still planned for future production and both Freeman and Fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script.\n\nClarke published a number of non-fiction books with essays, speeches, addresses, etc. Several of his non-fiction books are composed of chapters that can stand on their own as separate essays.\n\nIn particular, Clarke was a populariser of the concept of space travel. In 1950 he wrote \"Interplanetary Flight\", a book outlining the basics of space flight for laymen. Later books about space travel included \"The Exploration of Space\" (1951), \"The Challenge of the Spaceship\" (1959), \"Voices from the Sky\" (1965), \"The Promise of Space\" (1968, rev. ed. 1970) and \"Report on Planet Three\" (1972) among others.\n\nHis books on space travel usually included chapters about other aspects of science and technology, such as computers and bioengineering. He predicted telecommunication satellites (albeit serviced by astronauts in space suits, who would replace the satellite's vacuum tubes as they burned out).\n\nHis many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of magazine essays that eventually became \"Profiles of the Future,\" published in book form in 1962. A timetable up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a \"global library\" for 2005. The same work also contained \"Clarke's First Law\" and text that became Clarke's three laws in later editions.\n\nIn a 1959 essay Clarke predicted global satellite TV broadcasts that would cross national boundaries indiscriminately and would bring hundreds of channels available anywhere in the world. He also envisioned a \"personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one.\" He wrote: \"the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialling a number.\" Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that \"no one need ever again be lost.\" Later, in \"Profiles of the Future\", he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn a 1974 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like in the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding to a question about how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: \"He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, [points to nearby computer], but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house ... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone.\"\n\nAn extensive selection of Clarke's essays and book chapters (from 1934 to 1998; 110 pieces, 63 of them previously uncollected in his books) can be found in the book \"Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!\" (2000), together with a new introduction and many prefatory notes. Another collection of essays, all previously collected, is \"By Space Possessed\" (1993). Clarke's technical papers, together with several essays and extensive autobiographical material, are collected in \"Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography\" (1984).\n\nClarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. He first described this in a letter to the editor of \"Wireless World\" in February 1945 and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled \"Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?\", published in \"Wireless World\" in October 1945. The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honour.\n\nIt is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. According to John R. Pierce, of Bell Labs, who was involved in the Echo satellite and Telstar projects, he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 (published in 1955), using ideas that were \"in the air\", but was not aware of Clarke's article at the time. In an interview given shortly before his death, Clarke was asked whether he had ever suspected that one day communications satellites would become so important; he replied: \n\nThough different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating via satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in Hermann Oberth's 1923 book \"Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen\" (\"The Rocket into Interplanetary Space\"), and then the idea of radio communication by means of those satellites in Herman Potočnik's (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book \"Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums – der Raketen-Motor (The Problem of Space Travel — The Rocket Motor)\", sections: \"Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety\", and (possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite, but not that 3 would be optimal) \"Observing and Researching the Earth's Surface\", published in Berlin. Clarke acknowledged the earlier concept in his book \"Profiles of the Future\".\n\nClarke was an avid scuba diver and a member of the Underwater Explorers Club. In addition to writing, Clarke set up several diving-related ventures with his business partner Mike Wilson. In 1956, while scuba diving, Wilson and Clarke uncovered ruined masonry, architecture and idol images of the sunken original Koneswaram temple – including carved columns with flower insignias, and stones in the form of elephant heads – spread on the shallow surrounding seabed. Other discoveries included Chola bronzes from the original shrine, and these discoveries were described in Clarke's 1957 book \"The Reefs of Taprobane.\" In 1961, while filming off Great Basses Reef, Wilson found a wreck and retrieved silver coins. Plans to dive on the wreck the following year were stopped when Clarke developed paralysis, ultimately diagnosed as polio. A year later, Clarke observed the salvage from the shore and the surface. The ship, ultimately identified as belonging to the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, yielded fused bags of silver rupees, cannon, and other artefacts, carefully documented, became the basis for \"The Treasure of the Great Reef\". Living in Sri Lanka and learning its history also inspired the backdrop for his novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" in which he described a space elevator. This, he believed, would make rocket-based access to space obsolete and, more than geostationary satellites, would ultimately be his scientific legacy.\n\nThemes of religion and spirituality appear in much of Clarke's writing. He said: \"Any path to knowledge is a path to God—or Reality, whichever word one prefers to use.\" He described himself as \"fascinated by the concept of God\". J. B. S. Haldane, near the end of his life, suggested in a personal letter to Clarke that Clarke should receive a prize in theology for being one of the few people to write anything new on the subject, and went on to say that if Clarke's writings did not contain multiple contradictory theological views, he might have been a menace. When he entered the Royal Air Force, Clarke insisted that his dog tags be marked \"pantheist\" rather than the default, Church of England, and in a 1991 essay entitled \"Credo\", described himself as a logical positivist from the age of ten. In 2000, Clarke told the Sri Lankan newspaper, \"The Island\", \"I don't believe in God or an afterlife,\" and he identified himself as an atheist. He was honoured as a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism. He has also described himself as a \"crypto-Buddhist\", insisting that Buddhism is not a religion. He displayed little interest about religion early in his life, for example, only discovering a few months after marrying that his wife had strong Presbyterian beliefs.\n\nA famous quotation of Clarke's is often cited: \"One of the great tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion.\" He was quoted in \"Popular Science\" in 2004 as saying of religion: \"Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. We should get rid of it as quick as we can.\" In a three-day \"dialogue on man and his world\" with Alan Watts, Clarke stated that he was biased against religion and said that he could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time. In his introduction to the penultimate episode of \"Mysterious World\", entitled \"Strange Skies\", Clarke said: \"I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers,\" reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to \"mankind\". Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he said that his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, \"The Star\" (1955), and making \"Mysterious World\" (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said: \"How romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era.\"\n\nClarke left written instructions for a funeral that stated: \"Absolutely no religious rites of any kind, relating to any religious faith, should be associated with my funeral.\"\n\nRegarding freedom of information Clarke believed \"In the struggle for freedom \nof information, technology, not politics, will be the ultimate decider\".\n\nClarke also wrote \"It is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can \nlong survive when men have seen the Earth in its true perspective as a single small \nglobe against the stars.\"\n\nRegarding human jobs being replaced by robots Clarke said \"Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be!\"\n\nClarke supported the use of renewable energy saying \"I would like to see us kick our current addiction to oil, and adopt clean energy sources..Climate change has now added a new sense of urgency. Our civilisation depends on energy, but we can’t allow oil and coal to slowly bake our planet.\"\n\nClarke believed \"The best proof that there’s intelligent life in outer space is the fact that it hasn’t come \nhere...the fact that we have not yet found the slightest evidence\nfor life — much less intelligence — beyond this Earth does not surprise or disappoint \nme in the least. Our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like \njungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms, while the ether around them \ncarries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime\"\n\nClarke also believed \"Two possibilities \nexist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\"\n\nEarly in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel \"Childhood's End\". Citing the numerous promising paranormal claims that were shown to be fraudulent, Clarke described his earlier openness to the paranormal having turned to being \"an almost total sceptic\" by the time of his 1992 biography. During interviews, both in 1993 and 2004–2005, he stated that he did not believe in reincarnation, saying that there was no mechanism to make it possible, though he stated \"I'm always paraphrasing J. B. S. Haldane: 'The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it's stranger than we \"can\" imagine.'\" He described the idea of reincarnation as fascinating, but favoured a finite existence.\n\nClarke was well known for his television series investigating paranormal phenomena – \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\" (1980), \"Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers\" (1985) and \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe\" (1994) – enough to be parodied in an episode of \"The Goodies\" in which his show is cancelled after it is claimed that he does not exist.\n\nIn Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World he gives three kinds of \"mysteries\".\n\n\nClarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the Solar System and the world's oceans. His images of the future often feature a Utopian setting with highly developed technology, ecology and society, based on the author's ideals.\nHis early published stories usually featured the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough into the underlying decadence of his own society.\n\nA recurring theme in Clarke's works is the notion that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods. This was explored in his 1953 novel \"Childhood's End\" and briefly touched upon in his novel \"Imperial Earth\". This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book \"Last and First Men\" that \"No other book had a greater influence on my life ... [It] and its successor \"Star Maker\" (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career\".\n\nClarke won the 1963 Stuart Ballantine Medal from the Franklin Institute for the concept of satellite communications, and other honours. He won more than a dozen annual literary awards for particular works of science fiction.\n\nIn 1986, Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially £1,000) for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in the previous year. In 2001 the prize was increased to £2001, and its value now matches the year (e.g., £2005 in 2005).\nIn 2005 he lent his name to the inaugural Sir Arthur Clarke Awards—dubbed the \"Space Oscars\". His brother attended the awards ceremony, and presented an award specially chosen by Arthur (and not by the panel of judges who chose the other awards) to the British Interplanetary Society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "226045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226045", "title": "Bodh Gaya", "text": "Bodh Gaya\n\nBodh Gaya is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is famous as it is the place where Gautama Buddha is said to have obtained Enlightenment (Pali: bodhi) under what became known as the Bodhi Tree.\n\nFor Buddhists, Bodh Gaya is the most important of the main four pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha, the other three being Kushinagar, Lumbini, and Sarnath. In 2002, Mahabodhi Temple, located in Bodh Gaya, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nBodh Gaya is the most holy place for Buddhists. Situated by the bank of river Neranjana the place was then known as Uruwela. King Ashoka was the first to build a temple here.\n\nTraditionally, Buddha was born in 563 BC in what is now Nepal on the following auspicious Baisakhi purnima. As Siddhartha, he renounced his family at the age of 29 in 534 BC and travelled and meditated in search of truth. After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, he gave up that practice because it did not give him Vimukthi. Then he discovered Noble Eight-fold path without help from anyone and practiced it, then he attained Buddhatva or enlightenment. Enlightenment is a state of being completely free from lust (raga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). By gaining enlightenment, you enter Nirvana, in which the final stage is Parinirvana.\n\nAt this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been his companions of earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked his well-nourished appearance. \"Here comes the mendicant Gautama,\" they said, \"who has turned away from asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect.\" When they reminded him of his former vows, the Buddha replied, \"Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way\". This is the path which is neither easy (a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, Sarnath, 13 km n.e. of Benares.\n\nThe disciples of Gautama Siddhartha began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of Vaisakh (April–May), as per the Hindu calendar. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gaya, the day of enlightenment as Buddha Purnima, and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.\n\nThe history of Bodh Gaya is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the Chinese pilgrims Faxian in the 5th century and Xuanzang in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was conquered by Turkic armies in the 13th century.\nThe place-name, Bodh Gaya, did not come into use until the 18th century CE. Historically, it was known as Uruvela, Sambodhi (Saṃ+bodhi, “Complete Enlightenment” in Ashoka's Major Rock Edict No.8), Vajrasana (the \"Diamond Throne\" of the Buddha) or Mahabodhi (\"Great Enlightenment\"). The main monastery of Bodh Gaya used to be called the Bodhimanda-vihāra (Pali). Now it is called the Mahabodhi Temple.\n\nThe complex, located about 110 kilometres from Patna, at ,\ncontains the Mahabodhi Temple with the Vajrasana or \"diamond throne\" and the holy Bodhi tree. This tree was originally a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka, itself grown from a what is claimed to be a sapling of the original Bodhi tree.\n\nIn approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Buddhist Emperor Asoka visited Bodh Gaya in order to establish a monastery and shrine on the holy site, which have today disappeared.\n\nRepresentations of this early temple are found at Sanchi, on the toraṇas of Stūpa I, dating from around 25 BCE, and on a relief carving from the stupa railing at Bhārhut, from the early Shunga period (c. 185–c. 73 BCE). The present pyramidal temple was built at the time of the Gupta Empire, circa the 6th century CE.\n\nKittisirimegha of Sri Lanka, a contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sanghārāma near the Mahabodhi Temple, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Xuanzang (Beal, op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.\n\nSeveral Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of Bhutan, China, Japan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sikkim, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tibet and Vietnam in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect the architectural style, exterior and interior decoration of their respective countries. The statue of Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old and was brought from China. Japan's Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also pagoda shaped and is reminiscent of Bagan. The Thai temple has a typical sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles. Inside, the temple holds a massive bronze statue of Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is 25-metre statue of Buddha located within a garden which has existed there for over 100 years.\n\nAcross the Phalgu river is the Sujata Stupa, in the village of Bakraur. The stupa was dedicated to the milkmaid Sujata, who is said to have fed Gautama Buddha milk and rice as he was sitting under a Banyan tree, ending his seven years of fasting and ascetism, and allowing him to attain illumination through the Middle Way. The stupa was built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of black polished wares and punch-marked coins in the attending monastery.\n\nOn 7 July 2013, at around 05:15, a low intensity bomb blast took place in the 2500-year-old Mahabodhi Temple complex. This was followed by a series of nine low intensity blasts which resulted in two monks being injured; one was Tibetan and the other Burmese. These blasts were carried out by an Islamic terrorist organization. The serial blasts did not cause any damage to the temple or the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. Two other bombs, one under the 80-foot statue of the Buddha and the other near Karmapa Temple were defused by the police. Investigation of the blast was given to NIA (National Investigating Agency). Three unexploded bombs were also found in the Temple complex.\n\nAs per the 2001 census, Bodh Gaya had a population of 30,883. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Bodh Gaya has an average literacy rate of 51%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 63% and female literacy of 38%. 8% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7630", "title": "Catharism", "text": "Catharism\n\nCatharism (; from the Greek: , \"katharoi\", \"the pure [ones]\") was a Christian dualist or Gnostic revival movement that thrived in some areas of Southern Europe, particularly what is now northern Italy and southern France, between the 12th and 14th centuries. The followers were known as Cathars and are now mainly remembered for a prolonged period of persecution by the Catholic Church, which did not recognise their belief as being Christian. Catharism appeared in Europe in the Languedoc region of France in the 11th century and this is when the name first appears. The adherents were sometimes known as Albigensians, after the city Albi in southern France where the movement first took hold. The beliefs are believed to have been brought from Persia or the Byzantine Empire.\n\nCathar beliefs varied between communities because Catharism was initially taught by ascetic leaders who set few guidelines. The Catholic Church denounced its practices including the \"Consolamentum\" ritual, by which Cathar individuals were baptized and raised to the status of \"perfect\".\n\nCatharism may have had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and certainly in the Bogomils of the First Bulgarian Empire, who were influenced by the Paulicians resettled in Thrace (Philipopolis) by the Byzantines. Though the term \"Cathar\" () has been used for centuries to identify the movement, whether the movement identified itself with this name is debated. In Cathar texts, the terms \"Good Men\" (\"Bons Hommes\"), \"Good Women\" (\"Bonnes Femmes\"), or \"Good Christians\" (\"Bons Chrétiens\") are the common terms of self-identification.\n\nThe idea of two gods or principles, one good and the other evil, was central to Cathar beliefs. The good God was the God of the New Testament and the creator of the spiritual realm, contrasted with the evil Old Testament God, creator of the physical world whom many Cathars, and particularly their persecutors, identified as Satan. All visible matter, including the human body, was created by this evil god; matter was therefore tainted with sin. This was antithetical to the monotheistic Catholic Church, whose fundamental principle was that there was only one God, who created all things visible and invisible. Cathars thought human spirits were the genderless spirits of angels trapped within the physical creation of the evil god, destined to be reincarnated until they achieved salvation through the consolamentum.\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Pope Innocent III attempted to end Catharism by sending missionaries and by persuading the local authorities to act against them. In 1208, Innocent's papal legate Pierre de Castelnau was murdered while returning to Rome after excommunicating Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who, in his view, was too lenient with the Cathars. Pope Innocent III then abandoned the option of sending Catholic missionaries and jurists, declared Pierre de Castelnau a martyr and launched the Albigensian Crusade which all but ended Catharism.\n\nThe origins of the Cathars' beliefs are unclear, but most theories agree they came from the Byzantine Empire, mostly by the trade routes and spread from the First Bulgarian Empire to the Netherlands. The name of Bulgarians (\"Bougres\") was also applied to the Albigensians, and they maintained an association with the similar Christian movement of the Bogomils (\"Friends of God\") of Thrace. \"That there was a substantial transmission of ritual and ideas from Bogomilism to Catharism is beyond reasonable doubt.\" Their doctrines have numerous resemblances to those of the Bogomils and the Paulicians, who influenced them, as well as the earlier Marcionites, who were found in the same areas as the Paulicians, the Manicheans and the Christian Gnostics of the first few centuries AD, although, as many scholars, most notably Mark Pegg, have pointed out, it would be erroneous to extrapolate direct, historical connections based on theoretical similarities perceived by modern scholars.\n\nJohn Damascene, writing in the 8th century AD, also notes of an earlier sect called the \"Cathari\", in his book \"On Heresies\", taken from the epitome provided by Epiphanius of Salamis in his \"Panarion\". He says of them: \"They absolutely reject those who marry a second time, and reject the possibility of penance [that is, forgiveness of sins after baptism]\". These are probably the same Cathari (actually Novations) who are mentioned in Canon 8 of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in the year 325, which states \"... [I]f those called Cathari come over [to the faith], let them first make profession that they are willing to communicate [share full communion] with the twice-married, and grant pardon to those who have lapsed ...\"\n\nIt is likely that we have only a partial view of their beliefs, because the writings of the Cathars were mostly destroyed because of the doctrinal threat perceived by the Papacy; much of our existing knowledge of the Cathars is derived from their opponents. Conclusions about Cathar ideology continue to be debated with commentators regularly accusing their opponents of speculation, distortion and bias. There are a few texts from the Cathars themselves which were preserved by their opponents (the \"Rituel Cathare de Lyon\") which give a glimpse of the inner workings of their faith, but these still leave many questions unanswered. One large text which has survived, \"The Book of Two Principles\" (\"Liber de duobus principiis\"), elaborates the principles of dualistic theology from the point of view of some of the Albanenses Cathars.\n\nIt is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable historical Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld. A landmark in the \"institutional history\" of the Cathars was the Council, held in 1167 at Saint-Félix-Lauragais, attended by many local figures and also by the Bogomil \"papa\" Nicetas, the Cathar bishop of (northern) France and a leader of the Cathars of Lombardy.\n\nThe Cathars were largely local, Western European/Latin Christian phenomena, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-12th century, northern France around the same time, and particularly the Languedoc—and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern Italy, the Cathars attained their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the Inquisitions of the fourteenth century finally extirpated them.\n\nCathars, in general, formed an anti-sacerdotal party in opposition to the pre-Reformation Christian Church, protesting against what they perceived to be the moral, spiritual and political corruption of the church.\n\nWhen Bishop Fulk of Toulouse, a key leader of the anti-Cathar persecutions, excoriated the Languedoc Knights for not pursuing the heretics more diligently, he received the reply, \"We cannot. We have been reared in their midst. We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of perfection.\"\n\nIn contrast to the Catholic Church, the Cathars had but one central rite, the Consolamentum, or Consolation. This involved a brief spiritual ceremony to remove all sin from the believer and to induct him or her into the next higher level as a perfect.\n\nMany believers would receive the Consolamentum as death drew near, performing the ritual of liberation at a moment when the heavy obligations of purity required of Perfecti would be temporally short. Some of those who received the sacrament of the consolamentum upon their death-beds may thereafter have shunned further food or drink and, more often and in addition, expose themselves to extreme cold, in order to speed death. This has been termed the \"endura\". It was claimed by some of the church writers that when a Cathar, after receiving the Consolamentum, began to show signs of recovery he or she would be smothered in order to ensure his or her entry into paradise. Other than at such moments of \"extremis\", little evidence exists to suggest this was a common Cathar practice.\n\nThe Cathars also refused the sacrament of the eucharist saying that it could not possibly be the body of Christ. They also refused to partake in the practice of Baptism by water. The following two quotes are taken from the Inquisitor Bernard Gui's experiences with the Cathar practices and beliefs:\nSome believe that the Catharist conception of Jesus resembled nontrinitarian modalistic monarchianism (Sabellianism) in the West and adoptionism in the East.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux's biographer and other sources accuse some Cathars of Arianism, and some scholars see Cathar Christology as having traces of earlier Arian roots. According to some of their contemporary enemies Cathars did not accept the normative Trinitarian understanding of Jesus, but considered him the human form of an angel similar to Docetic Christology. Zoé Oldenbourg (2000) compared the Cathars to \"Western Buddhists\" because she considered that their view of the doctrine of \"resurrection\" taught by Jesus was, in fact, similar to the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation. The Cathars taught that to regain angelic status one had to renounce the material self completely. Until one was prepared to do so, he/she would be stuck in a cycle of reincarnation, condemned to live on the corrupt Earth.\n\nThe alleged sacred texts of the Cathars besides the \"New Testament\", include \"The Gospel of the Secret Supper, or John's Interrogation\" and \"The Book of the Two Principles\".\n\nKilling was abhorrent to the Cathars. Consequently, abstention from all animal food (sometimes exempting fish) was enjoined of the Perfecti. The Perfecti avoided eating anything considered to be a by-product of sexual reproduction. War and capital punishment were also condemned—an abnormality in Medieval Europe. In a world where few could read, their rejection of oath-taking marked them as social outcasts.\n\nTo the Cathars, reproduction was a moral evil to be avoided, as it continued the chain of reincarnation and suffering in the material world. It was claimed by their opponents that, given this loathing for procreation, they generally resorted to sodomy. Such was the situation that a charge of heresy leveled against a suspected Cathar was usually dismissed if the accused could show he was legally married.\n\nIt has been alleged that the Cathar Church of the Languedoc had a relatively flat structure, distinguishing between the baptised \"perfecti\" (a term they did not use; instead, \"bonhommes\") and ordinary unbaptised believers (\"credentes\"). By about 1140, liturgy and a system of doctrine had been established. They created a number of bishoprics, first at Albi around 1165 and after the 1167 Council at Saint-Félix-Lauragais sites at Toulouse, Carcassonne, and Agen, so that four bishoprics were in existence by 1200. In about 1225, during a lull in the Albigensian Crusade, the bishopric of Razès was added. Bishops were supported by their two assistants: a \"filius maior\" (typically the successor) and a \"filius minor\", who were further assisted by deacons. The \"perfecti\" were the spiritual elite, highly respected by many of the local people, leading a life of austerity and charity. In the apostolic fashion they ministered to the people and travelled in pairs.\n\nCatharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the \"consolamentum.\"\n\nCathars believed that one would be repeatedly reincarnated until one commits to the self-denial of the material world. A man could be reincarnated as a woman and vice versa, thereby rendering gender meaningless. The spirit was of utmost importance to the Cathars and was described as being immaterial and sexless. Because of this belief, the Cathars saw women as equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender as held by the Catholic Church.\n\nWomen accused of being heretics in early medieval Christianity included those labeled Gnostics, Cathars, and Beguines, as well as several other groups that were sometimes \"tortured and executed\". Cathars, like the Gnostics who preceded them, assigned more importance to the role of Mary Magdalene in the spread of early Christianity than the church previously did. Her vital role as a teacher contributed to the Cathar belief that women could serve as spiritual leaders. Women were found to be included in the Perfecti in significant numbers, with numerous receiving the \"consolamentum\" after being widowed. Having reverence for the Gospel of John, the Cathars saw Mary Magdalene as perhaps even more important than Saint Peter, the founder of the church.\n\nThe Cathar movement proved successful in gaining female followers because of its proto-feminist teachings along with the general feeling of exclusion from the Catholic church. Catharism attracted numerous women with the promise of a leadership role that the Catholic Church did not allow. Catharism let women become a perfect of the faith, a position of far more prestige than anything the Catholic Church offered. These female perfects were required to adhere to a strict and ascetic lifestyle, but were still able to have their own houses. Although many women found something attractive in Catharism, not all found its teachings convincing. A notable example is Hildegard of Bingen, who in 1163 gave a widely renowned sermon against the Cathars in Cologne. During this speech, Hildegard announced a state of eternal punishment and damnation to all those who accepted Cathar beliefs.\n\nWhile women perfects rarely traveled to preach the faith, they still played a vital role in the spreading of the Catharism by establishing group homes for women. Though it was extremely uncommon, there were isolated cases of female Cathars leaving their homes to spread the faith. In Cathar communal homes (ostals), women were educated in the faith, and these women would go on to bear children who would then also become believers. Through this pattern the faith grew exponentially through the efforts of women as each generation passed. Among some groups of Cathars there were more women than there were men.\n\nDespite women having an instrumental role in the growing of the faith, misogyny was not completely absent from the Cathar movement. Some seemingly misogynistic Cathar beliefs include that one's last incarnation had to be experienced as a man to break the cycle. This belief was inspired by later French Cathars, which taught that women must be reborn as men in order to achieve salvation. Another one was that the sexual allure of women impeded man's ability to reject the material world. Toward the end of the Cathar movement, Catharism became more misogynistic and started the practice of excluding women perfects. However, the influence of these type of misogynistic beliefs and practices remained limited (Later Italian perfects still included women.)\n\nIn 1147, Pope Eugene III sent a legate to the Cathar district in order to arrest the progress of the Cathars. The few isolated successes of Bernard of Clairvaux could not obscure the poor results of this mission, which clearly showed the power of the sect in the Languedoc at that period. The missions of Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus to Toulouse and the Toulousain in 1178, and of Henry of Marcy, cardinal-bishop of Albano, in 1180–81, obtained merely momentary successes. Henry's armed expedition, which took the stronghold at Lavaur, did not extinguish the movement.\n\nDecisions of Catholic Church councils—in particular, those of the Council of Tours (1163) and of the Third Council of the Lateran (1179)—had scarcely more effect upon the Cathars. When Pope Innocent III came to power in 1198, he was resolved to deal with them.\n\nAt first Innocent tried peaceful conversion, and sent a number of legates into the Cathar regions. They had to contend not only with the Cathars, the nobles who protected them, and the people who respected them, but also with many of the bishops of the region, who resented the considerable authority the Pope had conferred upon his legates. In 1204, Innocent III suspended a number of bishops in Occitania; in 1205 he appointed a new and vigorous bishop of Toulouse, the former troubadour Foulques. In 1206 Diego of Osma and his canon, the future Saint Dominic, began a programme of conversion in Languedoc; as part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at Verfeil, Servian, Pamiers, Montréal and elsewhere.\n\nDominic met and debated with the Cathars in 1203 during his mission to the Languedoc. He concluded that only preachers who displayed real sanctity, humility and asceticism could win over convinced Cathar believers. The institutional Church as a general rule did not possess these spiritual warrants. His conviction led eventually to the establishment of the Dominican Order in 1216. The order was to live up to the terms of his famous rebuke, \"Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth.\" However, even Dominic managed only a few converts among the Cathari.\n\nIn January 1208 the papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau—a Cistercian monk, theologian and canon lawyer—was sent to meet the ruler of the area, Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse. Known for excommunicating noblemen who protected the Cathars, Castelnau excommunicated Raymond for abetting heresy following an allegedly fierce argument during which Raymond supposedly threatened Castelnau with violence. Shortly thereafter, Castelnau was murdered as he returned to Rome, allegedly by a knight in the service of Count Raymond. His body was returned and laid to rest in the Abbey at Saint Gilles.\n\nAs soon as he heard of the murder, the Pope ordered the legates to preach a crusade against the Cathars and wrote a letter to Philip Augustus, King of France, appealing for his intervention—or an intervention led by his son, Louis. This was not the first appeal but some see the murder of the legate as a turning point in papal policy. Others claim it as a fortuitous event in allowing the Pope to excite popular opinion and to renew his pleas for intervention in the south. The chronicler of the crusade which followed, Peter of Vaux de Cernay, portrays the sequence of events in such a way that, having failed in his effort to peaceably demonstrate the errors of Catharism, the Pope then called a formal crusade, appointing a series of leaders to head the assault.\n\nThe French King refused to lead the crusade himself, and could not spare his son to do so either—despite his victory against John, King of England, there were still pressing issues with Flanders and the empire and the threat of an Angevin revival. Philip did however sanction the participation of some of his more bellicose and ambitious—some might say dangerous—barons, notably Simon de Montfort and Bouchard de Marly. There followed twenty years of war against the Cathars and their allies in the Languedoc: the Albigensian Crusade.\n\nThis war pitted the nobles of France against those of the Languedoc. The widespread northern enthusiasm for the Crusade was partially inspired by a papal decree permitting the confiscation of lands owned by Cathars and their supporters. This not only angered the lords of the south but also the French King, who was at least nominally the suzerain of the lords whose lands were now open to despoliation and seizure. Philip Augustus wrote to Pope Innocent in strong terms to point this out—but the Pope did not change his policy. As the Languedoc was supposedly teeming with Cathars and Cathar sympathisers, this made the region a target for northern French noblemen looking to acquire new fiefs. The barons of the north headed south to do battle.\n\nTheir first target was the lands of the Trencavel, powerful lords of Carcassonne, Béziers, Albi and the Razes. Little was done to form a regional coalition and the crusading army was able to take Carcassonne, the Trencavel capital, incarcerating Raymond Roger Trencavel in his own citadel where he died within three months; champions of the Occitan cause claimed that he was murdered. Simon de Montfort was granted the Trencavel lands by the Pope and did homage for them to the King of France, thus incurring the enmity of Peter II of Aragon who had held aloof from the conflict, even acting as a mediator at the time of the siege of Carcassonne. The remainder of the first of the two Cathar wars now focused on Simon's attempt to hold on to his gains through winters where he was faced, with only a small force of confederates operating from the main winter camp at Fanjeaux, with the desertion of local lords who had sworn fealty to him out of necessity—and attempts to enlarge his newfound domains in the summer when his forces were greatly augmented by reinforcements from France, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nSummer campaigns saw him not only retake, sometimes with brutal reprisals, what he had lost in the \"close\" season, but also seek to widen his sphere of operation—and we see him in action in the Aveyron at St. Antonin and on the banks of the Rhone at Beaucaire. Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the Battle of Muret—a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies—but also the death of Peter of Aragon—and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to de Montfort—and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire. The Battle of Muret was a massive step in the creation of the unified French kingdom and the country we know today—although Edward III, the Black Prince and Henry V would threaten later to shake these foundations.\n\nThe crusader army came under the command, both spiritually and militarily, of the papal legate Arnaud-Amaury, Abbot of Cîteaux. In the first significant engagement of the war, the town of Béziers was besieged on 22 July 1209. The Catholic inhabitants of the city were granted the freedom to leave unharmed, but many refused and opted to stay and fight alongside the Cathars.\n\nThe Cathars spent much of 1209 fending off the crusaders. The Béziers army attempted a sortie but was quickly defeated, then pursued by the crusaders back through the gates and into the city. Arnaud-Amaury, the Cistercian abbot-commander, is supposed to have been asked how to tell Cathars from Catholics. His reply, recalled by Caesarius of Heisterbach, a fellow Cistercian, thirty years later was \"Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius\"—\"Kill them all, the Lord will recognise His own\". The doors of the church of St Mary Magdalene were broken down and the refugees dragged out and slaughtered. Reportedly at least 7,000 innocent men, women and children were killed there by Catholic forces. Elsewhere in the town, many more thousands were mutilated and killed. Prisoners were blinded, dragged behind horses, and used for target practice. What remained of the city was razed by fire. Arnaud-Amaury wrote to Pope Innocent III, \"Today your Holiness, twenty thousand heretics were put to the sword, regardless of rank, age, or sex.\" \"The permanent population of Béziers at that time was then probably no more than 5,000, but local refugees seeking shelter within the city walls could conceivably have increased the number to 20,000.\"\n\nAfter the success of his siege of Carcassonne, which followed the Massacre at Béziers in 1209, Simon de Montfort was designated as leader of the Crusader army. Prominent opponents of the Crusaders were Raymond Roger Trencavel, viscount of Carcassonne, and his feudal overlord Peter II, the king of Aragon, who held fiefdoms and had a number of vassals in the region. Peter died fighting against the crusade on 12 September 1213 at the Battle of Muret. Simon de Montfort was killed on 25 June 1218 after maintaining a siege of Toulouse for nine months.\n\nThe official war ended in the Treaty of Paris (1229), by which the king of France dispossessed the house of Toulouse of the greater part of its fiefs, and that of the Trencavels (Viscounts of Béziers and Carcassonne) of the whole of their fiefs. The independence of the princes of the Languedoc was at an end. But in spite of the wholesale massacre of Cathars during the war, Catharism was not yet extinguished and Catholic forces would continue to pursue Cathars.\n\nIn 1215, the bishops of the Catholic Church met at the Fourth Council of the Lateran under Pope Innocent III; part of the agenda was combating the Cathar heresy.\n\nThe Inquisition was established in 1233 to uproot the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it succeeded in crushing Catharism as a popular movement and driving its remaining adherents underground. Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake.\n\nOn Friday, 13 May 1239, 183 men and women convinced of Catharism were burned at the stake on the orders of Robert le Bougre. Mount Guimar was already denounced as a place of heresy by the letter of the bishop of Liège to Pope Lucius II in 1144. Augustine, bishop of Hippo, had expelled from the city a Fortunatus who had fled Africa in 392; he is a Fortunatus who is reported as a monk from Africa and protected by the lord of Widomarum.\n\nFrom May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Montségur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 Cathar Perfects were burnt in an enormous pyre at the \"prat dels cremats\" (\"field of the burned\") near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of Narbonne.\nA popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar Perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at \"prat dels cremats\". It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them \"le trésor cathar\". What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars' accumulated wealth, which might have included the Holy Grail (see the Section on Historical Scholarship, below).\n\nHunted by the Inquisition and deserted by the nobles of their districts, the Cathars became more and more scattered fugitives: meeting surreptitiously in forests and mountain wilds. Later insurrections broke out under the leadership of Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix, Aimery III of Narbonne, and Bernard Délicieux, a Franciscan friar later prosecuted for his adherence to another heretical movement, that of the Spiritual Franciscans at the beginning of the 14th century. But by this time the Inquisition had grown very powerful. Consequently, many presumed to be Cathars were summoned to appear before it. Precise indications of this are found in the registers of the Inquisitors, Bernard of Caux, Jean de St Pierre, Geoffroy d'Ablis, and others. The parfaits it was said only rarely recanted, and hundreds were burnt. Repentant lay believers were punished, but their lives were spared as long as they did not relapse. Having recanted, they were obliged to sew yellow crosses onto their outdoor clothing and to live apart from other Catholics, at least for a while.\n\nAfter several decades of harassment and re-proselytising, and, perhaps even more important, the systematic destruction of their religious texts, the sect was exhausted and could find no more adepts. The leader of a Cathar revival in the Pyrenean foothills, Peire Autier was captured and executed in April 1310 in Toulouse. After 1330, the records of the Inquisition contain very few proceedings against Cathars. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, Guillaume Bélibaste, was executed in the autumn of 1321.\n\nFrom the mid-12th century onwards, Italian Catharism came under increasing pressure from the Pope and the Inquisition, \"spelling the beginning of the end\". Other movements, such as the Waldensians and the pantheistic Brethren of the Free Spirit, which suffered persecution in the same area, survived in remote areas and in small numbers into the 14th and 15th centuries. Some Waldensian ideas were absorbed into other proto-Protestant sects, such as the Hussites, Lollards, and the Moravian Church (Herrnhuters of Germany). Cathars were in no way Protestant, and very few if any Protestants consider them as their forerunners (as opposed to groups like Waldensians, Hussites, Lollards, and Arnoldists).\n\nAfter the suppression of Catharism, the descendants of Cathars were at times required to live outside towns and their defences. They thus retained a certain Cathar identity, despite having returned to the Catholic religion.\n\nAny use of the term \"Cathar\" to refer to people after the suppression of Catharism in the 14th century is a cultural or ancestral reference, and has no religious implication. Nevertheless, interest in the Cathars, their history, legacy and beliefs continues.\n\nThe term \"Pays Cathare\", French meaning \"Cathar Country\", is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. This area is centred around fortresses such as Montségur and Carcassonne; also the French département of the Aude uses the title \"Pays Cathare\" in tourist brochures. These areas have ruins from the wars against the Cathars which are still visible today.\n\nSome criticise the promotion of the identity of \"Pays Cathare\" as an exaggeration for tourist purposes. Many of the promoted Cathar castles were not built by Cathars but by local lords and later many of them were rebuilt and extended for strategic purposes. Good examples of these are the magnificent castles of Queribus and Peyrepertuse which are both perched on the side of precipitous drops on the last folds of the Corbieres mountains. They were for several hundred years frontier fortresses belonging to the French crown and most of what is still there dates from a post-Cathar era. Many consider the County of Foix to be the actual historical centre of Catharism.\n\nIn an effort to find the few remaining heretics in and around the village of Montaillou, Jacques Fournier, Bishop of Pamiers, future Pope Benedict XII, had those suspected of heresy interrogated in the presence of scribes who recorded their conversations. The late 13th- to early-14th-century document, discovered in the Vatican archives in the 1960s and edited by Jean Duvernoy, is the basis for Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's work \"Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error\".\n\nThe publication of the early scholarly book \"Crusade Against the Grail\" by the young German Otto Rahn in the 1930s rekindled interest in the connection between the Cathars and the Holy Grail, especially in Germany. Rahn was convinced that the 13th-century work \"Parzival\" by Wolfram von Eschenbach was a veiled account of the Cathars. The philosopher and Nazi government official Alfred Rosenberg speaks favourably of the Cathars in \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\".\n\nAcademic books in English first appeared at the beginning of the millennium: for example, Malcolm Lambert's \"The Cathars\" and Malcolm Barber's \"The Cathars\".\n\nStarting in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, historians like R. I. Moore have radically challenged the extent to which Catharism, as an institutionalized religion, actually existed. Building on the work of French historians such as Monique Zerner and Uwe Brunn, Moore's \"The War on Heresy\" argues that Catharism was \"contrived from the resources of [the] well-stocked imaginations\" of churchmen, \"with occasional reinforcement from miscellaneous and independent manifestations of local anticlericalism or apostolic enthusiasm\". In short, Moore claims that the men and women persecuted as Cathars were not the followers of a secret religion imported from the East, instead they were part of a broader spiritual revival taking place in the later twelfth and early thirteenth century. Moore's work is indicative of a larger historiographical trend towards examination of how heresy was constructed by the church.\n\nThe principal legacy of the Cathar movement is in the poems and songs of the Cathar troubadors, though this artistic legacy is only a smaller part of the wider Occitan linguistic and artistic heritage. Recent artistic projects concentrating on the Cathar element in Provençal and troubador art include commercial recording projects by Thomas Binkley, electric hurdy-gurdy artist Valentin Clastrier and his CD Heresie dedicated to the church at Cathars, La Nef, and Jordi Savall.\n\nThe Cathars have been depicted or re-interpreted in popular books, video games, and films such as \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\", \"The Bone Clocks\", the History Channel TV series \"Knightfall\", Damsels in Distress \"Labyrinth\", \"The Winter Ghosts\", \"The Apocalypse Fire\", \"\", Paulo Coelho's Brida, Bernard Cornwell's \"The Grail Quest\" series, Theodore Roszak's \"Flicker\", and Kathleen McGowan's \"The Magdaline Line\" trilogy.\n\nCatharism, along with other Christian movements including Fraticelli, Waldensianism, and Lollardy, is featured in the grand strategy game \"Crusader Kings II\", which is notable as being the only Catholic heresy in-game that allows female priests; it also grants the option of absolute cognatic succession laws (such as absolute primogeniture) and the appointment of female generals and councilors. This was added as part of the Conclave DLC.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48517137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48517137", "title": "Chinese funeral rituals", "text": "Chinese funeral rituals\n\nChinese funeral rituals comprise a set of traditions broadly associated with Chinese folk religion, with different rites depending on the age of the deceased, the cause of death, and the deceased's marital and social statuses. Different rituals are carried out in different parts of China, and many contemporary Chinese people carry out funerals according to various religious faiths such as Buddhism or Christianity. However, in general, the funeral ceremony itself is carried out over seven days, and mourners wear funerary dress according to their relationship to the deceased. Traditionally, white clothing is symbolic of the dead, while red is not usually worn, as it is traditionally the symbolic colour of happiness worn at Chinese weddings. The number three is significant, with many customary gestures being carried out three times.\n\nWhile traditionally inhumation was favoured, in the present day the dead are often cremated rather than buried, particularly in large cities in China. According to the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA), of the 9.77 million deaths in 2014, 4.46 million, or 45.6%, were cremated.\n\nThroughout history, Chinese people have carried out complex funeral rites, with tombs of early rulers rivalling Ancient Egyptian tombs in their funerary art and provision for the dead in the afterlife. The late 3rd century BCE Terracotta Army contains approximately 9,000 terracotta figures that were buried to protect Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China.\n\nTraditional burial customs show a strong belief in life after death and the need for ancestor veneration among the living; Confucian philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors as an act of filial piety (孝 \"xiào\"). These ideals still inform funeral rites for many Chinese people today.\n\nIt is customary for relatives to hold vigils over the dying, in order to accompany them till the very last moment before entering the afterlife. This process, called \"shou ling\" (守靈), is a way for loved ones to show filial piety and loyalty to the deceased. Family members thus take shifts to watch over a relative on their deathbed.\n\nIt is common to place a white banner over the door of the household to signify that a death has occurred. Families will usually gather to carry out funeral rituals, in order both to show respect for the dead and to strengthen the bonds of the kin group. Those with closer relationships to the dead (i.e. sons and daughters) wear white garments, while more distant relatives wear garments in different colours of white, black, blue and green. The colours red, yellow, and brown are traditionally not worn during the mourning period, which may last up to three years. Before a funeral, an obituary notice (訃聞) is commonly sent to relatives and friends announcing the date and time of the funeral procession. The date is usually selected as an auspicious one according to the Chinese fortune calendar (通勝 \"tong sheng\").\n\nThe deceased is dressed in clean funeral dress (小殮) in preparation for their departure from the world (人世 \"rén shì\") and journey into the afterlife (來世 \"lei shì\"). \"Dà liàn\" (大殮) is the ritual of transferring the body of deceased into the coffin (入木 \"rù mù\"), which will rest in the funeral hall decorated with four character idioms (成语 \"cheng yu\") prior to the burial or cremation. Before the funeral procession, the \"jiā jì\" (家祭) is held. According to the closeness and status of the family members, they will pay respects (奠) to the deceased.\n\nAccording to Chinese custom, an elder should never show respect to someone younger. So, if the deceased is a young bachelor, for example, his body cannot be brought home and must remain at the funeral parlor. His parents cannot offer prayers to their son either. Since he was unmarried, he did not have any children who could perform these same rites for him. (This is why the body cannot come into the family home.) If an infant or child dies, no funeral rites are performed either since respect cannot be shown to a younger person. The child is thus buried in silence.\n\nThe funeral procession (發引 \"fā yǐn\") is the process of bringing the hearse to the burial site or site of cremation. During the funeral, offerings of food items, incense, and joss paper are commonly presented. The offering of food and joss paper signifies the continuing interdependence between the deceased and their living descendants. Taoist or Buddhist prayers are sometimes carried out by monks, to help the deceased's soul to find peace and escape a fate of becoming a \"restless ghost\".\n\nEvery year at the Qing Ming Festival (清明節), people pay respect to their ancestors by visiting their graves and tidying up their tombstones. Later generations are invited to participate through this process of ancestor veneration (慎終追遠 \"shèn zhōng zhuī yuǎn\").\n\n"}

In Britain and countries whose Roman Catholic usage it directly influenced:\n\nIn Ireland, and in other countries whose Roman Catholic usage it influenced, all bishops, not archbishops alone, are titled \"the Most Reverend\" (\"Most Rev.\").\n\nClergy are often referred to with the title \"Doctor\" (\"Dr.\"), or have \"D.D. (Doctor of Divinity)\" placed after their name, where justified by their possession of such degree.\n\nSimilar to, and the source of, most of the U.S. English titles, with some variation:\n\nIn the predominantly Catholic Philippines, ecclesiastical address is adapted from American usage. The titles listed below are only used in the most formal occasions by media or official correspondences, save for the simpler forms of address. Post-nominals that indicate educational attainment or membership in a religious order are usually included.\n\n\nAlthough the styles and titles of Eastern Catholic clergy varies from language to language, in the Greek and Arabic-speaking world the following would be acceptable, but is by no means a full list of appropriate titles. It is notable that surnames are never used except in extra-ecclesial matters or to specify a particular person where many share one Christian name or ordination name. Where not noted, Western titles may be supposed. The following are common in Greek Melkite Catholic usage and in Greek Orthodox usage in the United States.\n\nBishop / Archbishop: In Arabic, a bishop is styled \"Sayedna,\" while in Syriac-tradition churches, he is styled \"Mar\". If an Eastern Catholic Archbishop or Patriarch is made a Cardinal by the Pope, he may be addressed as \"His Eminence\" or use the hybrid title \"His Beatitude and Eminence\". \n\nPriest: In Arabic, \"Abouna\", and in Greek \"Pappas\".\n\nDeacon: Identical to a priest in all ways except \"Father Deacon\" is also heard (\"Abouna Shammas\" or \"Pappas Diakonos\").\n\nSubdeacon: Reverend Subdeacon in written address, but the Christian name with or without \"Brother\" is usually used, except some traditions where \"Father Subdeacon\" is used. In Arabic, this is confused by the word \"Shammas\" being used for both the subdeaconate and the deaconate, the distinction being a \"Deacon of the Letter\" and a \"Deacon of the Gospel,\" respectively. Often a Deacon will be addressed as \"Father\" and the subdeacon as \"Brother\" to make the distinction clear.\n\nReader: Readers are addressed as \"Reader\" or \"Brother\" depending on the preference of the addresser.\n\nSeminarians: \"Brother\" or \"Brother Seminarian\" is the most common title; the appellation \"Father Seminarian\" or \"Father Student\" is not seen outside of rural Greek and Arabic-speaking laity.\n\nTonsured individuals of no title: Brother.\n\nUsage varies somewhat throughout the Eastern Orthodox Communion, and not every church uses every clerical rank. Surnames are typically not used for archpastors (rank of bishop or above) or monastics.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2905412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2905412", "title": "Ee ja nai ka", "text": "Ee ja nai ka\n\nIn West Japan, \"ee ja nai ka\" appeared at first in the form of dancing festivals, often related to public works, rain magic, or dances for the dead. When sacred amulets were said to have fallen from heaven, thanksgiving celebrations for these amulets were added that could last for several days and effectively took whole rural and urban communities away from everyday life. Gifts were exchanged, youth groups organized mass dancing including cross-dressing, wearing costumes, or not wearing clothes at all. To express their gratitude towards the gods or buddhas who had given them the amulets, many people went on pilgrimages to local or regional sanctuaries. The term \"ee ja nai ka\" was a refrain in popular songs performed during these activities and was therefore later chosen as their title. The phrase's meaning is both defiant and fatalistic, and it translates as \"Who cares?\", \"Why not?\", or \"What the hell?\", along the lines of \"Who cares if we take our clothes off?\", \"Who cares if we have sex?\".\n\nThe great diversity and rivalry of religious practice in premodern Japan helped shape the range of events. It has been suggested that religious activists, such as priests and itinerant preachers, played a major role in fabricating the \"amulet showers\", and some suspects were even caught in action by alert officers. Youth interested in celebrating parties, or in becoming spiritual leaders, were also suspected and in some cases convicted.\n\n\"Ee ja nai ka\" was not linked to any specific political platform, though it is often understood \"as a form of political protest when other ways [were] blocked\", in reaction to the crumbling Tokugawa shogunate. Disappointment regarding the lack of governing political leadership, disgust at Western and Christian foreigners, and other signs of social/political critique were frequently displayed. There is no evidence for any coordinated political setup or staging of \"ee ja nai ka\", although this was also rumoured.\n\nThe movement spread across Japan, eventually descending to mob violence before coming to an end. The end of \"ee ja nai ka\" was concurrent with the beginning of the Meiji Restoration and the Western-style modernization of Japan.\n\nIn 1981, Japanese director Shohei Imamura produced his film \"Eijanaika\", which gives a deliberately historically incorrect interpretation of the events but nevertheless catches the unstable and tense atmosphere of the age. Imamura had previously helped write the 1957 Yuzo Kawashima film on the period . This era was also depicted in the 1969 Kihachi Okamoto-directed Toshirō Mifune film . The \"ee ja nai ka\" activities, hitherto unknown as part of Japanese history during the Bakumatsu, have in recent years been included and alluded to in mainstream historical productions, such as the NHK Taiga dramas \"Ryōmaden\" and \"Yae no Sakura\".\n\n"}

After Ouspensky's death, his students published a book entitled \"The Fourth Way\" based on his lectures.\n\nAccording to this system, the three traditional schools, or ways, \"are permanent forms which have survived throughout history mostly unchanged, and are based on religion. Where schools of yogis, monks or fakirs exist, they are barely distinguishable from religious schools. The fourth way differs in that \"it is not a permanent way. It has no specific forms or institutions and comes and goes controlled by some particular laws of its own.\"\n\nThe Fourth Way addresses the question of humanity's place in the Universe and the possibilities of inner development. It emphasizes that people ordinarily live in a state referred to as a semi-hypnotic \"waking sleep,\" while higher levels of consciousness, virtue, unity of will are possible.\n\nThe Fourth Way teaches how to increase and focus attention and energy in various ways, and to minimize day-dreaming and absent-mindedness. This inner development in oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, whose aim is to transform man into \"what he ought to be.\"\n\nGurdjieff's followers believed he was a spiritual master, a human being who is fully awake or enlightened. He was also seen as an esotericist or occultist. He agreed that the teaching was esoteric but claimed that none of it was veiled in secrecy but that many people lack the interest or the capability to understand it. Gurdjieff said, \"The teaching whose theory is here being set out is completely self supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time.\"\n\nThe Fourth Way teaches that humans are born with a soul but that one's soul becomes encapsulated by personality leaving one not really conscious, even as they clearly \"believe\" they are. A person must free the soul by following a teaching which can lead to this aim or \"go nowhere\" upon death of his body. Should a person be able to receive the teaching and find a school, upon the death of the physical body they will \"go elsewhere.\" Humans are born \"asleep\", live in \"sleep\" and die in \"sleep\", only \"imagining\" that they are awake with few exceptions. The ordinary waking \"consciousness\" of human beings is not consciousness at all but merely a form of sleep.\"\n\nGurdjieff taught \"sacred dances\" or \"movements\", now known as Gurdjieff movements, which they performed together as a group. He left a body of music, inspired by that which he had heard in remote monasteries and other places, which was written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, Thomas de Hartmann.\n\nGurdjieff taught that traditional paths to spiritual enlightenment followed one of three ways:\n\n\n\n\nGurdjieff insisted that these paths - although they may intend to seek to produce a fully developed human being - tend to cultivate certain faculties at the expense of others. The goal of religion or spirituality was, in fact, to produce a well-balanced, responsive and sane human being capable of dealing with all eventualities that life may present. Gurdjieff therefore made it clear that it was necessary to cultivate a way that integrated and combined the traditional three ways.\n\nGurdjieff said that his Fourth Way was a quicker means than the first three ways because it simultaneously combined work on all three centers rather than focusing on one. It could be followed by ordinary people in everyday life, requiring no retirement into the desert. The Fourth Way does involve certain conditions imposed by a teacher, but blind acceptance of them is discouraged. Each student is advised to do only what they understand and to verify for themselves the teaching's ideas.\n\nOuspensky documented Gurdjieff as saying that \"two or three thousand years ago there were yet other ways which no longer exist and the ways then in existence were not so divided, they stood much closer to one another. The fourth way differs from the old and the new ways by the fact that it is never a permanent way. It has no definite forms and there are no institutions connected with it.\"\n\nOuspensky quotes Gurdjieff that there are fake schools and that \"It is impossible to recognize a wrong way without knowing the right way. This means that it is no use troubling oneself how to recognize a wrong way. One must think of how to find the right way.\"\n\nIn his works, Gurdjieff credits his teachings to a number of more or less mysterious sources:-\n\nAttempts to fill out his account have featured:\n\nThe Fourth Way focuses on \"conscious labor\" and \"intentional suffering.\"\n\nConscious Labor is an action where the person who is performing the act is present to what he is doing; not absentminded. At the same time he is striving to perform the act more efficiently.\n\nIntentional suffering is the act of struggling against automatism such as daydreaming, pleasure, food (eating for reasons other than real hunger), etc... In Gurdjieff's book \"Beelzebub's Tales\" he states that \"the greatest 'intentional suffering' can be obtained in our presences by compelling ourselves to endure the displeasing manifestations of others toward ourselves\"\n\nTo Gurdjieff these two were the basis of all evolution of man.\n\nSelf-Observation\n\nThis is to strive to observe in oneself behavior and habits usually only observed in others, and as dispassionately as one may observe them in others, to observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judging or analyzing what is observed.\n\nThe Need for Effort\n\nGurdjieff emphasized that awakening results from consistent, prolonged effort. Such efforts may be made as an act of will after one is already exhausted.\n\nThe Many 'I's\n\nThis indicates fragmentation of the psyche, the different feelings and thoughts of ‘I’ in a person: I think, I want, I know best, I prefer, I am happy, I am hungry, I am tired, etc. These have nothing in common with one another and are unaware of each other, arising and vanishing for short periods of time. Hence man usually has no unity in himself, wanting one thing now and another, perhaps contradictory, thing later.\n\nCenters\n\nGurdjieff classified plants as having one center, animals two and humans three. Centers refer to apparati within a being that dictate specific organic functions. There are three main centers in a man: intellectual, emotional and physical, and two higher centers: higher emotional and higher intellectual.\n\nBody, Essence and Personality\n\nGurdjieff divided people's being into \"Essence\" and \"Personality\".\n\n\nCosmic Laws\n\nGurdjieff focused on two main cosmic laws, the \"Law of Three\" and the \"Law of Seven\" .\n\n\nHow the \"Law of Seven\" and \"Law of Three\" function together is said to be illustrated on the Fourth Way Enneagram, a nine-pointed symbol which is the central glyph of Gurdjieff's system.\n\nIn his explanations Gurdjieff often used different symbols such as the Enneagram and the Ray of Creation. Gurdjieff said that \"the enneagram is a universal symbol. All knowledge can be included in the enneagram and with the help of the enneagram it can be interpreted ... A man may be quite alone in the desert and he can trace the enneagram in the sand and in it read the eternal laws of the universe. And every time he can learn something new, something he did not know before.\" The ray of creation is a diagram which represents the Earth's place in the Universe. The diagram has eight levels, each corresponding to Gurdjieff's laws of octaves.\n\nThrough the elaboration of the law of octaves and the meaning of the enneagram, Gurdjieff offered his students alternative means of conceptualizing the world and their place in it.\n\nTo provide conditions in which attention could be exercised more intensively, Gurdjieff also taught his pupils \"sacred dances\" or \"movements\" which they performed together as a group, and he left a body of music inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places, which was written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, Thomas de Hartmann.\n\nGurdjieff laid emphasis on the idea that the seeker must conduct his or her own search. The teacher cannot do the student's work for the student, but is more of a guide on the path to self-discovery. As a teacher, Gurdjieff specialized in creating conditions for students - conditions in which growth was possible, in which efficient progress could be made by the willing. To find oneself in a set of conditions that a gifted teacher has arranged has another benefit. As Gurdjieff put it, \"You must realize that each man has a definite repertoire of roles which he plays in ordinary circumstances ... but put him into even only slightly different circumstances and he is unable to find a suitable role and for a short time he becomes himself.\"\n\nHaving migrated for four years after escaping the Russian Revolution with dozens of followers and family members, Gurdjieff settled in France and established his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at the Château Le Prieuré at Fontainebleau-Avon in October 1922. The institute was an esoteric school based on Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teaching. After nearly dying in a car crash in 1924, he recovered and closed down the Institute. He began writing \"All and Everything\". From 1930, Gurdjieff made visits to North America where he resumed his teachings.\n\nOuspensky relates that in the early work with Gurdjieff in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Gurdjieff forbade students from writing down or publishing anything connected with Gurdjieff and his ideas. Gurdjieff said that students of his methods would find themselves unable to transmit correctly what was said in the groups. Later, Gurdjieff relaxed this rule, accepting students who subsequently published accounts of their experiences in the Gurdjieff work.\n\nAfter Gurdjieff's death in 1949 a variety of groups around the world have attempted to continue The Gurdjieff Work. The Gurdjieff Foundation, was established in 1953 in New York City by Jeanne de Salzmann in cooperation with other direct pupils. J. G. Bennett ran groups and also made contact with the Subud and Sufi schools to develop The Work in different directions. Maurice Nicoll, a Jungian psychologist, also ran his own groups based on Gurdjieff and Ouspensky's ideas.\nThe French institute was headed for many years by Madam de Salzmann - a direct pupil of Gurdjieff. Under her leadership, the Gurdjieff Societies of London and New York were founded and developed.\n\nThere is debate regarding the ability to use Gurdjieff's ideas through groups. Some critics believe that none of Gurdjieff's students were able to raise themselves to his level of understanding. Gurdjieff himself seemed to have formed this impression some ten years before his death, which led him to divert his efforts away from the Institute and into writing. Proponents of the continued viability of Gurdjieff's system, and its study through the use of groups, however, point to Gurdjieff's insistence on the training of initiates in interpreting and disseminating the ideas that he expressed cryptically in \"Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson\". This, combined with Gurdjieff's almost fanatical dedication to the completion of this text (\"Beelzebub's Tales\"), suggest that Gurdjieff himself intended his ideas to continue to be practiced and taught long after his death. Other proponents of continuing the Work are not concerned with external factors, but focus on the inner results achieved through a sincere practice of Gurdjieff's system.\n\n\"There are only special schools; there are no general schools. Every teacher, or guru, is a specialist in some one thing. One is an astronomer, another a sculptor, a third a musician. And all the pupils of each teacher must first of all study the subject in which he has specialized.\"\n\nIn contrast, some former Gurdjieffians joined other movements, and there are a number of offshoots, and syntheses incorporating elements of the Fourth Way, such as:\n\n\nThe Enneagram is often studied in contexts that do not include other elements of Fourth Way teaching.\n\n\n\n28.Tale of a Rascal sage book in Tamil by Anand Kumar \n"}

In Homeric Greek, \"hero\" (, ) refers to a man who fought (on either side) during the Trojan War. By the historical period, however, the word came to mean specifically a \"dead\" man, venerated and propitiated at his tomb or at a designated shrine, because his fame during life or his unusual manner of death gave him power to support and protect the living. A hero was more than human but less than a god, and various kinds of supernatural figures came to be assimilated to the class of heroes; the distinction between a hero and a god was less than certain, especially in the case of Heracles, the most prominent, but atypical hero.\n\nThe grand ruins and tumuli remaining from the Bronze Age gave the pre-literate Greeks of the 10th and 9th centuries BC a sense of a grand and vanished age; they reflected this in the oral epic tradition, which would crystallize in the \"Iliad\". Copious renewed offerings begin to be represented, after a hiatus, at sites like Lefkandi, even though the names of the grandly buried dead were hardly remembered. \"Stories began to be told to individuate the persons who were now believed to be buried in these old and imposing sites\", observes Robin Lane Fox.<ref>\n"}

Certain of Gurdjieff's followers claim that the Gurdjieff Movements can only be properly transmitted by those who themselves have been initiated in the direct line of Gurdjieff; otherwise, they say, it leads nowhere.\n\nThe movements are purportedly based upon traditional dances that Gurdjieff studied as he traveled throughout central Asia, India, Tibet, the Orient and Africa where he encountered various Indo-European and Sufi orders, Buddhist centers and other sources of traditional culture and learning. However, Gurdjieff insists that the main source as well as the unique symbol of the Enneagram was transmitted to him as an initiate in the Sarmoung Monastery. There were literally thousands of movements collected and taught by Gurdjieff throughout his teaching career. The music for the movements was written by Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann, as well as British composer Edouard Michael.\n\nA brief glimpse of the dances appears at the very end of the motion picture about Gurdjieff, \"Meetings with Remarkable Men\", produced and directed in 1978 by Peter Brook.\n\nAn example of Gurdjieff's later series of movements (The 39 series) are:\n\n"}

{"id": "167020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167020", "title": "Islamic art", "text": "Islamic art\n\nIslamic art encompasses the visual arts produced from the 7th century onward by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by or ruled by culturally Islamic populations. It is thus a very difficult art to define because it covers many lands and various peoples over some 1,400 years; it is not art specifically of a religion, or of a time, or of a place, or of a single medium like painting. The huge field of Islamic architecture is the subject of a separate article, leaving fields as varied as calligraphy, painting, glass, pottery, and textile arts such as carpets and embroidery.\n\nIslamic art is not at all restricted to religious art, but includes all the art of the rich and varied cultures of Islamic societies as well. It frequently includes secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians. Apart from the ever-present calligraphic inscriptions, specifically religious art is actually less prominent in Islamic art than in Western medieval art, with the exception of Islamic architecture where mosques and their complexes of surrounding buildings are the most common remains. Figurative painting may cover religious scenes, but normally in essentially secular contexts such as the walls of palaces or illuminated books of poetry. The calligraphy and decoration of manuscript Qur'ans is an important aspect, but other religious art such as glass mosque lamps and other mosque fittings such as tiles (e.g. Girih tiles), woodwork and carpets usually have the same style and motifs as contemporary secular art, although with religious inscriptions even more prominent.\n\n\"Islamic art developed from many sources: Roman, Early Christian art, and Byzantine styles were taken over in early Islamic art and architecture; the influence of the Sassanian art of pre-Islamic Persia was of paramount significance; Central Asian styles were brought in with various nomadic incursions; and Chinese influences had a formative effect on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles.\" Though the whole concept of \"Islamic art\" has been criticised by some modern art historians, calling it a \"figment of imagination\" or a \"mirage\",\nthe similarities between art produced at widely different times and places in the Islamic world, especially in the Islamic Golden Age, have been sufficient to keep the term in wide use by scholars.\n\nViews of Islamic Art are widely seen through Eurocentrism which coins the term orientalism. The East has dominant control over most interpretations while infiltrating in their prejudice perceptional views. It is also important to note the Western linear theory of evolution in cultures that suggests progress began in the East and later translated to the West. Along with this comes the Philosophy of “Universal History. This philosophy of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel says that Universal history goes from East to West. Europe is absolutely the end of universal history. Asia is the beginning.” This philosophy is taken into the interpretations of Islamic Art while misconstruing it with the ideology that Asia is extremely underdeveloped as if they were in an infantile state. On the other hand, Europe has surpassed all others as they are at the peak of cultural evolution and has claimed dominance over the “New World.” This results in the justification of Europe’s capitalist theories while condoning their aggression towards any non-European entity, especially Islam. With this information in mind, it is easy to see the stress that is placed on European influence of Islamic art and Architecture. This takes away the cultural value of the artistic intention of the culture on its architecture. It also further perpetuates an idea of Eurocentric superiority and distracts the focus from the individuality and aspects of the Islamic culture that are reflected in this architectural style.\n\nThere are repeating elements in Islamic art, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as the arabesque. The arabesque in Islamic art is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God. Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.\n\nTypically, though not entirely, Islamic art has focused on the depiction of patterns, whether purely geometric or floral, and Arabic calligraphy, rather than on figures, because it is feared by many Muslims that the depiction of the human form is idolatry and thereby a sin against God, forbidden in the Qur'an. Human portrayals can be found in all eras of Islamic art, above all in the more private form of miniatures, where their absence is rare. Human representation for the purpose of worship is considered idolatry and is duly forbidden in some interpretations of Islamic law, known as \"Sharia\" law. There are also many depictions of Muhammad, Islam's chief prophet, in historical Islamic art. Small decorative figures of animals and humans, especially if they are hunting the animals, are found on secular pieces in many media from many periods, but portraits were slow to develop.\n\nCalligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in Europe in the Middle Ages, religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of Chinese calligraphy of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the Great Mosque of Xi'an. Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic \"kufic\" and \"naskh\" scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of minbars, and metalwork. Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as \"quranic art\".\n\nEast Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \"epigraphic ware\", has been described as \"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\". Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in relief, or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings. Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production. The tughra or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones. Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.\n\nThe main languages, all using Arabic script, are Arabic, always used for Qur'anic verses, Persian in the Persianate world, especially for poetry, and Turkish, with Urdu appearing in later centuries. Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.\n\nAlthough there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the Persianate world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the miniature in illuminated manuscripts, or later as a single page for inclusion in a \"muraqqa\" or bound album of miniatures and calligraphy. The tradition of the Persian miniature has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the Ottoman miniature of Turkey and the Mughal miniature in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones. Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the Umayyad Desert Castles (c. 660-750), and during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749–1258).\n\nThe largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of Persian poetry such as the epic \"Shahnameh\", although the Mughals and Ottomans both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests. Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized. Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.\n\nChinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky. The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size. The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear. The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.\n\nNo Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the \"Oriental carpet\" (oriental rug). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a prayer rug, which would provide a clean place to pray). They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the Netherlands. Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments. In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.\nVery early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and oriental carpets in Renaissance painting from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately. The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way. Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.\n\nThere are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the Pitti Palace in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer. Production of this style of carpet began under the Mamluks but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt. The other sophisticated tradition was the Persian carpet which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the Ardabil Carpet and Coronation Carpet; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition. These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central \"gul\" motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders. The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today. The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre. Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.\n\nAs well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans. Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include coats of arms, enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the Papal Palace, Avignon, and the industry continued after the Reconquista. Armenian carpet-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought. The Berber carpets of North Africa have a distinct design tradition. Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs. As well as pile carpets, kelims and other types of flat-weave or embroidered textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls. Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.\n\nEarly Islamic columns followed the style seen in the classic period of the Mediterranean. Classic columns can be seen in earlier mosques such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and Córdoba. These columns can vary in form from being completely smooth, and having vertical or twisting fluting. In the 7th and 8th century, the Mosque of the Prophet Medina, was rebuilt using a style known as hypostyle. Hypostyle mosques usually entail multiple columns that support a smooth and even wall. In India, traditionally Indian stone columns of different shapes such a circles, squares and octagons, were incorporated into some mosques. Finally, engaged columns were introduced into decorate Islamic buildings.\n\nIslamic arches, similar to columns, followed a style similar to Roman architecture. Arches became quite prominent to Islamic architecture during the 8th-10th centuries. There are three distinct shapes of Islamic arches which include horseshoe, keel, and polylobuled. However, in India, islamic arches take shape after being pointed, lobed, or \n\nBalcony: a platform projecting from a wall, above ground level, enclosed by a railing or balustrade, supported on brackets or columns or cantilevered from a wall. Balconies are a common architectural feature of Islamic cultures due to their warmer climates. “Wooden balconies projecting at upper levels and constructed with latticed screens to ensure privacy but allow air circulation were a feature of Islamic domestic architecture in many countries, and specific types developed in particular areas over time, such as the wooden screen known as \"mashrabiya\" in Egypt and the \"shanashil\" in Iraq” Balconies became an architectural element of mosques, such as the royal boxes like the Turkish \"hünkâr mahfili\" “or that in the Bara Gunbad complex at Delhi (1494)”.\n\nIslamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in pottery and tiles for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures. Early pottery is often unglazed, but tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stonepaste ceramics, originating from 9th century Iraq. The first industrial complex for glass and pottery production was built in Raqqa, Syria, in the 8th century. Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550). Lusterwares with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.\n\nIslamic pottery was often influenced by Chinese ceramics, whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated. This was especially the case in the periods after the Mongol invasions and those of the Timurids. Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected. Until the Early Modern period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied. An example of this is the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Hispano-Moresque examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.\n\nThe Hispano-Moresque style emerged in Al-Andaluz or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: glazing with an opaque white tin-glaze, and painting in metallic lusters. Ottoman İznik pottery produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics. These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.\n\nThe medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in Persia and Egypt.\n\nThe earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem had interior walls decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine style, but without human figures. From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured tiling for interior and exterior walls and domes developed. Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns. Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme – a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.\n\nSome elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional relief, and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures. These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals. The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs. The geometric patterns, such as modern North African zellige work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as \"mosaic\", which is not strictly correct.\n\nThe Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) \"parchin kari\", a type of pietra dura decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases. This can be seen at the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and other imperial commissions. The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.\n\nFor most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in Eurasia, exported to both Europe and China. Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of Sassanian and Ancient Roman glass, and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in Egypt. For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties. From various documentary references glassmaking and glass trading seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.\n\nBetween the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by \"manipulating the surface\" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief. The very massive Hedwig glasses, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in Norman Sicily), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date. These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved rock crystal (clear quartz), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels, and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and hardstone carving were regarded as the same craft. From the 12th century the industry in Persia and Mesopotamia appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass. Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as Hebron glass in Palestine.\n\nLustre painting, by techniques similar to lustreware in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century. Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects. Gilded, painted and enamelled glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork. Some of the finest work was in mosque lamps donated by a ruler or wealthy man. As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it \"often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles\". Aleppo seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the Mongol invasion of 1260, and Timur appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to Samarkand. By about 1500 the Venetians were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.\n\nMedieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in enamel, some pieces entirely in precious metals. In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in brass, bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black niello. The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down. The abundant local sources of zinc compared to tin explains the rarity of bronze. Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.\n\nThe use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, as was the wearing of gold rings. One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.\n\nIslamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or aquamaniles, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine cloisonne techniques. The Pisa Griffin is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz. More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath), and ewers, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces. A typical 13th century ewer from Khorasan is decorated with foliage, animals and the Signs of the Zodiac in silver and copper, and carries a blessing. Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as astrolabes, as well as jewellery. Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.\n\nHigh levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including hardstone carvings and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone. Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters. Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and lacquer over paint.\n\nEgyptian carving of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the Cairo palace of the Fatimid Caliph was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries. From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels. Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.\n\nOlder wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes. An important exception are the complex muqarnas and mocárabe designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a stalactite-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the Alhambra in Granada, Spain are among the best known. Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with marquetry inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop. The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used. There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods. A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman Cappella Palatina in Palermo, which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art. Other famous wooden roofs are in the Alhambra in Granada.\n\nIvory carving centred on the Mediterranean, spreading from Egypt, where a thriving Coptic industry had been inherited; Persian ivory is rare. The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted. Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes. They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930–1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, Cordoba had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality. In the 12th and 13th century workshops in Norman Sicily produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution. Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture – most are now detached from their settings. Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.\n\nDespite Hadithic sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam. Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle. These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions. The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe reliquaries, where the relics were often wrapped in silk. European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of Toul in France was wrapped in a silk from the Bukhara area in modern Uzbekistan, probably when the body was reburied in 820. The Shroud of St Josse is a famous samite cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of camels and an inscription in Kufic script, from which the date appears to be before 961. Other silks were used for clothes, hangings, altarcloths, and church vestments, which have nearly all been lost, except for some vestments.\n\nOttoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal kaftans have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized \"tiger-stripes\" below three balls or circles. Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence. By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97 cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of Suleiman the Magnificent in his invasion of Persia in 1543–45, before being taken by a Polish general at the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic \"portraits\" of plants, as found in other media.\n\nThe development and refinement of Indonesian \"batik\" cloth was closely linked to Islam. The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged \"batik\" design to become more abstract and intricate. Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional \"batik\". However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the Garuda of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.\n\nAlthough its existence pre-dates Islam, \"batik\" reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as Mataram and Yogyakarta, whose sultans encouraged and patronised \"batik\" production. Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.\n\nThe period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day Syria. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or Sassanid and Byzantine art, and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial Muslim conquest. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the Louvre, whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.\n\nInfluences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. Bedouin tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories. For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.\n\nReligious and civic architecture were developed under the Umayyad dynasty (661–750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence (mosaic against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic frieze. The desert palaces in Jordan and Syria (for example, Mshatta, Qasr Amra, and Khirbat al-Mafjar) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.\n\nWork in ceramics was still somewhat primitive (unglazed) during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.\n\n'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.\n\nIn this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian late antiquity, which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the Great Mosque of Damascus are based on Byzantine models, but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated Qur'āns.\n\nThe Abbasid dynasty (750 AD – 1258) witnessed the movement of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad, and then from Baghdad to Samarra. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. Art historian Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an \"Islamic Rome\", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the \"navel of the world\", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.\n\nThe ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, Abbasid Samarra, which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of stucco reliefs, in which the prehistory of the arabesque can be traced. Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.\n\nSamarra witnessed the \"coming of age\" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted stucco allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of faience, and of metallic lusterware. Hadithic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic lusterware in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine Chinese porcelain led to the development of this technique.\nThough the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as \"tiraz\" produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the \"silk route\".\n\nCalligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated Qur'ans gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.\n\nBeginning in the 9th century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a Shi'a dynasty, that of the north African Fatimids, followed by the Umayyads in Spain, gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran.\n\nThe first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Spain (or al-Andalus) was that of the Spanish Umayyads. As their name indicates, they were descended from the great Umayyads of Syria. After their fall, the Spanish Umayyads were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the taifas (1031–91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the Almoravids and the Almohads, captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of Granada, ruled by the Nasirid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.\n\nAl-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of Averroes), the territory was an equally vital center for art.\n\nMany techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The pyxis of al-Mughira is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints’ reliquaries. From the periods of Maghrebi rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\nThe art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\nThe Fatimid dynasty, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171 introduced crafts and knowledge from politically troubled Baghdad to Cairo.\n\nBy the year 1070, the Seljuks emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at Manzikert. During the rule of Malik Shah the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the atabegs (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish crusaders. In 1171, Saladin seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory Ayyubid dynasty on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enameled glass became another important craft.\n\nIn 1250, the Mamluks seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was Baibars. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects (many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period), while patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enameled glass and metalwork, and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt. The \"Baptistère de Saint-Louis\" in the Louvre is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.\n\nIn Iran and the north of India, the Tahirids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as Nishapur and Ghazni, and the construction of the Great Mosque of Isfahan (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.\n\nThe Seljuqs, nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of \"Seljuq\" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from Damascus and Baghdad to Merv, Nishapur, Rayy, and Isfahan, all in Iran.\n\nPopular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth. Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece. For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques. Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals. Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated. In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous. It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.\n\nInnovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a silicon paste (\"fritware\"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals. Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen. These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.\n\nDuring the 13th century, the Mongols under the leadership of Genghis Khan swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the Yuan in China, the Ilkhanids in Iran and the Golden Horde in northern Iran and southern Russia.\n\nA rich civilization developed under these \"little khans\", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north-south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of \"iranisation\" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the \"Iranian plan\" mosques, was resumed. The art of the Persian book was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the \"Jami' al-tawarikh\" by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.\n\nThe early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the Hermitage.\n\nThe beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the Timurids, was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of Timur. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.\n\nThe Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the Byzantine Empire in the Battle of Manzikert (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.\n\nCaravanserais dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai inns improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.\n\nThe Turkmen were nomads who settled in the area of Lake Van. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the Blue Mosque in Tabriz, and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the Ottomans, who, after 1450, are referred to as the \"first Ottomans\". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the \"Milet\" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.\n\nIslamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century book frontispieces.\n\nEarlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic epigraphs, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature astrological, figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.\n\nHillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called \"Maqamat\", copied and illustrated by Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti were some of the earliest \"coffee table books\". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the Delhi Sultanate. Later other competing sultanates were founded in Bengal, Kashmir, Gujarat, Jaunpur, Malwa, and in the north Deccan (the Bahmanids). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with Hindu art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the Mughals, who progressively seized their territories.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after World War I. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably Iznik ware, important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling Ebru, Turkish carpets as well as tapestries and exceptional Ottoman miniatures and decorative Ottoman illumination.\n\nMasterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two \"books of festivals\" (Surname-I Hümayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan Murad III. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong Safavid influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.\n\nThe Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, \"Iznik red\", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models. From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of Rococo which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.\n\nThe Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the British Raj, who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later Sikh rulers as well. The Mughal miniature began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by Humayun when in exile in Safavid Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style. Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas. The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western graphical perspective, and a wider range of poses in the human figure. Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from. As the courts of local Nawabs developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional Indian painting developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.\n\nThe arts of jewelry and hardstone carving of gemstones, such as jasper, jade, adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler Abu'l Fazl, and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses’ heads is particularly impressive.\n\nThe Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced Damascus steel and refined the locally produced Wootz steel, the Mughals also introduced the \"bidri\" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like Ali Kashmiri and Muhammed Salih Thatawi created the seamless celestial globes.\n\nThe Iranian Safavids, a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia. Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in blue and white. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of Shah Abbas in Isfahan, which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as Ali Qapu), an immense bazaar, and a large imperial mosque.\n\nThe art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh, an immense copy of Ferdowsi’s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album (muraqqa). The albums were the creations of conoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of Reza Abbasi figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the grisaille techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.\n\nAfter the fall of the Safavids, the Qajars, a Turkmen tribe established from centuries on the banks of the Caspian Sea, assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.\n\nFrom the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court. From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. Many industries with very long histories, such as pottery in Iran, largely closed, while others, like metalwork in brass, became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.\n\nThe carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world. Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the zellige mosaic tiles of the Maghreb, have often survived better. Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as \"Islamic art\" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy. Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.\n\n\nBooks and journals\n\n\n"}

(Southern Song Dynasty), was a famous Chinese Buddhist monk, calligrapher, idealist philosopher, and is the founder of the Kenchō-ji sect, which is a branch of the Rinzai school. \n\nLanxi Daolong entered temple life at the age of thirteen. Due to the Mongol Conquest of the Song Dynasty in China in 1246, also driven by the new trend that Zen monks of the Southern Song Dynasty increasingly tended to voluntarily go to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, plus the influences of his teachers and friends, he sailed to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, and later moved to Kamakura, where he took charge of Kenchō-ji (建長寺). after having accepted the invitation of Hōjō Tokiyori (北条時頼) in 1253. \n\nLanxi Daolongs calligraphy was famous in Japan, especially \"Rule of Zen\" (法语规则). Daolong died in Kenchō-ji, and was given the Posthumous Name as Dajue Zen Master (大覚禅師, Daikaku Zenji in Japanese) by Emperor Go-Uda (後宇多天皇). Throughout his lifetime, he made great contributions to promote Sino-Japanese cultural interactions.\n\nLanxi Daolong was born in Lanxi, Fujiang, Sichuan Province (presently Mianyang, Sichuan Province) in 1213 (in the Jiading period of Southern Song Dynasty) and died in Japan on July 24, 1278 at 2pm. It is difficult to trace his parenthood and the living conditions of his childhood. We only know that the family name of Lanxi Daolong was Ran. According to \"Biographies of Monks\" (高僧传), Lanxi Daolong displayed purity, excellence and bravery. \n\nIn 1226, at the age of 13, he went to Daci Temple (), Chengdu, and he was tonsured to participate in various forms of Zen learning in 1227. Later, he went to Zhejiang Province to learn Zen from Wuzhun Shifan in Wanshou Temple (万寿寺), and finally became a disciple of Chijue Daochong, Beijian Jujian and so on. Daolong persevered in learning dhyana there. Before long he began to travel through Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, finally settling down in Yangshan (in Wuxi, Jiangsu) where he learned Zen from Renjue (formerly known as Wuming Huixing, 1160–1237) in Cuiwei Temple.\n\nIn the autumn of the 6th year of Chunhu (AD 1246), at the age of 33, Lanxi Daolong left for Japan with his disciples and two statues of the Buddha to preach Zen, boarding a Japanese merchant ship from Tiantong Temple in Ningbo, Zhejiang. First, he arrived in Daizaifu (太宰府) and wrote \"The rite of sitting in meditation\" (坐禅仪) to instruct his followers. In the second year, he arrived in Kyoto and lived in Sennyū-ji (泉涌寺), a Ritsu temple. After spending some years in Kyushu and Kyoto, Lanxi Daolong came to Kamakura. In 1248, he went to Kikokuzan Kongō Jufuku Zenji (亀谷山金剛寿福禅寺), a temple of the Kenchō-ji branch of the Rinzai sect, usually known as Jufuku-ji (寿福寺). \n\nIn 1249, Hōjō Tokiyori (北條時賴), the fifth shikken (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate, decided to build a Zen training monastery, and at that time, he has converted to Lanxi Daolong. Built according to the architecture style of the Chinese Song Dynasty, Kenchō-ji (建長寺), a Rinzai Zen temple, was constructed on the orders of Emperor Go-Fukakusa (後深草天皇) in Kamakura　and completed in 1253, fifth year of the Kenchō era, from which it takes its name, and Lanxi Daolong became its first abbot. Lanxi Daolong preached Zen in Kamakura for 13 years. Later Emperor Kameyama (亀山天皇) recalled Lanxi Daolong to Kyoto and appointed him the eleventh abbot of Kennin-ji (建仁寺). Lanxi Daolong made it a purely Zen institution, and three years later, he returned to Kamakura. There he was exiled twice to Kōshū (甲州). He built more than 20 temples during his exile in Kōshū, Shinshū (信州) and Ōshū (奥州). Hōjō Tokimune (北条時宗) remitted Lanxi Daolong and greeted him back to Kamakura. Lanxi Daolong selected a site for Engaku-ji (円覚寺), but in 1278, he died before the construction. After his nirvana, there are Buddha's relics. During his thirty-three-year stay in Japan, he built 49 temples and now these temples have become famous Buddhist architectures.\n\nIn calligraphy, Lanxi Daolong imitated Huang Tingjian, Zhang Jizhi and Chu Suiliang’s works of calligraphy, and he not only inherited the core of their works, but also developed it, and formed his own style. His calligraphy has an elegant pattern. The force of his writing was powerful and skillful. The whole style was simple and straight. \n\nIn the calligraphy circles of Japanese Buddhist temple, Lanxi Daolong was equal to Rong Xi. However, only a few works of his calligraphy are extant today. Two works of \"Rule of Zen\" (法语规则) and three works of \"The article of reading the variant Chinese characters\" (重文讽诵文) are now stored at Kenchō-ji (建長寺) and are national treasures of Japan. The work of \"Diamond Sutra\" (金刚经) preserved in the Da De temple of Kyoto is also an important work of his calligraphy.\n\nLiving in Japan for more than 30 years, Lanxi Daolong had great effects on Japanese culture. He was the first one to introduce the Pure Zen Buddhism of Song Dynasty into Japan. In addition, Lanxi Daolong also brought the Song Dynasty characterized culture into Japan, for instance, the Edo Neo-Confucianism and philosophy, the literature and art, the architectural aesthetics and the daily customs. By mixing them with Japanese culture, he accelerated the formation of Japanese Zen Buddhism. Moreover, Lanxi Daolong had strong supports from Japanese rulers, especially from the Kamakura Shogunate , which paved the road for the development of Zen Buddhism in Japan and helped it establish its leadership position in the various Japanese Buddhism sects. Furthermore, the Zen Buddhism had a great impact on the formation of the Bushidō and the national character of Japan.\n\nAs drinking tea was prevalent in Buddhist temple and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Sichuan where Lanxi Daolong used to live in were the main tea-producing areas, he was deeply influenced by the tea culture.We can find many words and phrases concerning \"drinking tea\" in Quotations from Lanxi Daolong.Therefore, Lanxi Daolong required his disciples to follow strictly the discipling of drinking tea, the way as many people in Southern Song Dynasty did. What Lanxi Daolong did made contributions to the formation and spread of Japanese tea ceremony.\n\nIt is still inconclusive about his influence on Japanese drama. But Lanxi Daolong had written a poem in Japan. In this poem, he expressed the insights of Zen Buddhism by recalling the scene that he was seeing the Zaju in Sichuan province. By confirmation, Some scholars think that it is the important clue approving that Japanese drama was influenced by Zaju of Song Dynasty. Thus, he was regarded as one of the important figures in the exchanges of Sino-Japanese drama culture.\n\nLanxi Daolong mainly used three forms to communicate Chinese literature with Japanese literature:\n\nFirst, Lanxi Daolong quoted a large number of references of the Tang poetry and Song poetry and literary allusions when he preached Zen, for example \"The cloud does at the end of the Castle Peak, but the pedestrian is outside the Castle Peak\" (白云尽处是青山, 行人更在青山外)., \"Disregard the changing circumstances\" (刻舟求剑) and \"Castles in the air\" (画饼充饥).\n\nSecond, Daolong often wrote poems about Zen and his feelings. These poems were full of grace and charm, and had a great influence on Literature of the Five Mountains ().Third, Quotations from Lanxi Daolong, which was edited by the disciples of Lanxi Daolong, has enriched and improved the literary genre of Japanese Zen Quotations with Rich content, complete form, and wide propagation. It was regarded as one of the signs of maturity of Japanese Zen Quotations.\n"}

N. Dhalla, was a Zoroastrian priest and religious scholar.\n\nDhalla is best known for his criticism of the orthodox factions within the Parsi community. In particular, he was stringently opposed to the excessive ritualization of religious practice, including that of the use of the Towers of Silence. In his autobiography, he was also critical of the orthodox refusal to accept converts, noting that \"the permanent blockade to an influx from outside, the abandoning of the fold by an increasing number of both men and women, and the ever-falling birth-rate of the community [...] it can be said that [the question of conversion] has become the thread on which hangs the very existence of this microscopic community.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Iranica\" entry for Dhalla – written by the son of a contemporary of Dhalla's with whom the Head Priest was at loggerheads for many years – summarizes Dhallas's position as \"embroiled in the problem of proselytizing [...] that plagued the community; even though he held liberal views in the matter, he always sided with the orthodox majority.\" Dhalla himself merely acknowledged that \"in replying to questions concerning ceremonies and conventions I do not give my personal opinion as a thinking individual or as a humble scholar or as a reformist, because I have no authority to do so. I am the Head Priest of a [community] that is 75% conservative and of a performing priest-class that is 99% orthodox. These gentlemen consider the later [traditional treatises] as authentic law-books on customs and conventions, hence my replies are perforce based mainly in conformity with their teachings.\"\n\nManeckji Dhalla was born on 22 September 1875 in Surat, India into a family of \"Godavara\" priests. At age 3, he was sent with his father Nusserwanji Dhalla to Karachi (then a city in the Sindh province of British India, and today lies in Pakistan), where his father had subsequently employed.\n\nIn 1890, at the age of 15, Dhalla began his training for the priesthood. Shortly thereafter he interrupted his studies in order to work and so augment the family's meagre income. In 1894, Dhalla became editor of a monthly magazine \"Goolshan-e-Danesh.\" Two years later, Dhalla acquired ownership of the magazine but was forced to shut it down when funds ran out a few months later. The debt incurred would remain with him for many years.\n\nDhalla completed his clerical training on 21 March 1895 at the age of 20 and his first lecture as a full-fledged priest was on \"atash\", fire. In the next three years, he published six booklets (in the Gujarati language) on various aspects of the Zoroastrian religion. On 21 September 1900, just shy of his 25th birthday, Dhalla delivered his first public lecture in Bombay (present day Mumbai), the first of what would become a lecture tour of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe lecture series made him famous among the Parsi community, and in August 1901 Dhalla was accepted at the postgraduate degree program in Avestan and Pahlavi studies at the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Madressa (today the J. J. Institute) in Bombay. He graduated in 1904, having completed the five-year course in just over three.\n\nIn May 1905 and with the financial support of Parsi community (in particular that of the Tata family), Dhalla continued his studies at Columbia University in New York City, where he studied under the personal tutelage of A. V. Williams Jackson, an authority on the Avestan language. Even with the preparatory assistance of Shapurji Saklatvala and Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, New York was initially quite a culture shock for Dhalla, who until his arrival in the United States had never even worn \"foreign attire.\" \"How and when to wear these [suits] was quite unknown to me.\"\n\nNonetheless, and with great pecuniary discipline, for the next three years Dhalla studied Iranian languages and Sanskrit as majors with minors in philology and philosophy. He received a Master's degree in 1906. Following the publication of his thesis on \"The Nyaishes or Zoroastrian Litanies\", Dhalla was awarded a Ph.D. in May 1908.\n\nThe experience at Columbia University gave Dhalla \"a new outlook on life\" and he began \"observing religious literature from a new angle.\" He \"renounced conventional religion\" and his \"fascination for ritualistic religion\" faded. He now \"considered ethics as the highest form of religion\" and \"embraced the path of devotion\" His \"antagonism for western culture turned to amity.\" Although it would be later said that his time at Columbia had made him \"felt attracted to mysticism,\" Dhalla unambiguously says the opposite in his own autobiography.\n\nOn 22 April 1914 Dhalla and his wife again sailed again for the United States, where Dhalla was to have his book \"Zoroastrian Theology\" published. While there, Dhalla delivered a series of lectures on 'The Culture of the East' under the chairmanship of Williams Jackson.\n\nIn September 1921 Dhalla, accompanied by his wife and son (Nariman, who would eventually also study at Columbia), again proceeded to New York, this time to have his book \"Zoroastrian Civilization\" published. On the way, the family also spent four months in Iran and Iraq, where Dhalla again gave a series of lectures. Although Dhalla was appalled at the living conditions (not just of Zoroastrians), he found that the still-medieval infrastructure afforded him with opportunities for closer contacts with the people that he would have had with more modern forms of transportation. In New York, Dhalla delivered lectures whenever the opportunity arose. Following the publication of his book, Dhalla and family returned to Karachi via London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Rome, and Naples, and felt the effects of the war that had ended only three years previously. Following a five-week layover in Bombay, they returned to Karachi in July 1922.\n\nIn 1929, Dhalla journeyed again to New York to attend Columbia University's 175th anniversary celebrations, and at which he received an honorary Doctor of Letters (Litt.D.). His book \"Our Perfecting World: Zarathushtra's Way of Life\" was subsequently published there and he again delivered lectures. On his return journey – this time eastwards – he was surprised to discover that he was known in Japan. It turned out that a newspaper article on him had recently been published. Dhalla was upgraded to a first class cabin for the onward journey to Karachi.\n\nIn June 1935, Dhalla was awarded the title of \"Shams-ul Ulema\" by the British colonial government. In January 1938, Dhalla again travelled to New York, where his magnum opus \"The History of Zoroastrianism\" was then published.\n\nOn 24 June 1942 his wife Cooverbai died of a stomach affliction. She was 65. Dhalla continued to write and give lectures until 1954. He died in 1956, aged 79. He was the only ordained Dastur or High Priest of Karachi.\n\nManeckji Nusserwanji Dhalla published some 30 works during his career. Most of these were in Gujarati and directly addressed to the Parsi community. Works that achieved greater circulation include:\n\n\"Atma Katha\", his autobiography (written in Gujarati) was published in Karachi in 1942. It was subsequently reissued in a revised and extended edition in 1946. Following Dhalla's death, the autobiography was translated into English and published as \"The Saga of a Soul\" in Karachi in 1975.\n\nDhalla is also the author of several articles in the \"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics\".\n\n"}

According to Theosophy, each root race has its own \"Manu\" which physically incarnates in an advanced body of an individual of the old root race and physically progenerates with a suitable female partner the first individuals of the new root race. The Theosophical concept of the Manu is derived from the concept in Hinduism that the Manu was the being who was the progenitor of the human race. \n\nWhen the \"Manu\" is spoken of in Theosophy, normally the \"being\" referred to, is the \"Vaivasvatu Manu.\"\n\nIn Theosophy, the \"Vaivasvatu Manu\" is regarded as the progenitor of the fifth root race, the Aryan root race. This progeneration is believed to have taken place 100,000 years ago in Atlantis. \n\nThe progenitor of the fourth root race, the Atlantean root race, is called the \"Chakshusha Manu\" and is in appearance an individual of the Mongolian race. \n\nAccording to C.W. Leadbeater, a colony will be established in Baja California by the Theosophical Society under the guidance of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in the 28th century for the intensive selective eugenic breeding of the sixth root race. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\"progenitor\") of this new root race.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy, it is taught that the Vaivasvatu Manu has a \"twin flame\", i.e., a \"divine complement\" or \"celestial wife\". However, her name has not yet been revealed.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the being C.W. Leadbeater called the \"Chakshusha Manu\" is referred to as \"Lord Himalaya\". According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, \"Lord Himalaya\" was the teacher of Maitreya when Maitreya incarnated in as one of the first individuals of the new Atlantean root race that was then being progenerated by the \"Lord Himalaya\" from the Lemurian root race—Maitreya served in the Garden of Eden, which was actually a mystery school of the Great White Brotherhood run by the \"Lord Himalaya\" that was located in what is now San Diego, California, which was then part of Lemuria.\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors. \nHowever, although she mentioned the \"Manu\" in The Secret Doctrine, she never claimed to have met him.\n\n\n\n"}

The derived verb \"midewi\", thus means \"be in/of \"mide\".\" The derived noun \"midewiwin\" then means \"state of being in \"midewi\".\" Often \"mide\" is translated into English as \"medicine\" (thus the term \"midewinini\" \"medicine-man\") though \"mide\" conveys the idea of a spiritual medicine, opposed to \"mashkiki\" that conveys the idea of a physical medicine. A practitioner of Midewiwin is called a \"midew\", which can also be rendered as \"mide'o\"... both forms of the word derived from the verb \"midewi\", or as a \"medewid\", a gerund form of \"midewi\". Specifically, a male practitioner is called a \"midewinini\" (\"\"midew\" man\") and a female practitioner a \"midewikwe\" (\"\"midew\" woman\").\n\nDue to the body-part medial \"de\"' meaning \"heart\" in the Anishinaabe language, \"Midewiwin\" is sometimes translated as \"The Way of the Heart.\" Blessing shares a definition he received from Thomas Shingobe, a \"Mida\" (a Midewiwin person) of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in 1969, who told him that \"the only thing that would be acceptable in any way as an interpretation of 'Mide' would be 'Spiritual Mystery'.\" However, fluent speakers of Anishinaabemowin often caution that there are many words and concepts that have no direct translation to English.\n\nAccording to historian Michael Angel, the Midewiwin is a \"flexible, tenacious tradition that provided an institutional setting for the teaching of the world view (religious beliefs) of the Ojibwa people\". Commonly among the Anishinaabeg, Midewiwin is ascribed to Wenaboozho (Onaniboozh) as its founder. However, among the Abenakis, Midewiwin is ascribed to Mateguas, who upon his death and needing to comfort his brother who is still alive, bestowed the Midewiwin to his grieving brother Gluskab. However, Hoffman records that according to the Mille Lacs Indians chief \"Bayezhig\" (\"Lone One\"), Midewiwin has its origin as:\n\nThis event is called \"Gwiiwizens wedizhichigewinid\"—Deeds of a Little-boy.\nTribal groups who have such societies include the Abenaki, Quiripi, Nipmuc, Wampanoag, Anishinaabe (Algonquin, Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi), Miami, Meskwaki, Sauk, Sioux and the Ho-Chunk. These indigenous peoples of Turtle Island pass along wiigwaasabak (birch bark scrolls), teachings, and have degrees of initiations and ceremonies. They are often associated with the Seven Fires Society, and other aboriginal groups or organizations. The Miigis shell, or cowry shell, is used in some ceremonies, along with bundles, sacred items, etc. There are many oral teachings, symbols, stories, history, and wisdom passed along and preserved from one generation to the next by these groups.\n\nWhiteshell Provincial Park (Manitoba) is named after the whiteshell (cowry) used in Midewiwin ceremonies. This park contains some petroforms that are over 1000 years old, or possibly older, and therefore may predate some aboriginal groups that came later to the area. The Midew society is commemorated in the name of the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie (Illinois).\n\nThe Mide practitioners are initiated and ranked by \"degrees.\" Much like the apprentice system or an academic degree program, a practitioner cannot advance to the next higher degree until completing the required tasks and gain the full knowledge of that degree's requirements. Only after successful completion may a candidate be considered for advancement into the next higher degree.\n\nThe accounts regarding the extended Fourth Degrees vary from region to region. All Midewiwin groups claim the extended Fourth Degrees are specialized forms of the Fourth Degree. Depending on the region, these extended Fourth Degree Midew can be called \"Fifth Degree\" up to \"Ninth Degree.\" In parallel, if the Fourth Degree Midew is to a doctorate degree, the Extended Fourth Degree Midew is to a post-doctorate degree. The Jiisakiwinini is widely referred to by Elders as the \"highest\" degree of all the medicine practitioners in the Mide, as it is Spiritual medicine as opposed to physical/plant based medicine.\n\nThe \"midewigaan\" (\"\"mide\" lodge\"), also known as \"mide-wiigiwaam\" (\"\"mide\" wigwam\") when small or \"midewigamig\" (\"\"mide\" structure\") when large, is known in English as the \"Grand Medicine Lodge\" and is usually built in an open grove or clearing. A \"midewigaan\" is a domed structure with the proportion of 1 unit in width by 4 units in length. Though Hoffman records these domed oval structures measuring about 20 feet in width by 80 feet in length, the structures are sized to accommodate the number of invited participants, thus many \"midewigaan\" for small \"mide\" communities in the early 21st century are as small as 6 feet in width and 24 feet in length and larger in those communities with more \"mide\" participants. The walls of the smaller \"mide-wiigiwaam\" consist of poles and saplings from 8 to 10 feet high, firmly planted in the ground, wattled with short branches and twigs with leaves. In communities with significantly large \"mide\" participants (usually of 100 people or more participants), the \"midewigamig\" becomes a formal and permanent ceremonial building that retains the dimensions of the smaller \"mide-wiigiwaam\"; a \"midewigamig\" might not necessarily be a domed structure, but typically may have vaulted ceilings.\n\nDesign of the \"jiisakiiwigaan\" (\"'juggler' lodge\" or \"Shaking Tent\" or traditionally \"shaking wigwam\") is similar in construction as that of the \"mide-wiigiwaam\". Unlike a \"mide-wiigiwaam\" that is an oval domed structure, the \"jiisakiiwigaan\" is a round high-domed structure of typically 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet in height, and large enough to hold two to four people.\n\n\n\n\nCalled \"wiigwaasabakoon\" in the Ojibwe language, birch bark scrolls were used to pass on knowledge between generations. When used specifically for Midewiwin ceremonial use, these \"wiigwaasabakoon\" used as teaching scrolls were called \"Mide-wiigwaas\" (\"Medicine birch [bark scroll]\"). Early accounts of the Mide from books written in the 1800s describe a group of elders that protected the birch bark scrolls in hidden locations. They recopied the scrolls if any were badly damaged, and they preserved them underground. These scrolls were described as very sacred and the interpretations of the scrolls were not easily given away. The historical areas of the Ojibwe were recorded, and stretched from the east coast all the way to the prairies by way of lake and river routes. Some of the first maps of rivers and lakes were made by the Ojibwe and written on birch bark.\n\n\"The Teachings of the Midewiwin were scratched on birch bark scrolls and were shown to the young men upon entrance into the society. Although these were crude pictographs representing the ceremonies, they show us that the Ojibwa were advanced in the development of picture 'writing.' Some of them were painted on bark. One large birch bark roll was 'known to have been used in the Midewiwin at Mille Lacs for five generations and perhaps many generations before', and two others, found in a seemingly deliberate hiding place in the Head-of-the-Lakes region of Ontario, were carbon-dated to about 1560 CE +/-70. The author of the original report on these hidden scrolls advised: \"Indians of this region occasionally deposited such artifacts in out-of-the-way places in the woods, either by burying them or by secreting them in caves. The period or periods at which this was done is far from clear. But in any event, archaeologists should be aware of the custom and not overlook the possibility of their discovery.\"\n\nTeaching stones known in Ojibwe as either \"Gikinoo'amaagewaabik\" or \"Gikinoo'amaage-asin\" can be either petroglyphs or petroform.\n\nThe seven fires prophecy was originally taught among the practitioners of \"Midewiwin\". Each fire represents a prophetical age, marking phases or epochs of Turtle Island. It represents key spiritual teachings for North America, and suggests that the different colors and traditions of humans can come together on a basis of respect. The Algonquins are the keepers of the seven fires prophecy \"wampum\".\n\n\n"}

Traditionally some plain garb recognisable as a religious habit has also been worn by those leading the religious eremitic and anchoritic life, although in their case without conformity to a particular uniform style.\n\nIn the typical Roman Catholic or Anglican orders, the habit consists of a tunic covered by a scapular and cowl, with a hood for monks or friars and a veil for nuns; in other orders it may be a distinctive form of cassock for men, or a distinctive habit and veil for women. Modern habits are sometimes eschewed in favor of a simple business suit. Catholic Canon Law requires only that it be in some way identifiable so that the person may serve as a witness of Gospel values. This requires flexibility and creativity. For instance in Turkey, a Franciscan might wear street clothes.\n\nIn many orders, the conclusion of postulancy and the beginning of the novitiate is marked by a ceremony, during which the new novice is accepted then clothed in the community's habit by the superior. In some cases the novice's habit will be somewhat different from the customary habit: for instance, in certain orders of women that use the veil, it is common for novices to wear a white veil while professed members wear black, or if the order generally wears white, the novice wears a grey veil. Among some Franciscan communities of men, novices wear a sort of overshirt over their tunic; Carthusian novices wear a black cloak over their white habit.\n\nIn some orders, different types or levels of profession are indicated by differences in habits.\n\nKāṣāya (Sanskrit: काषाय kāṣāya; Pali: kasāva; ), \"chougu\" (Tibetan) are the robes of Buddhist monks and nuns, named after a brown or saffron dye. In Sanskrit and Pali, these robes are also given the more general term \"cīvara\", which references the robes without regard to color.\n\nBuddhist kāṣāya are said to have originated in India as set of robes for the devotees of Gautama Buddha. A notable variant has a pattern reminiscent of an Asian rice field. Original kāṣāya were constructed of discarded fabric. These were stitched together to form three rectangular pieces of cloth, which were then fitted over the body in a specific manner. The three main pieces of cloth are the \"antarvāsa\", the \"uttarāsaṅga\", and the \"\". Together they form the \"triple robe,\" or \"tricīvara\". The tricīvara is described more fully in the Theravāda Vinaya (Vin 1:94 289).\n\nA robe covering the upper body. It is worn over the undergarment, or antarvāsa. In representations of the Buddha, the uttarāsaṅga rarely appears as the uppermost garment, since it is often covered by the outer robe, or saṃghāti.\n\nThe saṃghāti is an outer robe used for various occasions. It comes over the upper robe (\"\"), and the undergarment (\"antarvāsa\"). In representations of the Buddha, the saṃghāti is usually the most visible garment, with the undergarment or uttarāsaṅga protruding at the bottom. It is quite similar in shape to the Greek himation, and its shape and folds have been treated in Greek style in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra.\n\nOther items that may have been worn with the triple robe were:\n\nIn India, variations of the kāṣāya robe distinguished different types of monastics. These represented the different schools that they belonged to, and their robes ranged widely from red and ochre, to blue and black.\n\nBetween 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called \"Dà Bǐqiū Sānqiān Wēiyí\" (Ch. 大比丘三千威儀). Another text translated at a later date, the \"Śariputraparipṛcchā\", contains a very similar passage corroborating this information, but the colors for the Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka sects are reversed.\n\nIn traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, which follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, red robes are regarded as characteristic of the Mūlasarvāstivādins.\n\nAccording to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the robes of fully ordained Mahāsāṃghika monastics were to be sewn out of more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections. The symbols sewn on the robes were the endless knot (Skt. \"śrīvatsa\") and the conch shell (Skt. \"śaṅkha\"), two of the Eight Auspicious Signs in Buddhism.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the kāṣāya is called \"jiāshā\" (Ch. 袈裟). During the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the most common color was red. Later, the color of the robes came to serve as a way to distinguish monastics, just as they did in India. However, the colors of a Chinese Buddhist monastic's robes often corresponded to their geographical region rather than to any specific schools. By the maturation of Chinese Buddhism, only the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was still in use, and therefore the color of robes served no useful purpose as a designation for sects, the way that it had in India.\n\nIn Japanese Buddhism, the kāṣāya is called \"kesa\" (Jp. 袈裟). In Japan, during the Edo and Meiji periods, kesa were even sometimes pieced together from robes used in Noh theatre.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does not have distinct religious orders such as those in the Catholic Church. The habit (Greek: Σχήμα, \"Schēma\") is essentially the same throughout the world. The normal monastic color is black, symbolic of repentance and simplicity. The habits of monks and nuns are identical; additionally, nuns wear a scarf, called an apostolnik. The habit is bestowed in degrees, as the monk or nun advances in the spiritual life. There are three degrees: (1) the beginner, known as the Rassaphore (\"robe bearer\") (2) the intermediate, known as the Stavrophore (\"cross bearer\"), and (3) the Great Schema worn by Great Schema Monks or Nuns. Only the last, the Schemamonk or Schemanun, the monastic of the highest degree, wears the full habit.\n\nThe habit is formally bestowed upon monks and nuns at the ceremony known as the tonsure. The parts of the Eastern Orthodox habit are:\n\n\nThe portions of the habit worn by the various degrees of monastics is as follows:\nFemale ascetics and Svetambara male monks always wear un-stitched or minimally stitched white clothes. Digambara Jain monks do not wear clothes. A loin cloth which reaches up to the shins is called a Cholapattak. Another cloth to cover the upper part of the body is called Pangarani (Uttariya Vastra). A cloth that passes over the left shoulder and covers the body up to a little above the ankle is called a Kïmli. Kïmli is a woolen shawl. They also carry a woolen bed sheet and a woolen mat to sit on. Those who wear clothes have a muhapati, which is a square or rectangular piece of cloth of a prescribed measurement, either in their hand or tied on their face covering the mouth. Svetambara ascetics have an Ogho or Rajoharan (a broom of woolen threads) to clean insects around their sitting place or while they are walking. Digambara ascetics have a Morpichhi and a Kamandal in their hands. This practice may vary among different sects of Jains but essential principle remains the same to limit needs.\n\nPope John Paul II in his Post-Apostolic Exhortation \"Vita consecrata\" (1996) says concerning the religious habit of consecrated persons:\n§25 … The Church must always seek to make her presence visible in everyday life, especially in contemporary culture, which is often very secularized and yet sensitive to the language of signs. In this regard the Church has a right to expect a significant contribution from consecrated persons, called as they are in every situation to bear clear witness that they belong to Christ.<br>\nSince the habit is a sign of consecration, poverty and membership in a particular Religious family, I join the Fathers of the Synod in strongly recommending to men and women religious that they wear their proper habit, suitably adapted to the conditions of time and place.<br>\nWhere valid reasons of their apostolate call for it, Religious, in conformity with the norms of their Institute, may also dress in a simple and modest manner, with an appropriate symbol, in such a way that their consecration is recognizable.<br>\nInstitutes which from their origin or by provision of their Constitutions do not have a specific habit should ensure that the dress of their members corresponds in dignity and simplicity to the nature of their vocation.\n\nThe religious habit of Roman Catholic nuns typically consists of the following elements:\n\n\nOther accessories:\n\nDifferent orders adhered to different styles of dress; these styles have changed over time. In the 12th century the German abbess Hildegard von Bingen, for example, advocated a style for her nuns that included extravagant and lavish white silk habits worn with golden head pieces designed to present the nun to Christ in her most beautiful form.\n\nUsually, priests wear black or another dark color along with a white clerical collar. A cassock is worn in more formal situations, while a black shirt and slacks is worn when more mobility is needed. White may be worn in warmer climates. A priest is ceremonially given their habit, and it symbolizes that they are a part of the church.\n\nIn Japan, various types of very traditional dress are worn by Shinto priests, often dating to styles worn by nobles during the Nara period or Heian period.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Roozahang or Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya (Roozahang) appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of Indo-Iranian origin.\n\nIn a hymn of the Avesta (incorporated by Ferdowsi, with due acknowledgement, in the Shahnameh), Tishter or Roozahang is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon Apaosha. According to the myth, in the form of a pure white horse the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The yazata proceeded to call upon the Creator Ahura Mazda, who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition.\n\nIn Iranian mythology, especially in Persian mythology and in Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Persia, Sirius appears as \"Tishtrya\" or Tishter or Roozahang and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishter of New Persian poetry). Beside passages in the sacred texts of the Avesta, the Avestan language Roozahang followed by the version \"Tir\" in Middle and New Persian is also depicted in the Persian epic Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. Due to the concept of the yazatas, powers which are \"worthy of worship\", Tishtrya (Tishter ) is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of apaosha, the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya (Tishter ) is beautifully depicted as a white horse.\n\nThe other names of Roozahang is Tishtrya, Shabahang and Varahang.\nRoozahang is the God of Rainfall.

{"id": "23736108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23736108", "title": "Santería", "text": "Santería\n\nSantería, also known as Regla de Ocha, La Regla de Ifá, or Lucumí, is an Afro-American religion of Caribbean origin that developed in the Spanish Empire among West African descendants. \"Santería\" is a Spanish word that means the \"worship of saints\". Santería is influenced by and syncretized with Roman Catholicism. Its sacred language is the Lucumí language, a variety of Yoruba.\n\nSantería is a system of beliefs that merges aspects of Yoruba religion brought to the New World by enslaved Yoruba people along with Christianity and the religions of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Yoruba people carried with them various religious customs, including a trance and divination system for communicating with their ancestors and deities, animal sacrifice, and sacred drumming and dance. The need to preserve their traditions and belief systems in a hostile cultural environment prompted those enslaved in Cuba, starting from as early as 1515, to merge their customs with aspects of Roman Catholicism.\n\nThis religious tradition evolved into what is now recognized as Santería.\nIn order to preserve and shield (mask) their traditional beliefs, the Lucumí people syncretized their \"Orichás\" with Catholic saints. (As a consequence, the terms \"saint\" and \"orichá\" are commonly used interchangeably among practitioners.) Spanish colonial planters who saw the enslaved African people celebrating on saints' days did not know that they were actually performing rituals related to \"Orichás\", and assumed that they were showing more interest in Catholic saints than in the Christian God—hence the origin of the term Santería.\n\nThe historical veiling of the relationship between Catholic saints and Orichás is compounded by the fact that the vast majority of \"santeros\" in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, are also Roman Catholics, have been baptized, and often require initiates to be baptized in Roman Catholicism as well.\n\nThe spread of Santería beyond the Spanish-speaking parts of the Caribbean, including to the United States, was catalyzed by the Cuban Revolution of 1959. In 1974, the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye became the first Santería church in the United States to become officially incorporated.\n\nSantería does not use a central creed for its religious practices; though it is understood in terms of its rituals and ceremonies. These rituals and ceremonies take place in what is known as a house-temple or \"\" (house of saints), also known as an \"ilé\". Most \"ilés\" are in the homes of the initiated priests and priestesses. \"Ilé\" shrines are built, by the priests and priestess, to the different \"orichás\", which creates a space for worship, called an \"igbodu\" (altar). In an \"igbodu\" there is a display of three distinct thrones (draped with royal blue, white, and red satin) that represent the seats of the queens, kings, and the deified warriors.\n\nEach \"ilé\" is composed of those who occasionally seek guidance from the \"orishas\", as well as those who are in the process of becoming priests.\n\nThe many ' and ' that bridged the 19th and 20th centuries are fondly remembered by contemporary priests as the origins and strongholds of Cuban Lucumí culture and religion.\n\nTo become a \"Santero\" or \"Santera\" (Priest or Priestess of Santería), the initiator must go through an intensive week-long initiation process in which the teaching of the ritual skills and moral behavior occurs informally and nonverbally. To begin with, the initiator goes through what is called a cleansing ritual. The initiator's \"Padrino\" (godfather) cleanses the head with special herbs and water. The \"Padrino\" rubs the herbs and water in a specific pattern of movements into the scalp of the head. However, if a person is entering Santería for the need of healing, they will undergo the \"\" (blessing of the head), in which coconut water and cotton are applied on the head to feed it. Once cleansed, there are four major initiation rituals that the initiator will have to undergo: obtaining the \"elekes\" (beaded necklace), receiving \"Los Guerreros\" (the Warriors), making \"Ocha\" (Saint), and \"Asiento\" (ascending the throne).\n\nThe first ritual is known as the acquisition of the beaded necklaces (known as \"ilekes\"); according to De La Torre, \"the colors and patterns of the beads on the ilekes will be those of the orichá that serves as the iyawo's (bride) ruling head and guardian angel and so the first thing that must be done is to determine who the orichá is. The \"ilekes\" necklace is bathed in a mixture of herbs, sacrificial blood, and other potent substances and given to the initiated.\n\nThe initiate most often receives the necklace of the five most powerful and popular \"oricha\", as the multicolored beads of the \"ilekes\" are each patterned for the primary \"Orishás\" (Eleguá, Obatalá, Yemayá, Changó, and Ochún), and they serve as a sacred point of contact with these \"Orishás\". When the necklace is received, the initiated must bow over a bathtub and have his/her head washed by the \"olo orichá\". The \"elekes\" serves as the sacred banners for the \"Orishás\" and act as a sign of the \"<nowiki>Orichá'</nowiki>s\" presence and protection; however, it must never be worn during a woman's menstruation period, nor during sex, nor when bathing.\n\nThe second important ritual is known as \"\", the creation of an image of the orichá Eleguá. The individual will go through a consultation with a Santero, where all the recipients' life, past, present, and future, will be reviewed. During the consultation, the Santero determines which path of Eleguá the recipient will receive. Then, based on his findings, he chooses materials that will be used to construct the image of the Eleguá, a sculpture that is used to keep evil spirits away from the initiator's home. This ritual is only prepared by men as the orichás take some of the Santero's \"manly\" spirit in the process.\n\nThe third ritual, known as \"receiving the warriors\", is a ritual where the initiated receives objects from their padrino that represents the warriors; Iron tools to represent Ogún; an iron bow and arrow to represent Ochosi; and an iron or silver chalice surmounted by a rooster to represent Osún. This ritual begins a formal and lifelong relationship that the initiate will have with these Orichás, as the orichás devote their energies to protecting and providing for the initiate on their path.\n\nThe last ritual of the initiation process is known as \"Asiento\" (ascending the throne), and is the most important and the most secretive ritual in Santería, as it is the ceremony where the \"iyawo\" (bride of the oricha) becomes \"born again\" into the faith. This ritual is a culmination of the previous rituals, and cannot be made unless the others have been completed. Asiento is a process of purification and divination whereby the initiated becomes like a newborn baby and begins a new life of deeper growth within the faith.\n\nOnce the initiation is completed, depending on the individuals \"house\", there is a year-long waiting period, known as \"iyaboraje\", in which the newly appointed Priest and Priestess can not perform cleansings and other remedies. It is a time where the \"Iyawo\" or Bride of the \"Orichá\" must follow a strict regimen of wearing all white and must avoid physical contact with those who have not been initiated. Once the \"\" has been completed there will be an end of year ceremony, which will enable the Priest or Priestess to consult clients, perform cleansings, provide remedies and perform initiations. And according to Gonzalez: \"they are also regarded as royalty in the religion, as they are considered representatives of the \"Orichás\" and are vested with the power to work with the forces of those \"Orichás\" in full.\"\n\nWith Santería rituals there are musical ceremonies and prayers that are referred to as \"bembé\", \"\", or \"tambor\". It is a celebration dedicated to an \"Orichá\", where the \"batá\" drums (set of three drums known as the \"iya\" (the largest drum), \"itoltele\", and \"okonkolo\") are played in the \"<nowiki>Orichá'</nowiki>\"s honor. Through these sacred drums, messages of worshippers reach the \"orichás\" and the \"orichás\" respond to their devotees. These drums are used only by men and must always be treated with respect; for example, dancers must never turn their backs towards the drums while dancing, as it is considered disrespectful.\n\nPriests are commonly known as \"Santeros\" or \"Olorichas\". Once those priests have initiated other priests, they become known as \"babalorichás\", \"fathers of \"orichá\"\" (for men), and as \"iyalorichás\", \"mothers of \"orichá\"\" (for women). Priests can commonly be referred to as \"Santeros\" (male) and \"Santeras\" (female), and if they function as diviners (using cowrie-shell divination known as \"Dilogun\") of the \"Orichás\" they can be considered \"Italeros\", or if they go through training to become leaders of initiations, \"Obas\" or \"Oriates\".\n\nLucumí traditional healing practices are rooted in the spiritual influences of America, Cuba, and West Africa.\nHaving a strong spiritual component, these traditional healing practices also use the pathways of the herbalist, psychologist, ethicist, and that of a respected spiritual medium interceding between God and human beings. Du Toit refers to Cuban traditional healing practices as ethnomedicine, which taps on the biodynamic chemical properties of certain plants, from which some commercial drugs were derived, such as the cardiac medications, digitalis, quinine, and curare – chemicals causing neuromuscular paralysis. Du Toit categorizes Cuban ethnomedicine as having health specialists, which are ' (the herbalist), ' (the curer), ' (the religious healer), and ' (the botanist). Du Toit continues, \"Cuba is one of the regions in which a great deal of ethnographic and ethnobotanical research has been conducted.\"\n\nDu Toit cites the studies of Lydia Cabrera on the religious and healing role of indigenous medicinal plants, and Jose Gallo on the 900-page compilation of folk medicine, and also mentions that with the 31 herbs prescribed as bronchodilators, only \"Datura candida\" was effective, due to its contents of scopolamine and atropine in the leaves. Lemongrass or \"\" is used for low blood pressure and anti-inflammatory effects. Thyme tea and castor oil are used to speed the delivery of babies and the broomweed (\"Corchorus siliquosus\") induces the quick expulsion of the placenta. Herbs are also used to create a trance possession using the hallucinogenic properties of \"Datura metel\" and \"Datura stramonium\" (both have scopolamine and atropine, causing amnesia), the psychoactive ingredients from the cane toad (\"Bufo marinus\").\n\nAside from being herbalist, Santería traditional healing practice has a spiritual aspect. Santería has a holistic approach, acknowledging the connection with heart, mind, and body. In Santería, the world flows with the primal life energy called \"aché\" or growth, the force toward completeness and divinity. Aché is the current that Santería initiates channel so that it empowers them to fulfill their path in life, because aché is connected to all that has life or exhibits power; aché comprises blood, grace, and power. When a person is sick, the healer thinks, interprets and reacts, considering the illness not just a physical dysfunction but also an interface with suffering and bad luck in life, believed to be brought on by the activity of bad spirits.\n\nPrevalent in Caribbean cultures, \"\" is a part of the Latin American traditional healing practice. Du Tout reveals that Santería has a \"strong element of spiritism.\" McNeill also concurs that some \"Santeros\" have the power to communicate with spirits asking for guidance to improve the situation of a person consulting. However, in general, the \"Santeros\" of the \"Regla de Ocha\" primarily turn to religion as their practice to address personal challenges and identify means to improve a situation. Many people may go and see espirititas who don't see a \"Santero\". Also, espiritistas may work hand in hand with \"Santeros\".\n\nWhile psychotherapy tends to use mostly allopathic principles, spiritism uses homeopathic principles that aim to reduce the anxiety, or permit the patient to acknowledge pent-up emotions, unexpressed guilt, or repressed behavior through catharsis meant to release emotions the patient may not even be aware of. It is said that \"healing can occur when the spirit medium assists the sufferer to come into harmony with the spirit world so as to change his or her physical condition, emotions, way of life, or destiny.\"\n\nThe reputation of \"espiritistas\" was tinged with negativity, being accused of witchcraft because they deal with health through the unfamiliar paradigm of the spirit world, which was not understood by either the medical doctors or the Catholic priests. Consequently, \"espiritistas\" or traditional healers of Santería and other Latin American cultures working with healing through the spirit world are attacked as \"works of the devil\" from the pulpits of the Catholic Churches and labeled as \"quackery\" from the journals of the medical profession. This unique system of knowledge is appreciated as ethnopharmacology or ethnomedicine.\n\nAligning and harmonizing with the forces of nature, practitioners of the \"Regla de Ocha\" invoke on the guidance of \"Orichás\". There are three foremost \"orichás\" that are predominantly concerned with folk-healing, however, other \"orichás\" may be invoked to help a person with a specific problem. These main \"orichás\" are: Osaín, the orichá of the herbs; Babalú-Ayé, the orichá of contagious and epidemic diseases; and Inle, the patron of physicians. Osaín is the patron of \"curanderos\" or traditional herbal healers, also called \"Osainistas\". According to de la Torre, Osaín is believed to be embodied in the \"omiero\", which is a combination of \"blood from sacrifices offered during the ceremony and juices extracted from herbs that are sacred to the \"Orichás\" with water (from rain, rivers, or seas) honey, \"aguardiente\", powdered eggshell, \"corojo\", and cocoa butter.\" The forest has everything that would maintain a robust health and keep a person away from malevolence, thus, Santería practitioners would agree that no spell will be able to work without the sanction of Osaín, the master herbalist commanding the healing secrets of plant life. Osaín is syncretized with Saint Joseph, Saint Benito, or Saint Jerome. Babalú-Ayé is revered by its victims and survivors like smallpox, leprosy, and skin diseases. Babalú-Ayé has become the guardian of those with HIV/AIDS. He is syncretized with Saint Lazarus. Inle is the patron of physicians, known as a healer who favors scientific methods. Inle is ranked as one of the orichás that is approached for very specific health issues. Thus, Inle is also known as the protector of homosexuals and feminosexuals.\n\nPeople go to a \"consulta\" for many reasons, mainly for health-related issues. Divination is a means that traditional healers utilize to inquire further on the details of a problem. Divination may articulate the origin/cause of the problem; in addition, it may include prescriptions for solutions/suggestions to certain difficulties. Divination establishes an interpretative frame for the situation a person finds himself in. Hence, the \"Santeros\" offer cowrie-shell divination or other appropriate traditional practices. Rituals, or the reading of patakís may be done to clarify a problem, of which sometimes the person consulting may not even be aware. Passed orally from many generations, \"patakí\" are parables used by diviners to guide or give insights or moral lessons to a person who came for consultation. The \"patakí\" recited by the \"Santero\" corresponds to the number that the cowrie shell divination brings.\n\nAside from the use of herbs and divination, the Santería traditional healing is achieved through rituals that include animal sacrifice, offerings, altar building, music, dance, and possession trance. When the patient is a child, the \"Santero\" uses the curative system known as \"santiguo\", which means \"to heal by blessing\". Perceiving health problems, most \"Santeros\" recommend that the client seeks a medical doctor. Parallel to the medical treatment, the patient might be prescribed some herbal teas, cleansing baths, or a special diet from the traditional healing practice. Sometimes, a \"Santero\" might advise a client to receive \"omiero\", whose efficacy is widely disputed by many in the medical community. An \"omiero\" is claimed by believers to be a sacred mixture that is made for specific Santería ceremonies and to embody the \"orichá\" ruler of herbs, Osaín. Most clients who see \"Santeros\" would never be told to drink it.\n\nSantería traditional healing is just one of the many traditional healing practices used in Caribbean and Latin American cultures. Traditional healing practices are practiced side by side with mainstream medical practices through the Cuban healthcare system. Traditional healers recognize but do not compete with Western medicine.\n\nSantería is a religion found in Latin America. It is mainly practiced in but not limited to Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Panama, and Colombia. There is also a large population who practice it in the United States. \n\nIn 2001, there were an estimated 22,000 practitioners in the US alone, but the number may be higher as some practitioners may be reluctant to disclose their religion on a government census or to an academic researcher. Of those living in the United States, some are fully committed priests and priestesses, others are godchildren or members of a particular house-tradition, and many are non-committal clients seeking help with their everyday problems.\n\nA similar religion of Yoruba origin called Candomblé Queto is practiced in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. This is referred to as \"parallel religiosity\".\n\nIn 1993, the issue of animal sacrifice in Santería was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of \"Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah.\" The court ruled that animal cruelty laws targeted specifically at Santería were unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2009, legal and religious issues that related to animal sacrifice, animal rights, and freedom of religion were taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of \"Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless.\" The court ruled that the Merced case of the freedom of exercise of religion was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of Euless, Texas, from enforcing its ordinances restricting his religious practices relating to the use of animals, (see Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 110.005(a)(2)) without the court having to reach his claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the court case was settled, a news article was published in the Dallas Observer documenting the volume and brutality of the animal sacrifices.\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed as the Russian Bund was split at its conference in Gomel in April 1920. The Social Democratic Bund was formed out of the rightwing minority section of the erstwhile Russian Bund (the leftwing majority formed the Communist Bund). The party was led by Raphael Abramovitch.\n\nInside the party there were two ideological streams, a leftwing tendency led by Abramovitch and a rightwing tendency led by Mikhail Liber. In the summer of 1920 Abramovitch travelled to Western Europe together with a Menshevik delegation. He did not return to Russia afterwards. \n\nThe Social Democratic Bund lived a shadowy existence. At public workers meetings it would condemn the Yevsektsia, the Jewish Section of the Communist Party. In 1922, the Social Democratic Bund representation abroad took part in a protest against a trial of Socialist-Revolutionary leaders in Moscow. As late as February 1923 it published \"Biuleten tsentralnogo komiteta Bunda\" ('Bulletine of the Bund Central Committee') from Moscow. The February 1923 issue spoke of Bund sections active in Moscow and Vitebsk.\n\nAs of 1924, the foreign delegation of the Social Democratic Bund took part in the framing of the platform of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks) in Berlin, Germany.

{"id": "10432403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10432403", "title": "Tamagushi", "text": "Tamagushi\n\nThe Japanese word \"tamagushi\" is usually written with the \"kanji\" \"tama\" \"jade; gem; jewel; precious; ball; bead\" and \"kushi\" \"string together; skewer; spit; stick\", or sometimes written 玉ぐし with \"hiragana\" since the official Tōyō kanji do not include 串.\n\nThe earliest recorded transcription of \"tamagushi\" is 玉籤, using \"kuji\" \"bamboo slip; (divination) lot; written oracle; raffle; lottery\" instead of \"kushi\". The (ca. 720 CE) \"Nihon Shoki\" \"Chronicles of Japan\", which repeatedly mentions a 500-branched \"masakaki\" 真榊 \"true \"sakaki\"\" tree (tr. Aston 1896:43, 47, 121), is the \"locus classicus\" for \"tamagushi\" 玉籤. This mytho-history records a legend that when the sun-goddess Amaterasu got angry with her brother Susano'o and closed the door on the \"Rock-cave of Heaven\", the gods decorated a giant \"sakaki\" tree in order to lure the sun out of the darkness. \n\nThen all the Gods were grieved at this, and forthwith caused Ama no nuka-do no Kami, the ancestor of the Be [\"clan; guild\"] of mirror-makers, to make a mirror, Futo-dama, the ancestor of the Imibe [weavers' clan], to make offerings, and Toyo-tama, the ancestor of the Be of jewel-makers, to make jewels. They also caused Yama-Tuschi [Mountain-god] to procure eighty precious combs of the five-hundred-branched true sakaki tree, and Nu-dzuchi [Moor-god] to procure eighty precious combs of the five-hundred-branched Suzuki grass. (tr. Aston 1896:47)\n\nThis \"precious combs\" translation derives from \"tama\" 玉 (tr. \"Toyo-tama\" and \"jewels\") and \"kushi\" \"comb\", which is a \"Nihon Shoki\" graphic variant of \"kuji\" 籤 in the goddess named Tamakushi Hime 玉櫛姫 (tr. \"jewel-comb\" Aston 1896:62).\n\nThe (ca. 645-760 CE) \"Man'yōshū\" \"Myriad Leaves Collection\" does not use the word \"tamagushi\" but one poem (tr. Pierson 1929-1938:199) describes making it with paper mulberry: \"I tie pure white strands of mulberry to the branches of the sacred tree\".\n\nSome common \"tamagushi\" collocations include:\n\"Tamagushi\" has an uncommon secondary meaning of \"name for the \"sakaki\" tree\". The (ca. 1439 CE) Shin Kokin Wakashū \"New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems\" (tr. Carr 1995:8) contains the first occurrence, \"Holding the ornamented \"tamagushi\" leaves\".\n\nThe \"sakaki\" (\"Cleyera japonica\") is a flowering evergreen tree, which is considered sacred in Japanese mythology. In the present day, Shinto shrines often plant it as a \"sakaiki\" (境木 \"boundary tree\") to demarcate sanctified space. \"Sakaki\" is written with the \"kanji\" , which graphically combines \"boku\" or \"ki\" \"tree; wood\" and \"shin\" or \"kami\" \"spirit; god\", compare \"Shinboku\" (神木 \"sacred tree\"). Carr (1995:11) characterizes 榊 as \"a doubly exceptional logograph\"; it is an ideograph \"character representing an idea\" (which is an infrequent type of logograph \"character representing a word\", see Chinese character classification), and it is a \"kokuji\" 国字 \"national character; Japanese-made character\" (rather than a typical \"kanji\" 漢字 \"Chinese character\" loanword).\n\nThe etymology of \"tamagushi\", like many Japanese words, is uncertain. Despite consensus that \"-gushi\" 串 means \"skewer; stick\" (of \"sakaki\"), the original signification of \"tama-\" 玉 \"jade; jewel; ball\" remain obscure. The Kokugaku scholar Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801) suggested an etymon of \"tamukegushi\" 手向け串 \"hand-offered stick/skewer\". The Shinto theologian Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843) proposed \"bejeweled stick/skewer\", with \"tama\" 玉 referring to decorative \"jewels\" (cf. \"tama\" \"jewel; pearl; bead\"). The famous ethnologist Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962) hypothesized \"spiritual stick/skewer\", with \"tama\" 玉 meaning \"tama\" \"spirit; soul\" (believed to be shaped like a \"tama\" \"ball; sphere; globe\").\n\n\"Tamagushi\" was central to the \"Ehime-ken Yasukuni jinjā tamagushi soshō\" 愛媛県靖国神社玉串訴訟 \"Ehime Prefecture's Yasukuni Shrine \"tamagushi\" lawsuit\" over the constitutional separation of state and religion (see Nelson 1999 or Morimura 2003 for details). \n\nAlthough Article 20 of the Constitution of Japan prohibits the state establishment of religion and Article 89 forbids expenditure of public money \"for the use, benefit, or maintenance of any religious institution\", the Ehime Governor officially paid for \"tamagushi-ryō\" 玉串料 \"\"tamagushi\" offerings\" presented at several Shinto shrines. In 1982, a group of prefectural residents sued his office for having misappropriated ¥ 166,000 (approximately US $1900) in public funds. On March 17, 1989, the Matsuyama District Court ruled the \"tamagushi\" offerings were unconstitutional and ordered the defendants to repay the prefecture. On May 12, 1992, the Takamatsu High Court overturned the Matsuyama decision, reasoning that the Shinto offerings were constitutionally allowed within the realm of \"social protocol\". On April 2, 1997, the Supreme Court of Japan overturned that decision and made a landmark ruling that \"tamagushi\" offerings were unconstitutional.\n\nThe question of what constitutes support of State Shinto remains controversial. For instance, the reformist politician Ichirō Ozawa disagrees with the court ruling. \nThere are some instances where the values specified in the constitution are not in accord with the Japanese traditional culture. The Shinto rite of worshipping one's ancestors is very different from the idea of religion in the West. The 'Tamagushirō Decision' of the Supreme Court against Ehime Prefecture, which declared that making donations to purchase \"tamagushi\" was against the Constitution based on the religious freedom of Article 20, would not strike the Japanese (who believe in many gods) as anti-constitutional. Perhaps it would be better to impose restrictions on religious freedom only in order to suppress the development of state-sponsored religious fascism. (2001:169) \n\n\n"}

It is the basis for the similar Japanese tale \"The Dream of Akinosuke\".\n\nChunyu Fen (淳于棼) is a previously successful and rich officer in the Huainan army who has offended his general and been dismissed. Disgruntled, he drank himself to sleep under a huge ash tree and was carried back to his house by two friends. While he is resting in a half-asleep state, a pair of messengers enter with an invitation from the king of \"Ashendon\".\n\nChunyu goes with the messengers in their carriage, which heads towards the ash tree and into the hollow under it. The scenery in the hollow, while consisting of mountains and rivers, looks different from the world above. After about ten miles, they enter a large city though a grand gate over which is written \"The Great Kingdom of Ashendon\". Chunyu sees an old drinking friend of his at the side of the road, amongst other officers.\n\nChunyu is informed by the prime minister that the king has invited him here with the hope of him marrying one of his daughters, creating an alliance. When brought before the king, he is told that this is at his father's wish. Chunyu is bemused by this, but since his father was a missing frontier general, it is possible. At a feast that evening, Chunyu is entertained by nymphs and fairies, and meets his groomsmen and Tian Zihua, another old friend who tells him yet another friend, Zhou, is also in the city. Forthwith, he is married to the king's second daughter, a girl of about fifteen.\n\nChunyu and his wife come to love each other greatly, and his power grows. One day, Chunyu asks the king how his father could have made the request to the king for him to be married, as Chunyu's father has been missing for nearly twenty years. The king replies that he is in frequent contact with Chunyu's father who is still alive, and serving at the northern frontier. The king instructs Chunyu to write to his father, but not to go to see him. A reply is soon received, telling Chunyu of his father's regret that they can't meet then, but that they will meet in three years' time.\n\nAt his wife's request, Chunyu takes an official post at Nanke (a prosperous and fertile southern tributary state) where he serves as governor, with Tian Zihua as finance minister and Zhou as chief councillor. After a farewell feast and a several-day-long journey, they arrive at Nanke. Chunyu is a wise governor and the state flourishes. He has five sons, who all take official posts, and two daughters who are married into the royal family.\n\nOne day, the neighboring kingdom of \"Sandalvine\" invades, and Chunyu is commanded to raise an army and fight them, which he does, putting Zhou in charge of 30,000 men. However, Zhou proves a poor commander, and the battle is a rout. Zhou flees back to Nanke under cover of darkness, where Chunyu arrests him, but the king pardons both men for the defeat. The next month Zhou dies from a boil on his neck and Chunyu's wife dies shortly after that. Chunyu's request to travel back to the capital with the hearse is granted, and he is greeted there by the mourning king and queen. After his return Chunyu behaves oddly and gathers so many followers that the king begins to suspect him. Meanwhile, the king is informed of a mysterious portent that the kingdom will be destroyed by an event caused by a foreigner close to the royal family. Accordingly, the king forces Chunyu to retire.\n\nSensing Chunyu's feelings of despondence, the king informs him that is regretful that his wife has died so young, but now Chunyu must return home. Chunyu argues, saying that this \"is\" his home, but the king disagrees, saying that Chunyu came from the world of men. So, Chunyu returns the way he came, but this time in an old and shabby carriage. Entering his home again, he is gripped by sadness, and then is shocked to see himself lying in his bed. Suddenly he awakens, and finds that the day he fell asleep has not yet ended, despite having lived a generation in Ashendon.\n\nHe goes out with his friends and uncovers a great ants' nest under the ash tree, with two huge ants attended to by the others, with another nest nearby for Nanke, and a burial mound for his wife. A connected nest is found under a sandalwood tree overgrown with vines, showing where the invaders had come from. Chunyu forbids his friends to damage the nests and covers them again with the vines, but that night a severe storm destroys Ashendon, fulfilling the prophecy of destruction. Chunyu then remembers his friends Zhou and Tian Zihua, and sends a servant for news, to find that they are both recently dead. Realising the emptiness of the material world, Chunyu becomes a Taoist, eschews money and women, and dies three years later.\n\nLuo notes that the story fits other tales' pattern of building up to a final \"factuality\", or justification for the story, in the finding of the ant nests. Yu says that this story is similar to others such as \"The World inside a Pillow\" (\"Zhenzhongji\") and \"Cherry and the Blue Robe Maiden\" (\"Yingtao qingyi\") in that it uses the concept of a dream as a cautionary device. Indeed, this story has led to the Chinese idiom \"Nankeyimeng\" (南柯一梦) to describe such an illusory dream or fantasy of grandeur, despite the emptiness of materialistic life.\n\nAs well as the similar Japanese story \"The Dream of Akinosuke\", the concept of a lifetime being lived in the space of a single dream was explored in the \"\" episode \"The Inner Light\", where Picard wakes up on an alien planet and lives a long life before waking up after only a few minutes back in the real world.\n"}

He is a well-known kabbalist and a rosh yeshiva of both the main Breslov Yeshiva in Meah Shearim, Jerusalem, and the Non-Breslov Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva in Mekor Baruch. His lectures, both in oral and written form, emphasize the application of Breslov and other related Chassidic and non-Chassidic teachings to the challenges of life and the pursuit of spiritual growth.\n\nYaakov Meir Shechter was born in the Old City of Jerusalem to a prominent Breslover family headed by his father, Rabbi Dovid Shechter. During his youth in the Old City, Shechter learned from Breslov elders of the previous generation — especially Rabbi Abraham Sternhartz, who had immigrated to Israel from Uman, Ukraine in 1936.\n\nThe Shechter family was expelled from the Old City together with the rest of the Jewish population by the Jordanian army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Later, the family moved again to the Meah Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem near the main Breslov yeshiva, which was founded in 1953.\n\nShechter is widely regarded as the leading figure of the faction of Breslov which is connected to the larger Ashkenazi Hasidic community, centered in Meah Shearim.\n\nThousands of people from all over the world and from all backgrounds flock to him for guidance on all matters, and for his blessings.\n\nA selection of Shechter's talks from \"Leket Amarim\" (A Collection of Talks) was translated into English as \"In All Your Ways: A Guide to Avodas Hashem\" (Moznaim Publishers). This work incorporates Shechter's broad knowledge of Talmud, Midrash, Mussar, Breslov Hasidut, and Kabbalah into an inspirational guide for the spiritual seeker.\n\n"}

Yam is a deity of the sea and his palace is in the abyss associated with the depths, or Biblical tehom, of the oceans. \nYam is the deity of the primordial chaos and represents the power of the sea, untamed and raging; he is seen as ruling storms and the disasters they wreak, and was an important divinity to the maritime Phoenicians. The gods cast out Yam from the heavenly mountain Sappan (modern Jebel Aqra; \"Sappan\" is cognate to \"Tsephon\"). \n\nThe fight of Baal-Hadad with Yam has long been equated with the \"Chaoskampf\" mytheme in Mesopotamian mythology in which a god fights and destroys a \"dragon\" or sea monster; the seven-headed dragon Lotan is associated closely with him and Yam is often described as \"the serpent\". Both Mesopotamian Tiamat and Biblical Leviathan are adduced as reflexes of this narrative, as is the fight of Zeus with Typhon in Greek mythology.\n\nIn the Ugaritic \"Baal Cycle\", El, chief of the Gods and father to the second-tier divinities, appoints Yam to fight Hadad-Baal.\nIn the \"interpretatio graeca\" of Philo of Byblos, El corresponds to Cronus, Hadad-Baal to Zeus, Yam to Poseidon and Mot to Hades.\n\nKTU 1.2 iii:\n\nAfter a great war in heaven involving many of the gods, Yam is soundly defeated:\n\nHadad holds a great feast, but not long afterwards he battles Mot (death) and through his mouth he descends to the netherworld. Yet like Yam, Death too is defeated and in h. I AB iii the Lord arises from the dead:\n\nThe narrative of the conflict of Yam with Baal-Hadad has long been compared to parallels in Mesopotamian mythology, the battle between Tiamat and Enlil and Babylonian Marduk and, more generically, the \"Chaoskampf\" motif in comparative mythology.\n\n\n\n"}

Avraham was a lawyer and Esther was involved in community service: Raising funds for the Yeshiva, feeding the poor and so forth.\n\nAfter his bar mitzva, he was enrolled in the yeshiva of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. He was considered a very promising student and was assigned Wasserman's son, Naftali, as a study partner. He later studied in the Mir yeshiva as well.\n\nWhile studying in Mir, he married Sarah Baila Gutman (b. Navahrudak, 1910 – d. New York City, March 12, 2008 ), the daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Gutman, the administrator of the yeshiva in Baranowicze. When Rabbi Gutman was looking for a match, he asked Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman about a number of prospects. Rabbi Wasserman recommended Kaplan. When Rabbi Gutman pressed him \"Isn't your own son, Naftoli, a little better?\" Rabbi Wasserman answered \"My Naftoli is a good boy, but he doesn't measure up to Mendel.\" (Greenwald 1995:31)\n\nThey had six children:\n\n\nIn late 1939, the German's Invasion of Poland overtook Poland and the Jews of Baranovich fled for their lives. Wasserman advised his yeshiva students to regroup in then-independent Vilna, Lithuania. Kaplan and his family moved there and Kaplan studied there under Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. In June 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied Vilna, Jewish life became unbearable. Like the members of the Mir yeshiva and other refugees there, Kaplan sought visas to allow him to escape Nazi and Soviet rule. He obtained a \"de facto\" destination visa from the Dutch consul but was unable to obtain the necessary transit visa from Japanese Vice-consul, Chiune Sugihara that would allow his family to detour through Japan while awaiting some final, true destination. (Greenwald 1995:38)\n\nThe family nevertheless boarded the trains to the Russian port city of Vladivostok. His son, Chaim Ozer, was born on the train ride. After entering Japanese territory by boat, Kaplan expected deportation back to Russia and eventually Siberia. Japanese officials goaded him to produce any kind of visa and he reluctantly showed them an obviously tampered Japanese transit visa. Inexplicably, it was stamped and accepted and the family continued on to Kobe and then later to Shanghai. (Greenwald 1995:39–40)\n\nHis son Shimon was born in Shanghai, while his middle son, Chaim Ozer grew sick and died there.\n\nKaplan arrived in America after the war and moved to Chicago, where his brother, Rabbi Hertzl Kaplan was teaching at the Chicago yeshiva that was to become the Hebrew Theological College. Reb Mendel accepted a teaching position there, though his students were English-speaking and his English was not yet mastered. He won the students over by offering to \"teach them to read the \"Chicago Tribune\" if they taught him to read English.\" His insights into world affairs and reading between the lines of the daily paper (even while needing help with the language) earned him his student's respect. (Greenwald 1995:44)\n\nWhen his girls were old enough for high school, his wife moved with them to Brooklyn New York, so they could attend a Jewish girls high school in Williamsburg. Kaplan started Kaplan's Winery Corporation, producing traditional Kosher Concord wine, in an effort to supplement his income to cover his daughter's tuition costs. (Greenwald 1995:47)\n\nBy 1965, Kaplan had joined his family in New York and was invited to start teaching the first-level post-high school class in the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia. He accepted the position, lived in the dormitory and commuted each weekend to his wife and family in Brooklyn. He stayed at the school and taught the same level until his death on April 4, 1985. Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky commented \"\"Ahzah Kuntz\", (What a feat!) He is greater than famous Roshei Yeshiva, and he can still work quietly under younger men.\" (Greenwald 1995:48–49) However, Reb Mendel had strong disagreements with the Roshei Yeshiva in Philadelphia regarding involving the students in secular studies.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18302693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18302693", "title": "Zend", "text": "Zend\n\nZend or Zand (Middle Persian :𐭦𐭭𐭣) is a Zoroastrian technical term for exegetical glosses, paraphrases, commentaries and translations of the Avesta's texts. The term \"zand\" is a contraction of the Avestan language word \"\" \"𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬙𐬌\" , meaning \"interpretation\", or \"as understood\".\n\n\"Zand\" glosses and commentaries exist in several languages, including in the Avestan language itself. These Avestan language exegeses sometimes accompany the original text being commented upon, but are more often elsewhere in the canon. An example of exegesis in the Avestan language itself includes \"Yasna\" 19-21, which is a set of three Younger Avestan commentaries on the three Gathic Avestan 'high prayers' of \"Yasna\" 27. \"Zand\" also appear to have once existed in a variety of Middle Iranian languages, but of these Middle Iranian commentaries, the Middle Persian \"zand\" is the only to survive fully, and is for this reason regarded as 'the' \"zand\".\n\nWith the notable exception of the \"Yashts\", almost all surviving Avestan texts have their Middle Persian \"zand\", which in some manuscripts appear alongside (or interleaved with) the text being glossed. The practice of including non-Avestan commentaries alongside the Avestan texts led to two different misinterpretations in western scholarship of the term \"zand\"; these misunderstandings are described below. These glosses and commentaries were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the Avestan language texts remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in the Avestan language, which was considered a sacred language. The Middle Persian \"zand\" can be subdivided into two subgroups, those of the surviving Avestan texts, and those of the lost Avestan texts.\n\nA consistent exegetical procedure is evident in manuscripts in which the original Avestan and its \"zand\" coexist. The priestly scholars first translated the Avestan as literally as possible. In a second step, the priests then translated the Avestan idiomatically. In the final step, the idiomatic translation was complemented with explanations and commentaries, often of significant length, and occasionally with different authorities being cited.\n\nSeveral important works in Middle Persian contain selections from the \"zand\" of Avestan texts, also of Avestan texts which have since been lost. Through comparison of selections from lost texts and from surviving texts, it has been possible to distinguish between the translations of Avestan works and the commentaries on them, and thus to some degree reconstruct the content of some of the lost texts. Among those texts is the \"Bundahishn\", which has \"Zand-Agahih\" (\"Knowledge from the \"Zand\"\") as its subtitle and is crucial to the understanding of Zoroastrian cosmogony and eschatology. Another text, the \"Wizidagiha\", \"Selections (from the Zand)\", by the 9th century priest Zadspram, is a key text for understanding Sassanid-era Zoroastrian orthodoxy. The Denkard, a 9th or 10th century text, includes extensive summaries and quotations of \"zand\" texts.\n\nThe priests' practice of including commentaries alongside the text being commented upon led to two different misunderstandings in 18th/19th century western scholarship:\nPropagated by N. L. Westergaard's \"Zendavesta, or the religious books of the Zoroastrians\" (Copenhagen, 1852–54), by the early/mid 19th century, the confusion became too universal in Western scholarship to be easily reversed, and \"Zend-Avesta\", although a misnomer, continued to be fashionable well into the 20th century.\n\n"}
