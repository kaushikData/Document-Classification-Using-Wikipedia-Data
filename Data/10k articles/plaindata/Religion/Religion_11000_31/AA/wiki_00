He became prominent as an art gallery owner in Paris beginning in 1907 and was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubist movement in art.\n\nKahnweiler's family moved from Rockenhausen, a small village in the Palatinate, to Mannheim, Baden, where Kahnweiler was born in 1884. His upbringing and education at a German Gymnasium prepared him well for his life as an art connoisseur and pragmatic businessman. Early employment in the family business of stock brokerage in Germany and Paris gave way to an interest in art collecting while Kahnweiler was still in his twenties. He opened his first small art gallery (4 by 4 meters) in Paris in 1907 at 28 rue Vignon. There was a family precedent for such an enterprise, since his uncle, who ran a famous stock brokerage house in London, was a major art collector of traditional English art works and furniture.\n\nKahnweiler is considered to have been one of the greatest supporters of the Cubist art movement through his activities as an art dealer and spokesman for artists. He was among the first people to recognize the importance and beauty of Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\" and immediately wanted to buy it along with all of Picasso's works. Picasso wrote of Kahnweiler, \"What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn't had a business sense?\" Kahnweiler's appreciation of Picasso's talents was especially gratifying to the artist, since he was largely unknown and destitute at the time when many of his most famous works were created.\n\nIn his gallery, Kahnweiler supported many of the great artists of his time who found themselves without adequate recognition and little or no interest among collectors. Initial purchases included works by Kees van Dongen, André Derain, Fernand Léger, Georges Braque, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several other artists of the same generation. To use his own word, Kahnweiler wanted to \"defend\" great artists, but only those who had no dealers and whose talents he was convinced of. Rather than exhibiting appealing works by established artists from the past and present, Kahnweiler championed burgeoning artists who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse and Montmartre at the time. Thus Paul Cézanne, although a great artist, was considered too old to be represented, and his work was already represented by the dealer Ambroise Vollard in any case.\nAlong with such men as Alfred Flechtheim, Paul Cassirer, Daniel Wildenstein, Léonce Rosenberg and Paul Rosenberg, Kahnweiler was one of the influential art connoisseurs of the 20th century. As a businessman, Kahnweiler pioneered many new methods of working with artists and art dealing; these are now established practices in the industry.\n\nIn 1907, when there were only half a dozen viable galleries in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of their work in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on their creative work. He met with them daily to discuss their work, photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of their work and promoted their work internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.\n\nAs part of his activities in promoting the work of emerging artists, Kahnweiler sponsored the first exhibition of the work of Georges Braque. He encouraged the practice of publishing \"Beaux Livres\" (beautiful books), in which a contemporary artist would illustrate a work of a contemporary writer. He expanded his presentations by bringing together artists, writers and poets to produce their works as a joint project in more than 40 books. Picasso, for example, illustrated the works of Max Jacob. As a publisher of art with literary works, he had no equal, and was the first to sponsor publications by Max Jacob, Guillaume Apollinaire, André Masson, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, and many others. In doing so, he launched many literary careers.\n\nKahnweiler's entrepreneurial abilities were so acute that by the 1950s his art gallery was in the top 100 companies in France in terms of turnover from export.\n\nAlthough the financial support for artists was an important contribution to art history, he was also a significant figure for his work as an art historian and eyewitness to the emergence of Cubism during the period 1907–1914. When working in Paris, his spare time was devoted to reading and understanding the history of art and aesthetics. He also spent his time visiting the city's museums and art galleries. Besides the museums in Paris, he took trips around the European continent to see what was being shown in museums and art galleries outside France. He gave his first interview on Cubism in 1912, and it was actual historical events that led to his career as a historian. There is a view that Kahnweiler's sensibility was such that his gallery, and the way he styled and developed it, was as much a Cubist gallery as were the paintings by Picasso and the other Cubist painters. The gallery had a clear aesthetic position, uncompromising integrity, financial stability and creative development. During the years 1907-1914 his gallery was a central cradle for Cubism, not only to see the works but where one also met the artists, discussed art and where artists discussed each other's works.\n\nConcurrently, the primary means for avant-garde painters and sculptors to show their works to a wider audience remained the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d'Automne. Kahnweiler forbade his 'gallery Cubists' from exhibiting at these major Salons, and by doing so actually removed them from the public view. For the general public, Cubism was more associated with the 'Salon Cubists', such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I in 1914 not only ruptured the Cubist experiments in art, but also forced Kahnweiler to live in exile in Switzerland; due to his German citizenship, he was considered an alien under French law. Many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state, and as a result, Kahnweiler's collection was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the Hôtel Drouot between 1921 and 1923.\n\nDuring the years of exile (until 1920), Kahnweiler studied and wrote works such as the \"Der Weg Zum Kubismus\" and \"Confessions esthétiques\". Writing becoming a passion he continued over his lifetime, and he authored hundreds of books and major articles. The second period of enforced writing came during a period of internal exile caused by the events of World War II. As a Jew, the Nazis forced him to flee Paris. He remained in France in hiding. \"Under the clouds from the gas chambers,\" as he put it, he wrote his seminal work on Juan Gris.\n\nKahnweiler was very prolific as an author, but never produced a full autobiography. There was, however, a series of interviews first aired on French television, then published and translated as a book under the title \"Mes galleries et mes peintres\" (\"my galleries and my painters\". For his 80th birthday, a \"Festschrift\" was published with contributions by the world's leading philosophers, art historians, and artists, all of whom emphasized the vital importance of his unique contribution to art history – an importance still not yet fully appreciated, probably due to the fact that he has been viewed mostly as an art dealer and not as an art historian. This situation has been aggravated because some of his major works on aesthetics were either never translated into English or badly translated. The omission of key elements of a proper understanding of Cubism and focus on small and sensational elements of his complex relationship with Picasso has led to a flawed understanding of the ideas he put forward in these writings.\n\nAlthough revered by artists for his business and aesthetic sense and respected by art dealers and art historians, the true impact of his life and work has yet to be recognized, despite a recent biography by Pierre Assouline. He died in 1979 in Paris aged 94.\n\n\n"}

In 2013 \"Fearnet\" named Tomaselli one of their \"Favorite Underrated Horror Directors\", as they found his work \"unique and eccentric\". Tomaselli is currently working on a remake of the 1976 film \"Alice, Sweet Alice\", which was directed by his cousin Alfred Sole.\n\nTomaselli was born on October 29, 1969 in Paterson, New Jersey. He expressed interest in becoming a horror filmmaker while he was still a child due to his enjoyment of films such as \"The Exorcist\" and \"Don't Look Now\", which he would watch with his mother at local theaters. He studied filmmaking at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute and later transferred to the New York School of Visual Arts, where he received a B.F.A. degree in Advertising. In 1999 he released his first film, \"Desecration\", which he based on an earlier-made 23-minute short. On January 14, 2014, Tomaselli released his first audio CD of electronic horror music, \"Scream in the Dark\", through Elite Entertainment and MVD Audio.\n\nTomaselli is gay and was involved with a project called \"Gay of the Dead\".\n\nTomaselli heavily utilizes themes of Catholicism and Christianity in his work, which is inspired partly by his Catholic upbringing as a child though he is critical of the concept of religion as a whole. Other factors that influenced his work include Tomaselli's relation to Sole and surrealism, as well as severe nightmares he had as a child, which he has tried to work into his films. Some critics mistakenly attribute directors such as Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci as influences due to some similarities between their work, but Tomaselli stated in an interview with author Matthew Edwards that he did not view those directors' work until his early twenties.\n\nCritical reception to Tomaselli's films is usually very polarized, with some criticizing the films as lacking a linear plot line. Other critics have praised the films for this feature and remarked on the variety of filmgoers' reactions by saying that the movies would not appeal to all viewers and especially not to those that favor more mainstream fare or do not prefer surreal films.\n\n"}

{"id": "10685123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10685123", "title": "G. O. Mebes", "text": "G. O. Mebes\n\nG. O. Mebes (Gregory Ottonovich Mёbes, 1868 (Riga, Latvia) - 1930(Ust-Sysolsk, Russia)), was a leader of Russian Freemasonry, with more than 200 years of existence at that time, and the founder of ‘The Initiation School of Western Esoterism’. In his external life, he occupied the position of professor of French and Mathematics in two of the best schools in Saint Petersburg. He was appreciated and well known among the members of the society in the capital city. However, very few knew of his School. Only those who were invited by him were allowed into the School.\n\nThe School had an ‘external circle’, attended by all of his students, as well as some ‘internal groups’ formed accordingly to the evolutionary level of the disciples, their individual aspirations and capabilities.\n\nIn 1912, foreseeing what perhaps was the storm about to reach Russia, G. O. Mebes agreed that his disciples publish the lessons about the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot. The book came out under the title of \"The Course of Encyclopedia of Occultism\", which was completely justified because through the explanation of the Arcana, which are faces of the Truth, he introduced all of the ramifications and aspects of occultism. The first edition was quickly sold out.\n\nIn late 1917, when the new soviet regime started to persecute religion and spiritualism, the School of G.O. Mebes became clandestine, but its works never stopped.\n\nIn 1926, due to imprudence of one of the students, the School and the domicile of its members were invaded by soviet authorities, the documents destroyed and those who were linked the School were arrested.\nG. O. Mebes was deported to a gulag in the Solovetsk islands, in the White Sea, sub-Arctic region. He died a few years later.\n\nIn 1937, the \"Encyclopedia\" was considered as a classic of occultism, it was again published in Shanghai, China.\nBefore that, in the second decade, in Tallinn, Estonia, the Russian theosopher Catarina Sreznewska-Zelenzeff, who was getting ready to leave Europe and move to Brazil, received from her friend, Nina Rudnikoff, disciple of G. O. Mebes, a precious material about the Minor Arcana of Tarot. Nina, escaping from Russia, saved all her notes taken during her studies at the School. Having known that Catarina was going to travel to Brazil, Nina gave her the notes taken from the lessons that had been ministered by Mebes to the internal circle groups of the School. She also asked her to transfer her notes to ‘someone dignified’, asking her that take that with her and, eventually, transfer the material to someone else ‘dignified’ so that the lessons could be preserved.\n\nYears later, in Brazil, in a very strange coincidence, Catarina met Nadia, widow of Gabriel Iellatchitch, another disciple and great friend of Mebes. Both ladies decided to live together. Right after that, Nadia’s brother, Alexandre Nikitin-Nevelskoy, who had a profound knowledge of esoterism and was also a follower of Mebes’ School, came from Chile to live with them. By putting his notes together and with the help of the two ladies, Alexandre reestablished the course of the Minor Arcana of Tarot in its entirety. Therefore, Nina’s wish came true because the material was safe and not only transmitted to ‘someone dignified’ but also organized by someone competent, who belonged to the same egregoric (see egregore) chain. This allowed the work to be translated to Portuguese.\n\nSome of the copies of the \"Encyclopedia\" reached Brazil and were translated by Marta Pécher, who was deeply impressed by the content of the book. She also tried to reach contact with old disciples of Mebes, and finally knew one of his direct disciples, who died in Chile. With some help, she began the translation to Portuguese and published the book under the title \"Os arcanos Maiores do Tarô\" (The Major Arcana of Tarot). This book was edited by Editora Pensamento, in Brazil. Following the symbolism he explains in his book, some tarot cards have been created. These cards are very rich in symbolism, as Mebes knew Kabbalah as well as the numeric meaning of every arcana.\n\nMebes' work also influenced the writer Mouni Sadhu, who admitted that his own book, \"The Tarot\", was based on that of Mebes, and the \"Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot\" of Valentin Tomberg.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "231798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231798", "title": "Goliard", "text": "Goliard\n\nThe goliards were a group of clergy, generally young, in Europe who wrote satirical Latin poetry in the 12th and 13th centuries of the Middle Ages. They were chiefly clerics who served at or had studied at the universities of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and England, who protested the growing contradictions within the church through song, poetry and performance. Disaffected and not called to the religious life, they often presented such protests within a structured setting associated with carnival, such as the Feast of Fools, or church liturgy.\n\nThe derivation of the word is uncertain. It may come from the Latin \"gula,\" gluttony. It may also originate from a mythical \"Bishop Golias,\" a medieval Latin form of the name Goliath, the giant who fought King David in the Bible—thus suggestive of the monstrous nature of the goliard. Another source may be \"gailliard,\" a \"gay fellow.\"\n\nMany scholars believe the term \"goliard\" is derived from a letter between St. Bernard of Clairvaux and Pope Innocent II, in which Bernard referred to Pierre Abélard as Goliath, thus creating a connection between Goliath and the student adherents of Abélard. By the 14th century, the word goliard became synonymous with minstrel, and no longer referred to a particular group of clergy.\n\nThe goliardic class is believed to have arisen from the need of younger sons to develop means of support. The medieval social convention of primogeniture meant that the eldest son inherited title and estate. This practice of bestowing the rights of inheritance upon the eldest son left younger sons to seek other means by which to support themselves. Often, these younger sons went, or were sent, to the universities and monasteries of the day, where theology and preparation for clergy careers were a major focus. Many felt no particular affinity for religious office, and often could not secure an office even if they desired one because of an overabundance of those educated in theology. Consequently, over-educated, under-motivated clerics often adopted not the life of an ordered monk, but one mainly intent on the pursuit of carnal pleasures.\n\nThe goliards, as scholars, often wrote their poetry in Latin. As a kind of traveling entertainer, the goliards composed many of their poems to be sung. These poems, or lyrics, focus on two overarching themes: depictions of the lusty lifestyle of the vagrant and satirical criticisms of society and the church.\n\nExpressing their lusty lifestyle, the goliards wrote about the physicality of love, in contrast to the chivalric focus of the troubadours. They wrote drinking songs, and reveled in riotous living. Their satirical poems directed at the church were inspired by their daily worlds, including mounting corruption in monasteries and escalating tensions among religious leaders. As a result of their rebellious writings against the church, the goliards were eventually denied the privileges of the clergy. Their strained relationship with the church, along with their vagabond lifestyle, also contributed to many poems describing the complaints of such a lifestyle. One of the largest and most famous collections of goliardic poetry is the \"Carmina Burana.\"\n\nThis belief, however, that the goliards were the authors of vast parts of this satirical and worldly poetry that originated in the twelfth and early thirteenth century, is criticized by recent historical and philological research, especially because most traceable goliardic poets were an integral part of church hierarchy, often worked as teachers in the secular clergy and had neither any communality nor a single provable point of contact with the historical goliards. Thus \"goliardic poets\" on the one hand and \"goliards\" on the other hand need to be strictly distinguished.\n\nInstead it has been argued that the cathedral schools of northern France were the decisive historical context of goliardic poetry, defining it as follows: \"Based on the manuscript attribution of medieval poetry with Golias and goliardus, the High and Late Middle Ages understood “goliardic poetry” to be the rhymed secular Latin poetry of the High Middle Ages, whose primary purpose was a comical one. This comical intent was evident in theme and plot, but could mostly be found on the poetological meta-layers of language, intertext and semantics. Goliardic poetry was written in a time frame between circa 1115 and 1255 in the “school system” of secular clergy between Loire and Somme, and mainly in the cathedral schools of that region and their cosmos, but was read for a longer timeframe, also being received in wider geographical and institutional spaces. Goliardic poetry was turned into revolutionary hedonistic scandal poetry by archivists of the early modern era and research since the middle of the 19th century, which understood the thematic focus as the experience poetry of socially low-ranking clerical vagrants (goliards) instead of viewing its omnipresent comedy as role poetry enriched with moralising and sometimes pedagogical and didactical elements.\"\n\nThe satires were meant to mock and lampoon the church. For example, at St. Remy, the goliards went to mass in procession, with each trailing a herring on a string along the ground. The game was to step on the herring in front and keep your own herring from being trod upon. In some districts, goliards staged a celebration of the ass, in which a donkey dressed in a silly costume was led to the chancel rail where a cantor chanted a song of praise. When he paused, the audience would respond: \"He Haw, Sire Ass, He haw!\". The University of Paris complained: \nPriests and clerks.. dance in the choir dressed as women... they sing wanton songs. They eat black pudding at the altar itself, while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play dice on the altar. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They run and leap throughout the church, without a blush of their own shame. Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby carriages and carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in infamous performances, with indecent gestures and with scurrilous and unchaste words.\n\nThe goliards used sacred sources such as texts from the Roman Catholic Mass and Latin hymns and played upon them to secular and satirical purposes in their poems (such as in the Drinkers Mass). The jargon of scholastic philosophy also is frequently featured in their poems, either for satirical purposes, or because these concepts were familiar parts of the writers' working vocabulary. Their satires were almost uniformly directed against the church, attacking even the pope.\n\nThe word \"goliard\" outlived the original meaning. It was absorbed into the French and English literature of the 14th century, generally meaning \"jongleur\" or wandering minstrel, and no longer related to the original clerical association. It is thus used in \"Piers Plowman\", and by Chaucer.\n\n\n"}

It began as a weekly paper and eventually developed into a daily. In 1909, the paper had a peak circulation of 1,200 copies, 500 distributed in Jerusalem.\n\n\"HaZvi\" revolutionized Hebrew newspaper publishing in Jerusalem by introducing secular issues and techniques of modern journalism, especially after Itamar Ben-Avi, Ben-Yehuda's son, joined the paper. Influenced by the French press, Ben-Avi brought in sensational headlines and a style of reporting that differed from newspapers of the old school. \"HaZvi \" became the organ of the New Yishuv (pre-state Jewish community), as the first Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. The paper included translations of French literature (previously only German literature had appeared in translation) and original Hebrew prose. The need for Hebrew words to report the daily news prompted Ben-Yehuda to begin his lifelong project of compiling a Hebrew dictionary. All this fit in with the Hebraist ideology that was on the rise.\nIn 1908, the name of the paper was changed to \"HaOr\" ( 'The Light') due to licensing restrictions.\n\nThe paper was banned by the Ottoman government during the First World War due to its proposals for a Jewish homeland.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7372761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7372761", "title": "Hortus conclusus", "text": "Hortus conclusus\n\nHortus conclusus is a Latin term, meaning literally \"enclosed garden\". At their root, both of the words in \"hortus conclusus\" refer linguistically to enclosure.\n\n\"Hortus conclusus\" is both an emblematic attribute and a title of the Virgin Mary in Medieval and Renaissance poetry and art, suddenly appearing in paintings and manuscript illuminations about 1330 as well as a genre of actual garden that was enclosed both symbolically and as a practical concern, a major theme in the history of gardening.\n\nThe term \"hortus conclusus\" is derived from the Vulgate Bible's \"Canticle of Canticles\" (also called the \"Song of Songs\" or \"Song of Solomon\") 4:12, in Latin: \"Hortus conclusus soror mea, sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus\" (\"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.\" This provided the shared linguistic culture of Christendom, expressed in homilies expounding the \"Song of Songs\" as allegory where the image of King Solomon's nuptial song to his bride was reinterpreted as the love and union between Christ and the Church, the mystical marriage with the Church as the Bride of Christ. \n\nThe verse \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\" (4.7) from the \"Song\" was also regarded as a scriptural confirmation of the developing and still controversial doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception - being born without Original Sin (\"macula\" is Latin for spot).\n\nChristian tradition states that Jesus Christ was conceived to Mary miraculously and without disrupting her virginity by the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Holy Trinity. As such, Mary in late medieval and Renaissance art, illustrating the long-held doctrine of the Perpetual virginity of Mary, as well as the Immaculate Conception, was shown in or near a walled garden or yard. This was a representation of her \"closed off\" womb, which was to remain untouched, and also of her being protected, as by a wall, from sin. In the Grimani Breviary, scrolling labels identify the emblemmatic objects betokening the Immaculate Conception: the enclosed garden (\"hortus conclusus\"), the tall cedar (\"cedrus exalta\"), the well of living waters (\"puteus aquarum viventium\"), the olive tree (\"oliva speciosa\"), the fountain in the garden (\"fons hortorum\"), the rosebush (\"plantatio rosae\"). Not all actual medieval \"horti conclusi\" even strove to include all these details, the olive tree in particular being insufficiently hardy for northern European gardens.\n\nThe enclosed garden is recognizable in Fra Angelico's \"Annunciation\" (\"illustration, above left\"), dating from 1430-32.\n\nTwo pilgrimage sites are dedicated to Mary of the Enclosed Garden in the Dutch-Flemish cultural area. One is the statue at the hermitage-chapel in Warfhuizen: \"Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden\". The second, \"Onze Lieve Vrouw van Tuine\" (literally \"Our Lady of the Garden\"), is venerated at the cathedral of Ypres.\n\nAll gardens are by definition enclosed or bounded spaces, but the enclosure may be somewhat open, and consist of columns, low hedges or fences. An actual walled garden, literally surrounded by a wall, is a subset of gardens. The meaning of \"hortus conclusus\" suggests a more private style of garden.\n\nIn the history of gardens the High Medieval \"hortus conclusus\" typically had a well or fountain at the center, bearing its usual symbolic freight (see \"Fountain of Life\") in addition to its practical uses. The convention of four paths that divided the square enclosure into quadrants, was so strong that the pattern was employed even where the paths led nowhere. All medieval gardens were enclosed, protecting the private precinct from public intrusion, whether by folk or by stray animals. The enclosure might be as simple as woven wattle fencing or of stout or decorative masonry; or it might be enclosed by trelliswork tunneled pathways in a secular garden or by an arcaded cloister, for communication or meditative pacing.\n\nThe origin of the cloister is in the Roman colonnaded peristyle, as every garden history notes; the ruined and overgrown Roman villas that were so often remade as the site of Benedictine monasteries had lost their planted garden features with the first decades of abandonment: \"gardening, more than architecture, more than painting, more than music, and far more than literature, is an ephemeral art; its masterpieces disappear, leaving little trace.\" Though \"when, in 1070, the abbey of Cassino was rebuilt,\" Georgina Masson observed, \"the garden was described as 'a paradise in the Roman fashion'\", it may have been merely \"the aura of the great classical tradition\" alone that had survived. The ninth-century idealised plan of Saint Gall (\"illustration\") shows an arcaded cloister with a central well and cross paths from the centers of each range of arcading, but when a consciously patterned garden was revived for the medieval cloister, the patterning came through Norman Sicily and its hybrid culture that adapted many Islamic elements, in this case the enclosed North African courtyard gardens, ultimately based on the Persian garden tradition.\n\nThe practical enclosed garden was laid out in the treatise by Pietro Crescenzi of Bologna, \"Liber ruralium commodorum\", a work that was often copied, as the many surviving manuscripts of its text attest, and often printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Late medieval paintings and illuminations in manuscripts such as for \"The Romance of the Rose\"— where the garden in the text is largely allegorical— often show a turfed bank for a seat as a feature of the \"hortus conclusus\". Only in the fifteenth century, at first in Italy, did some European gardens begin to look outward.\n\nSitting, walking and playing music were the activities most often portrayed in the numerous fifteenth-century paintings and illuminated manuscripts, where strenuous activities were inappropriate. In Rome, a late fifteenth-century cloister at San Giovanni dei Genovesi was constructed for the use of the Genoese \"natio\", an \"Ospitium Genoensium\", as a plaque still proclaims, which provided shelter in cubicles off its vaulted encircling arcades, and a meeting place and shelter reuniting those from the distant home city.\n\nSomewhat earlier, Pietro Barbo, who became Pope Paul II in 1464, began the construction of a \"hortus conclusus\", the Palazzetto del Giardino di San Marco, attached to the Venetian Cardinals' Roman seat, the Palazzo Venezia. It served as Paul's private garden during his papacy; inscriptions stress its secular functions as \"sublimes moenibus hortos...ut relevare animum, durasque repellere curas\", a garden of sublime delights, a retreat from cares, and praise it in classicising terms, as the home of the dryads, suggesting that there was a central grove of trees, and mentioning its snowy-white stuccoed porticoes. An eighteenth-century engraving shows a tree-covered central mount, which has been recreated in the modern replanting, with box-bordered cross and saltire gravelled paths.\n\nThe Farnese Gardens (\"Orti Farnesiani sul Palatino\"—or \"Gardens of Farnese upon the Palatine\") were created by Vignola in 1550 on Rome's northern Palatine Hill, for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520–89). These become the first private botanical gardens in Europe (the first botanical gardens of any kind in Europe being started by Italian universities in the mid-16th century, only a short time before). Alessandro called his summer home at the site \"Horti Farnesiani\", probably in reference to the \"hortus conclusus.\" These gardens were also designed in the Roman peristylium style with a central fountain.\n\nAgain in the age of the automobile, the enclosed garden that had never disappeared in Islamic society, became an emblem of serenity and privacy in the Western world.\n\nThe \"hortus conclusus\" was one of a number of depictions of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages developed to be more informal and intimate than the traditional hieratic enthroned Virgin adopted from Byzantine icons, or the Coronation of the Virgin. The subject began as a specific metaphor for the Annunciation, but tended to develop into a relaxed \"sacra conversatione\", with several figures beside the Virgin seated, and less specific associations. Germany and the Netherlands in the 15th century saw the peak popularity of this depiction of the Virgin, usually with Child, and very often a crowd of angels, saints and donors, in the garden - the garden by itself, to represent the Virgin, was much rarer. Often walls, or trellises close off the sides and rear, or it may be shown as open, except for raised banks, to a landscape beyond. Sometimes, as with a Gerard David's \"The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor\" (Below) the garden is very fully depicted; at other times, as in engravings by Martin Schongauer, only a wattle fence and a few sprigs of grass serve to identify the theme. Italian painters typically also keep plants to a minimum, and do not have grass benches. A sub-variety of the theme was the German \"Madonna of the Roses\", sometimes attempted in sculptured altarpieces. The image was rare in Orthodox icons, but there are at least some Russian examples.\n\nOne type of depiction, not usually compatible with correct perspective, concentrates on showing the whole wall, and several garden structures or features that symbolize the mystery of Christ's conception, mostly derived from the \"Song of Songs\" or other Biblical passages, as interpreted by theological writers. These may include one or more temple or church-like buildings, an Ivory Tower (SS 7.4), an open-air altar with Aaron's rod flowering, surrounded by the bare rods of the other tribes, a gatehouse \"tower of David, hung with shields\" (SS 7.4), with the gate closed, the Ark of the Covenant, a well (often covered), a fountain, and the morning sun above (SS 6.10).\nThis type of depiction usually shows the Annunciation, although sometimes the child Jesus is held by Mary. The miniature at right shows a relatively simple example; below a large Spanish altarpiece is able to combine many of the usual features (others no doubt contained in the many chapels) with correct perspective.\n\nA rather rare, late 15th century, variant of this depiction was to combine the Annunciation in the \"hortus conclusus\" with the \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" and \"Virgin and Unicorn\", so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many \"prima facie\" secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal. In the 16th century the subject of the \"hortus conclusus\" drifts into the open air \"Sacra Conversazione\" and the Madonnas in a landscape of Giovanni Bellini, Albrecht Dürer and Raphael, where it is hard to say if an allusion is intended.\n\nAn exhibition of later medieval visual representations of \"hortus inclusus\" was mounted at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington DC; the exhibition drew a distinction between \"garden representations as thematic reinforcements and those that seemingly treat the garden as a subject in itself\"; in reviewing it Timothy Husband, warned against uncritical interpretation of the refined detail in manuscript illuminations' \"seemingly objective representation\". \"Late medieval garden imagery, by subjugating direct observation to symbolic or allegorical intention, reflects more a state of mind than reality,\" if a disjunct can be detected where the objects of the world shimmered with pregnant allegorical meaning. South Netherlandish illuminations and painting appear to document the \"turf benches, fountains, raised beds, 'estrade' trees, potted plants, walkways, enclosing walls, trellises, wattle fences and bowers\" familiar to contemporary viewers, but assembled into an illusion of reality.\n\nThe concept for the 2011 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was the hortus conclusus, a contemplative room, a garden within a garden. Designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and with a garden created by Piet Oudolf, the Pavilion was a place abstracted from the world of noise and traffic and the smells of London – an interior space within which to sit, to walk, to observe the flowers.\n\n\n"}

P. Sinnett, the first biographer of H. P. Blavatsky (née Hahn). He describes the many unusual incidents in her life, beginning from her childhood in Russia and asserts that she has been with \"an early connection with the supernatural world;\" he says about her short unlucky marriage and \"decade of extensive global travels,\" about her period of learning in Tibet, and the \"criticism she received about some of her 'phenomena' and practices.\"\n\nWashington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship, and over a decade (1879–89), she led with them the correspondence and has supplied to the author the materials for her biography. The book was \"an attempt to reestablish\" Blavatsky's reputation after the attacks of the Society for Psychical Research contained in Hodgson Report. Sinnett long continued correcting often distorted information about the time and place of the events in the book, having arrived to Blavatsky in Würzburg for it. Subsequently, she continued to send him additional information, which pop up in her memory. Sinnett wrote: \"In consultation we decided that \"Memoirs\" would be too comprehensive a title for the book and agreed on the word \"Incidents\" instead.\" In her letter to the author Blavatsky stated: \n\"Do whatever you like. Publish the memoirs, write what you think best and proper. I subscribe to it beforehand and hereby give you carte blanche and full authority to act and do in my name whatever you will. I am sure you will defend the cause and myself better than I ever can.\"\n\nHelena told her biographer about a strange event that happened to her in early childhood. She wanted to get a better look at a portrait hanging high on the wall. She made up a pyramid out of two small tables and one chair, and tried to get to the portrait. What happened next, she does not know, because she lost consciousness at the moment when her building swayed and began to crumble. When she regained consciousness, she saw herself completely intact on the floor, and tables and chair were again in their usual places. Nevertheless, \"the mark of her small hand remained imprinted on the dusty wall high up beside the picture.\"\n\nThe author tells about another case where Helena miraculously survived: \"A horse bolted with her — she fell, with her foot entangled in the stirrup, and before the horse was stopped she ought, she thinks, to have been killed outright but for a strange sustaining power she distinctly felt around her, which seemed to hold her up in defiance of gravitation.\" She was then fourteen years old. Sinnett informs that, according to her earliest memories, she occasionally saw near herself her protector. From early childhood, this form has prevailed in her imagination. He was always the same, his features never changed. \"In after life she met him as a living man, and knew him as though she had been brought up in his presence.\"\n\nA certain seer told about Helena's future:\n\"This little lady is quite different from all of you. There are great events lying in wait for her in the future. I feel sorry in thinking that I will not live to see my predictions of her verified; \"but they will all come to pass\"!\"\n\nAccording to Helena Hahn's aunt, the reason for this marriage was frivolous nature of her niece. Her governess has said that her character is bad, and hardly there is a man who would be willing to marry her. To enhance the impact of her words the governess added that \"even the old man she had found so ugly, and had laughed at so much, calling him 'a plume-less raven' — that even he would decline her for a wife! That was enough: three days after she made him (Mr. Blavatsky) propose, and then, frightened at what she had done, sought to escape from her joking acceptance of his offer. But it was too late.\"\nHelena's aunt has described:\n\"At the altar, she heard the priest saying to her: 'Thou shalt honour and obey thy husband', and at this hated word 'shalt,' her young face — for she was hardly seventeen — was seen to flush angrily, then to become deadly pale. She was overheard to mutter in response, through her set teeth — 'Surely, I shall not.'\"[Sinnett continues:] \"And surely she has not. Forthwith she determined to take the law and her future life into her own hands, and — he left her 'husband' for ever, without giving him any opportunity to ever even think of her as \"his wife.\"\"\nSinnett says that Mr. Blavatsky himself was ready to agree in the divorce. He tried to get a formal divorce on the reason that \"his marriage had never been more than a form, and that his wife had run away; but Russian law at the time was not favourable to divorce, and the attempt failed.\"\n\nNext Blavatsky (Hahn) has left Russia and voyaged \"ten long years in strange and out-of-the-way places — in Central Asia, India, South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe.\"\n\nBlavatsky's unusual psychic abilities, that had manifested even in her childhood and adolescence, during her travel significantly increased and determined, and she returned to Russia, having many occult powers.\nIn the town of Pskoff Blavatsky had performed occult phenomena under follows classification:\n\nOne time Blavatsky had caused raps inside the glasses of a skeptical professor with such force that they were knocked from his nose. In reply to a somewhat frivolous lady who had asked what is the best conductor for the production of such raps, the table spelt out 'gold', and the next minute this lady rushed out of the room with her hands inflicted on her mouth, as she had felt the raps on her gold artificial teeth.\n\nBlavatsky has transformed weight of small table so that Leonid Hahn, her brother, couldn't lift it. Then she recovered it to a normal weight, and Leonid raised the table as a feather. Sinnett informs, according to Jelihowsky's narrative:\n\"At one moment as we sat at supper in the dining-room, there were loud accords played on the piano which stood in the adjoining apartment, and which was closed and locked, and so placed that we could all of us see it from where we were through the large open doors. Then at the first command and look of Mme. Blavatsky there came rushing to her through the air her tobacco-pouch, her box of matches, her pocket-handkerchief, or anything she asked, or was made to ask for.\"\n\nSinnett tells that Blavatsky has tried with the most prominent mediums to call and \"communicate with those dearest to her, and whose loss she had deplored, but could never succeed.\" She said to him that \"she often saw, to her disgust, how her own recollections and brain-images were drawn from her memory and disfigured in the confused amalgamation that took place between their reflection in the medium's brain, which instantly sent them out, and the shells which \"sucked them in\" like a sponge and objectivised them.\" Next Sinnett transmits the following words by Blavatsky:\n\"Even the materialized form of my uncle at the Eddys was the picture; it was I who sent it out from my own mind, as I had come out to make experiments without telling it to anyone. It was like an empty outer envelope of my uncle that I seemed to throw on the medium's astral body. I saw and followed the process, I knew Will Eddy was a genuine medium, and the phenomenon as real as it could be, and therefore, when days of trouble came for him, I defended him in the papers.\"\nAccording to Jelihowsky, Blavatsky claimed that she is \"no medium, but only a mediator between mortals and beings we knew nothing about.\" In one of her letters to relatives Blavatsky informed that the last remnant of her psycho-physical helplessness has leaved out her and will not return any more. In connection with her mediumship, Sinnett argues that \"there, \"where a less strong nature would have been surely wrecked in the struggle, her indomitable will found somehow or other the means of subjecting the world of the invisibles — to the denizens of which she has ever refused the name of 'spirits' and souls — to her own control.\"\"\n\nAlthough Blavatsky helped to the author by providing information, in Sinnett's book there is a \"number of errors of fact which have been pointed out by later writers.\"\nSolovyov wrote concerning Sinnett's book following: \n\"For the sake of inflation of Blavatsky's fame Sinnett published a book entitled \"Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky.\" The book portrays, \"on the foundation of the most precise evidences,\" the life of Helena Petrovna. Well, it is not difficult to prove that this book is mainly a collection of stories about something that never happened.\"\nSolovyov stated that from the analysis of the phenomena performed by Blavatsky, which made Hodgson, \"we can conclude, with which 'serious and honest' \"the researcher\" we deal in the face of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky.\" Solovyov also stated that the theosophical \"Universal Brotherhood\" is only a \"funny bunch of systematic deceptions, as say the modern Frenchmen – \"rien qu'une fumisterie.\"\" He wrote that the conclusions of the SPR about \"Blavatsky's \"phenomena\" make superfluous the assumption that, in addition to the tricks, she could to demonstrate for the benefit of the theosophy some really exceptional psychic abilities.\" Hodgson in his report argued:\n\"Mr. Sinnett treats with scorn the supposition that Madame Blavatsky could have produced either the 'raps' or the 'astral bells' by means of any machine concealed about her person; but I cannot help thinking that the latter sounds at least might have been produced in this way. Madame Coulomb asserts that they were actually so produced, by the use of a small musical-box, constructed on the same principle as the machine employed in connection with the trick known under the name 'Is your watch a repeater?' and she produced garments which she asserted had belonged to Madame Blavatsky, and showed me stains resembling iron-mould on the right side, slightly above the waist, which she affirmed had been caused by contact with the metal of the machine.\"\nNevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, \"a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by Vernon Harrison of the SPR effectively demolished both the Coulomb accusations and the conclusions of the Report.\"\n\nThe book was reprinted several times and has been translated into French. Second edition of the book was published in 1913 in abridged form.\n\n\n\n"}

His many inventions, including the steerable cardiac catheter, helped pioneer the biomedical engineering industry. He was also an early exponent of what has come to be referred to as consciousness studies and authored several books on the subject.\n\nBentov was born in Humenné, Czechoslovakia, in 1923. During World War II, his parents were killed in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nHe narrowly escaped being sent to the camps and moved to British Palestine, first living on the Shoval kibbutz in the Negev.\n\nDespite not having a university degree, Bentov joined the Israeli Science Corps, which David Ben-Gurion incorporated into the Israeli Defense Forces one month before Israel declared statehood in 1948. The Science Corps became a military branch known by the Hebrew acronym HEMED. Bentov designed Israel's first rocket for the War of Independence. HEMED was forced to make improvised weapons as there was a worldwide embargo on selling weapons to the Jewish state.\n\nBentov immigrated to the United States in 1954, and settled in Massachusetts. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1962.\n\nBentov began with a workshop in the basement of a Catholic church in Belmont, Massachusetts in the 1960s. In 1967, he built the steerable heart catheter and attracted the attention of businessman John Abele, with whom Bentov founded the Medi-Tech corporation in 1969.\n\nAbele later recalled of Bentov's workshop,\n\nIn 1979, Abele and Peter Nicholas looked to grow the successful business and established Boston Scientific as a holding company to purchase Medi-Tech.\n\nBentov was the holder of numerous patents. In addition to the steerable cardiac catheter, his inventions ranged included diet spaghetti, automobile brake shoes, EKG electrodes and pacemaker leads.\n\nBentov was extremely fascinated by consciousness, in particular how it related to physiology. In his 1977 book, \"Stalking the Wild Pendulum: On the Mechanics of Consciousness\", he wrote that \"consciousness permeates everything.\"\n\nBentov's invention was a seismographic device to record the heartbeat, in particular the aorta's reverberations. Marc Seifer described the results: \"During normal breathing, the reverberations in the aorta arc out of phase with the heartbeat and the system is inharmonious. However, during meditation and when the breath is held, the echo off the bifurcation of the aorta (where the aorta forks at the pelvis to go into each leg) is in resonance with the heartbeat and the system becomes synchronized, thus utilizing a minimum amount of energy. This resonant beat is approximately seven cycles per second, which corresponds not only to the alpha rhythm of the brain but also to the low-level magnetic pulsations of the Earth.\"\n\nBentov was killed on May 25, 1979, as a passenger aboard American Airlines Flight 191 that crashed at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Moments after takeoff, an engine detached from the plane and tore off part of the wing, sending the plane down. The crash killed all 271 passengers and crew on board and two people on the ground. It is the deadliest single plane crash on U.S. soil to date.\n\nBentov's daughter, English professor Sharona Ben-Tov Muir, wrote a memoir about her father, \"The Book of Telling: Tracing the Secrets of My Father's Lives\" in 2005. It was not until after his death that she learned about his life in the Israeli Defense Forces and that he had created Israel's first rocket. Searching for answers as to why he never discussed this part of his life, Muir traveled to Israel and researched his years there.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"nirgrantha\" (\"bondless\") was used for Jain monks in the past. The monastic practices of two major sects (\"Digambara\" and \"Śvētāmbara\") vary greatly, but the major principles of both are identical.\n\n\"Digambaras\" use the word \"\" for male monastics and \"aryika\" for female monastics. \"Digambara monks\" are also called \"nirgrantha\" (without bonds). Buddhist texts refer to Mahavira, the last \"Tirthankara\", as \"Nigaṇṭha Jñātaputta\". \"Nigaṇṭha\" means \"without knot, tie, or string\"; \"Jñātaputta\" (son of \"Natas\") refers to his clan of origin, \"Jñāta\" or \"Naya\" (Prakrit). \"Śvētāmbaras\" use the word \"sadhvi\"s for female monastics.\n\nHistorians believe that a united Jain \"sangha\" (community) existed before 367 BCE, about 160 years after the \"moksha\" (liberation) of Mahavira.

This is followed (or preceded) by another ritual in which the initiate receives an \"ogho\" (a small broom made of wool) from their mentor as a symbol of welcome into the monastic order. The initiate then puts on monastic clothing and pluck out hairs by hand. Further rituals formally initiate them into the monastic order. The \"Śvētāmbara Terapanth\" sect requests written permission from a person's parents before initiating them into the ascetic order.\n\nThe earliest known texts often ask for ascetics to be in complete solitude, identifying the isolation of soul and non-soul. However, soon after Mahavira's death ascetics organized themselves into groups. A few examples of ascetics living in complete solitude are found in the \"Digambara\" sect.\n\nJain ascetics are detached from social and worldly activities; all activities are aimed at self-purification for self-realization. They follow established guidelines for daily worship and austerity.\n\nThe monk's daily routine is broadly structured by three ideological formulae: the five great vows (\"mahavrata\"), the eight matrices of doctrine (\"pravacana-matrka\"), and the six obligatory actions (\"avasyaka\"). The first two are restrictions, and the third is positively framed in what the monk is encouraged to do daily.\n\nAscetics do not have a home or possessions. They choose austerity, avoid services such as telephones and electricity. Monks engage in activities such as meditation, seeking knowledge and acquiring self-discipline.\n\nThe \"Yati\" of the \"Śvētāmbara\" sect and the \"Bhattaraka\" of the Digambara Terapanth do not wander; they usually live in temples and perform daily rituals.\n\nThe monks rise before dawn, most around 5:00 a.m. but some as early as 2:00 a.m. In observance of \"utsarg-samiti\", defecation takes place in the open where feces not harm living creatures; urination is into a shallow pan, which is emptied onto a dry patch of ground.\n\nMonks and nuns from the \"Digambara\" traditions are assigned to ranks:\n\nIn the \"Digambara\" tradition, an ascetic rises from \"kshullak\" (one who uses two pieces of cloth) through \"Ailak\" (uses one piece of cloth) to \"muni\" (or \"sadhu\"). Over time a number of designations were mentioned in shastras, such as \"gani\", \"pannyas\" and \"pravartak\". The Śvētāmbara Terapanth sect has a new rank of junior monks, \"samana\".\n\nObserving complete abstinence, male \"Digambara\" monks wear no clothing. \"Aryikas\" wear plain, seamless white \"sarees\". All Digambara monks and nuns traditionally carry only three things: a \"mor-pichhi\" (peacock-feather whisk), a \"kamandalu\" (water pot) and \"shastras\" (scriptures).\n\n\"Śvētāmbara\" monastics wear white, seamless clothing.\n\n\"Chaturmas\" is the four-month monsoon period during which ascetics stay in one place to reduce the risk of accidentally killing insects and other small forms of life which thrive during the rains. This period is suitable for \"sravakas\" to renew their faith by listening to teachings of the \"dharma\", meditation and \"vartas\" (acts of self-control).\n\nDuring \"Chaturmas\", the chief \"sadhu\" of each group gives a daily \"pravacana\" or \"vyakhyana\" (sermon) attended mostly by women and retired men but on special days by most of the lay congregation. During their eight months of travel, the \"sadhus\" give sermons whenever requested (most often when they arrive in a new village or town in their travels).\n\nThe \"Kalpa Sūtra\" describes Mahavira's asceticism in detail; from it, most of the ascetic practices (including the restraints and regulations) are derived:\n\n\n"}

In 1913 he completed his doctorate in theology with a dissertation on the letters of Saint John. During this time he traveled widely throughout Kashubia, particularly through the northern part, gathering information about Kashubian culture and language. Although he was associated with the Society of Young Kashubians from its start, he gradually distanced himself from the Society's cultural objectives and focused on his priestly vocation and his poetry, which he published under the nom de plume Stanisław Czernicki.\n\nWhen Poland regained its freedom after the First World War, Father Heyke was based from 1920 to 1935 in Kościerzyna, where he served as chaplain and teacher of religion and French at the National Gimnazjum. He resumed his prolific publication of poetry and historical works, preferring to emphasize northern variants of the Kashubian language. In addition, he became known as one of the leading Kashubian activists. Among other things, he was the featured speaker at the 1931 dedication of the monument to Hieronim Derdowski in Wiele.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Father Heyke attempted to join the Polish Army as a chaplain. However, he was arrested by the Germans in the town of Wda and executed with other clergy and intellectuals on October 15 in the Szpęgawski Forest near Starogard Gdański.\n\nAlthough Father Heyke's works were rarely published during the period of Communist rule, his life and writings now enjoy their proper place in Kashubian culture. In 2005 the Kashubian Institute of Gdańsk sponsored a conference on Father Heyke entitled \"Świętopełk literatury kaszubskiej\" (\"Swiantopolk of Kashubian Literature\"), a reference to the revered Kashubian historical figure Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania.

Somé endured sixteen years of physical and emotional abuse by the priests, but he left the school when he was twenty to return to the village of his birth. Upon his return, integration into his traditional tribal religion and customs was difficult, due to his long absence from his culture and his apparent indoctrination into Christianity and a \"white man's world\". Elders from the village believed that Somé's ancestral spirit had withdrawn from his body and that he had already undergone a type of rite of passage into manhood in the white world. Despite this, they agreed to let him undergo a belated manhood rite with a younger group in the tribe.

{"id": "6486861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6486861", "title": "Mazhabi Sikh", "text": "Mazhabi Sikh\n\nMazhabi Sikhs (also known as Mazbhabi, Mazbhi, Majhabhi or Majabhi) are members of an untouchable caste who have rejected Hinduism in favour of the Sikh faith. The word \"Mazhabi\" is derived from the Urdu term \"mazhab\" (Mazhab means religion or sect), and can be translated as \"the faithful\". They live mainly in Indian Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nThe definition of Mazhabi today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of Valmikism. Mazhabis are best known for military service in the Sikh Khalsa Army, British Indian Army and post-independence Indian Army.\n\nWhen Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, was killed by the Mughals in Delhi, three lower caste recovered his dismembered body from a Muslim crowd and brought it back to his son, Guru Gobind Singh. In recognition of their act, he admitted the untouchable into the Khalsa (the Sikh faith), giving them the name \"Mazhabi\" (\"faithful\").\n\nWithin the present-day Mazhabi community, one group calls itself the Ranghreta and claims a higher status on the grounds that one of their ancestors was Bhai Jaita Ranghreta, who carried the head of Tegh Bahadur from Delhi to Guru Gobind Singh in Anandpur Sahib.\n\nThe definition of \"Mazhabi\" today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of Valmikism. While Sikhism is in theory an egalitarian faith that takes no notice of caste, gender and other social demarcations, Fenech and Singh note that \"there is often a level of hypocrisy between what is taught and what is actually put into practice.\" Mazhabis are discriminated against by Sikhs whose origins lie with higher-ranked castes and many Chuhras have turned to Valmikism but are still referred to as Mazhabi. While young Valmikis, who accept Valmiki as their guru, increasingly object to being labelled as Sikh, their elders are less concerned. At least one of their organisations, the Valmiki-Mazhabi Sikh Morcha, conflates the terms.\n\nMazhabis who converted from Sikhism to Christianity under the influence of Christian missionaries in the later years of the British Raj are sometimes referred to as Christian Mazhabi Sikhs. Some also profess Hinduism but call themselves Mazhabi, as do a small number who follow the tenets of Buddhism.\n\nThe Mazhabis were recruited to the army of Sandhanwalia Jat ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh but as separate companies attached to regular battalions rather than as part of an integrated force. This situation was forced upon him because high-caste Sikhs refused any closer connection. They served as pioneers, operating mainly as a labour corps that worked on construction of roads, bridges and canals. They were not, however, mere labourers because it was expected that their infantry skills would enable them to defend themselves in the event of attack.\n\nThe Mazhabis, whom historian Stephen Cohen says \"had strong caste traditions of violence and aggressiveness and were classed as a criminal caste by the British\", lost their military employment following the defeat of the Sikhs in the Anglo-Sikh Wars. Some eventually found employment as pioneers in the army of Gulab Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. In 1857, the British turned to them for help during the Indian Rebellion, apparently to counteract the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army. The First Pioneer Sikh Regiment soon found itself helping to break the Siege of Delhi, a second regiment was raised in 1858 and a third followed soon after. This military employment contributed to a gradual improvement in their social status and in 1911 their official classification in Gujranwala and Lyallpur was uplifted to that of \"agricultural caste\" by the British authorities. The British military classification system, which rated recruits according to their caste, continued to assert that Mazhabis were best suited as pioneers while, for example, Jat Sikhs should be infantry.\n\nThey were deployed at the Siege of Lucknow and Capture of Lucknow during the 1857 Indian Rebellion. It was calculated in 1898 that there were 2,452 Mazhabis in the army, along with 28,146 Jat Sikhs and 9,000 other Sikhs.\n\nDuring World War I the single-battalion regiments of the Mazhabi Sikh Pioneers – the 23rd, 32nd and 34th Pioneer Regiments – were expanded to comprise three battalions each. These units served in Egypt, Europe, Mesopotamia and Palestine and performed well. The 1/34th Sikh Pioneers were awarded the title of \"Royal\". Ellinwood and Pradhan note that during the First World War, the Mazhabi Sikh soldiers were \"estimated\" to have reached a \"remarkably high standard\".\nThe Sikh Pioneer regiments, which were practically the only military employer of the Mazhabis, were disbanded in December 1932. The cause was mainly advances in road-building techniques and the need to economise. Most of their recruits were released from the army, the only means by which they had been able to advance themselves in society. A Mazhabi Sikh platoon did replace Rajputs as the Indian Platoon of the Welch Regiment in 1933.\n\nThe Mazhabi Sikhs, together with the Ramdasia, were recruited to the Sikh Light Infantry regiment (SLI) after its formation in 1941. Despite unwillingness among some policy makers, the British had to abandon their traditional distinction between martial and non-martial races during the Second World War. This was necessitated by the need for more recruits than could be supplied by those communities upon which they usually relied, such as the Jat Sikhs, Dogras and Punjabi Musalmans. In addition, indiscipline among Jat Sikhs caused by their concerns regarding a post-war division of India was another reason to prefer recruitment of new classes. While recruitment from the pre-war martial classes was still pre-eminent, that from newly recognised classes such as the Mazhabis and Ramdasias became significant. Mazhabis were even recruited into units such as the 13th Frontier Force Rifles, which previously would not have contemplated them.\n\nWhen India became independent in 1947, the British Indian Army became the Indian Army. This, like its predecessor, relies on the martial race theory for much of its recruitment and thus there is a grossly disproportionate number of Sikhs within its ranks. The Mazhabi Sikhs and Ramdasias continued their service with the SLI in the new army. The SLI has served in almost all of the post-1947 conflicts involving India, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, the Hyderabad Police Action of 1948 and the Chinese aggression in 1962. It has also served in Sri Lanka, where the 1st, 7th, 13th and 14th Battalions have contributed towards peace-keeping.\n\nThe Mazhabi Sikh soldiers have a reputation for their loyalty and reliability. During Operation Blue Star in 1984, when the Indian Army entered the Golden Temple, Jat Sikh soldiers broke out in mutiny against their officers in the Sikh Regiment and Punjab regiments A total of 2,000 Sikh personnel took part in the mutinies. In the most sensational case 1,400 mainly Jat Sikhs deserted after killing their commanding officer and armed themselves. A significant number of those were also new recruits who were incited easily into mutiny and some were forced at gun point to take part in the mutinies. Despite that, the Indian Army officers were correct when they expressed confidence to journalists that the Mazhabi Sikhs of the Sikh Light Infantry would not mutiny.\n\nIn Punjab, Sikh militants had stepped up their attacks on law enforcement as well as civilians, including minority groups. The Punjab had now reached a state of emergency and Director General of Police, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, responded by raising Mazhabi Sikhs as \"Special Police Officers\". This tactic was designed both for community protection and to dull any incentive for Mazhabis to join with the militants, although in fact Mazhabis had often been victims of attacks by those people. Their loyalty was to the government and was never questioned. Mostly unemployed people, they were provided with guns by the state and were literally given a licence to kill. Gill received heavy criticism for the brutality and ruthlessness of his tactics but the Sikh militants were neutralised. A large number of these special police officers were said to have been used during the February 1992 elections. An open season was declared on Sikh terrorists and the police were able to use whatever means deemed necessary to achieve victory. Major Sikh militant leaders were targeted, and many did not survive.\n\nMost of them live in separate clusters in villages. As the 19th century drew to a close, untouchables such as the Mazhabis were still denied equal access to the gurdwara (places of worship) by their fellow Sikhs and during the early years of the 20th century members of the Arya Samaj tried to capitalise on this in their attempts to reconvert those groups to Hinduism. In spite of Sikhism's egalitarian tenets, the Singh Sabha movement also viewed them as being inferior, despite initially being established in 1873 in part with the aim of eradicating untouchability.\n\nThe British Raj system of land allocation in the Punjab also worked against the Mazhabis. As land in the new canal colonies was made available for cultivation, the Raj allocated it to people on the basis of the scale of existing landholdings, which meant that dominant landholding communities such as the Jats received most of the that became available between 1885–1940 while outcastes were excluded entirely.\n\nDuring the numerous discussions, conferences and proposals that preceded Indian independence, the Mazhabis sought to obtain an autonomous region within partitioned Punjab which they proposed to be called \"Mazbhistan\". This was one of many instances reflecting the lack of coherence among adherents of Sikhism at that time.\n\nMany Jat Sikhs continue to look down upon the Mazhabis, and they are also considered to be of lower status by the other Dalit communities, being the Ramdasia and Ravidasia. The internal division between Jat Sikh and Mazhabi still broadly follows the economic distinction between farmer and landless labourer. It is land-ownership rather than varna's stress on occupational status that defines discrimination within the Sikh communities of the Punjab, and Ronki Ram notes that the nature of untouchability itself in Punjab differs from the rest of India because it is \"related more to prejudice than pollution\". Many Mazhabi are still exploited in low-status jobs, they are often forced to live in less desirable areas of villages, cannot use the gurdwaras frequented by higher-caste Sikhs and must use special cremation grounds.\n\nThe outcome of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) elections in December 1954 favoured Punjabi Suba, a Jat Sikh-dominated movement. Akali Dal, a religio-political party founded in 1920 and dominated by Jat Sikhs, won all 111 seats that it contested and Khalsa Dal – a new party created with government support – managing to win only three of the 132 in which it put forward a candidate. The campaign saw the Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh, who were both opposed to Punjabi Suba and believed in Hindu supremacy, stressing a fear of Sikh domination. They encouraged Hindu Punjabis to lie by claiming Hindi to be their first language even when it was almost always in fact Punjabi. This attempt to cause a division along religious lines had the tacit support of the government and its impact echoed down the years. In 2005, 56 expelled employees of the SGPC abandoned Sikhism and alleged that they were being discriminated against because they were Mazhabis.\n\nAccording to a report published in \"The Tribune\" on 16 March 1966, a spokesperson for the Federation of Mazhabi Sikhs stated that \"the Sikh Scheduled Castes had been reduced to a position of mere serfs by the Sikh landlords who would literally crush the Mazhabi Sikhs if Punjabi Suba was formed.\" The federation offered support for Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh in opposition to the Punjabi Suba.\n\nAlthough Sikh leaders recognise the contribution of the Mazhabis and Ravidasias to the community and have tried to include them in their organisations, not least because of the size of their population, both groups still feel alienated because of discrimination by higher-caste Sikhs, especially the Jats. It is because of this that they have turned to political parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party rather than maintaining past associations with Sikh politics through the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and SGPC.\n\nIn 2014, both the SAD and the Indian National Congress (INC) voiced their opposition to Christian Mazhabi people being reconverted to the Sikh faith in a ceremony organised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Parkash Singh Badal, then Chief Minister of Punjab and an SAD elder, said that such conversions are \"unfortunate and against the basic tenets of Sikhism as Sikh gurus sacrificed their lives resisting conversion\", while Amarinder Singh of the INC considered the move by the Hindutva-centric RSS to be \"forced conversion\". The RSS said that it was not sponsoring conversion to Hinduism but rather to Sikhism and that the SGPC had been lax in stemming the tide of poor Sikh families switching to Christianity. It was claimed by an RSS colleague, Ram Gopal, that 2,470 people had already been converted in the year prior to the controversy being commented upon and that the SGPC had initially supported the idea. There were also protests by Christians, who claimed that the conversions were an attempt by the RSS to drive a wedge between their religion and Sikhism where previously there had been a harmonious relationship.\n\nThe Government of India recognises Mazhabi Sikh as a Scheduled Caste as part of their official affirmative action program.\n\nBetween 30,000-40,000 Mazhabi Sikhs were reported to be congregated at Govindghar in an attempt to reach India during the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. This was one of many examples of the mass migrations that took place across the border in both directions as communities found themselves in the midst of violence driven by religious differences.\n\n, there were 2,633,921 Mazhabis in the Indian state of Punjab, of whom 2,562,761 declared themselves to be Sikh, 71,000 as Hindu and 160 as Buddhists. The total Scheduled Caste population of the state was 8,860,179. At that time, there were 158,698 Mazhabis in Rajasthan, comprising 11,582 Hindus, 147,108 Sikhs and 8 Buddhists. 141,681 lived in Haryana (11,485 Hindu, 130,162 Sikh and 34 Buddhists), 460 resided in Himachal Pradesh, 3,166 in Chandigarh, 2,829 in Delhi NCT, 6,038 in Uttarakhand, and 14,192 in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

Passed by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled bishops, this declaration was promulgated on 28 October 1965, by Pope Paul VI. Pope John XXIII had originally conceived it as an expression of the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jews. Over the course of several substantial revisions, the focus of the document was broadened to address relationships with several faiths. Opposition from conservative elements in the Church was overcome and support gained from Jewish organisations.\n\nThe first draft, entitled \"Decretum de Iudaeis\" (\"Decree on the Jews\"), was completed in November 1961, approximately fourteen months after Pope John XXIII tasked Cardinal Augustin Bea, a Jesuit and biblical scholar, with its composition. This text was not submitted to the Council, which opened on 11 October 1962. It read:\nThe first draft was then reworked as a supplementary fourth chapter of a \"Decree on Ecumenism\". Debate on this document, \"On the Attitude of Catholics Toward Non-Christians and Especially Toward Jews\", although distributed to the Council's Second Session on 8 November 1963, was postponed until the Third Session. This draft was notable for addressing the \"deicide\" charge against the Jews directly, saying \"it is wrong to call them an accursed people, ... or a deicidal people\". The text read:\n\nThe third draft, \"On the Jews and Non-Christians\", took the form of an appendix to the \"Schema on Ecumenism\". It deleted the word \"deicidal\" and added material on other religions, especially Muslims. In presenting the document to the Council on 28 September 1964, Cardinal Bea encouraged the Council Fathers to strengthen it. They discussed this draft on 28 and 29 September.\n\nThe publicly recorded debate on the third draft took place on 28 September 1964 and on the following days. Since the Vatican Council archives are still \"substantially inaccessible\", it is difficult to measure the impact of the public and the behind-the-scenes initiatives. Participants included Cardinals Joseph Ritter of St. Louis, Richard Cushing of Boston, Albert Meyer of Chicago, and Lawrence Shehan of Baltimore, Lercaro of Bologne, Liénart of Lille, König of Vienna, and Léger of Montreal, and Franjo Šeper of Zagreb, as well as a number of lesser prelates.\n\nThe language suggested by Cardinal Cushing of Boston was echoed in the final version the Council approved:\n\nJohn Carmel Heenan of Westminster said:\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of San Antonio Stephen Leven objected to text's failure to address the charge of deicide, which some thought \"unworthy of a Conciliar document\". He said: \"we have to deal here with not with a philosophical entity, but with an infamous abuse that was invented by Christians for the sole purpose of bringing shame and disgrace upon Jews. For hundreds of years, and even in our own century, Christians have flung the word 'deicide' into the faces of Jews in order to justify all kinds of excesses, even murder. ... We must remove this word from the vocabulary of Christians, so that it can never again be turned against the Jews.\"\n\nCardinal Meyer said: \"Following the teaching of Scripture, St. Thomas makes two points: [1] No single individual Jew of Christ's time was subjectively guilty of deicide, since all acted in ignorance of Christ's divinity. This must be said explicitly in our text. [2] The bulk of Jews should be acquitted of any formal guilt because they followed their leaders out of ignorance. As proof of this St. Thomas refers to St. Peter: 'I know that you acted in ignorance' (Ac 3:17). Finally it must be also said where the real guilt of the torment of Christ lies: 'He died for us and for our salvation'.\"\n\nArchbishop Patrick O'Boyle of Washington said: \"The word 'conversion' awakens in the hearts of Jews memories of persecutions, sufferings, and the forced denials of all truths that a Jew loves with sincerity and good faith. So a Jew, when he hears that Catholics are seeking to further his 'conversion', thinks of the reintroduction of that type of proselytism that for centuries assaulted his rights and personal dignity. ... It would be better if we were to express our hope for the turning of the Jews [to Christ] in such a way that they, too, can perceive with respect its honesty and our humble recognition that the mystery of salvation does not depend on us, but upon God's transcendent act.\" He offered the following text: \"Furthermore, it is worthy of remembrance that the union of the Jewish and Christian people is part of Christian Hope. With Unshaken faith and deep longing the Church awaits that union which God will bring about in His own time and in a way still hidden in His wisdom.\"\n\nCardinal Joseph Ritter of St. Louis suggested the following text:\nThe critical paragraphs read: \n\n\nThe Declaration begins by describing the unity of the origin of all people, and the fact that they all return to God; hence their final goal is also one. It describes the eternal questions which have dogged men since the beginning, and how the various religious traditions have tried to answer them.\n\nIt mentions some of the answers that some Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other faiths have suggested for such philosophical questions. It notes the willingness of the Catholic Church to accept some truths present in other religions in so much as they reflect Catholic teaching and may lead souls to Christ.\n\nPart three goes on to say that the Catholic Church regards the Muslims with esteem, and then continues by describing some of the things Islam has in common with Christianity and Catholicism: worship of One God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, Merciful and Omnipotent, Who has spoken to men; the Muslims' respect for Abraham and Mary, and the great respect they have for Jesus, whom they consider to be a Prophet and not God. The synod urged all Catholics and Muslims to forget the hostilities and differences of the past and to work together for mutual understanding and benefit.\n\nPart four speaks of the bond that ties the people of the 'New Covenant' (Christians) to Abraham's stock (Jews). It states that even though some Jewish authorities and those who followed them called for Jesus' death, the blame for this cannot be laid at the door of all those Jews present at that time, nor can the Jews in our time be held as guilty, thus repudiating an indiscriminate charge of Jewish deicide; 'the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God'. The Declaration also decries all displays of antisemitism made at any time by anyone.\n\nThe fifth part states that all men are created in God's image, and that it is contrary to the mind of Christ to discriminate against, show hatred towards or harass any person or people on the basis of colour, race, religion, and condition of life.\n\n\"Nostra aetate\" was one of Vatican II's three declarations, the other documents consisting of nine decrees and four constitutions. It was the shortest of the documents and contained few, if any, references to the debates and the rationale that had gone into its making; therefore, the changes to be brought about by the declaration on the Church's Relations with non-Christian Religions, \"Nostra aetate\", carried implications not fully appreciated at the time.\n\nTo flesh out these implications and ramifications, the Vatican's Commission on Interrelegious Relations with the Jews issued its \"Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate\" in late 1974.\n\nThis was followed by that same body's \"Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in the Teaching and Catechesis of the Roman Catholic Church\" in 1985. These developments were paralleled by accompanying statements from the U.S. bishops.\n\nThe above-referenced statements by the Vatican's Commission for Interreligious Relations with the Jews, as well as other developments, including the establishment of more than two dozen centers for Christian-Jewish understanding at Catholic institutions of higher learning in the United States along with the participation by rabbis in seminarian formation training, demonstrate how the church has embraced \"Nostra aetate\".\n\nThe significance of \"Nostra aetate\" as a new starting point in the Church's relations with Judaism, in light of the foregoing, can be appreciated from the vantage point of the passage of forty years. The U.S. Congress passed a resolution acknowledging \"Nostra aetate\" at forty, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. also noted this anniversary. This is in addition to the marking of the occasion at the Vatican's Gregorian University itself and at major centers of Christian–Jewish understanding around the United States.\n\nThe Vatican's Commission for Religious Relations with Jews released a new document exploring the unresolved theological questions at the heart of Christian–Jewish dialogue. Entitled \"The Gifts and Calling of God are Irrevocable\", it marked the 50th anniversary of the ground-breaking declaration \"Nostra Aetate\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12275093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12275093", "title": "Ordeal of the bitter water", "text": "Ordeal of the bitter water\n\nA Sotah ( / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible. The term \"Sotah\" itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is Mishnaic Hebrew based on the verse \"if she has strayed\" (verb: שטה \"satah\") in Numbers 5:12. The process was a trial by ordeal administered to the wife whose husband suspected her of adultery but who had no witnesses to make a formal case (). The ordeal is further explained in the Talmud, in the eponymous seventh tractate of \"Nashim\".\n\nThe account of the ordeal of bitter water given in the Book of Numbers is as follows:\n\nAccording to the Mishnah, it was the practice for the woman to first be brought to the Sanhedrin, before being subjected to the ordeal. Repeated attempts would be made to persuade the women to confess, including multiple suggestions to her of possible mitigating factors; if she confessed, the ordeal was not required.\n\nThe regulations require that the ordeal take place when the woman is brought to an Israelite priest, or when she is brought \"before God\". The Mishnah reports that, in the time of the Second Temple, she was taken to the East Gate of the Temple, in front of the Nikanor gate.\n\nThe woman is required by the Biblical passage to have loosened hair during the ritual; this is often taken to be a symbol of the woman's supposed shame, but according to Josephus, it was merely the standard behaviour for anyone accused of any crime, when they appeared before the Sanhedrin. The Mishnah also states that the garment she was wearing was ripped to expose her heart. A rope was tied above her breasts so that her clothes did not completely fall off. The Mishnah, however, argues that the clothing on the woman's upper body was also stripped away, leaving her bare-breasted.\n\nThis trial consisted of the wife having to drink a specific potion administered by the priest. The text does not specify the amount of time needed for the potion to take effect; 19th century scholars suspected it was probably intended to have a fairly immediate effect. The Mishnah mentions there could also be a suspension of the ordeal for one, two or three years, if she has an acquittal. Maimonides records the traditional Rabbinical view: \"Her belly swells first and then her thigh ruptures and she dies\". Others maintain that since the word \"thigh\" is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for various reproductive organs, in this case it may mean the uterus, the placenta or an embryo, and the woman would survive.\n\nNahmanides points out that of all the 613 commandments, it is only the \"sotah\" law that requires God's specific co-operation to make it work. The bitter waters can only be effective miraculously.\n\nThe text specifies that the potion should be made from water and dust; in the masoretic text, the water used for the potion must be \"holy water\", and the Targum interprets it as water from the \"Molten Sea\", but the Septuagint instead requires \"running water\". The passage argues that the curse was washed into the water; it is thought that this idea derives from a belief that the words of a curse exist in their own right. Others argue that the curse is a euphemism for a miscarriage or infertility.\n\nThe potion also had to be mixed in an earthenware vessel; this may have been because the potion was regarded as a taboo which could be spread by contact, and therefore also made the vessel taboo, necessitating its subsequent destruction (as do the biblical rules concerning taboo animals, for any earthenware vessels into which such animals fall). However, the Talmud and Rashi explain that this vessel is chosen to contrast the woman's predicament with her behavior. She gave the adulterer to drink choice wine in valuable goblets; therefore, let her drink bitter water in a worthless clay vessel.\n\nMaimonides further writes: \"When she dies, the adulterer because of whom she was compelled to drink will also die, wherever he is located. The same phenomena, the swelling of the belly and the rupture of the thigh, will also occur to him. All the above applies provided her husband never engaged in forbidden sexual relations in his life. If, however, her husband ever engaged in forbidden relations, the [bitter] waters do not check [the fidelity of] his wife.\"\n\nThe husband was required to make a sacrifice to God, as part of the ritual, probably due to a general principle that no one should seek answers from God without giving something in return. This offering is required to be placed in the wife's hands, and is literally described as \"her offering for her\"; scholars think that it is the man's offering, in relation to the ordeal of his wife, and that her holding of it is merely symbolic of this.\n\nThe offering specified is one tenth of an ephah of barley meal, unaccompanied by oil or frankincense; this is the cheaper type of flour, unlike the flour specified for all other biblical sacrifices. The specification is now thought to be a rare survival of an earlier period, in which there was no restriction on the types of flour which could be used for sacrifices, although the Mishnah argues that it was a reference to the \"bestial\" nature of adultery, coarse flour being the \"food of beasts\".\n\nIf the woman was unharmed by the bitter water, the rules regard her as innocent of the accusation. The account in the Book of Numbers states that the man shall be \"free from blame\" (5:26). This is not to be confused with the Deuteronomic Code, which pertains to when a man accuses his wife of pre-marital sex; when accusation is disproven, the husband is to be fined, and is no longer to have the right of divorcing the wife () There is more reason to fine and whip the man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex than the husband of the sotah woman. The man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex has no proof about his wife when he accuses her, whereas by a Sotah woman, the husband initially warned her not to seclude herself with a particular man, which she thereafter did. Therefore, whether she is innocent of the accusation of adultery or not, she still has caused reasonable suspicion in the eyes of her husband.\n\nThe rabbinical interpretation of is that when a woman accused of adultery who was innocent drinks the bitter water, even if she was previously unable to conceive, she will now conceive and give birth to a male.\n\nAccording to Mishnah, \"Sotah\", 9: the practice was abolished some time during the first century CE under the leadership of Yohanan Ben Zakkai. But even if it had not been abolished, the rite would have sunk into abeyance with the fall of the Temple (in approximately the year 70 CE), because, according to the Law, the ceremony could not be performed elsewhere. Explanations in rabbinical literature vary concerning cessation of the practice. Yohanan Ben Zakkai stated:\n\nRabbi Hanina of Sura said in Talmud \"Sotah\": \nAlthough, as with later Judaism, the actual ordeal was not practiced in Christianity it was referenced by Christian writers through the ages in relation to both the subject of adultery, and also the wider practice of trial by ordeal. Additionally some early Christian legends, such as the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, embroider the life of Mary, mother of Jesus with accounts including Mary (and even Joseph) undergoing a version of the ordeal.\n\nSeveral commentaries on the Bible maintain that the ordeal is to be applied in the case of a woman who has become pregnant, allegedly by her lover.\n\nAlthough a pregnancy on its own does not exclude the possibility that a married woman may have become pregnant to her lawful husband, presumably pregnancy was an indication of adultery if the husband claimed (truthfully or not) that there had been no circumstance under which she could have been impregnated by him. However, presuming the husband is being truthful as to his non-participation in conception, pregnancy due to non-consensual rape (as opposed to consensual adultery) is not taken into consideration.\n\nOne reading is that the ordeal results in a prolapsed uterus if she is guilty. Some interpretations of the ordeal describe the bitter potion as an abortifacient, which induces a purposeful abortion or miscarriage if the woman is pregnant with a child which her husband alleges is another man’s. If the fetus aborts as a result of the ordeal, this presumably confirms her guilt of adultery, otherwise her innocence is presumed if the fetus does not abort.\n\nThe text appears to suggest first that the offering should occur before the ordeal, () and then that it should occur after it. ()\n\nDue of the awkwardness of the idea that the wife has to drink the potion twice, secular textual scholars argue that either the first drinking must be a later addition to the text, or that the whole account of the ordeal must be spliced together from two earlier descriptions.\n\nNoting that there are two descriptions of the location for the ritual (in the presence of a priest, and \"before Yahweh\",) and two occasions on which the punishment for the woman is mentioned, the division into two earlier documents, first suggested by Bernhard Stade is typically as follows: \n\nOther secular Biblical scholars think that the ordeal is itself a fusion of two earlier rituals (pre-dating the original priestly text), one using water, and the other dust. The use of dust might be connected to necromancy. In other historic semitic cultures there are many instances in which \"holy water\" was regarded as taboo, and therefore that contact with it, or its consumption, was dangerous.\n\nAccording to scholars such as Helena Zlotnick, after the ordeal of bitter water was no longer practiced it remained a reference point in the search for replacements for the test of adultery.\n\nTrials by ordeal are found in other societies of the ancient Near East such as in the Laws of Hammurabi (§132).\n\nHistoric Muslim Arabic culture similarly had an adultery ordeal, although in scientific terms, compared to the Israelite ritual it relied more on nausea, than on directly poisoning the woman. In this Arabic ritual, the woman simply took oaths at Mecca attesting to her innocence, and asking the divinity to cause her to have a miscarriage/abortion, should she be lying; but, on the way to Mecca, she would be forced to travel on a camel, between two bags of dung.\n\nOrdeals involving the risk of harm, including potential injury resulting from the drinking of certain potions, were common in antiquity; in parts of Europe, their judicial use even lasted until the late Middle Ages. Such ordeals were once believed to result in a direct decision by a deity, about the guilt or innocence of the party/parties undertaking the ordeal; typically divine intervention was believed to prevent the innocent being harmed, or to ensure that the guilty were, although in the case of some – witch ducking, for example – the innocent were more likely to come to harm.\n\n\n"}

Proponents of the movement believe that Christianity, and especially evangelicalism, has been exploited by both right-wing and left-wing political movements and has become too partisan and politicized. As a response this non-profit organization endeavors to create an evangelical movement that focuses on the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly in regard to social issues. The two most prominent figures associated with the movement are Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.\n\n\"Red-Letter\" refers to New Testament verses and parts of verses printed in red ink, to indicate the words attributed to Jesus without the use of quotations (see Red letter edition). While many Christians throughout church history have defined themselves as emphasizing the teachings of Jesus, this modern movement was initiated by Wallis and Campolo, who felt the religious right spend too much time on two issues: abortion and homosexuality. They believe Christians should be paying attention to Jesus words and example by promoting biblical values such as peace, building strong families, the elimination of poverty, and other important social justice issues. They believe that these are the issues that Jesus spoke of directly, and therefore these issues should be social and political priorities. Other issues such as the question of homosexuality and abortion are viewed as important but over-emphasized by both liberals and conservatives.\n\nAccording to Campolo, \"The purpose of this gathering was not to create a religious left movement to challenge the religious right, but to jump-start a religious movement that will transcend partisan politics.\" Campolo has released a book to help explain this, called \"Red Letter Christians, A Citizen's Guide to Faith and Politics\" (Regal Books, February 2008).\n\n"}

There is no Christian community living in Somalia. Additionally, some ethnic minorities in the southern part of the country practice traditional faiths.\n\nMost residents of Somalia are Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence, although some are adherents of the Shia Muslim denomination. Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, is also well-established, with many local \"jama'a\" (\"zawiya\") or congregations of the various \"tariiqa\" or Sufi orders.\n\nArticle 2 of the Provisional Constitution of Somalia defines Islam as the state religion of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and Islamic sharia as the basic source for national legislation. It also stipulates that no law that is inconsistent with the basic tenets of Shari'a can be enacted. Article 11 guarantees equal rights and freedom from persecution for all citizens before the law regardless of religion. Additionally, Article 17 protects freedom of religion.\n\nIslam entered the region very early on, shortly after the hijra. Zeila's two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the city. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties, who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the Benadir region to the south.\n\nIn addition, the Somali community has produced numerous important Islamic figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and well beyond. Among these Islamic scholars is the 14th century Somali theologian and jurist Uthman bin Ali Zayla'i of Zeila, who wrote the single most authoritative text on the Hanafi school of Islam, consisting of four volumes known as the \"Tabayin al-Haqa’iq li Sharh Kanz al-Daqa’iq\".\n\nChristianity is a minority religion in Somalia, with no more than 1,000 practitioners (about 0.01% of the population). According to estimates of the Diocese of Mogadishu (the territory of which coincides with the country) there were only about 100 Catholic practitioners in Somalia in 2004.\n\nIn 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories, with only about 100–200 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate. There were also no known Catholic missions in Italian Somaliland during the same period. In the 1970s, during the reign of Somalia's then Marxist government, church-run schools were closed and missionaries sent home. There has been no archbishop in the country since 1989, and the cathedral in Mogadishu was severely damaged during the civil war.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, less than 0.1% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of traditional or folk religions. These mainly consisted of some non-Somali ethnic minority groups in the southern parts of the country, who practice animism. In the case of the Bantu, these religious traditions were inherited from their ancestors in Southeast Africa, and include the practice of possession dances and the use of magic and curses.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, less than 0.1% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of Hinduism, Buddhism, or unaffiliated with any religion.\n\n"}

Less than half of the book is the written journal of Rodrigues, while the other half of the book is written either in the third person, or in the letters of others associated with the narrative. The novel relates the trials of Christians and the increasing hardship suffered by Rodrigues.\n\nRodrigues and his companion Francisco Garupe (also a Jesuit priest) arrive in Japan in 1639. There they find the local Christian population driven underground. To ferret out hidden Christians, security officials force suspected Christians to trample on a \"fumi-e\", a carved image of Christ. Those who refuse are imprisoned and killed by \"anazuri\" (穴吊り), which is by being hung upside down over a pit and slowly bled.\n\nRodrigues and Garupe are eventually captured and forced to swim as Japanese Christians lay down their lives for the faith. There is no glory in these martyrdoms, as Rodrigues had always imagined – only brutality and cruelty. Prior to the arrival of Rodrigues, the authorities had been attempting to force priests to renounce their faith by torturing them. Beginning with Ferreira, they torture other Christians as the priests look on, telling the priests that all they must do is renounce their faith in order to end the suffering of their flock.\n\nRodrigues' journal depicts his struggles: he understands suffering for the sake of one's own faith; but he struggles over whether it is self-centered and unmerciful to refuse to recant when doing so will end another's suffering. At the climactic moment, Rodrigues hears the moans of those who have recanted but are to remain in the pit until he tramples the image of Christ. As Rodrigues looks upon a \"fumi-e\", Christ breaks his silence: \"You may trample. You may trample. I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. You may trample. It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain that I carried my cross.\" Rodrigues puts his foot on the \"fumi-e\".\n\nAn official tells Rodrigues, \"Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mudswamp, Japan.\"\n\n\"Silence\" received the Tanizaki Prize for the year's best full-length literature. It has also been the subject of extensive analysis. In a review published by the New Yorker, John Updike called \"Silence\" \"a remarkable work, a sombre, delicate, and startlingly empathetic study of a young Portuguese missionary during the relentless persecution of the Japanese Christians in the early seventeenth century.\" William Cavanaugh highlights the novel's \"deep moral ambiguity\" due to the depiction of a God who \"has chosen not to eliminate suffering, but to suffer with humanity.\"\n\n\"Silence\" was not immediately successful among Japanese Catholics, who were among some of the novel's harshest critics. Instead, the novel's popularity was boosted by \"left-wing college students\" who saw a connection between the plight of Japanese Marxists in the circumstances of Rodrigues. The novel was notably compared to Graham Greene's \"The Power and the Glory\", leading Endo to be referred to as \"the Graham Greene of Japan.\"\n\nBesides Endo's stage version, \"The Golden Country\", there have been several adaptions.\n\nMasahiro Shinoda directed the 1971 film \"Silence\", an adaptation from the novel.\n\nIt was re-adapted by João Mário Grilo as \"The Eyes of Asia\" in 1996. \n\nIn 2016, the novel was adapted into a film, also named \"Silence\", directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciarán Hinds. The film premiered at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome on November 29, 2016.\n\nComposer and poet Teizo Matsumura wrote the libretto and music for an opera with the same title, which was premiered at the New National Theatre in Tokyo in 2000.

The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: \"taisha-zukuri\", \"shinmei-zukuri\" and \"sumiyoshi-zukuri\". They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha respectively and date to before 552. According to the tradition of \", the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.\n\nIzumo Taisha's \"honden\" over time has gone through profound changes that have greatly decreased its size and changed its structure. In its present form, it is a gabled building 2x2 \"ken\" in size, with an entrance on the gabled end (a characteristic called .

Smaller than Izumo Taisha's, it nonetheless has thick supporting pillars. It is deeper, has a higher floor, and differs significantly from Izumo Taisha's.

The best-known account of the Mass is that of James George Frazer in his 1890 omnibus \"The Golden Bough\"; Frazer's description, in turn, was taken nearly verbatim from a less well-known French book published in 1883, \"Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne\" (\"Fourteen Popular Superstitions of Gascony\"), by Jean-François Bladé (Fr: ).\n\nThe ritual was a form of black mass, a parody of the Roman Catholic Mass, and is notable for its unusual parody of the Eucharist as compared to other accounts of Black Masses. It was said to be employed as a method by which a wronged party could supernaturally avenge himself. Bladé's informant indicated that fear of the Mass was still prevalent at the time of their interview.\n\nAccording to the recorded account, the mass could only be said in a ruined or deserted church. At precisely the first stroke of 11 o’clock the corrupt priest, with only his lover as attendant, would begin to recite the mass backwards, being sure to finish at precisely the last stroke of midnight. Among other details intended to parody the normal practice of the Mass, the host used would be triangular and black, rather than round and white, with three points instead of the usual four; the priest would not consecrate wine but instead drink water from a well into which an unbaptized infant had been thrown. Bladé's informant also reported that the sign of the cross would be made by the priest with his left foot on the ground before him. At the very end the officiant would pronounce the name of a victim who, it was believed, would soon simply waste away and die, with no cause that could be understood by medicine.\n\nAleister Crowley wrote a short story about the Mass, entitled \"The Mass of Saint-Sécaire\", in his \"Golden Bough\"-inspired series \"Golden Twigs\". First published in February 1918 in \"The International\", it uses a working of the Mass of Saint-Sécaire to illustrate an aspect of Crowley's theory of magical effects. The Mass is also used as the basis of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater episode The Secret Doctrine (first aired June 20, 1974).\n\n"}

{"id": "337012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337012", "title": "Vision Serpent", "text": "Vision Serpent\n\nThe Vision Serpent is an important creature in Pre-Columbian Maya mythology, although the term itself is now slowly becoming outdated.\n\nThe serpent was a very important social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding of their skin made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal.\n\nThey were so revered, that one of the main Mesoamerican deities, Quetzalcoatl, was represented as a feathered serpent. The name means \"beautiful serpent\" (From Nahuatl, 'Quetzalli' means beautiful and 'coatl' meaning snake or serpent.).\n\nThe Vision Serpent is thought to be the most important of the Maya serpents. \"It was usually bearded and had a rounded snout. It was also often depicted as having two heads or with the spirit of a god or ancestor emerging from its jaws.\" During Maya bloodletting rituals, participants would experience visions in which they communicated with the ancestors or gods. These visions took the form of a giant serpent \"which served as a gateway to the spirit realm.\" The ancestor or god who was being contacted was depicted as emerging from the serpent's mouth. The vision serpent thus came to be the method in which ancestors or Gods manifested themselves to the Maya. Thus for them, the Vision Serpent was a direct link between the spirit realm of the gods and the physical world.\n\nThe Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions, and lies at the\ncenter of the world as they conceived it. \"It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power.\"\n\nThe Vision Serpent is prevalent in bloodletting ceremonies, in Maya religious practices, Maya jewelry, pottery and their architecture.\n\nMany have attempted to explain the manifestation of the Vision Serpent in association with Maya bloodletting. One conclusion is \"that massive blood loss causes the brain to release an abundance of natural endorphins, which are chemically related to opiates. As the body goes into shock, a hallucinatory vision occurs.\" Once the actual bloodletting was over, the blood soaked ceremonial papers were burned, releasing a column of smoke. The smoke provided the perfect medium for the Vision Serpent to appear. Every major political or religious event involved bloodletting because it provided a medium by which the gods could be called upon to witness and actually participate in the ceremony. Sometimes the spirits of ancestors were also called upon to give guidance. The Hauberg Stela (A. D. 199) from the Maya Lowlands \"is one of the first dated monuments that depict the Vision Serpent's connection to bloodletting\". \n\nLintel 25 depicts one of the bloodletting rituals. \"One of Shield Jaguar's wives, is seen gazing up towards an enormous bicephalous Vision Serpent. In her left hand, she holds a bowl containing a stingray spine, an obsidian lancet, and papers spattered with blood. The Vision Serpent appears to be emanating from the bowl. From the jaws of the Vision Serpent, spews forth an ancestral Tlaloc warrior complete with spear and shield\".\n\nLintel 17 refers to \"Bird Jaguars as Blood Lord of Yaxchilan\" and shows him preparing to draw blood from his penis with a stingray spine. Opposite Bird Jaguar is Lady Balam-Ix, who proceeds to pass coarse rope through a gouge in her tongue. The blood is being collected in the vessel near Bird Jaguar's feet. The Vision Serpent's mouth is green and, the trickles of blood characteristic of bloodletting are red\".\n\nLintel 15 depicts the appearance of this Vision Serpent. \"The serpent can be seen rising out of the bowl with trickles of blood along a column of blood scrolls. This lintel shows the queen of Yaxchilan involved in a visionary experience following an elaborate bloodletting ceremony. She holds the ritual paraphernalia in her arms while the vision serpent rises from a bowl of blood stained paper.\"\n\nThere was a Vision Serpent named Och-Kan, lord of Kalak'mul.\n\nOne of the most common rituals associated with the Vision serpent involved invoking ancestral spirits. Especially during coronation rites, the kings would contact the spirits for guidance and blessings. It is the Vision Serpent who provides the medium for contacting these deities.\n\nIt is believed that Lord Pakal's sarcophagus lid, which was located at Palenque, is probably “the single most comprehensive image which relates the Vision Serpent to Maya religion.” It depicts the death of Pakal and his descent into the Underworld. “The bicepalous serpent bar is placed horizontally on the World Tree and is the conduit for this transition. In the same way that the Vision Serpent represents a conduit between the physical world and the spirit realm of the ancestors, this bicephalous serpent bar represents a conduit between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead.” \n\nA piece of Maya jewelry depicts an “anthropomorphic, bicephalous serpent.” It is believed to have been worn during a bloodletting ceremony. It clearly shows the arrival of an ancestor from the spirit realm.\n\nThe portrayal of the Vision Serpent was very prevalent in Maya pottery. Vessels used during bloodletting ceremonies, depict the Vision serpent. The vessels below are excellent examples. They are carved in stone and are “some of the earliest depiction of Vision Serpent iconography. Blood spews forth from the open jaws of the front head. Although the rear is not physically attached, it sits just above the serpent's tail and also represents blood”.\n\nThe Vision Serpent also finds a place in Maya architecture and is especially prominent in the decoration of pillars on the interior and exterior of Maya temples.\n\n”In the palace at Labna, serpents adorn the corners of the principle facade. Characteristic of the Vision Serpent, there appears to be either an anthropomorphic deity or the spirit of an ancestor emanating from the gaping jaws of the serpent's mouth”.\n\nRemnants of the Vision Serpent have survived until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, Belize, that the Q'eqchi' Maya still performed a ritual very similar to the vision quest of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new shaman for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the knowledge that is needed to become a powerful shaman.\n\n"}

{"id": "44406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44406", "title": "Zoroaster", "text": "Zoroaster\n\nZoroaster (, ; \"Zōroastrēs\"), (Persian: زرتشت pronounced as Zartusht) also known as Zarathustra (, ; \"Zaraθuštra\"), Zarathushtra Spitama, or Ashu Zarathushtra, was an ancient Persian prophet, spiritual leader and ethical philosopher who taught a spiritual philosophy of self-realization and realization of the Divine. His teachings challenged the existing traditions of the Indo-Iranian religion and later developed into the religion of Mazdayasna or Zoroastrianism. He inaugurated a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in Ancient Persia. He was a native speaker of Old Avestan and lived in the eastern part of the Iranian Plateau, but his exact birthplace is uncertain.\n\nThere is no scholarly consensus on when he lived. However, approximating using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence allows for dating to somewhere in the second millennium BCE. This is done by estimating the period in which the Old Avestan language (as well as the earlier Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Iranian languages and the related Vedic Sanskrit) were spoken, the period in which the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion was practiced, and correlation between the burial practice described in the Gathas with the archeological Yaz culture. However, other scholars still date him in the 7th and 6th century BCE as a near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great and Darius I. Zoroastrianism eventually became the official religion of Ancient Persia and its distant subdivisions from the 6th century BCE to the 7th century CE. Zoroaster is credited with authorship of the Gathas as well as the Yasna Haptanghaiti, hymns composed in his native dialect, Old Avestan, and which comprise the core of Zoroastrian thinking. Most of his life is known from these texts. By any modern standard of historiography, no evidence can place him into a fixed period, and the historicization surrounding him may be a part of a trend from before the 10th century that historicizes legends and myths.\n\nZoroaster's name in his native language, Avestan, was probably \"Zaraϑuštra\". His English name, \"Zoroaster\", derives from a later (5th century BCE) Greek transcription, \"Zōroastrēs\" (), as used in Xanthus's \"Lydiaca\" (Fragment 32) and in Plato's \"First Alcibiades\" (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin \"\" and, in later Greek orthographies, as Ζωροάστρις \"Zōroastris\". The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan \"zaraϑ-\" with the Greek ζωρός \"zōros\" (literally \"undiluted\") and the Avestan \"-uštra\" with ἄστρον \"astron\" (\"star\").\n\nIn Avestan, \"Zaraϑuštra\" is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian \"*Zaratuštra-\"; The element half of the name (\"-uštra-\") is thought to be the Indo-Iranian root for \"camel\", with the entire name meaning \"he who can manage camels\".\nReconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the Middle Persian (300 BCE) \"Zardusht\", which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts—suggest that \"*Zaratuštra-\" might be a zero-grade form of \"*Zarantuštra-\".\nSubject then to whether \"Zaraϑuštra\" derives from \"*Zarantuštra-\" or from \"*Zaratuštra-\", several interpretations have been proposed.\n\nIf \"Zarantuštra\" is the original form, it may mean\n\"with old/aging camels\", related to Avestic \"zarant-\" (\"cf.\" Pashto \"zōṛ\" and Ossetian \"zœrond\", \"old\"; Middle Persian \"zāl\", \"old\"):\n\nThe interpretation of the \"-ϑ-\" () in Avestan \"zaraϑuštra\" was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the \"-ϑ-\" is an irregular development: As a rule, \"*zarat-\" (a first element that ends in a dental consonant) should have Avestan \"zarat-\" or \"zarat̰-\" as a development from it. Why this is not so for \"zaraϑuštra\" has not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan \"zaraϑuštra\" with its \"-ϑ-\" was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis. All present-day, Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the Middle Iranian variants of \"Zarϑošt\", which, in turn, all reflect Avestan's fricative \"-ϑ-\".\n\nIn Middle Persian, the name is 𐭦𐭫𐭲𐭥𐭱𐭲 \"Zardu(x)št\", in Parthian \"Zarhušt\", in Manichaean Middle Persian \"Zrdrwšt\", in Early New Persian \"Zardušt\", and in modern (New Persian), the name is زرتشت \"Zartosht\".\n\nThere is no consensus on the dating of Zoroaster, the Avesta gives no direct information about it, while historical sources are conflicting. Some scholars base their date reconstruction on the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and thus it is considered to have been some place in northeastern Iran and some time between 1500 and 500 BCE.\n\nSome scholars such as Mary Boyce (who dated Zoroaster to somewhere between 1700–1000 BCE) used linguistic and socio-cultural evidence to place Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BCE (or 1200 and 900 BCE). The basis of this theory is primarily proposed on linguistic similarities between the Old Avestan language of the Zoroastrian Gathas and the Sanskrit of the Rigveda (c. 1700–1100 BCE), a collection of early Vedic hymns. Both texts are considered to have a common archaic Indo-Iranian origin. The Gathas portray an ancient Stone-Bronze Age bipartite society of warrior-herdsmen and priests (compared to Bronze tripartite society; some conjecture that it depicts the Yaz culture), and thus it is implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could have been composed more than a few centuries apart. These scholars suggest that Zoroaster lived in an isolated tribe or composed the Gathas before the 1200–1000 BCE migration by the Iranians from the steppe to the Iranian Plateau. The shortfall of the argument is the vague comparison, and the archaic language of Gathas does not necessarily indicate time difference.\n\nOther scholars propose a period between 7th and 6th century, for example, c. 650–600 BCE or 559–522 BCE. The latest possible date is the mid 6th century, at the time of Achaemenid Empire's Darius I, or his predecessor Cyrus the Great. This date gains credence mainly on the thesis that certain figures must be based on historical facts, thus some have related the mythical Vishtaspa with Darius I's father Vishtaspa (or Hystaspes in Greek) with the account on Zoroaster's life. However, in the Avesta it should not be ignored that Vishtaspa's son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, Darius I would not neglect to include his patron-father in the Behistun Inscription. A different proposed conclusion is that Darius I's father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by Arsames.\n\nClassical scholarship in the 6th to 4th century BCE believed he existed six thousand years before Xerxes I invasion of Greece in 480 BCE (Xanthus, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Hermippus), which is a possible misunderstanding of the Zoroastrian four cycles of 3000 years i.e. 12,000 years. This belief is recorded by Diogenes Laërtius, and variant readings could place it six hundred years before Xerxes I, somewhere before 1000 BCE. However, Diogenes also mentions Hermodorus's belief that Zoroaster lived five thousand years before the Trojan War, which would mean he lived around 6200 BCE. The 10th-century Suda, provides a date of \"500 years before Plato\" in the late 10th century BCE. Pliny the Elder cited Eudoxus who also placed his death six thousand years before Plato, c. 6300 BCE. Other pseudo-historical constructions are those of Aristoxenus who recorded Zaratas the Chaldeaean to have taught Pythagoras in Babylon, or lived at the time of mythological Ninus and Semiramis. According to Pliny the Elder, there were two Zoroasters. The first lived thousands of years ago, while the second accompanied Xerxes I in the invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. Some scholars propose that the chronological calculation for Zoroaster was developed by Persian magi in the 4th century BCE, and as the early Greeks learned about him from the Achaemenids, this indicates they did not regard him as a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, but as a remote figure.\n\nSome later pseudo-historical and Zoroastrian sources (the \"Bundahishn\", which references a date \"258 years before Alexander\") place Zoroaster in the 6th century BCE, which coincided with the accounts by Ammianus Marcellinus from 4th century CE. The traditional Zoroastrian date originates in the period immediately following Alexander the Great's conquest of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BCE. The Seleucid rulers who gained power following Alexander's death instituted an \"Age of Alexander\" as the new calendrical epoch. This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an \"Age of Zoroaster\". To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by (erroneous, some even identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa) counting back the length of successive generations, until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived \"258 years before Alexander\". This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century Arabic and Pahlavi texts of Zoroastrian tradition, like the 10th century Al-Masudi who cited a prophecy from a lost Avestan book in which Zoroaster foretold the Empire's destruction in three hundred years, but the religion would last for a thousand years.\n\nThe birthplace of Zoroaster is also unknown, and the language of the Gathas is not similar to the proposed north-western and north-eastern regional dialects of Persia. It is also suggested that he was born in one of the two areas and later lived in the other area.\n\n\"Yasna\" 9 and 17 cite the Ditya River in Airyanem Vaējah (Middle Persian \"Ērān Wēj\") as Zoroaster's home and the scene of his first appearance. The Avesta (both Old and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian tribes such as the Medes, Persians, or even Parthians. The \"Farvardin Yasht\" refers to some Iranian peoples that are unknown in the Greek and Achaemenid sources about the 6th and 5th century BCE Eastern Iran. The \"Vendidad\" contain seventeen regional names, most of which are located in north-eastern and eastern Iran.\n\nHowever, in \"Yasna\" 59.18, the \"zaraϑuštrotema\", or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood, is said to reside in 'Ragha' (Badakhshan). In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, this 'Ragha' and with many other places appear as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is Arachosia), the \"Būndahišn\", or \"Primordial Creation,\" (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in Media (medieval Rai). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning \"plain, hillside.\"\n\nApart from these indications in Middle Persian sources that are open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zarathustra. There are many Greek accounts of Zarathustra, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median Zoroaster; Ctesias located him in Bactria, Diodorus Siculus placed him among Ariaspai (in Sistan), Cephalion and Justin suggest east of greater Iran whereas Pliny and Origen suggest west of Iran as his birthplace. Moreover, they have the suggestion that there has been more than one Zoroaster.\n\nOn the other hand, in post-Islamic sources Shahrastani (1086–1153) an Iranian writer originally from Shahristān, present-day Turkmenistan, proposed that Zoroaster's father was from Atropatene (also in Medea) and his mother was from Rey. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated from \"their\" homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there. Also Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical Persia consider Azerbaijan as the birthplace of Zarathustra.\n\nBy the late 20th century, most scholars had settled on an origin in eastern Greater Iran. Gnoli proposed Sistan, Baluchistan (though in a much wider scope than the present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for Bactria and Chorasmia; Khlopin suggests the Tedzen Delta in present-day Turkmenistan.\nSarianidi considered the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex region as \"the native land of the Zoroastrians and, probably, of Zoroaster himself.\" Boyce includes the steppes to the west from the Volga. The medieval \"from Media\" hypothesis is no longer taken seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and others.\n\nThe 2005 \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" article on the history of Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with \"while there is general agreement that he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative\".\n\nZoroaster is recorded as the son of Pourušaspa of the Spitaman or Spitamids (Avestan \"spit\" mean \"brilliant\" or \"white\"; some argue that Spitama was a remote progenitor) family, and Dugdōw, while his great-grandfather was Haēčataspa. All the names appear appropriate of the nomadic tradition, as his father's means \"possessing gray horses\" (with the word \"aspa\" meaning horse), while his mother's is \"milkmaid\". According to the tradition, he had four brothers, two older and two younger, whose names are given in much later Pahlavi work.\n\nHis training for the priesthood probably started very early, around seven years of age. He became a priest probably around the age of fifteen, and according to the Gathas, he gained knowledge from other teachers and personal experience from traveling when he left his parents at twenty years old. By the age of thirty, he experienced a revelation during a spring festival; on the river bank he saw a shining Being, who revealed himself as Vohu Manah (Good Purpose) and taught him about Ahura Mazda (Wise Spirit) and five other radiant figures. Zoroaster soon became aware of the existence of two primal Spirits, the second being Angra Mainyu (Hostile Spirit), with opposing concepts of Asha (truth) and Druj (lie). Thus he decided to spend his life teaching people to seek Asha. He received further revelations and saw a vision of the seven Amesha Spenta, and his teachings were collected in the Gathas and the Avesta.\n\nHe taught about free will, and opposed the use of the hallucinogenic Haoma plant in rituals, polytheism, over-ritualising religious ceremonies and animal sacrifices, as well an oppressive class system in Persia which earned him strong opposition among local authorities. Eventually, at the age of about forty-two, he received the patronage of queen Hutaosa and a ruler named Vishtaspa, an early adherent of Zoroastrianism (possibly from Bactria according to the Shahnameh). Zoroaster's teaching about individual judgment, Heaven and Hell, the resurrection of the body, the Last Judgment, and everlasting life for the reunited soul and body, among other things, became borrowings in the Abrahamic religions, but they lost the context of the original teaching.\nAccording to the tradition, he lived for many years after the Vishtaspa conversion, managed to establish a faithful community, and married three times. His first two wives bore him three sons and three daughters. His third wife, Hvōvi, was childless. Zoroaster died when he was 77 years and 40 days old. The later Pahlavi sources like Shahnameh, instead claim that an obscure conflict with Tuiryas people led to his death, murdered by a \"karapan\" (a priest of the old religion) named Brādrēs.\n\nIn the Gathas, Zoroaster sees the human condition as the mental struggle between \"aša\" (truth) and \"druj\" (lie). The cardinal concept of \"aša\"—which is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable—is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of Ahura Mazda (who is \"aša\"), creation (that is \"aša\"), existence (that is \"aša\") and as the condition for free will.\n\nThe purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain \"aša\". For humankind, this occurs through active participation in life and the exercise of constructive thoughts, words and deeds.\n\nElements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on Judaism and Middle Platonism and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy. Among the classic Greek philosophers, Heraclitus is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's thinking.\nIn 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers. Zarathustra's impact lingers today due in part to the system of rational ethics he founded called Mazda-Yasna. The word \"Mazda-Yasna\" is Avestan and is translated as \"Worship of Wisdom\" in English. The encyclopedia Natural History (Pliny) claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with Pythagoras, used a similar term, philosophy, or \"love of wisdom\" to describe the search for ultimate truth.\n\nZoroaster emphasized the freedom of the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept \"aša\", or arta (the divine order), and shun \"druj\" (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force \"aša\" or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.\n\nA number of parallels have been drawn between Zoroastrian teachings and Islam. Such parallels include the evident similarities between Amesha Spenta and the archangel Gabriel, and the mention of Thamud and the Iram of the Pillars in the Quran. These may also indicate the vast influence of the Achaemenid Empire on the development of either religion.\n\nThe Sabaeans, who believed in free will coincident with Zoroastrians, are also mentioned in the Quran.\n\nLike the Greeks of classical antiquity, Islamic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic \"Majus\", collective \"Majusya\"). The 11th-century Cordoban Ibn Hazm (Zahiri school) contends that \"Kitabi\" \"of the Book\" cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. Citing the authority of the 8th-century al-Kalbi, the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian al-Tabari (i.648) reports that Zaradusht bin Isfiman (an Arabic adaptation of \"Zarathustra Spitama\") was an inhabitant of Israel and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet Jeremiah. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. Elisha's servant Gehazi in Jewish Scripture).\n\nThe apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to Balkh (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. Vishtaspa), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681–683) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been \"Sabi\"s) to the Magian religion.\n\nThe 12th-century heresiographer al-Shahrastani describes the Majusiya into three sects, the \"Kayumarthiya\", the \"Zurwaniya\" and the \"Zaradushtiya\", among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: \"They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform.\" (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5–7. 50–54) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other \"People of the Book\".\n\nThough the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: \"And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee.\" (40 : 78). Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmesteter remarked in the translation of Zend Avesta: \"When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta.\" (Introduction to Vendidad. p. 69.)\n\nShi'a view\n\nDuring the reign of the seventh Abbasid caliph, Al-Ma'mun, Imam Ali al-Ridha, the great grandson of Muhammad and a prominent Islamic scholar of his time, was summoned in court to debate with the high priests, scholars, philosophers, and theologians to test his knowledge on religion and jurisprudence. Among the summoned scholars was a Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Ridha questioned the priest on his beliefs saying,“Tell me about Zoroaster, whom you claim is a prophet; what is your evidence for his Prophethood?” to which the response was “We did not see him, but the tales of our ancestors informed us that he had legalized for us what no other person before had made legal.” Imam Al-Ridha responded “This is the case with all other nations. Tales had come to them about what the prophets had accomplished, what Moses, Jesus and Muhammad had all brought them, so why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster, through the tales that came to you about him, informing that he brought forth what others did not?”\n\nAhmadi Muslims view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the god of goodness, and Ahraman, the god of evil, as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will. Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, in his book \"Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth\" views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nManichaeism considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with Jesus and the Buddha) in a line of prophets of which Mani (216–276) was the culmination. Zoroaster's ethical dualism is—to an extent—incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.\n\nZoroaster appears in the Bahá'í Faith as a \"Manifestation of God\", one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity. Zoroaster thus shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, saw Bahá'u'lláh as the fulfillment of a post-Sassanid Zoroastrian prophecy that saw a return of Sassanid emperor Bahram: Shoghi Effendi also stated that Zoroaster lived roughly 1000 years before Jesus.\n\nThe Greeks—in the Hellenistic sense of the term—had an understanding of Zoroaster as expressed by Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Agathias that saw him, at the core, to be the \"prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples,\" Beck notes that \"the rest was mostly fantasy\". Zoroaster was set in the ancient past, six to seven millennia before the Common Era, and was described as a king of Bactria or a Babylonian (or teacher of Babylonians), and with a biography typical of a Neopythagorean sage, i.e. having a mission preceded by ascetic withdrawal and enlightenment. However, at first mentioned in the context of dualism, in Moralia, Plutarch presents Zoroaster as \"Zaratras,\" not realizing the two to be the same, and he is described as a \"teacher of Pythagoras\".\n\nZoroaster has also been described as a sorcerer-astrologerthe creator of both magic and astrology. Deriving from that image, and reinforcing it, was a \"mass of literature\" attributed to him and that circulated the Mediterranean world from the 3rd century BCE to the end of antiquity and beyond.\n\nThe language of that literature was predominantly Greek, though at one stage or another various parts of it passed through Aramaic, Syriac, Coptic or Latin. Its ethos and cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and \"the ascription of literature to sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid for authority and a fount of legitimizing \"alien wisdom\". Zoroaster and the magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it.\" The attributions to \"exotic\" names (not restricted to magians) conferred an \"authority of a remote and revelatory wisdom.\"\n\nAmong the named works attributed to \"Zoroaster\" is a treatise \"On Nature\" (\"Peri physeos\"), which appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The framework is a retelling of Plato's Myth of Er, with Zoroaster taking the place of the original hero. While Porphyry imagined Pythagoras listening to Zoroaster's discourse, \"On Nature\" has the sun in middle position, which was how it was understood in the 3rd century. In contrast, Plato's 4th-century BCE version had the sun in second place above the moon. Ironically, Colotes accused Plato of plagiarizing Zoroaster, and Heraclides Ponticus wrote a text titled \"Zoroaster\" based on his perception of \"Zoroastrian\" philosophy, in order to express his disagreement with Plato on natural philosophy. With respect to substance and content in \"On Nature\" only two facts are known: that it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that Necessity (\"Ananké\") was mentioned by name and that she was in the air.\n\nPliny the Elder names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (\"Natural History\" 30.2.3). \"However, a principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds.\" That \"dubious honor\" went to the \"fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.\" Although Pliny calls him the inventor of magic, the Roman does not provide a \"magician's persona\" for him. Moreover, the little \"magical\" teaching that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest example being from the 14th century.\n\nAssociation with astrology according to Roger Beck, were based on his Babylonian origin, and Zoroaster's Greek name was identified at first with star-worshiping (\"astrothytes\" \"star sacrificer\") and, with the \"Zo-\", even as the \"living\" star. Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (\"zo-\") flux (\"ro-\") of fire from the star (\"astr-\") which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him.\n\nThe alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratras or Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos. Pythagoreans considered the mathematicians to have studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia.Lydus, in \"On the Months\", attributes the creation of the seven-day week to \"the Babylonians in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes,\" and who did so because there were seven planets. The Suda's chapter on \"astronomia\" notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata, in \"Mennipus\" 6, reports deciding to journey to Babylon \"to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors,\" for their opinion.\n\nWhile the division along the lines of Zoroaster/astrology and Ostanes/magic is an \"oversimplification, the descriptions do at least indicate what the works are \"not\"; they were not expressions of Zoroastrian doctrine, they were not even expressions of what the Greeks and Romans \"imagined\" the doctrines of Zoroastrianism to have been\" [emphases in the original]. The assembled fragments do not even show noticeable commonality of outlook and teaching among the several authors who wrote under each name.\n\nAlmost all Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is now lost, and of the attested texts—with only one exception—only fragments have survived. Pliny's 2nd- or 3rd-century attribution of \"two million lines\" to Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the Library of Alexandria. This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because no one before Pliny refers to literature by \"Zoroaster\", and on the authority of the 2nd-century Galen of Pergamon and from a 6th-century commentator on Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient authors.\n\nThe exception to the fragmentary evidence (i.e. reiteration of passages in works of other authors) is a complete Coptic tractate titled \"Zostrianos\" (after the first-person narrator) discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945. A three-line cryptogram in the colophones following the 131-page treatise identify the work as \"words of truth of Zostrianos. God of Truth [\"logos\"]. Words of Zoroaster.\" Invoking a \"God of Truth\" might seem Zoroastrian, but there is otherwise \"nothing noticeably Zoroastrian\" about the text and \"in content, style, ethos and intention, its affinities are entirely with the congeners among the Gnostic tractates.\"\n\nAnother work circulating under the name of \"Zoroaster\" was the \"Asteroskopita\" (or \"Apotelesmatika\"), and which ran to five volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The title and fragments suggest that it was an astrological handbook, \"albeit a very varied one, for the making of predictions.\" A third text attributed to Zoroaster is \"On Virtue of Stones\" (\"Peri lithon timion\"), of which nothing is known other than its extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster \"sang\" it (from which Cumont and Bidez conclude that it was in verse). Numerous other fragments preserved in the works of other authors are attributed to \"Zoroaster,\" but the titles of those books are not mentioned.\n\nThese pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas. The \"Oracles of Hystaspes\", by \"Hystaspes\", another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources. Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place, Pliny had sworn in the name of Hercules that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth. This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like that of \"two million verses\") also appears in the 9th– to 11th-century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition, and for a time it was assumed that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources. Pliny also records that Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom. The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers, and the provenance of other descriptions are clear. For instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies reads thus: \"Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy. He used to call the one Horomazes and the other Areimanius\".\n\nZoroaster was known as a sage, magician, and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture. Although almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late 18th century, his name was already associated with lost ancient wisdom. Statements by Sir Thomas Browne as early as 1643 are the earliest recorded references to Zoroaster in the English language.\n\nEnlightenment writers such as Voltaire promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational Deism, preferable to Christianity. Zoroaster was the subject of the 1749 opera, \"Zoroastre\", by Jean-Philippe Rameau. With the translation of the Avesta by Abraham Anquetil-Duperron, Western scholarship of Zoroastrianism began.\n\nAn early 19th-century representation of Zoroaster derived from the portrait of a figure that appears in a 4th-century sculpture at Taq-e Bostan in south-western Iran.\n\nIn E. T. A. Hoffmann's novel \"\" (1819), the mage Prosper Alpanus states that Professor Zoroaster was his teacher.\n\nIn his seminal work \"Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra)\" (1885) the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche uses the native Iranian name Zarathustra which has a significant meaning as he had used the familiar Greek-Latin name in his earlier works. It is believed that Nietzsche invents a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality. Richard Strauss's Opus 30, inspired by Nietzsche's book, is also called \"Also sprach Zarathustra\".\n\nIrish poet William Butler Yeats (1865–1939) and his wife reportedly claimed to have contacted Zoroaster through \"automatic writing\".\n\nA sculpture of Zoroaster by Edward Clark Potter, representing ancient Persian judicial wisdom and dating to 1896, towers over the Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. A sculpture of Zoroaster appears with other prominent religious figures on the south side of the exterior of Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on the campus of the University of Chicago.\n\nAlthough a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show the prophet performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely present him in white vestments (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a \"baresman\" (Avestan; Middle Persian \"barsom\"), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the Avesta. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the \"varza\"—usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point.\n\nZoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of Jesus.\n\nA common variant of the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this depiction at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a \"baresman\" in hand and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly thought to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.\n\n\n\n"}
