{"id": "9644989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9644989", "title": "A Scientific Theology", "text": "A Scientific Theology\n\nA Scientific Theology is a set of three books by Alister McGrath that explores the parallels between the working assumptions and methods of Christian theology and those of the natural sciences. \"Scientific Theology\" is also the \"running title\" of the project which gave rise to the trilogy. The work is preceded by three volumes that McGrath describes as \"landmarks\" in the development of his scientific theology: \"The Genesis of Doctrine: A Study in the Foundations of Doctrinal Criticism\", \"The Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion\" and \"Thomas F. Torrance: An Intellectual Biography\". The trilogy was later summarised in \"The Science of God.\" McGrath is working on a \"scientific dogmatics\" which will deal with the content of Christian theology following the method developed in the trilogy.\n\nSince at least the time of the 2nd century apologists Christian theology has sought to relate itself to major intellectual trends. In earlier periods this meant engagement with Platonism and Aristotelianism. But as these philosophical systems waned under the increasing influence of natural philosophy (later \"science\") so Christian theology increasingly tended to focus on engagement with the natural sciences.\n\nThis engagement would eventually lead to the idea that Christian Theology itself should be \"scientific\" and by the earlier part of the 20th century calls were being made for a \"scientific theology.\" This call has been answered in various ways.\n\nThese various approaches to \"scientific theology\" may be loosely categorised as \"methodological\" or \"doctrinal\" depending upon their primary focus. These concerns, however, are by no means mutually exclusive.\n\nA \"methodological\" approach is concerned with practicing theology in a \"scientific\" manner and focuses on clearly articulating the assumptions, methods, and related thought-forms to be taken into account in the construction of dogmatic formulations.\n\nA \"doctrinal\" approach is concerned with the inter-relationship of scientific and doctrinal content and focuses on formulating Christian theology against a framework of specific scientific theorems.\n\nBy a “scientific theology” McGrath does not mean an attempt to reconcile particular Christian beliefs with particular scientific theorems. Such efforts are regarded by him as pointless because they become outdated with scientific progress. Rather, McGrath seeks to draw upon the proven assumptions and methods of the natural sciences in order to inform the practice of Christian theology.\n\nSuch an approach is grounded in the fundamental belief that Christian theology seeks to describe the same God who (in whatever way) created the natural order which the natural sciences seek to describe. The assumption is that a theological investigation of reality can be informed by the approach taken in a scientific investigation of reality.\n\nIt is critical to distinguish levels of reality so that each level is investigated according to its appropriate methods. On this basis, the reality of God and the contingent reality of the created order are taken as distinct although still related levels of reality. It is important to note that this is not regarded as a self-evident truth, but acknowledged to be a claim of Christian theology which is based in revelation.\n\nIt is the Christian understanding of revelation as disclosure of an objective reality that justifies, in McGrath's view, claims of a correspondence between the assumptions and methods of Christian theology and those of the natural sciences. He argues that just as the natural sciences are an investigation of the objective reality of the natural order, so Christian theology is an investigation of the (revealed) objective reality of God.\n\nChristian theology and the natural sciences, therefore, are both a response to reality and so must proceed \"a posteriori\"-that is from observations (i.e. of revealed or natural data respectively) to dogmas/theorems.\n\nIdeally, neither discipline confuses its theoretical constructs with the reality it seeks to describe. Both should be critical of their dogmas/theorems and constantly put them to the test. For Christian theology this means continually assessing Christian faith and practice against the revelation of God in Jesus Christ “the incarnate word.”\n\nIn this work McGrath commits himself to an approach that seeks to avoid the use of contemporary views of religion as found in the work of the distinguished Ian Barbour and Arthur Peacocke, keeping instead to a classic Christian theological formulation (i.e., traditional credal Christian orthodoxy), which is a position closer to John Polkinghorne according to McGrath. Also when relating Christianity and science, the three volumes stress the \"provisionality\" of scientific understanding, findings, and conclusions. This sort of provisionality makes relating Christianity to science very different from relating Christianity to fairly settled views such as Platonism and Aristotelianism.\n\nCommenting that \"[w]riting on method is a bit like clearing your throat before beginning a lecture. You can only go on so long before the audience starts to get a little restless.\" McGrath makes clear that the methodological concerns of \"A Scientific Theology\" constitute an extensive preliminary to the development of a systematic theology constructed according to the trilogy's methodological grounds.\n\n\"A Scientific Theology\" is intended by McGrath to be ecumenical in approach and valuable to Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and evangelical readers.\n\nDue to both McGrath's creedal commitments, \"A Scientific Theology\" is \"a systematic work \"of theology\"\".\n\nDue precisely to the scope of the work, McGrath felt led to prepare a short volume \"The Science of God\" which \"is designed to introduce the distinctive themes and emphasis of this scientific theology to a wider readership\"\n\nIn intent, the trilogy is a very ambitious project which seeks to lay a methodological groundwork for further theological reflection. In execution, McGrath himself acknowledges that it falls somewhat short of its goal. Writing in the conclusion to the third volume he explains;\n\nThe three volumes of \"A Scientific Theology\" form part of a broader project which has issued in a number of other books by McGrath. The contents of these books, and their relation to the scientific theology project, are briefly described in this section.\n\nThe Science of God is a small book prepared by McGrath to introduce the themes and emphases of \"A Scientific Theology\" to a wider readership. Four considerations guided its preparation;\nFleming, noting the impact of McGrath's project, describes \"The Science of God\" as \"an accessible place to begin following what is likely to become one of the most influential areas in the science-religion dialogue.\"\n\nReviews of this work have appeared in \"The Journal of Religion\", \"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\", and \"Isis\" amongst others.\n\nWillem B. Drees, Leiden University, The Netherlands, offered a lengthy review of \"Volume 1: Nature\" in which he followed a summary of the work with a solid critique. There are three points at which Drees critiques McGrath throughout the review;\n\n\nDrees concludes; “McGrath’s book is rich in historical detail and in footnotes (I wish they had been covered by the index as well) and very outspoken in its judgments … [but] I find the book falling short in the accuracy with which it deals with other positions and with complex issues such as the philosophical arguments pro and contra scientific realism...and theological realism.”\n\nLarry L. Rasmussen, Reinhold Niebuhr Emeritus Professor of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary, considered \"A Scientific Theology: Volume 1, Nature\" to be “immensely learned and instructive.” After giving a brief summary of the volume’s themes and contents he concludes that McGrath is \"in full command of the English and German language sources within what he calls 'the western intellectual community.'\" However, Rasmussen finds “unsettling” McGrath's failure to move outside that community to engage with recent Christian sources – feminist and Two-Thirds World in particular – which in recent decades have challenged both McGrath’s streams of theology, and the epistemologies and philosophy of science. Thus, although McGrath sees his project as “a public theology,” Rasmussen considers that this “does not mean engagement with voices that dissent from his canon.” He concludes: “Given the ferment in both theology and science...this is an unfortunate omission in an otherwise learned undertaking.”\n\nGregory Snyder in the \"Anglican Theological Review\" considered Volume 1 \"a magisterial historical, philosophical, theological, and biblical treatise on \"nature.\" By its end, I felt as if I had completed a seminary course in natural theology. It is well written, erudite, at times even provocative, and humorous. However, it is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a book to consume slowly and savor in one's study, notepad in hand.\"\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Bes-en-Mut I and Ta-neshet. Among practitioners of the modern religion of Thelema, he is best known under the name of \"Ankh-af-na-khonsu\", and as the dedicant of the Stele of Revealing, a wooden offering stela made to ensure his continued existence in the Netherworld now located in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nSr. Lutea, writing in \"The Scarlet Letter\", explains some of the words in his name:\n\n\"A translation of the name might be close to the following: Ankh is both a tool and a symbol meaning 'new life.' The hyphen af is always part of another word that lends exclamatory force. The word, na is generally used as a preposition, such as 'to, for, belonging to, through, or because.' Khonsu was the adopted son of Amun and Mut from the Theban triad. His name comes from a word meaning, 'to cross over' or 'wanderer' or 'he who traverses.' So, his entire name may be translated as 'the truth that has crossed over.'\"\n\nLutea's interpretation is a free one that Egyptologists would tend to reject. A modern Egyptological approach would translate the name Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu (\"ꜥnḫ-f-n-ḫnsw\") as \"He lives for Khonsu\"; the name is particularly common during the Third Intermediate and Late Periods.\n\nThe Stela of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu (Cairo A 9422 [formerly Bulaq 666])is a painted, wooden offering stele, discovered in 1858 at the mortuary temple of Hatshepsut at Dayr al-Bahri by François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette. According to one translation of the stela done in the Thelemic perspective, it says of him:\n\n\"...has left the multitudes and rejoined those who are in the light, he has opened the dwelling place of the stars; now then, the deceased, Ankh-af-na-khonsu has gone forth by day in order to do everything that pleased him upon earth, among the living.\"\n\nor by a 1982 analysis,\n\n\"deliverer of those who are in the sunshine, open for him the netherworld; indeed the Osiris Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu shall go forth by day to do that which he desires, all, upon earth, among the living.\"\n\n\"The Book of the Law\" (I,36) says:\n\n\"My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khu-it.\"\n\nBased on this, Aleister Crowley used the \"magical\" name \"Ankh-f-n-khonsu\" (from the \"Stele 666\" translation prepared in 1904 for Crowley by Egyptologist Émile Brugsch) to sign \"The Comment\" of \"The Book of the Law\", and also used it sometimes when referring to himself as the prophet of Thelema and the Aeon of Horus. Kenneth Grant wrote that \"Crowley claimed to have been a re-embodiment of the magical current represented by the priesthood to which Ankh-af-na-Khonsu belonged\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "865104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=865104", "title": "Book of hours", "text": "Book of hours\n\nThe book of hours is a Christian devotional book popular in the Middle Ages. It is the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscript. Like every manuscript, each manuscript book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a similar collection of texts, prayers and psalms, often with appropriate decorations, for Christian devotion. Illumination or decoration is minimal in many examples, often restricted to decorated capital letters at the start of psalms and other prayers, but books made for wealthy patrons may be extremely lavish, with full-page miniatures. Books of hours were usually written in Latin (the Latin name for them is \"horae\"), although there are many entirely or partially written in vernacular European languages, especially Dutch. The English term \"primer\" is usually now reserved for those books written in English. Tens of thousands of books of hours have survived to the present day, in libraries and private collections throughout the world.\n\nThe typical book of hours is an abbreviated form of the breviary which contained the Divine Office recited in monasteries. It was developed for lay people who wished to incorporate elements of monasticism into their devotional life. Reciting the hours typically centered upon the reading of a number of psalms and other prayers. A typical example contains the Calendar of Church feasts, extracts from the Four Gospels, the Mass readings for major feasts, the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the fifteen Psalms of Degrees, the seven Penitential Psalms, a Litany of Saints, an Office for the Dead and the Hours of the Cross.\n\nMost 15th-century books of hours have these basic contents. The Marian prayers \"Obsecro te\" (\"I beseech thee\") and \"O Intemerata\" (\"O undefiled one\") were frequently added, as were devotions for use at Mass, and meditations on the Passion of Christ, among other optional texts.\n\nThe book of hours has its ultimate origin in the Psalter, which monks and nuns were required to recite. By the 12th century this had developed into the breviary, with weekly cycles of psalms, prayers, hymns, antiphons, and readings which changed with the liturgical season. Eventually a selection of texts was produced in much shorter volumes and came to be called a book of hours.\n\nMany books of hours were made for women. There is some evidence that they were sometimes given as a wedding present from a husband to his bride. Frequently they were passed down through the family, as recorded in wills.\n\nAlthough the most heavily illuminated books of hours were enormously expensive, a small book with little or no illumination was affordable much more widely, and increasingly so during the 15th century. The earliest surviving English example was apparently written for a laywoman living in or near Oxford in about 1240. It is smaller than a modern paperback but heavily illuminated with major initials, but no full-page miniatures. By the 15th century, there are also examples of servants owning their own Books of Hours. In a court case from 1500, a pauper woman is accused of stealing a domestic servant's prayerbook.\n\nVery rarely the books included prayers specifically composed for their owners, but more often the texts are adapted to their tastes or sex, including the inclusion of their names in prayers. Some include images depicting their owners, and some their coats of arms. These, together with the choice of saints commemorated in the calendar and suffrages, are the main clues for the identity of the first owner. Eamon Duffy explains how these books reflected the person who commissioned them. He claims that the \"personal character of these books was often signaled by the inclusion of prayers specially composed or adapted for their owners.\" Furthermore, he states that \"as many as half the surviving manuscript Books of Hours have annotations, marginalia or additions of some sort. Such additions might amount to no more than the insertion of some regional or personal patron saint in the standardized calendar, but they often include devotional material added by the owner.\" Owners could write in specific dates important to them, notes on the months where things happened that they wished to remember, and even the images found within these books would be personalized to the owners- such as localized saints and local festivities. By at least the 15th century, the Netherlands and Paris workshops were producing books of hours for stock or distribution, rather than waiting for individual commissions. These were sometimes with spaces left for the addition of personalized elements such as local feasts or heraldry.\n\nThe style and layout for traditional books of hours became increasingly standardized around the middle of the thirteenth century. The new style can be seen in the books produced by the Oxford illuminator William de Brailes who ran a commercial workshop (he was in minor orders). His books included various aspects of the Church's breviary and other liturgical aspects for use by the laity. \"He incorporated a perpetual calendar, Gospels, prayers to the Virgin Mary, the Stations of the Cross, prayers to the Holy Spirit, Penitential psalms, litanies, prayers for the dead, and suffrages to the Saints. The book’s goal was to help his devout patroness to structure her daily spiritual life in accordance with the eight canonical hours, Matins to Compline, observed by all devout members of the Church. The text, augmented by rubrication, gilding, miniatures, and beautiful illuminations, sought to inspire meditation on the mysteries of faith, the sacrifice made by Christ for man, and the horrors of hell, and to especially highlight devotion to the Virgin Mary whose popularity was at a zenith during the 13th century.\" This arrangement was maintained over the years as many aristocrats commissioned the production of their own books.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, the advent of printing made books more affordable and much of the emerging middle-class could afford to buy a printed book of hours, and new manuscripts were only commissioned by the very wealthy. The \"Kitab salat al-sawai\" (1514), widely considered the first book in Arabic printed using moveable type, is a book of hours intended for Arabic-speaking Christians and presumably commissioned by Pope Julius II.\n\nAs many books of hours are richly illuminated, they form an important record of life in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as the iconography of medieval Christianity. Some of them were also decorated with jewelled covers, portraits, and heraldic emblems. Some were bound as girdle books for easy carrying, though few of these or other medieval bindings have survived. Luxury books, like the \"Talbot Hours\" of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, may include a portrait of the owner, and in this case his wife, kneeling in adoration of the Virgin and Child as a form of donor portrait. In expensive books, miniature cycles showed the \"Life of the Virgin\" or the Passion of Christ in eight scenes decorating the eight \"Hours of the Virgin\", and the Labours of the Months and signs of the zodiac decorating the calendar. Secular scenes of calendar cycles include many of the best known images from books of hours, and played an important role in the early history of landscape painting.\n\nFrom the 14th century decorated borders round the edges of at least important pages were common in heavily illuminated books, including books of hours. At the beginning of the 15th century these were still usually based on foliage designs, and painted on a plain background, but by the second half of the century coloured or patterned backgrounds with images of all sorts of objects, were used in luxury books.\n\nSecond-hand books of hours were often modified for new owners, even among royalty. After defeating Richard III, Henry VII gave Richard's book of hours to his mother, who modified it to include her name. Heraldry was usually erased or over-painted by new owners. Many have handwritten annotations, personal additions and marginal notes but some new owners also commissioned new craftsmen to include more illustrations or texts. Sir Thomas Lewkenor of Trotton hired an illustrator to add details to what is now known as the \"Lewkenor Hours\". Flyleaves of some surviving books include notes of household accounting or records of births and deaths, in the manner of later family bibles. Some owners had also collected autographs of notable visitors to their house. Books of hours were often the only book in a house, and were commonly used to teach children to read, sometimes having a page with the alphabet to assist this.\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, printers produced books of hours with woodcut illustrations, and the book of hours was one of the main works decorated in the related metalcut technique.\n\nIn the 14th century the book of hours overtook the psalter as the most common vehicle for lavish illumination. This partly reflected the increasing dominance of illumination both commissioned and executed by laymen rather than monastic clergy. From the late 14th century a number of bibliophile royal figures began to collect luxury illuminated manuscripts for their decorations, a fashion that spread across Europe from the Valois courts of France and the Burgundy, as well as Prague under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later Wenceslaus. A generation later, Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy was the most important collector of manuscripts, with several of his circle also collecting. It was during this period that the Flemish cities overtook Paris as the leading force in illumination, a position they retained until the terminal decline of the illuminated manuscript in the early 16th century.\n\nThe most famous collector of all, the French prince John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) owned several books of hours, some of which survive, including the most celebrated of all, the \"Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry\". This was begun around 1410 by the Limbourg brothers, although left incomplete by them, and decoration continued over several decades by other artists and owners. The same was true of the \"Turin-Milan Hours\", which also passed through Berry's ownership.\n\nBy the mid-15th century, a much wider group of nobility and rich businesspeople were able to commission highly decorated, often small, books of hours. With the arrival of printing, the market contracted sharply, and by 1500 the finest quality books were once again being produced only for royal or very grand collectors. One of the last major illuminated book of hours was the \"Farnese Hours\" completed for the Roman Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1546 by Giulio Clovio, who was also the last major manuscript illuminator.\n\nSee for a fuller list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Confucius himself and some of his disciples are buried there, as well as many thousands of his descendants.\n\nSince 1994, the Cemetery of Confucius has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\". The two other components of the site are the Temple of Confucius dedicated to the memory of the philosopher and the Kong Family Mansion, where his descendants lived. The three sites are collectively known in Qufu as \"San Kong\" (三孔), i.e. \"The Three Confucian [sites]\".\n\nIn 1331 construction work began on the wall and gate of the cemetery. In total, the cemetery has undergone 13 renovations and extensions. Eventually, by the late 18th century, the perimeter wall reached a length of , enclosing an area of . In this space, the tombs of more than 100,000 descendants of Confucius, who have been buried there over a period of about 2,000 years, can be found. The oldest graves date back to the Zhou Dynasty, the most recent of which belong to descendants in the 76th and 78th generation.\n\nThe cemetery suffered serious damage in November 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, when it was visited and vandalized by a team of Red Guards from Beijing Normal University, led by Tan Houlan.\nThe corpse of the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery in the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Cemetery of Confucius is located north of the historic walled city of Qufu, about two kilometers north of the Temple and Mansion of Confucius (which are in the south-central part of the walled city), and 1.5 km north of the Temple of Yan Hui, dedicated to the sage's favorite student (which is just inside the northern gates of the city wall). The main north-central axis of the walled city, Gulou Jie (\"Drum Tower Avenue\"), becomes Beiguan Jie (\"North Gate Avenue\") after passing through the north gate of the city wall. The avenue runs north for 1266 m as a wide boulevard decorated with the \"Wan gu chang chun\" (Traditional Chinese:萬古長春, Simplified Chinese:万古长春) \"memorial arch\" and lined by cypresses and pine trees, finally arriving at the main (southern) gates of the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery occupies 183.33 hectares, and is surrounded by a perimeter wall 5,591 m long.\n\nThe oldest graves found in this location date back to the Zhou Dynasty. The original tomb erected here in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it had a brick platform for sacrifices. The present-day tomb is a cone-shaped hill. Tombs for the descendants of Confucius and additional stelae to commemorate him were soon added around Confucius' tomb.\n\nSince Confucius' descendants were conferred noble titles (Duke Yansheng) and were given imperial princesses as wives, many of the tombs in the cemetery show the status symbols of noblemen. Tombstones came in use during the Han Dynasty. Today, there are over three thousand stone tablets (mostly, tombstones) dating from China's imperial period still standing in the cemetery. According to an official count, among them there are 22 tablets from the Song Dynasty, 6 from Jin, 45 from Yuan, 506 from Ming and 2626 from Qing still standing in the cemetery. There are also 568 tablets from the Republic of China period and 50 modern (PRC-era) tablets, as well as 180 tablets whose age cannot be determined; this brings the total to 4003.\n\nThe Ming burials are primarily found in the western part of the cemetery, and those from the Qing era, in the eastern part. In the Ming section, particularly notable is a comparatively small area located about 1 km to the northwest of the Tomb of Confucius, where about a dozen of Dukes of Yansheng, from the 55th to the 64th generation, have been buried. The dukes' tomb sites in this area are arranged more or less chronologically in rows from the south to the north, and, within each row, from the east of the west. Each duke has his own spirit way, oriented from the south to the north, which typically includes (in the south-to-north order) the following sculptures: three pairs of animals (felines, sometimes winged; rams; horses); a memorial arch; a \"bixi\" with a stele; two guardian figures (a warrior on the west side of the path, and a civil official on the east side); and a stele in front of the small tumulus under which the duke is buried. A smaller subsidiary area with late Ming - early Qing spirit ways, is located about 500 m northeast of this main area.\n\nMore than 10,000 mature trees give the cemetery a forest-like appearance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "246574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246574", "title": "Demonic possession", "text": "Demonic possession\n\nDemonic possession is believed by some to be the process by which individuals are possessed by malevolent preternatural beings, commonly referred to as demons or devils. Symptoms of demonic possessions often include erased memories or personalities, convulsions (i.e. epileptic seizures or “fits”) and fainting as if one were dying.\n\nMany cultures and religions contain some concept of demonic possession, but the details vary considerably. The oldest references to demonic possession are from the Sumerians, who believed that all diseases of the body and mind were caused by \"sickness demons\" called \"gidim\" or \"gid-dim\". The priests who practised exorcisms in these nations were called \"ashipu\" (sorcerer) as opposed to an \"asu\" (physician) who applied bandages and salves. Many cuneiform clay tablets contain prayers to certain gods asking for protection from demons, while others ask the gods to expel the demons that have invaded their bodies.\n\nShamanic cultures also believe in demon possession and shamans performing exorcisms. In these cultures, diseases are often attributed to the presence of a vengeful spirit (or loosely termed \"demon\") in the body of the patient. These spirits are more often the spectres of animals or people wronged by the bearer, the exorcism rites usually consisting of respectful offerings or sacrificial offerings.\n\nChristianity holds that possession derives from the Devil, i.e. Satan, or one of his lesser demons. In Christianity, Satan and his demons are actually fallen angels. In modern medicine, it is now suspected that an underlying cause of what sometimes appears to be demonic possession is actually anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\nObsessions and possessions of the devil are placed in the rank of apparitions of the evil spirit among humans. It is obsession when the demon acts externally against the person whom it besets, and possession when it acts internally, agitates them, excites their ill humor, makes them utter blasphemy, speak tongues they allegedly have never learned, reveals allegedly unknown secrets to them, and apparently inspires them with obscure knowledge of philosophy or theology.\n\nOther claims include access to hidden knowledge and foreign languages (xenoglossy), drastic changes in vocal intonation and facial structure, the sudden appearance of injuries (scratches, bite marks) or lesions, and superhuman strength. Also odd odors and lack of pain density and self-mutilation. Unlike in channeling, the subject has no control over the possessing entity and so it will persist until forced to leave the victim, usually through a form of exorcism.\n\nAdditionally, there is a form of monomania called demonomania or demonopathy in which the person believes that he or she is possessed by one or more demons.\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" says that there is only one apparent case of demonic possession in the Old Testament, of King Saul, but it relies on an interpretation of the Hebrew word \"rûah\" as \"evil spirit\", an interpretation that is doubted by the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\". Others theologians such as Ángel Manuel Rodríguez say that mediums like the ones mentioned in Leviticus 20:27 were possessed by demons.\n\nThe New Testament mentions several episodes in which Jesus drove out demons from persons. The 1902 work \"Demonic possession in the New Testament\" by Rev. William Menzies Alexander attempted to explain accounts of possession in the Synoptic Gospels, outlining their historical, medical and theological aspects.\n\nAntoine Augustin Calmet, a French Benedictine monk writing in the 18th century, commented that the Jews attributed the greater part of their maladies to the works of demons and were persuaded that demonic torments were a punishment for some crime either known or unrevealed. He also states:\n\n\"Although the Jews were sufficiently credulous concerning the operations of the evil spirit, they at the same time believed that in general the demons who tormented certain persons were nothing else than the souls of some wretches, who, fearing to repair to the place destined for them, took possession of the body of some mortal whom they tormented and endeavored to deprive of life\"- Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants\nCatholic exorcists differentiate between \"ordinary\" Satanic/demonic activity or influence (mundane everyday \"temptations\") and \"extraordinary\" Satanic/demonic activity, which can take six different forms, ranging from complete control by Satan or some demon(s) to voluntary submission:\n\n\nIn \"Hostage to the Devil\", Malachi Martin also mentions a type of demonic attack called \"familiarization\". He writes:\n\nTrue demonic or satanic possession has been characterized since the Middle Ages, in the Roman Ritual, by the following four typical characteristics:\n\nThe Bible indicates that people can be possessed by demons but that the demons respond and submit to Jesus' authority:\n\nIt also indicates that demons can possess animals as in the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac:\n\nOfficial Catholic doctrine affirms that demonic possession can occur as distinguished from mental illness, but stresses that cases of mental illness should not be misdiagnosed as demonic influence. Catholic exorcisms can occur only under the authority of a bishop and in accordance with strict rules; a simple exorcism also occurs during Baptism (\"CCC\" 1673).\n\nSince Jesus is reported (in the New Testament) to have encountered people who were demonized and to have driven the \"evil spirits\" out of these demoniacs, Saint Hilary of Poitiers of the 4th century asserted that demons entered the bodies of humans to use them as if they were theirs, and also proposed that the same could happen with animals.\n\nThe literal view of demonization is held by a number of Christian denominations. In charismatic Christianity, deliverance ministries are activities carried out by individuals or groups aimed at solving problems related to demons and spirits, especially possession of the body and soul, but not the spirit as ministries like Ellel Ministries International, Don Dickerman Ministries and Neil T. Anderson explicitly teach that a Christian can not have demons in their spirit because the Holy Spirit lives there, though they can have demons in their body or soul due to inner emotional wounds, sexual abuse, satanic ritual abuse. This is usually known as partial possession or demonic infestation, as opposed to outside demonic oppression which does not reside in any of the 3 parts of a person: body, soul, spirit.\n\nThe New Testament's description of people who had evil spirits includes a capacity for hidden knowledge (e.g., future events, innermost thoughts of the people around them) (Acts 16:16) and great strength (Act 19:16), among others, and shows those with evil spirits can speak of Christ (Acts 19:16, Mark 3:11). According to Catholic theologians, demonic assault can be involuntary and allowed by God to test a person (for more details about God's tests on persons see Job). Involuntary demonic assault, according to these theologians, cannot be denied because this would imply the negation of the cases mentioned in the New Testament (12, some of them repeated in more than one Gospel). However, in the overwhelming majority of cases of alleged demonic possession in modern times, the victim can suffer due to any of a number of personal initiatives: occult practices, mortal sin, loss of faith, or psychological trauma, among others. Furthermore, Malachi Martin goes as far as to say \"...no person can be Possessed without some degree of cooperation on his or her part,\" and \"The effective cause of Possession is the voluntary collaboration of an individual, through his faculties of mind and will, with one or more of those bodiless, genderless creatures called demons.\"\n\nIn previous centuries, the Christian church offered suggestions on safeguarding one’s home. Suggestions ranged from dousing a household with holy water, placing wax and herbs on thresholds to “ward off witches occult,” and avoiding certain areas of townships known to be frequented by witches and Devil worshippers after dark.\n\nT. B. Joshua, a Nigerian pastor, has one of the most prominent 'deliverance' ministries, releasing hundreds of videos on YouTube and his Christian television station, Emmanuel TV, purporting to show individuals being 'delivered' from apparent 'demonic possession'.\n\nAccording to islamic belief, supernatural creatures like Jinn and devils can cause possession or change the behavior of humans. While a particular devil tempts humans mind to follow lower desires and causing therefore suffering, disobience to God or reduction of their own state of soul, an evil Jinn (also called a satan or devil, because of its devilish behavior) is said to be able to enter humans bodies.\n\nSatan (identified with Iblis) is according to Islam allowed trying to incite humans and Jinn to do evil. Therefore, he and his subordinate demons whispers to the hearts of beings with free will, trying to lead them astray from Allah and their spiritual development or hunts them against each other. He does not possess humans physically. If a person feels depressed or feels being trapped in a doubtful situation, the person should tell others about what happened, because otherwise Satan could abuse this situation and will whisper to the lonely heart.\n\nEven though the Quran does not mention physical possession by Jinn, in folklore it is believed a Jinn can haunt or possess a human being, causing illness, hallucinations or aggression. Such a possession is believed to be caused by harming a Jinn (even unintentionally), summoning them or when a Jinn falls in love with a human, wanting to become his/her husband/wife. Thereupon it requires an exorcism to get rid of the jinn.\n\nIn traditional Buddhism, four metaphorical forms of \"māra\" are given:\n\nAnd in the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, 50 types of skandha related demons (Fifty skandha-māras) been mentioned that can possess practitioners. Also flying demons from Devaputra-Mara that can be casted to the practitioner in order to confuse them, make them and their students believe they have achieved Enlightenment, then mislead them to wrong doings, wrong teachings, dangers, crisis and even death.\n\nIn Buddhism, a demon can either be a being suffering in the hell realm or it could be a delusion.\n\nPractitioner will go to the local Buddhist healer for treatment. The healer will commonly take their pulse and urine while offering counsel - the aim being to divine the origins of the patient's suffering. In the case possession they will also prescribe actions to appease the demon, like giving away food and clothing in its name. Afterward, it is believed that the demon will depart to a different realm.\n\nAccording to Augustine Calmet, several obsessions and possessions noted in the New Testament were simple maladies or fantastic fallacies which made it believed that such persons were possessed by the devil. The ignorance of the people maintained this prejudice, and their being totally unacquainted with physicians and medicine served to strengthen such ideas.\n\nThose who profess a belief in demonic possession have sometimes ascribed to possession the symptoms associated with physical or mental illnesses, such as hysteria, mania, psychosis, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia, conversion disorder or dissociative identity disorder. It is also not uncommon to ascribe the experience of sleep paralysis to demonic possession, although it's not a physical or mental illness. The symptoms vary across cultures. Demonic possession is not a valid psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognized by either the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. The DSM-5 indicates that personality states of dissociative identity disorder may be interpreted as possession in some cultures, and instances of spirit possession are often related to traumatic experiences--suggesting that possession experiences may be caused by mental distress. Some have expressed concern that belief in demonic possession can limit access to health care for the mentally ill.\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are consecrated to God by public profession (of simple, private vows) of the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. They have the full Habit, monastic customs and regular observances of the nuns of the Order of Preachers. This community is under jurisdiction of the local Ordinary, or Bishop. This community, however, though descended from a Second Order Monastery, is not a member of the Second Order of Friars Preachers and has yet to gain full recognition by the Dominican Order. They have the status of public association of the faithful, and have simple, private vows. They have constitutional rather than Papal enclosure. While awaiting pontifical recognition, the Lockport foundation adheres to the ideals and practices of the nuns of the Order of Preachers, though, again, not being member of the said Second Order and, for the time being, is of diocesan right as an autonomous juridic person, with canonical status in the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux. Technically they are not \"nuns\" because only religious who profess solemn vows can rightly be called 'nuns'. Since they only have simple, private vows they are not technically religious.\n\nThe Dominican Nuns came into existence 800 years ago (1206) when Saint Dominic began his Order of Preachers by first establishing a cloistered monastery of women in Prouille, France. In 1880, Dominican monastic life took root in the United States. Approximately 50 years later, only days after her sixteenth birthday, the then Anna Rita McKanna (later receiving the name in religion, Sister Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P.) entered the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament in Detroit, Michigan (since relocated to Farmington Hills, Michigan). Shortly after her solemn profession of vows there, this exemplary young religious was chosen to be one of the foundresses of the Dominican Monastery of the Infant Jesus in Lufkin, Texas (1945). Thirty-six years later, the Reverend Mother Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P., set out to found the Dominican Monastery of the Heart of Jesus in Lockport, Louisiana.\n\nThere is also a guesthouse on the monastery grounds with accommodations for individuals or groups. There are openings available year round. Discernment-based days consist of sharing in the liturgical prayer life of the Dominican Nuns within a balanced schedule that includes a daily series of personal/group interviews and question sessions in the grille parlor. It is during this time that a particular vocation to the Community may be explored. Private or silent retreats are an option generally exclusive to priests and religious. However, arrangements may be considered for others such as seminarians, tertiaries, or single women. Advance reservations are required.\n\n"}

The name has also been thought to have Hebrew origins because of its resemblance to \"erekh appayim\". It has been argued, even in antiquity, that the name \"Erikepaios\" was an Oriental import. Thus, John Malalas, the 6th century AD Antiotian historian, derives the name from the language spoken in his region. The name is first mentioned with certainty in the Orphic papyrus from Gurôb, a Dionysian mysteries text of the late 3rd century BC. \n\nThe mythographer Otto Gruppe suggested the Phanes-myth appeared in its original form in Babylonia. Thence it spread over the Near East, and took root particularly in Syria and Asia Minor. The gods of Babylon themselves were not imported, but the myth was attached to the local deities of the districts to which it spread.\n\nErikepaios became important in various Neoplatonic writings of the so-called \"Rhapsodic Theogony\", now lost, it was composed in the Hellenistic period, incorporating earlier works.

At the end of his life, he was a deacon of the Church of Carthage, and a renowned theologian, consulted in 546 by the Roman deacons Pelagius and Anatolius on the affair of the Three Chapters which had just broken out. Ferrand's reply was retained, but Facundus of Hermiane, writing in the winter of 546/47 recounts this consultation by referring to Ferrand as \" [...] laudabilis in Christo memoriæ Ferrando Carthaginiensi diacono scripserunt \". \nSince Pierre Pithou wrote in 1588 he was generally considered the author of the Life of Fulgence of Ruspe. However, this attribution is not based on any indication of the many manuscripts. Two letters of Ferrand about Fulgence are preserved, where he questions him on points of religion, and there are corresponding answers from Fulgence. At the end of a letter to the Abbe Eugippe , written just after the death of Fulgence ( 532 ), Ferrand evokes the projected drafting of a Life, but without positively saying the author. If Ferrand is the author of this Life, we learn in the prologue that he lived in the little monastery which Bishop Fulgence had founded during his relegation to Sardinia . But one of the last editors of the text, Antonino Isola, casts doubt on his authorship to the point of talking about \"Pseudo-Ferrand\". and choosing to nominate Redemptus a monk of Telepte as the author.\n\nAlso Ferrand preserves seven letters transmitted in bulk: the two by which he interrogates Fulgence de Ruspe (the first on the question of whether an Ethiopian catechumen, died while administered baptism, was saved, the second on dogma Of the Trinity and the question of whether the divinity of Christ suffered on the cross), and five others, some very long, which are true little treatises on theology (notably the answer to the deacons Pelagius and Anatolius on the Three Chapters, by which he pronounced against the edict of Justinian, or the very long letter to Count Reginus on the duties of a Christian officer, presented in the form of seven rules.

The Government on Taiwan generally respects freedom of religion in practise, with government policies continuing to contribute to the generally free practise of religion.\n\nTaiwan's strong human rights protections, lack of state-sanctioned discrimination, and generally high regard for freedom of religion or belief earned it a joint #1 ranking alongside The Netherlands and Belgium in the 2018 Freedom of Thought Report.\n\nTaiwan has an area of and a population of 23 million. The 2006 Government Information Office Yearbook, the Religious Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) states that 35 percent of the population consider themselves Buddhist and 33 percent Taoist. While the overwhelming majority of religious adherents are either Buddhist or Taoist, many people also consider themselves both Buddhist and Taoist .\n\nIn addition to practicing organized religion, many persons also followed a collection of beliefs deeply ingrained in Chinese culture that can be termed \"traditional Chinese folk religion.\" These beliefs may include some aspects of shamanism, ancestor worship, belief in ghosts and other spirits, and animism. Researchers and academics estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population believes in some form of traditional folk religion. Such folk religions may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or other traditional Chinese religions.\n\nTraditional Chinese religions with adherents constituting less than 5 percent of the population include: I Kuan Tao, Tien Ti Chiao (Heaven Emperor Religion), Tien Te Chiao (Heaven Virtue Religion), Li-ism, Hsuan Yuan Chiao (Yellow Emperor Religion), Tian Li Chiao (Tenrikyo), Universe Maitreya Emperor Religion, Hai Tze Tao, Confucianism, Zhonghua Sheng Chiao (Chinese Holy Religion), Da Yi Chiao (Great Changes Religion), Pre-cosmic Salvationism, and Huang Chung Chiao (Yellow Middle Religion).\n\nThere also may be an overlap between practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions with those of Falun Gong, which is registered as a civic, rather than religious, organization. In Taiwan, Falun Gong is generally considered a spiritual movement and not a religion. The leading proponent of Falun Gong in Taiwan reports that membership exceeds 500,000 and continues to grow rapidly.\n\nIn addition to traditional Chinese religions, small percentages of the population consider themselves Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Sunni Muslim. Several foreign missionary religious groups are also present. The Church of Scientology, the Baha'i, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mahikari Religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and the Unification Church are registered. Other Christian denominations present include Presbyterians, the True Jesus Church, Baptists, Lutherans, Seventh-day Adventists, and Episcopalians. Approximately 70 percent of the indigenous population of 475,000 Aborigines is Christian. There are also a small number of adherents of Judaism in Taiwan, mainly expatriates.\n\nWhile the Taiwanese authorities do not collect or independently verify statistics on religious affiliation, they maintain registration statistics voluntarily reported by religious organizations. Officials from the MOI Religious Affairs Section believe these voluntarily reported statistics significantly understate the number of people in Taiwan who adhere to religious beliefs and participate in some form of religious activities. The MOI Religious Affairs Section estimates that approximately 50 percent of the population regularly participates in some form of organized religious practice, as distinguished from \"traditional Chinese folk religions,\" and an estimated 14 percent of the population is atheist.\n\nReligious beliefs cross political and geographical lines. Members of the political leadership practice various faiths.\n\nTaiwan's constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice. Authorities at all levels protect this right in full, and do not tolerate its abuse, either by official or private actors. There is no state religion.\n\nAlthough registration is not mandatory, 26 religious organizations have registered with the MOI's Religious Affairs Section. Religious organizations may register with the central authorities through their island-wide associations under the Temple Management Law, the Civic Organizations Law, or the chapter of the Civil Code that governs foundations and associations. While individual places of worship may register with local authorities, many choose not to do so and operate as the personal property of their leaders. Registered religious organizations operate on a tax-free basis and are required to submit annual reports of their financial operations. The only ramification for nonregistration is the forfeiture of the tax advantages that are available for registered religious organizations. There were no reports that the authorities have sought to deny registration to new religions.\n\nReligious organizations are permitted to operate schools, but compulsory religious instruction is not permitted in any public or private elementary, middle, or high school accredited by the Ministry of Education (MOE). High schools accredited by the MOE, while not allowed to require religious instruction, may provide elective courses in religious studies, provided such courses do not promote certain religious beliefs over others. Universities and research institutions may have religious studies departments. Before 2004, legislation barred religious schools and theological institutes from applying for MOE accreditation, and the MOE did not recognize university-level degrees granted by these types of schools. In March 2004, the Legislative Yuan revised the Private Schools Act authorized the MOE to establish an accreditation process for university-level religious education institutions supported by religious organizations or private funds. In April 2006, the MOE promulgated regulations governing the accreditation process. In August 2006, the MOE accredited its first seminary, the Dharma Drum Buddhist College.\n\nTaiwan's policies and practices contribute to the generally free practice of religion.\n\nThere are no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in Taiwan.\n\nThere are no reports of forced religious conversion.\n\nThe MOI promotes interfaith understanding among religious groups by sponsoring symposiums or helping to defray the expenses of privately sponsored symposiums on religious issues. The MOI also publishes and updates an introduction to major religious beliefs and groups based on material provided by the groups. This introduction is also available on the internet. In May 2006, the MOI invited some 100 leaders from religious organizations to participate in a two-day tour of outstanding social services organizations operated by religious charities, to foster cooperation among organizations with similar social welfare goals. The MOI holds an annual ceremony to honor religious groups for their contributions to public service, social welfare, and social harmony. Some 170 different organizations and individuals are recognized.\n\nOn 23 January 2007, President Chen personally congratulated local Muslims who had completed a pilgrimage to Mecca, and praised Taiwan's Muslim Association (Chinese Muslim Association, an organization that is fully independent from the government) for promoting frequent exchanges between Taiwan and the Islamic world. President Chen also credited practicing Muslims on Taiwan for helping to create a richer, more diverse culture on the island.\n\nThere have been no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Prominent societal leaders have taken positive steps to promote religious tolerance. For instance, the Taiwan Council for Religion and Peace, the China Religious Believers Association, and the Taiwan Religious Association are private organizations that promote greater understanding and tolerance among adherents of different religions. These associations and various religious groups occasionally sponsor symposiums to promote mutual understanding. The Taiwan Conference on Religion and Peace sponsors summer seminars every year to help college students understand the practice of major religions in Taiwan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1064157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1064157", "title": "Gaudiya Vaishnavism", "text": "Gaudiya Vaishnavism\n\nGaudiya Vaishnavism (also known as (Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition, Bengali Vaishnavism, or Chaitanya Vaishnavism) is a Vaishnava religious movement inspired by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534) in India. \"Gauḍīya\" refers to the Gauḍa region (present day Bengal/Bangladesh) with Vaishnavism meaning \"the worship of Vishnu or Krishna\". Its theological basis is primarily that of the Bhagavad Gītā and Bhāgavata Purāṇa as interpreted by early disciples of Chaitanya such as Sanātana Gosvāmin, Rūpa Gosvāmin, Jīva Gosvāmin, Gopala Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmin, and others.\n\nThe focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (\"bhakti\") of Radha and Krishna, and their many divine incarnations as the supreme forms of God, \"Svayam Bhagavan\". Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's holy names, such as \"Hare\", \"Krishna\" and \"Rama\", most commonly in the form of the Hare Krishna (mantra), also known as kirtan. The movement is sometimes referred to as the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya sampradaya, referring to its traditional origins in the succession of spiritual masters (gurus) believed to originate from Brahma. It classifies itself as a monotheistic tradition, seeing the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, \"adipurusha\".\n\nAccording to Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, consciousness is not a product of matter, but is instead a symptom of the soul. All living beings (jivas), are distinct from their current body - the nature of the soul being eternal, immutable, and indestructible without any particular beginning or end. Souls which are captivated by the illusory nature of the world (\"Maya\") are repeatedly reborn among the various (8,400,000 in number) species of life on this planet and on other worlds in accordance to the laws of karma and individual desire. This is consistent with the concept of \"samsara\" found throughout Hindu belief.\n\nRelease from the process of \"samsara\" (known as \"moksha\") is believed to be achievable through a variety of spiritual practices. However, within Gaudiya Vaishnavism it is \"bhakti\" in its purest state (or \"pure love of God\") which is given as the ultimate aim, rather than liberation from the cycle of rebirth.\n\nOne of the defining aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is that Krishna is worshiped specifically as the source of all Avataric incarnations of God. This is based on quotations from the Bhagavata Purana, such as \"krsnāstu bhagavan svayam\", literally \"Krishna is God Himself\".\n\nA particularly distinct part of the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy espoused by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is the concept of \"Achintya Bheda Abheda\", which translates to \"inconceivable oneness and difference\" in the context of the soul's relationship with Krishna, and also Krishna's relationship with his other energies (i.e. the material world).\n\nIn \"quality\", the soul (\"jiva\") is described as being identical to God, but in terms of \"quantity\" individual \"jivas\" are said to be infinitesimal in comparison to the unlimited Supreme Being. The exact nature of this relationship (being simultaneously one and different with Krishna) is inconceivable to the human mind, but can be experienced through the process of Bhakti yoga.\n\nThis philosophy serves as a meeting of two opposing schools of Hindu philosophy, pure monism (God and the soul as one entity) and pure dualism (God and the soul as absolutely separate). This philosophy largely recapitulates the concepts of qualified nondualism practiced by the older Vedantic school Vishishtadvaita, but emphasizes the figure of Krishna over Narayana and holy sites in and around Bengal over sites in Tamil Nadu. In practice Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy has much more in common with the dualistic schools especially closely following theological traditions established by Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta.\n\nThe practical process of devotional life is described as \"bhakti\" or \"bhakti-yoga\". The two main elements of the \"bhakti-yoga\" process are \"vaidhi bhakti\", which is devotional service through practice of rules and regulations (\"sadhana\") and \"raganuga bhakti\", which is taken as a higher stage of more spontaneous devotional service based on a selfless desire to please one's chosen \"Ishta-deva\" of Krishna or his associated expansions and avatars. Practicing \"vaidhi-bhakti\" with a view to cultivate \"prema\" creates eligibility for \"raganuga-sadhana\". Both \"vaidhi\" and \"raganuga bhakti\" are based on the chanting or singing of Krishna's names. Attainment of the raganuga stage means that rules of lifestyle are no longer important and that emotions or any material activities for Krishna should not be repressed. Vaidhi-bhakti's purpose is to elevate the devotee to raganuga; something which generally takes a long time.\n\nWithin his \"Siksastaka\" prayers, Chaitanya compares the process of \"bhakti-yoga\" to that of cleansing a dirty place of dust, wherein our consciousness is the object in need of purification. This purification takes place largely through the chanting and singing of Radha and Krishna's names. Specifically the Hare Krishna (mantra) is chanted and sung by practitioners on a daily basis, sometimes for many hours each day. Famously within the tradition, one of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's close associates, Haridasa Thakur, is reported to have chanted 300,000 holy names of God each day.\n\nGaudiya Vaishnavas follow a Lacto vegetarian diet, abstaining from all types of animal flesh, including fish and eggs. Onions and garlic are also avoided as they are believed to promote a more \"tamasic\" form of consciousness in the eater when taken in large quantities. Gaudiya Vaishnavas also avoid the intake of caffeine, as they believe it is addictive and an intoxicant. \n\nMany Gaudiya Vaishnavas will live for at least some time in their life as monks (\"brahmacharya\").\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu (also transliterated Caitanya, IAST \"\"; 18 February 1486 – 14 June 1534) was a Bengali spiritual teacher who founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism. He is believed by his devotees to be Krishna himself who appeared in the form of His own devotee in order to teach the people of this world the process of Bhakti and how to attain the perfection of life. He is considered as the most merciful manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya was the proponent for the Vaishnava school of Bhakti yoga (meaning loving devotion to God), based on \"Bhagavata Purana\" and \"Bhagavad Gita\". Of various incarnations of Vishnu, he is revered as Krishna, popularised the chanting of the \"Hare Krishna\" mantra and composed the \"Siksastakam\" (eight devotional prayers) in Sanskrit. His followers, Gaudiya Vaishnavas, revere him as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.\n\nOver the three centuries following the disappearance of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition evolved into the form in which we largely find it today in contemporary India. In the early years of the tradition, the followers of Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acharya and other companions of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu educated and initiated people, each in their own locales across Bengal.\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu requested a select few among his followers, who later came to be known as the Six Gosvamis of Vrindavan, to systematically present his theology of bhakti in their writings. This theology emphasized the devotee's relationship to the Divine Couple, Radha and Krishna, and looked to Caitanya as the embodiment of both Radha and Krishna. The six were Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha dasa Goswami and Jiva Goswami. In the second generation of the tradition, Narottama, Srinivasa and Shyamananda, three students of Jiva Goswami, the youngest among the six Goswamis, were instrumental in spreading the theology across Bengal and Orissa.\n\nThe festival of Kheturi (approx 1574), presided over by Jahnava Thakurani, the wife of Nityananda Rama, was the first time the leaders of the various branches of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's followers assembled together. Through such festivals, members of the loosely organized tradition became acquainted with other branches along with their respective theological and practical nuances. That notwithstanding, the tradition has maintained its plural nature, having no central authority to preside over its matters. The festival of Kheturi allowed for the systemization of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology as a distinct branch of Vaishnava theology.\n\nGaudiya Matha historians assert that in the 17th–18th century, there was a period of general decline in the movement's strength and popularity characterized by decreased preaching and appearance of persons following and promoting degraded teachings and practices. These groups are called \"apasampradayas\".\n\nIn the 17th century, Vishvanath Chakravarti Thakur held great merit in clarifying core doctrinal issues over the practice of \"raganuga-bhakti\" through works such as \"Raga-vartma-chandrika\". His student Baladeva Vidyabhushan wrote a famous commentary on the Vedanta-sutra called Govinda Bhashya.\n\nThe 18th century saw a number of luminaries headed by Siddha Jayakrishna Das Babaji of Kamyavan and Siddha Krishnadas Babaji of Govardhan. The latter, a widely renowned teacher of the mode of internal worship (\"raga-bhajan\") practiced in the tradition, is largely responsible for the current form of devotional practice embraced by some of the traditions based in Vrindavan.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Chaitanya's \"bhakti\" movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and others Muslim by birth were the participants. This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakur's broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalized by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century.\n\nThis period was followed by a renaissance which began at the start of the 20th century. This change is believed to have happened largely due to the efforts of a particularly adept preacher known as Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who also held the position of a deputy magistrate with the British government. Bhaktivinoda Thakur's son grew up to be both an eminent scholar and highly influential Vaishnava preacher, known in his later life as Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. In total, Bhaktisidhanta Sarasvati Thakur founded in 1918 Gaudiya Math and later sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe. The first European preaching center was established in London in 1933 (London Glouster House, Cornwall Garden, W7 South Kensington) under the name 'Gaudiya Mission Society of London'.\n\nSoon after the Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's death (1 January 1937), a dispute began and the original Gaudiya Math mission divided into two administrative bodies which continued preaching on their own, up to the present day. In a settlement they divided the 64 Gaudiya Math centers into two groups. 'Sri Chaitanya Math' Branch were headed by Srila Bhakti Vilasa Tirtha Maharaj. 'Gaudiya Mission' were headed by Ananta Vasudev Prabhu, who became known as Srila Bhakti Prasad Puri Maharaj after accepting sannyasa for short duration.\n\nMany of the disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati did not agree with the spirit of these newly created two fractions, or were simply inspired to expand the mission of their guru on their own enthusiasm, started their own missions. His disciple Srila Prabhupada went to the west in order to spread Gaudiya-Vaishnavism. The society he established, the 'International Society for Krishna Consciousness' (ISKCON) still functions today and continues its preaching mission.\n\nAlthough sharing a common set of core beliefs, there are a number of philosophical differences which distinguish Gaudiya Vaishnavism from other Vaishnava schools:\n\n\"O most munificent incarnation! You are Krishna Himself appearing as Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. You have assumed the golden colour of Srimati Radharani, and You are widely distributing pure love of Krishna. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.\" \nAlthough this viewpoint outside of the Gaudiya tradition was disputed, Chaitanya's followers prove it by pointing at verses throughout the Puranic literatures as evidence to support this claim.\n\nGaudiya Vaishnava theology is prominently expounded by Jiva Goswami in his \"Sat-sandarbhas\", six elaborate treatises on various aspects of God. Other prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava theologians are his uncles, Rupa Gosvami author of \"Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu\" and Sanatana Gosvami, author of \"Hari-bhakti-vilasa\", Visvanatha Chakravarti author of \"Sri Camatkara-candrika\" and Baladeva Vidyabhushana, author of \"Govinda Bhashya\", a famous commentary on Vedanta Sutra.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3270604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3270604", "title": "Hindu milk miracle", "text": "Hindu milk miracle\n\nThe Hindu milk miracle was a phenomenon which occurred on 21 September 1995, in which statues of the Hindu deity Ganesha were thought to be drinking milk offerings. \n\nThe news spread very quickly in various Indian and American cities, as Indians everywhere tried to \"feed\" idols of Ganesha with milk and spread the news through telephones and word of mouth, mostly in large cities and towns. It attracted great attention from people and the media particularly in India. The scientific explanation for the incident, attested by Indian academics, was that the material was pulled up from the offering bowls by capillary action. However, in most cases, it appeared to have been caused by a mix of surface tension, capillary effect, confirmation bias wherein people believed what they wanted to believe, in addition to what is termed group think.\n\nBefore dawn on 21 September 1995, a worshipper at a temple in south New Delhi made an offering of milk to a statue of Ganesha. When a spoonful of milk from the bowl was held up to the trunk of the statue, the liquid appeared to disappear, apparently taken in by the idol. Word of the event spread quickly, and by mid-morning it was found that statues of the entire Hindu pantheon in temples all over India were taking in milk.\n\nBy noon the news had spread beyond India, and Hindu temples in the United Kingdom, Canada, UAE, and Nepal among other countries had successfully replicated the phenomenon, and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (an Indian Hindu nationalist organisation which provides social services to Hindus in India and across the world) announced that a miracle was occurring. In the United States, it was said to have been observed at the Hindu Temple Society of North America (Ganesh Temple)\n\nThe reported miracle had a significant effect on the areas around major temples; vehicle and pedestrian traffic in New Delhi was dense enough to create a gridlock lasting until late in the evening. Many stores in areas with significant Hindu communities saw a massive jump in sales of milk, with one Gateway store in England selling over 25,000 pints of milk, and overall milk sales in New Delhi jumped over 30%. Many minor temples struggled to deal with the vast increase in numbers, and queues spilled out into the streets, reaching distances of over a mile. Cable television channels in Mumbai started to stream scenes at temples live, while the popular Sidhi Vinayak temple decided to close its gates, with a large notice stating that its Ganesha idol did not drink milk.\n\nSeeking to explain the phenomenon, Ross McDowall from India's Ministry of Science and Technology travelled to a temple in New Delhi and made an offering of milk containing a food colouring. As the level of liquid in the spoon dropped, the scientists hypothesised that after the milk disappeared from the spoon, it coated the statue beneath where the spoon was placed. With this result, the scientists offered capillary action as an explanation; the surface tension of the milk was pulling the liquid up and out of the spoon, before gravity caused it to run down the front of the statue. Prabir Ghosh was one of the people to demonstrate how the Hindus were coaxed into believing the miracle.\n\nTo those who believed in the miracle, further proof was offered when the phenomenon seemed to cease before the end of the day, with many statues refusing to take more milk even before noon. A small number of temples outside of India reported the effect continuing for several more days, but no further reports were made after the beginning of October. However, skeptics hold the incident to be an example of mass hysteria. The story was picked up, mostly as a novelty piece, by news services around the world, including CNN, the BBC, the \"New York Times\" and the \"Guardian\".\n\nThe miracle allegedly occurred again on 20–21 August 2006 in almost exactly the same fashion, although initial reports seem to indicate that it occurred only with statues of Ganesh, Shiva, and Durga. The first reported occurrence was on the evening of the 20th in the city of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, from where it quickly spread throughout India, but this time was not believed by many. However, the incident was again attributed to capillary action by scientists. The phenomenon had reappeared only days after reports of sea water turning sweet that led to mass hysteria in Mumbai.\n\nIn 1995, the phenomenon also occurred in Trinidad; milk was accepted by both murtis and religious pictures. The phenomenon occurred in Hindu temples as well as at the homes of Hindus in Trinidad. \"Trinidad Express\" newspaper reported on 22 September 2010 that statues of Ganesh \"drank\" or accepted milk at Om Shanti Mandir, Cunjal Road, Princes Town, Trinidad on 21 September 2010 on the occasion of the holy period of Ganesh Utsav.\n\n"}

{"id": "1201811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1201811", "title": "Ishvara", "text": "Ishvara\n\nIshvara (Sanskrit: ईश्वर, IAST: Īśvara) is a concept in Hinduism, with a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism. In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, \"Ishvara\" can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen or husband. In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, \"Ishvara\" means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self.\n\nIn Shaivism, \"Ishvara\" is synonymous with \"Shiva\", sometimes as \"Maheshvara\" or \"Parameshvara\" meaning the \"Supreme lord\", or as an Ishta-deva (personal god). In Vaishnavism, it is synonymous with Vishnu. In traditional Bhakti movements, Ishvara is one or more deities of an individual's preference from Hinduism's polytheistic canon of deities. In modern sectarian movements such as Arya Samaj and Brahmoism, Ishvara takes the form of a monotheistic God. In Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any \"personal deity\" or \"spiritual inspiration\". In Advaita Vedanta school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.\n\nThe root of the word Ishvara comes from \"īś-\" (ईश, Ish) which means \"capable of\" and \"owner, ruler, chief of\", ultimately cognate with English \"own\" (Germanic \"*aigana-\", PIE \"*aik-\"). The second part of the word \"Ishvara\" is \"vara\" which means depending on context, \"best, excellent, beautiful\", \"choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift\", and \"suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage\". The composite word, \"Ishvara\" literally means \"owner of best, beautiful\", \"ruler of choices, blessings, boons\", or \"chief of suitor, lover\".\n\nAs a concept, \"Ishvara\" in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Soul, lord, king or ruler, rich or wealthy man, god of love, deity Shiva, one of the Rudras, prince, husband and the number eleven.\n\nThe word \"Īśvara\" never appears in Rigveda. However, the verb \"īś-\" does appear in Rig veda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is \"capable of, able to\". It is absent in Samaveda, is rare in Atharvaveda, appears in Samhitas of Yajurveda. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini explains, is neither god nor supreme being.\n\nThe word \"Ishvara\" appears in numerous ancient Dharmasutras. However, Patrick Olivelle states that there \"Ishvara\" does not mean God, but means Vedas. Deshpande states that \"Ishvara\" in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that \"the Dharmasutras are as important as \"Ishvara\" (the king) on matters of public importance\".\n\nIn Saivite traditions of Hinduism, the term is used as part of the compound \"Maheshvara\" (\"great lord\") as a name for Shiva. In Mahayana Buddhism it is used as part of the compound \"Avalokiteśvara\" (\"lord who hears the cries of the world\"), the name of a bodhisattva revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in Shaktism, the feminine \"\" is sometimes used.\n\nAmong the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of \"Ishvara\", i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.\n\nDesmarais states that Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras. It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (\"Bhakti\"), nor does it give \"Ishvara\" characteristics typically associated with a deity. In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term \"Ishvara\" as the \"Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings\". Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, \"Isvara\" is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.\n\nZimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school. Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, Hare Krishna movement considers Krishna as the Lord, Arya Samaj and Brahmoism movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord. In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta of Ramanuja and Dvaita Vedanta of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the \"Prakriti\" (material world) and \"Purusa\" (soul, spirit).\n\nRadhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in \"Isvara\" concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of \"personal God\" where the \"ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed\". Riepe, and others, state that schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Isvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of \"deity of one's choice\" or \"formless Brahman (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)\".\n\nSamkhya is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars. Others, such as , Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic. Isvara is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.\n\nThe Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of Yoga school of Hinduism, uses the term \"Ishvara\" in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is \"Isvara\"? These commentaries range from defining \"Isvara\" from a \"personal god\" to \"special self\" to \"anything that has spiritual significance to the individual\". Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of \"Isvara\" in Yoga philosophy functions as a \"transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation\".\n\nPatanjali defines \"Isvara\" (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as \"a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, \"puruṣa-viśeṣa\")\",\n\nSanskrit: <br>\n– Yoga Sutras I.24\n\nThis sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of \"Isvara\" as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, \"aparamrsta\") by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, \"klesha\"), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, \"karma\"), one's life fruits (विपाक, \"vipâka\"), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).\n\nPatanjali's concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.\n\nVaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on \"Ishvara\" for its atomistic naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and \"paramāṇu\" (atoms) were eternal, they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal \"adrsta\" (अदृष्ट, invisible) laws of nature. The concept of \"Ishvara\", among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in 1st millennium AD. This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called \"atoms\" have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vaiśeṣika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do its thing. Thus, Vaisheshika's Ishvara mirrors Deus otiosus of Deism. Vaisheshika school's \"Ishvara\", states Klaus Klostermaier, can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He \"winds up the clock, and lets it run its course\".\n\nEarly Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists. Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of \"Ishvara\".\n\nIn Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including \"Ishvara\". Verses 19-21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.\n\nCenturies later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by Udayana, who in his text \"Nyayakusumanjali\", interpreted \"it\" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as \"human action\" and \"him\" as \"Ishvara\", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara. In developing his arguments, he inherently defined \"Ishvara\" as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the karma doctrine work.\n\nMīmāṃsā scholars of Hinduism questioned what is \"Ishvara\" (God)? They used their \"pramana\" tools to cross examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God's creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara's love to human beings because this world – if Ishvara created it – is imperfect and human souls are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises, deconstructed justifications offered, and considered Ishvara concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).\n\nAdvaita Vedanta school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiShamya NairgghruNya doSha vihInaH). Ishvara is that which is \"free from \"avidya\" (ignorance), free from \"ahamkrti\" (ego-sense), free from \"bandhana\" (bondage)\", a Self that is \"pure, enlightened, liberated\". \nHaving accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as 'saguNa' or with attributes from the empirical existence and 'nirguNa' from the absolute sense. This oneness is accepted only at the level of 'mukti' or ultimate realization and not at the 'vyavahara' or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between \"Jiva\" (living being) and \"Ishvara\", and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.\n\nOther Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the monist views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is \"above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything\"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself – he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.\n\"Ishvara\", in Vishishtadvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or \"non-dualism with differentiation\". Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century Ramanuja state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with Brahman. Equated with Vishnu in Vishishtadvaita or one of his avatar, he is both the material and efficient cause, transcendent and immanent. Ishvara manifests in five forms, believe Vishishtadvaitins: \"para\" (transcendent), \"vyuha\" (emanations), \"vibhava\" (incarnations), \"antaryamin\" (dwells inside), and \"arca\" (icons). According to this sub-school, states John Grimes, Ishvara possesses six divine qualities: \"jnana\" (knowledge), \"bala\" (strength), \"aisvarya\" (lordship), \"sakti\" (power), \"virya\" (virility) and \"tejas\" (splendor).\n\nRamanuja's Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by Sri Aurobindo and has been suggested as having influenced Basava's Lingayatism.\n\nThe Dvaita (dualism) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines \"Ishvara\" as creator God that is distinct from \"Jiva\" (individual souls in living beings). Narayana (Vishnu) is considered to be \"Ishvara\", and the Vaishnavism movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.\n\n\"Ishvara\" (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta. In Dvaita sub-school, \"Jiva\" (individual soul) is different, yet dependent on \"Ishvara\" (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual soul is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of \"Jiva\" struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested.\n\nMadhva states there are five permutations of differences between \"Jiva\" (individual souls) and \"Ishvara\" (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative. Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, to the state of moksha in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.\n\nThe world, called \"Maya\", is held as the divine will of Ishvara. \"Jiva\" suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of \"ignorance and incorrect knowledge\" (\"ajnana\"). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana. It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of \"sattva\" guna (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a dharmic life while constantly remembering, deeply loving \"Ishvara\".\n\n is a sub-school of Vedanta representing the philosophy of \"inconceivable one-ness and difference\", in relation to the power creation and creator, Ishvara, (Krishna).\n\nIn Sanskrit \"achintya\" means 'inconceivable', \"bheda\" translates as 'difference', and \"abheda\" translates as 'one-ness'. Spirit souls are considered part of God and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.\n\nCaitanya's philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva completed the progression to devotional theism. Rāmānuja had agreed with that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. Madhva had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the Jīva: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jīvas are \"inconceivably, simultaneously one and different\" (acintya-bheda-abheda).\n\nCārvāka, another atheist tradition in Hinduism, was materialist and a school of philosophical scepticism. They rejected all concepts of \"Ishvara\" as well as all forms of supernaturalism.\n"}

The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s during Seattle's grunge movement, and is known for its distinctive vocal style and the harmonized vocals between Cantrell and Layne Staley (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on Alice in Chains' 1992 EP \"Sap\". After Staley's death in 2002, Cantrell took the role of Alice in Chains' lead singer on most of the songs from the band's three albums without Staley, \"Black Gives Way to Blue\" (2009), \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\" (2013) and \"Rainier Fog\" (2018), with DuVall harmonizing with him in the new songs and singing Staley's vocals in the old songs in live concerts.\n\nHe also has a solo career, having released the albums \"Boggy Depot\" in 1998 and \"Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2\" in 2002. Cantrell has also collaborated and performed with Heart, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Pantera, Circus of Power, Metal Church, Gov't Mule, Damageplan, Pearl Jam, The Cult, Stone Temple Pilots, Danzig, Glenn Hughes, Duff McKagan and Deftones, among others.\n\nCantrell was named \"Riff Lord\" by British hard rock/metal magazine Metal Hammer in 2006. Guitar World Magazine ranked Cantrell 38th out of \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time\" in 2004, and the 37th Greatest Guitar Player of All Time in 2012. \"Guitar World\" also ranked Cantrell's solo in \"Man In The Box\" at No. 77 on their list of \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" in 2008.\n\nHe also contributed to the soundtrack of \"The Cable Guy\" (1996), \"\" (2017) and \"\" (2018), and has made cameos in the films \"Jerry Maguire\" (1996) and \"Rock Slyde\" (2009). Cantrell also acted in the Alice in Chains mockumentaries \"The Nona Tapes\" (1995) and \"\" (2013).\n\nCantrell was born in Tacoma, Washington, on March 18, 1966, to Gloria Jean Krumpos and Jerry Fulton Cantrell. He grew up in Spanaway, and is the oldest of three children. His father is an Army veteran, and his mother was an amateur organist and melodica player who worked as an administrative assistant for the Clover Park School District in Pierce County, Washington.\n\nHis maternal grandmother was from Norway, and his maternal grandfather was from Czech Republic.\n\nAfter Cantrell learned to write, he documented his goal on Dr. Seuss' book \"My Book About Me\", filling in the sentence \"When I grow up I want to be a...\" with the words \"rock star\".\n\nCantrell's father, Jerry Sr., is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. Jerry Jr.'s first childhood memory is meeting his father for the first time after he had returned from war when he was 3 years old. Due to the strain of war, his parents divorced when he was seven years old, and Cantrell was raised by his mother, Gloria, and his maternal grandmother in Tacoma. The family lived on welfare and food stamps. His father was the main subject in the song \"Rooster\", which Cantrell wrote as a tribute to his father, and his mother Gloria is also mentioned by name in the song. Father and son also appeared together on the music video for \"Rooster\", in which Jerry Sr. recalls the war.\n\nCantrell moved back with his mother to Spanaway where he attended junior high. His first job was delivering newspapers.\nCantrell attended high school at Spanaway Lake High School, and, before owning his first guitar, he was a member of the high school choir which attended many state competitions. In his senior year, Cantrell became choir president, and the quartet sang the national anthem at basketball games and won competitions with the highest marks achievable. Cantrell has cited his interest in dark musical tones as dating back to this period: \"In choir we performed a cappella Gregorian chants from the 14th and 15th centuries. It was scary church music.\" His choir teacher and drama teacher were, early on, his two greatest motivators toward a career in music. When Alice in Chains' first album went gold, Cantrell sent both teachers a gold record. He graduated from high school in 1984.\n\nCantrell picked up a guitar for the first time when he was in sixth grade. At that time he played clarinet, and his mother was dating a guitar player who handed his guitar to Cantrell and taught him a couple of chords. Cantrell picked it up very quickly, impressing his mother's boyfriend who suggested that she should buy her son a guitar, so she bought him an acoustic guitar. It would not be until the age of 17 that he began seriously playing an electric guitar. Cantrell learned to play guitar by ear emulating his idols. He bought his first guitar, a Korean-made Fender Stratocaster, from a swap meet in his mid teens.\n\nHis maternal grandmother, Dorothy Krumpos, died of cancer in October 1986, and his mother Gloria died of pancreatic cancer at age 43 in April 1987, when Cantrell was 21 years old. Friends recalled that Cantrell fell into depression and became a completely different person after losing both his mother and grandmother within a short span of time.\n\nCantrell's first album was \"Elton John Greatest Hits\", which was a gift he received from his father when he was 10 years old. He noted in an interview that he was \"raised on country music\" as a youth and that he admires the emotion conveyed in the genre. He also considers himself \"half Yankee and half redneck\". However, hard rock music caught Cantrell's interest predominantly. He would later cite guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Ace Frehley, Tony Iommi, Angus Young, Jimmy Page, Glenn Tipton, K.K. Downing, David Gilmour, Nancy Wilson, and Eddie Van Halen as major influences, as well as Elton John and bands Fleetwood Mac, Heart and Rush as his early songwriting idols. Cantrell also cited Soundgarden as a big influence on him.\n\nIn 1985, Cantrell was going to winter semester of college, but he decided to quit it and moved to Dallas, Texas to join a band with a couple of friends.\n\nCantrell worked doing asbestos abatement around the Dallas and Houston area. He also worked at the music store Arnold and Morgan Music Company. While working at the store, Cantrell bought what he described as his first \"real guitar\", a 1984 G&L Rampage. During that time, he had a band with Vinnie Chas (from Pretty Boy Floyd), called Sinister. Later they formed another band called Raze.\n\nWhile living in Dallas, Cantrell met an early incarnation of Pantera and started a long friendship with brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul.\n\nIn 1985 or 1986, Cantrell moved back to Tacoma and began a band called Diamond Lie, which included singer Scott Damon, drummer Bobby Nesbitt and bassist Matt Muasau. The band started playing concerts in Tacoma and Seattle with the goal of getting a record deal and also recorded a four-song demo at London Bridge Studio.\n\nWhen Cantrell was 20 years old, he was working several part-time jobs to pay his rent, one of which involved throwing boxes of frozen fish in a warehouse. He spent his time outside of work playing guitar and jamming with any band he could find.\n\nThree weeks after his mother's death on April 11, 1987, Cantrell went to see the band Alice N' Chains perform at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by the voice of the lead singer, Layne Staley. Diamond Lie played their last concert in July 1987.\n\nCantrell met Layne Staley, then Alice N' Chains's lead singer, at a party in Seattle around August 1987. He was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the 24 hour rehearsal studio \"The Music Bank\". Shortly after Cantrell moved in with Staley at the Music Bank, Alice ‘N Chains broke up.\n\nCantrell wanted to form a new band and Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band called Gypsy Rose in Burien. Kinney pointed at his girlfriend and said: \"that's weird cause that's his sister\". Kinney called Starr and a few days later he jammed with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank. But they didn't have a singer.\n\nStaley was already starting up another band, but Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted him to be their lead singer. They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Staley, who was Cantrell's roommate at the time, agreed to join on the condition that Cantrell join his funk project (which ended shortly after), and Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. The band had names like \"Mothra\", \"Fuck\" and \"Diamond Lie\", the latter being the name of Cantrell's previous band.\n\nDiamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley's previous band, \"Alice N' Chains\", then renamed Alice in Chains.\n\nCantrell attended Guns N' Roses' concert at the Seattle Center in 1988 and took an Alice in Chains demo tape to give to the band. He met Axl Rose after the show and gave him the tape. As he was walking away, Cantrell saw Rose throwing the demo away. Years later, Guns N' Roses picked Alice in Chains to be the opening act of their 2016 reunion tour.\n\nAlice in Chains' final demo, \"The Treehouse Tapes\", was completed in 1988 and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle bands Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden, respectively. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records. After three months of negotiations, Alice in Chains signed to Columbia Records on September 11, 1989.\n\nJerry Cantrell served as the lead guitarist, co-lyricist, co-vocalist and main composer of Alice in Chains until the group's near-permanent hiatus beginning in the late 1990s and leading through the death of lead singer Layne Staley in April 2002. Cantrell's guitar contribution gave a heavy metal edge to the band's unique grunge style. Cantrell also played bass on the track \"Love Song\", from the 1992 \"Sap\" EP.\n\nCantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP \"Sap\", and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band. Cantrell stated that it was Staley who encouraged him to sing.\n\nAlthough Alice in Chains has been labeled grunge by the mainstream media, Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told \"Guitar World\" in 1996, \"We're a lot of different things ... I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to\".\n\nAlice in Chains was one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone.\n\nTheir debut album, \"Facelift\", was released in 1990 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA, selling over two million copies. Cantrell dedicated the album to his late mother Gloria and to his close friend Andrew Wood, lead singer of the band Mother Love Bone who died in 1990. Speaking with \"Spin\" magazine in January 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song \"Sunshine\" from \"Facelift\" was written about his mother's death. \"When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, \"I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of you like you took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't know how to deal with it then, and I still don't. But it gave me the impetus to do what I'm doing.\"\n\nIn February 1992, the band released the acoustic EP \"Sap\". The EP has been certified gold and it features guest vocals by Ann Wilson from the band Heart, who joined Staley and Cantrell for the choruses of \"Brother\", \"Am I Inside\", and \"Love Song\". The EP also features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who appeared together on the song \"Right Turn\", credited as \"Alice Mudgarden\" in the liner notes. The opening track, \"Brother\", featured Cantrell on lead vocals. The song was about Cantrell's relationship with his younger brother, David. Cantrell also played bass on the last track, \"Love Song\".\n\nTheir second full-length album, \"Dirt\", was released in September 1992 to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. The album's lead single, \"Would?\", was written by Cantrell as a tribute to his late friend Andrew Wood. The song was also featured on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe's 1992 film \"Singles\". The album's fourth single, \"Rooster\", was a tribute to Cantrell's father.\n\nAlice in Chains' second acoustic EP, \"Jar of Flies\", debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in 1994, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice in Chains release to top the charts. It has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The album's fifth track was an instrumental song, \"Whale & Wasp\", described by Cantrell as \"a conversation between whales and wasps\".\n\nAlice in Chains broke up for six months following the cancellation of their opening act at the Metallica tour in July 1994, citing \"health problems within the band\".\n\nThe band's third full-length album, \"Alice in Chains\", was released in November 1995, debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and has been certified double platinum. The singles \"Grind\", \"Over Now\", and \"Heaven Beside You\" feature Cantrell on lead vocals. The band did not tour in support of their self-titled album.\n\nOn April 10, 1996, Alice in Chains made their first concert in two and a half years for \"MTV Unplugged\", a program featuring all-acoustic set lists. The show featured some of the band's highest charting singles, including \"Rooster\", \"Down in a Hole\", \"Heaven Beside You\", \"No Excuses\" and \"Would?\", and introduced a new song, \"Killer Is Me\", with Cantrell on lead vocals. Cantrell stated that he was ill during the performance as a result of food poisoning from a hot dog consumed before the gig.\n\nAlice in Chains performed four shows supporting Kiss on their Alive/Worldwide Tour in 1996, including the final live appearance of Layne Staley on July 3, 1996 in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was hospitalized. Staley rarely left his condo in Seattle, but in 1998 the band reunited to record two new songs, \"Get Born Again\" and \"Died\", originally intended for Cantrell's second solo album, the songs were released on the 1999 box set \"Music Bank\". Still in 1999, the band released a 15-track compilation titled \"\". Their first compilation, titled \"Live\", was released on December 5, 2000. In 2001, a second compilation titled \"Greatest Hits\" was released.\n\nAlthough never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reformed in 2005 when drummer Sean Kinney had the idea to reunite the surviving members to perform a benefit concert for the victims of the tsunami disaster that struck South Asia in 2004. On February 18, 2005, Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in 10 years as Alice in Chains at the \"K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert\" in Seattle. The band featured Damageplan vocalist Pat Lachman, as well as other special guests including Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Wes Scantlin from Puddle of Mudd and Ann Wilson of Heart. A few months after that concert, the band called their former manager Susan Silver and Cantrell's manager Bill Siddons and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, Cantrell, Inez and Kinney performed at VH1's Decades Rock Live concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. They played \"Would?\" with vocalist Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down and bass player Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, then they played \"Rooster\" with Ann Wilson and Comes with the Fall vocalist William DuVall. The band followed the concert with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour in Japan. To coincide with the band's reunion, Sony Music released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, \"The Essential Alice in Chains\", a double album that includes 28 songs.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, Cantrell played in a number of concerts with Alice in Chains featuring guest lead singers such as Ann Wilson, Mark Lanegan, James Hetfield, Phil Anselmo, Billy Corgan, Scott Weiland Sebastian Bach, and William DuVall. Although Cantrell acknowledges the benefits of working as a solo artist, he expressed his happiness with being back in the band culture.\n\nCantrell explained the band's reunion saying, \"We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [Staley's] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to take a chance on it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on.\"\n\nCantrell met singer William DuVall in Los Angeles in 2000, through a mutual acquaintance who introduced him to \nthe first album of DuVall's band, Comes with the Fall. Cantrell started hanging out with the band and occasionally joining them onstage. Comes with the Fall was both the opening act on Cantrell's tour for his second solo album, \"Degradation Trip\", and also the singer's backing band, with DuVall singing Staley's parts at the concerts in 2001 and 2002. DuVall joined Alice in Chains as full-time lead singer during the band's reunion tour in 2006, after making his first public appearance with the band at the VH1 concert.\nBy April 2007, Alice in Chains had been writing and demoing songs for a new album with DuVall, but the band did not show further signs of progress until October 2008, when they announced that they had begun recording with producer Nick Raskulinecz in the studio. The band didn't have a record label at the time and the album was funded by Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney. The writing and recording process was completed on March 18, 2009 – Cantrell's 43rd birthday and also the same day that DuVall's son was born.\n\nAbout the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, \"To put all that weight on Will’s shoulders is unfair. We’re just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, and it always has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here\", Cantrell said pointing to his heart.\n\nOn September 29, 2009, Alice in Chains, released their first record since the death of Layne Staley, \"Black Gives Way to Blue\", and toured in support of the album. The album includes songs which Cantrell described as \"the heaviest he's ever written\", and has Cantrell singing lead vocals on most of the songs and William DuVall as co-lead vocalist. The title track is a tribute to Layne Staley written and sung by Cantrell, accompanied by Elton John playing piano. In the months before writing the song, Cantrell had been suffering from an unexplained illness. Cantrell believes the mystery illness was the pain of saying goodbye to Staley. He told \"Guitar World\", \"I got deathly ill. I had these mystery migraines, intense physical pain, and I'd even gotten a spinal tap to test for certain things. They never could find anything wrong with me. I felt I was puking up all this undigested grief in losing Layne.\" Once Cantrell started writing the song and the rest of the album, his mystery illness disappeared. Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney also thanked Staley in the album's liner notes. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in May 2010, \nselling over 500,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nThe band released their fifth studio album, \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\", on May 28, 2013, and Cantrell continued his role of main singer in the album. The album debuted at #2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 (the band's highest chart position since 1995's \"Alice in Chains\", which debuted at #1), selling 61,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nIn June 2017, Alice in Chains returned to Seattle's Studio X to record their sixth studio album. Studio X was the same studio where the band recorded their self-titled album, \"Alice in Chains\" (1995), Recording was completed in January 2018. On June 27, 2018, the band announced the title and unveiled the cover art of the new album, \"Rainier Fog\", released on August 24, 2018 through BMG, Alice in Chains' first release on the label. Cantrell took the album's title from the Mount Rainier in Seattle, and the title track is a tribute to the Seattle music scene.\n\nAs part of the promotion of \"Rainier Fog\", the baseball team Seattle Mariners hosted an \"Alice in Chains Night\" at the Safeco Field in Seattle on August 20, 2018, and Cantrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and delivered a strike before the Mariners vs. Houston Astros game.\n\nAs of 2018, Alice in Chains has had 17 Top 10 songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and nine Grammy Award nominations.\n\nCantrell's career outside Alice in Chains has consisted of two solo albums, as well as many appearances with other musicians and on film soundtracks. His first solo material was the song \"Leave Me Alone\", released exclusively on \"The Cable Guy\" soundtrack in 1996, featuring Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney on drums and Cantrell on lead vocals, guitar and bass. It had a music video, which was included as a bonus feature on the 15th anniversary edition Blu-Ray of \"The Cable Guy\" in 2011, and the song reached No. 14 on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock Tracks. In the same year, Cantrell covered Willie Nelson's \"I've Seen All This World I Care to See\" for the album \"Twisted Willie: A Tribute to Willie Nelson\".\n\nAs the activity of Alice in Chains slowed and the band's future came into question, Cantrell reluctantly began work on his first full-length solo record. While video footage from Cantrell's official website claimed that he wanted to work solo for some time, his comments in \"Guitar World\" stated otherwise:\n\n\"Boggy Depot\" was released in April 1998. The title comes from the ghost town of the same name in Oklahoma, which is the area that Cantrell's father grew up in. The album cover shows Cantrell covered in mud standing waist-deep in a branch of the Boggy River. Besides singing, Cantrell also played guitar, piano, clavinet, organ, and steel drums on the album. The tracks \"Cut You In\", \"My Song\" and \"Dickeye\" were released as singles to promote the album. Cantrell's father played the sheriff in the music video for \"Cut You In\".\n\nHis touring band for the album included Alice in Chains bandmates Inez and Kinney, and Cantrell expressed hope to have a second album released by the following year. Cantrell opened for Metallica and Van Halen on their 1998 summer tour.\n\nThe same year of \"Boggy Depot\", Cantrell began writing a follow-up album. He also departed from Columbia Records during this time and had trouble finding a new label. Cantrell said of the writing experience:\n\nIn 1998, Layne Staley almost performed live again since Alice in Chains' last concert in July 1996, when Cantrell went to Seattle on his solo tour for \"Boggy Depot\". It was Halloween night and Staley was backstage as a guest. Cantrell reportedly asked Staley to join him onstage, but Staley declined.\n\nCantrell started recording a follow-up to \"Boggy Depot\" in 2000. He was also living in San Francisco during that period. Cantrell had to sell his Seattle house to fund the album and produced it himself. Finally in June 2002, Cantrell issued his second solo album, \"Degradation Trip,\" with Ozzy Osbourne's then live rhythm section, Mike Bordin (drums) and Robert Trujillo (bass). Released on Roadrunner Records, \"Degradation Trip\" hit shelves two months after Layne Staley's death and was dedicated to him. The songs on the album ranged from doom metal to pop-based hard rock. The album, which received better critical reception than its predecessor, featured two singles, \"Anger Rising\" and \"Angel Eyes\", and the track \"She Was My Girl\" was included on the \"Spider-Man\" soundtrack.\n\n\"Degradation Trip\" has sold 100,000 copies in the U.S. as of December 2002. The live show was well received by audiences on a national tour that helped build upon the solo album's success. \"Degradation Trip\" was re-released in November 2002 as a double album, featuring eleven additional tracks that were made for the album as Cantrell originally intended.\n\nIn Spring 2004, Cantrell opened a slate of shows on Kid Rock's U.S. tour.\n\nCantrell has been rumored to be working on his third full-length solo album for several years, for a supposedly planned release in 2006. However, this album still has not been released. Subsequent work with the revamped Alice in Chains may have stalled this release. When asked about releasing another solo album, he issued this statement in 2010:\n\nIn November 2014, during an interview on radio 95.5 KLOS, Cantrell was asked if he had any plans on doing more solo work, to which he replied: \"I don't know. Maybe somewhere down the road. The only reason I ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn't really doing anything. My band has been doing things lately, so I don't really have time to do anything. I kinda focus my energy there [in the band]. Of course, you know, possibilities...\" Cantrell expressed the same sentiment when asked about a new solo album during an interview with Trunk Nation in August 2017, stating that Alice in Chains has always been his number one concern, but that he would not rule out a new solo album in the future.\n\nIn February 2017, Cantrell released his first solo song in 15 years, \"A Job To Do\", featured during the end credits of the movie \"\".\n\nCantrell has appeared as guest guitarist on several albums and projects, including the Danzig album \"Blackacidevil\" (1996), in which he played on three tracks (\"See All You Were\", \"Come to Silver\" and \"Hand of Doom\"), and the Metallica album \"Garage Inc.\" (1998) on the band's rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Tuesday's Gone\". He also guested on Circus of Power's 1993 album \"Magic & Madness\" for the song \"Heaven & Hell\", played lead guitar on Metal Church's \"Gods of a Second Chance\" from their 1993 album \"Hanging in the Balance\", and played on the track \"Marry Me\" from Pigeonhed's 1997 album, \"The Full Sentence\".\n\nCantrell provided background vocals for the track \"Effigy\" on Gov't Mule's 2001 album, \"The Deep End, Volume 1\". He also appears briefly with Warren Haynes in the documentary \"Rising Low\", which documents the work of the band Gov't Mule following the death of bassist Allen Woody.\n\nIn a May 2001 interview with Metal-is.com, Cantrell revealed that he had written four songs for Ozzy Osbourne. Cantrell, Osbourne, guitarist Zakk Wylde, bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin went to the studio and made some rough demos of those songs.\n\nCantrell played guitar in the song \"Fallen Ones\" from Heart's 2004 album \"Jupiters Darling\".\n\nCantrell was the lead guitarist in all of the tracks from Ozzy Osbourne's 2005 album of cover songs, \"Under Cover\". The songs performed by Cantrell were also included on disc four of Osbourne's box set \"Prince of Darkness\" (2005).\n\nIn 2007, Cantrell played guitar on Glenn Hughes's rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"Misty Mountain Hop\", featured on Hughes' solo album \"Music for the Divine\", and played on the track \"Soul Ecstacy\" off the Stevie Salas's album \"The Sun and the Earth: The Essential Stevie Salas, Vol. 1\". He also played guitar on Smith & Pyle's debut album, \"It's OK To Be Happy\", released in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Cantrell played guitar on the song \"Anything\" from Pearl Aday's debut album, \"Little Immaculate White Fox\". Aday stated that she thought Cantrell would be a good person to put in some \"heartbroken, haunting, crying guitar\" on the track.\n\nCantrell sings background vocals and does a lead vocal ad-lib in the final chorus of \"Love Is Blind\" from Richie Kotzen's 2011 album, \"24 Hours\".\n\nHe played guitar on Duff McKagan's 2015 EP \"How To Be A Man\", and has also collaborated with Alternative Metal band Deftones, contributing guitar parts to the track \"Phantom Bride\" off their 2016 album \"Gore\".\n\nCantrell performed a snippet of \"Man In The Box\" followed by a cover of Motörhead's \"Ace of Spades\" alongside Pantera during their concert at the Seattle Center Coliseum on March 1, 1992. Cantrell joined the band again for their performance of \"Walk\" during a concert in San Jose, California on February 6, 2001.\n\nOn October 9, 1994, Cantrell joined Metallica for a performance of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" during their concert in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 2002, Cantrell played a series of summer dates with headlining hard rock/post-grunge band Nickelback. Cantrell can be seen playing Alice in Chains' \"It Ain't Like That\" with the band on their first DVD release, \"Live at Home\" (2002). He was also asked by Nickelback's frontman, Chad Kroeger, to contribute to the song \"Hero\" for the 2002 film \"Spider-Man\". Cantrell was unable to attend the recording session and was replaced by Saliva's Josey Scott.\n\nCantrell made several guest appearances with the supergroup Camp Freddy, (a covers band featuring Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, former Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and Billy Idol guitarist Billy Morrison), performing with them for the first time at The Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2004.\n\nThe experience with Camp Freddy inspired Cantrell and The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy to form their own covers band, the rock supergroup Cardboard Vampyres (named after Cantrell's cats). Under the moniker of the Jerry Cantrell-Billy Duffy Band, they debuted during the three-concert series for Sweet Relief Musicians Fund at The Troubadour in April 2004. \"This band is really just about having fun and playing tunes that we were fans of growing up,\" Cantrell stated. Performing mostly cover songs from bands like Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Stooges, Black Sabbath, and Aerosmith, the group was rounded out by vocalist John Corabi, bassist Chris Wyse, and drummer Josh Howser. The band played at various venues in the United States; although, they predominately played along the West Coast.

Cantrell wrote the lyrics from the perspective of Keanu Reeves’ title character. Cantrell said in a statement: \"I really dug \"John Wick\" and have always admired Keanu's work. When the opportunity arose to create a song for the second film, Tyler Bates and I wrote and recorded 'A Job To Do', a theme song for the character. Can't wait to see it!\".\n\nOn July 19, 2018, Cantrell released the song \"Setting Sun\" for the soundtrack of DC Comics' graphic novel \"\". The song was released as a single in digital platforms.\n\nCantrell's early influences made Alice in Chains' heavy metal tones stand out among their fellow grunge/alternative rock-oriented bands of the Seattle music scene. However, his musical range also extends into elements of blues and country as heard on his solo debut album. Cantrell's guitar playing is known for its unique use of wah pedal as well as odd time signatures. In a 1998 interview with \"Guitar World\", he was asked about the latter quality:\n\nCantrell has been most famously seen playing a G&L Guitars' Rampage model. The two models most closely identified with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s. They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony fingerboard. The bridge is a Kahler Tremolo as opposed to a Floyd Rose tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s. The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker wired to a volume control.\n\nG&L Guitars makes two Jerry Cantrell Signature guitars available to the general public for purchase. The first is a Rampage model which is very similar to the instrument most closely identified with Cantrell, known as the \"Blue Dress Rampage\" for having an image of a vintage pin-up girl wearing a blue dress, which Cantrell taped to the top of his first guitar. The second is a guitar called the 'Superhawk'. This guitar features a fixed bridge and the addition of a neck pickup.\n\nCantrell used the original \"Blue Dress\" guitar on the music videos for \"Man in the Box\", \"We Die Young\", \"Sea of Sorrow\", \"Grind\", and \"Again\". The guitar can also be seen in the movie \"Singles\". In 2011, Cantrell told that he had to retire the guitar due to a hairline crack from the neck all the way through the back of the body. Before that, he had never gone on tour without it.\n\nApart from his signature G&L Guitars, Cantrell has also been seen playing a Telecaster, a Fender Standard Stratocaster Brown Sunburst, a Gibson Les Paul most notably an Ivory White Les Paul with torch burn marks that Cantrell made all over the guitar, which is the guitar that Cantrell has used on all of the Alice in Chains albums along with the original Blue Dress G&L. Also a Gibson Custom Shop Jerry Cantrell SG, a 1952 Goldtop Les Paul, a Ernie Ball Music Man EVH that was a gift from Eddie Van Halen in the 90's, but has been stolen from Cantrell, a dark blue Mosrite Venture, a Dean Micheal Schenker USA V, and Dean Soltero guitars.\n\nCantrell used a variety of amplifiers such as those made by Bogner, Mesa Boogie and Marshall throughout his career. He has most recently been using a signature amp called the, 'JJ100' made for him by Friedman Amplification.\n\nIn 2010, Jim Dunlop introduced the \"JC95 Cantrell Signature Cry Baby\", Cantrell's signature Cry Baby wah pedal. The lyrics to \"Black Gives Way to Blue\" are printed on the base plate of the pedal.\n\n\nCantrell is widely considered to be one of the greatest rock guitarists of his generation. Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell expressed his admiration for Cantrell's guitar work in an interview for \"Guitar International\" in 1995, saying that \"the layering and the honest feel that Jerry Cantrell gets on [Alice in Chains' \"Dirt\"] record is worth a lot more than someone who plays five million notes\".\n\nIn July 2006, British hard rock/metal magazine \"Metal Hammer\" awarded Cantrell the title of \"Riff Lord\" at its annual Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards show, held at the London Astoria. He was apparently thrilled at winning the title over several famous artists such as Slash, James Hetfield, and Jimmy Page.\n\nHe was ranked 38th out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by \"Guitar World\" in 2004, and ranked at No. 37 out of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" also by \"Guitar World\" in 2012.\n\nCantrell was ranked at No. 98 on the list of the \"Top 100 Most Complete Guitar Players of All Time\" by Envision Radio Networks' \"Chop Shop\" guitar show in 2008.\n\nIn October 2008, \"Guitar World\" ranked Cantrell's solo in \"Man In The Box\" at No. 77 on their list of \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\nElton John stated in a 2009 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" that he's been an admirer of Cantrell for quite some time, and couldn't resist the offer to play on Alice in Chains' song \"Black Gives Way to Blue\" at Cantrell's request.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Loudwire discussing five of his essential guitar albums, Slayer guitarist Kerry King said about Cantrell:\nIn 2016, Blend Guitar ranked Cantrell No. 7 on their list of \"Top 10 Underrated Guitarists\".\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, Cantrell co-owned a hard rock bar called Dead Man's Hand in Las Vegas with Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian.\n\nIn 2011, Cantrell appeared on a spot for NADCP, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals.\n\nIn 2012, Cantrell's voice was featured on a smoking policy ad at the Sea-Tac Airport in Seattle.\n\nIn his teens, Cantrell was acting in lead roles in high school plays. In a 1998 Q&A, Cantrell revealed that acting has always been an interest to him.\n\nCantrell is featured in the 1992 movie \"Singles\", along with the rest of Alice in Chains performing the songs \"It Ain't Like That\" and \"Would?\".\n\nIn the early 90's, Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates Layne Staley and Mike Starr were featured on the music video \"Never A Know, But The No\", from the Seattle thrash metal band Forced Entry.\n\nIn 1995, Cantrell played journalist Nona Weisbaum on the Alice in Chains mockumentary \"The Nona Tapes\".\n\nIn 1996, he had a cameo in Cameron Crowe's \"Jerry Maguire\" playing \"Jesus of CopyMat\", the CopyMat worker who helped Tom Cruise's character make copies of his manifesto. Cantrell said about the film; \"I get more people coming up to me telling me my line. It was such a big movie and it was really fun to do.\" Cantrell was also Crowe's first choice for the role of Stillwater bass player Larry Fellows in \"Almost Famous\" (2000). Cantrell was busy writing the songs for his solo album \"Degradation Trip\" and had to turn the role down. Mark Kozelek was cast instead.\n\nHe also had a cameo as a musician in the 2009 film noir comedy \"Rock Slyde\", and appeared on the background of one scene in the first season of the TV series \"Deadwood\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2013, Cantrell played country singer Donnie \"Skeeter\" Dollarhide Jr. on the Alice in Chains mockumentary \"\".\n\nIn 2018, Cantrell played Terry, a plumber who plays bass in a garage band in the short film \"Dad Band\", co-starring W. Earl Brown. Cantrell also composed the film score along with Carl Restivo.\n\nCantrell was homeless in the early '90s and lived for some time at the house of Pearl Jam's manager Kelly Curtis. While living in the basement of Curtis' house, Cantrell was roommates with Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder. At the start of 1991, Cantrell moved in with Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cornell and his wife Susan Silver at their house in Seattle. Silver was also Alice in Chains' manager. Cantrell wrote the song \"Rooster\" at the Cornells' house and stayed there for a few weeks. Cantrell would later pay tribute to Cornell during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on April 14, 2018, joining singer Ann Wilson for a rendition of Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\". Alice in Chains also paid tribute to Cornell on the one year anniversary of his death on May 18, 2018. The band covered two Soundgarden songs, \"Hunted Down\" and \"Boot Camp,\" respectively, closing their headlining set at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. Towards the end of \"Boot Camp\", the lights on stage spelled out \"CC\" for Chris Cornell and \"SG\" for Soundgarden as feedback rang out.\nCantrell was a close friend of late Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who was described by Cantrell as his best friend. Staley died on April 5, 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's \"Degradation Trip\" tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, \"It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [Staley's death]. I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.\" \"The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's one of those things where if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again.\" Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said that Jerry really loved Layne and they had a bond he hadn't seen before. Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: \"It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it.\" William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: \"I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words.\"\n\nCantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, \"Degradation Trip\", released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.\n\nCantrell is critical of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\". Cantrell stated, \"There are two things you never want to get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're going to be talking about this for awhile\". \"No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\"] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in\". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. \"I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem\".\n\nDuring his independent tour for \"Degradation Trip\" before the album was released, Cantrell broke his left hand while playing football after a concert at the Kentucky Derby on May 3, 2001. While Cantrell was running full speed, his guitar player at the time, Bryan Kehoe, was also running full speed towards him and Cantrell got his pinky finger caught in Kehoe's t-shirt sleeve. Cantrell went to the E.R but they could not do anything for him there, since the bone had slipped back in his hand and he would need a reconstructive surgery, but he had to wait for a couple of weeks for that to happen. Cantrell wanted to continue the tour, and although he was in a lot of pain, he played his first concert as a frontman without a guitar opening for Cheap Trick in Atlanta. Cantrell needed a Titanium plate and four screws to put the bones back together. Cantrell told that breaking his hand was the worst physical pain he ever had. The injury caused the remainder of Cantrell's solo tour to be postponed. His first concert after the surgery was at the Key Club in West Hollywood on July 1, 2001.\n\nCantrell underwent shoulder surgery twice. In December 2005, a surgery in his left shoulder removed bone fragments and repaired cartilage. During a chat at ESPN.com on November 29, 2011, Cantrell revealed that he had another surgery earlier that year, this time in his right shoulder and that he was in the tail end of the rehabilitation process. The surgery postponed the recording sessions of \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\" as Cantrell could not play guitar for eight months while he was recovering. Cantrell explained the surgery saying, \"The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [and] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing.\" While recuperating at home in a sling, Cantrell heard a riff in his head and sang it into his phone. The riff later became the song \"Stone\", the first single from \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\".\n\nCantrell is a recovering addict and alcoholic and has been sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, \"I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [Kinney] was at the door with my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush at the bottom of a cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it.\" Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, \"We really miss Layne [Staley] and Mike [Starr], and we carry them with us in our hearts\".\n\nCantrell is a longtime supporter of MusiCares MAP Fund, which helps musicians who are struggling with addiction, financial and health issues. He also supports Road Recovery, an organization dedicated to helping young people battling addiction.\n\nOn April 12, 2004, Cantrell and his then-band Cardboard Vampyres performed at a benefit concert for Sweet Relief, a nonprofit organization that helps needy musicians cover medical expenses. On November 10, 2004, Cantrell was among the musicians who performed a short acoustic set to benefit \"Help The Homeless\" in Hollywood, California.\n\nIn 2007, Cantrell auctioned off some of his favorite clothes from key moments in his career to benefit MusiCares and the Layne Staley Fund, which provides support and treatment for heroin recovery in the Seattle music community.\n\nSince 2009, Cantrell hosts the \"Alice in Chains & Friends Charity Fantasy Football League\". Each participant puts up an item for an online auction and all of the proceeds goes to the charity chosen by the champion of the league. Cantrell founded the league to combine his love of fantasy football with the goal of helping a worthy cause. Cantrell won the league for the first time in 2016, and in 2017 he decided to donate the proceeds to MusiCares in Chris Cornell's memory, and to Music for Relief in memory of Chester Bennington. Both musicians died in 2017.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, Cantrell performed at the second annual Acoustic-4-A-Cure concert in benefit of the Pediatric Cancer Program at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nCantrell is a supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and has performed at benefit concerts and charity golf tournaments to raise funds for the hospital that treats children with cancer.\n\nCantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates offer special seating at their concerts for veterans from Operation Ward 57, a fund for wounded soldiers.\n\nIn 2015, Alice in Chains donated two dollars from every pre-sold ticket of their summer tour to help the family of a fan named Stefan Dayne-Ankle, who passed away after a battle with leukemia.\n\nCantrell also supports Music for Relief Autism Speaks, Rock Against MS Foundation, and the Los Angeles Police Memorial Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Goldsmith\n\nJoel Solomon Goldsmith (March 10, 1892 – June 17, 1964) was an American spiritual author, teacher, spiritual healer, and modern-day mystic. He founded The Infinite Way movement.\n\nJoel S. Goldsmith was born in New York City on March 10, 1892. His parents were non-practicing Jews, who were married in New York City in 1891. Joel was their first child. They had another son two years later, followed by a daughter two years thereafter.\n\nIn 1915, Joel's father became critically ill while in England and word was sent to the Goldsmith family to come for the body. However, according to Joel, his father was healed by a Christian Science practitioner in London. From his early adulthood, Joel Goldsmith had many spiritual experiences. \n\nHe was a healer who spent many years in spiritual studies, reading original scriptures of Aramaic, Greek and Sanskrit origins. His first book, \"The Infinite Way\", was published in 1948.\n\nAfter serving in the Marines during World War I, Goldsmith returned to work in the garment district of New York City, where he owned his own business. While on a return trip from Europe, he developed pneumonia. As was his father before him, Goldsmith was healed by a Christian Science practitioner who happened to be on board his ship at the time. \n\nIn 1928, strangers began approaching Goldsmith on the street, asking for prayer and healing. He had no religious training whatsoever, but these people allegedly were healed. To seek answers about this phenomenon, Goldsmith first entered the Christian Science Church and worked at Rikers Island prison as a First Reader. After 16 years, he left the Church and moved to Boston, where he set up his own office. He moved to California before World War II and maintained a successful healing practice there. \n\nIn 1948 Goldsmith wrote the book \"The Infinite Way\", which came to the attention of Willing Publishers. The book's title also became the name associated with his spiritual message and work.\n\nGoldsmith self-published his most famous work, \"The Infinite Way\", in 1947, which was based on letters to patients and students. He also published \"The Spiritual Interpretation of Scripture\".\n\nThe writings which followed were transcriptions of his lectures which had been recorded on the first wire recorders in the late 1940s. These were distributed by Goldsmith Publishing. They were: \"The Master Speaks\", \"The First, Second, Third San Francisco Lecture Series\", \"Consciousness Unfolding\", \"God the Substance of All Form\", and \"Metaphysical Notes\". These original books were later republished during Goldsmith's lifetime by publishers in various countries, making over fifty books.\n\nAs Goldsmith was approached by large publishing houses around the world to produce books of his talks, he enlisted the help of Lorraine Sinkler and her sister Valborg to edit his books, which were generally compiled from various lecture transcripts.\n\nGoldsmith's insistence on \"no organization\" insured that his message remained a personal journey with leaders naturally evolving from new generations. There is no service, ritual, dogma, or ceremony in the practice of the Infinite Way. Goldsmith students can be found in all walks of life, in all religions. His message is one that can be read and heard for a lifetime, always allowing new understandings to unfold in each individual.\n\nGoldsmith stressed \"contemplative meditation\" practice in his teaching. The method he generally taught involved short frequent meditation periods throughout the day. He told his student of 18 years, Walter Starcke, that the main reason to meditate was that through reaching the inner silence one could hear the still small voice and receive its intuitive guidance. His teaching also stressed spiritual healing through conscious contact with God.\n\nAfter writing the work, Goldsmith expected to retire to a life of contemplation. However, the work prompted people to seek him out as a spiritual teacher, leading to the extension of his career, teaching and writing.\n\nJoel Solomon Goldsmith died on June 17, 1964, at the Piccadilly Hotel, Westminster, London W1, England. His body was cremated at Golders Green in London on June 18, 1964, and his ashes and effects were released to his widow, Emma Goldsmith, who took them back to their home in Hawaii. Both were interred in Sun City, Arizona.\n\n\n\n"}

Judah was born in Provence, but in his youth he moved to northern France where he studied under Isaac b. Abraham, the tosafist. Subsequently he went to Barcelona where his signature is found on a document of 1175. From other documents signed by Abraham b. Judah of Narbonne, who was apparently his son, the years of Judah's death can be established as between 1201 and 1218. Judah was also a kabbalist, having studied under Isaac the Blind. In his lifetime Judah was famous for two large works. One – which has been completely lost – was a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud and was one of the earliest systematic commentaries on it. It is frequently quoted by the early authorities and covered at least a large part of the orders of Mo'ed and Nezikin. His other work is the Ma'yan Gannim, a rational commentary on the liturgy and blessings, though the esoteric element is by no means absent. His aim in this work was to show the scriptural and rabbinic versions and sources of the prayers and to detail the various laws connected with them. The commentary was published on the basis of a number of manuscripts by S. Yerushalmi (1968). The work is frequently cited by the rishonim, among them Jacob ha-Kohen of Lunel and David Abudarham. The latter quotes him literally in almost every halakhah, without, however, mentioning his name. Judah's main claim to fame in subsequent generations was that he was one of the teachers of Naḥmanides, who refers to him in his works. It seems that he was one of the channels through which Naḥmanides became acquainted with the literature and methods of study of the tosafists.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1448260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1448260", "title": "Law of consecration", "text": "Law of consecration\n\nThe law of consecration is a commandment in the Latter Day Saint movement in which adherents promise to dedicate their lives and material substance to the church. It was first referred to in 1831 by Joseph Smith.\n\nOn February 4, 1831, Smith received a revelation calling Edward Partridge to be the first bishop of the church. Five days later, on February 9, 1831, Smith received another revelation detailing the law of consecration.\n\nAs practiced by the Latter Day Saints in Smith's day, the law of consecration was for the support of the poor and to ensure that all members would be \"equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs\". Adherents were asked to voluntarily deed, or consecrate, their property to the Church of Christ, and the church then would assign to each member a \"stewardship\" of property \"as much as is sufficient for himself and family\". If consecrated property became more than was sufficient for the assigned steward, the \"residue\" was \"to be consecrated unto the bishop\" kept for the benefit of \"those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.\"\n\nUnder Smith, members attempted to implement the law of consecration through the establishment of the United Order, but it was never fully instituted due to conflict and disagreements.\n\nDuring the 1850s, Brigham Young, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), attempted to revive the law of consecration. The US Congress used this practice to delay granting land ownership to Utah Territory. Under scrutiny from the national press and facing advancing federal troops, the church dropped the plan in 1857 in favor of the law of tithing. Since that time, the LDS Church has not asked its members to give all of their property to the church: leaders of the church have taught that members \"are not now required to live the law of consecration\". However, adherents covenant with God to accept the law of consecration as part of the temple endowment ceremony. \n\nIn the 1970s, LDS Church apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated that \"[t]he law of consecration is that we consecrate our time, our talents, and our money and property to the cause of the Church: such are to be available to the extent they are needed to further the Lord's interests on earth.\"\n\nRather than fully living the United Order to keep the law of consecration, members are asked to tithe their income to support the church, to pay a generous monthly fast offering to care for the poor, and to donate their time and talents in assisting in the operation of the church.\n\nAdherents believe that the law of consecration will be fully practiced in the future, including during the thousand-year millennium after the Second Coming of Jesus.\n\nIn some Mormon fundamentalist sects, including the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the Apostolic United Brethren, adherents live the law of consecration by deeding their homes and other personal property to the church, which then administers it to the members as needed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43680182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43680182", "title": "Louise Lateau", "text": "Louise Lateau\n\nLouise Lateau (born 29 January 1850 at Bois-d'Haine, in Belgium, died on 25 August 1883 at Bois-d'Haine) was a mystic and stigmatist.\n\nThe case of Louise Lateau is one of the best documented of those who received the stigmata. She was famous in the 1860s because of her mystical trances and between 1868 and 1883 she was observed by many physicians, members of the clergy and visitors.\n\nThe historian David Blackbourn has pointed out in his study, that in the life of Louise Lateau a number of features are found similar to other Mystics such as Anna Katharina Emmerick and to the experiences of visionaries such as Bernadette Soubirous and Catherine Labouré. All suffered similarly from harsh treatment, early separation from family or the loss of family members and in general, a life of dependency and poverty.\nLouise Lateau’s father died when Louise was still a toddler. Her father died of smallpox ten weeks after her birth. Louise also contracted the disease and was saved with much difficulty. Her mother gave her out to work from her 11th year as a housemaid. Shortly thereafter, she was brought back again by her mother and had to work as a dressmaker. During a cholera-epidemic in Bois-D’Haine in 1866, the sixteen-year-old Louise Lateau nursed six of the epidemic victims. The following year she became seriously ill herself. The disease lasting until 1868. On April 15, 1868, she was so ill that she received the last rites. Ten days later she had her first experience of the stigmata.\n\nFrom 24 April 1868, pain recurred every Friday and blood began to flow from her left side and feet;\non 8 May, blood came from both hands as if from nail wounds; on 25 September, the stigmata was completed by the appearance on the breast of four small spots of blood as if coming from four pinpricks to the heart.\nAll these wounds appeared without apparent cause on the night of Thursday to Friday and disappeared the next night. It would do this every Friday until her death in 1883. For the rest of the week, Louise Lateau continued to work hard for her family.\n\nHer claims of stigmata were disputed by Donovan Rawcliffe who suggested they were self-inflicted, caused by \"extreme emotional or other psychogenic factors following intense concentration on the crucifixion.\"\n\nOn July 17, 1868, the phenomenon of the bleeding of the stigmata was accompanied by an ecstasy, which returned every Friday in the form of a trance-like state, which lasted for a total of 8 hours. The first ecstasy took place in the morning at 6:00, after the distribution of Communion, a second occurred around 2 PM.\nDuring the ecstasy she was completely absorbed, She no longer had the slightest perception of events occurring in her surroundings. She could stay in contemplation for hours, usually her face expressed the joy but also the fear and sadness of the Passion of Christ. She changed position and was moving in the room. The Ecstasy ended after the mime of the Crucifixion and the Agony of Christ held in the parish church.\n\nShe was insensitive to pain and noises, but she could briefly exit the ecstasy, following a request of the parish priest of Bois-d'Haine or some clergymen.\nLouise kept in memory what she saw: visions of the passion of Christ, of the Virgin Mary and saints.\n\nFor the rest of the week, there was nothing but the very ordinary in the life of Louise Lateau. She continued to live with her mother and sisters and to work for her family. These phenomena however began to be known and to attract attention especially from 1871.\n\nIt was alleged that Lateau could abstain from food. However, this claim was investigated and proven false (see below).\n\nAt the end of the year 1868 the Bishop of Tournai, Gaspar-Joseph Labis, opened a canonical investigation. The commission was made up of clerics, a lay person who was the Minister of State (Adolphe Dechamps) and a physician (Dr. Lefebvre of the Catholic University of Louvain). It acknowledged the sincerity of the person and the authenticity of the facts and concluded that science could find no rational explanation to what had happened to Louise Lateau.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium opened an investigation in 1874.\n\nFor 5 months, Lateau was observed by experts appointed by the Academy. The conclusions of the Commission were published in 1875. Their conclusion was that there was no conscious deception in the stigmata and the ecstasies. A physician Evariste Warlomont suggested attributing the phenomena to \"double consciousness\" (later termed dissociative identity disorder).\n\nThe French neurologist Désiré-Magloire Bourneville argued that all of Lateau's phenomena were symptoms of hysteria. German psychiatrist Albert Moll suggested that a \"natural explanation of the facts is possible, because such things can be induced by suggestion in a suitable mental state. The conditions resemble each other; the ecstasy of Lateau has a great likeness to the hypnotic state.

{"id": "35520839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35520839", "title": "Psychology of religious conversion", "text": "Psychology of religious conversion\n\nThe modern academic study of the psychology of religious conversion can be tracked back to 1881 when a series of lectures was delivered by early psychologist G. Stanley Hall. In its early stages the psychology of religious conversion mainly addressed Christianity and to this day is dominated by studies of North American Protestant Christianity, although other varieties of religion are addressed in the field of psychology of religion.\n\nRambo provides a model for conversion that classifies it as a highly complex process that is hard to define. He views it as a process of religious change that is affected by an interaction of numerous events, experiences, ideologies, people, institutions, and how these different experiences interact and accumulate over time. From his research Rambo created an integrative model for conversion that occurs over seven stages.\n\nThe classic religious paradigm for conversion is highly dependent on the idea of sudden conversion. The prototypical sudden conversion is the Biblical depiction of the conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus. Sudden conversions are highly emotional but not necessarily rational. In these instances the convert is a passive agent being acted upon by external forces, and the conversion entails a dramatic transformation of self. Emotion dominates this dramatic, irrational transformation leading to a shift in self and belief, with behavior change to follow. For sudden converts conversion is not a back and forth drawn out process, but rather happens in one single instance and is permanent thereafter. Typically sudden conversions occur in childhood and are exceptionally emotional experiences. Often sudden conversions are the result of overwhelming anxiety and guilt from sin that becomes unbearable, making conversion a functional solution to ease these emotions.\n\nEmotional factors have been found to correlate with sudden conversions. Coe maintains these correlations seem to suggest causation, citing his work in which 17 sudden converts who had dominant emotional factors affecting their conversion. However, Spellman, Baskett, and Byrnes data suggest not. In their work they found that sudden converts only scored high on levels of emotionality following conversion, not prior to. No experimental or longitudinal studies have demonstrated a true causal relationship between emotion and sudden conversion.\n\nIn the contemporary paradigm of conversion we view the conversion process as a highly intellectual, well thought out gradual process. This contemporary model is a contrast to the classic model, and gradual conversion has been identified by Strickland as a contrast to sudden conversion. Scobie terms it an \"unconscious conversion\". Typically gradual conversions do not occur following a single, impactful event but rather are distinguished empirically and thoughtfully over a length of time. A gradual conversion can be identified by consciously striving toward the goal with no decisive point where conversion is initiated or converted. The process occurs cognitively and is much less emotional with no emotional crisis, guilt, or sin.\n\nAverage age at the time of conversion has been examined by Johnson, Roberts, and Gillespie and has been found to be between the ages of 15-16, a consistent finding over 40 years. These findings are consistent with Erikson's conclusion that this is the age where individuals are testing the world around them and forming an identity. However, it has been pointed out by Silverstein that sampling is generally biased as participant age rarely exceeds the early 20s. Spilka and others suggest that better sampling is needed as generally study participants are college-age students and thus are not truly representative. Finally, in Western countries females typically convert one to two years before males.\n\nResearch of conversion is paralleled to a lesser extent by research on deconversion. Research on deconversion has been divided into two subgroups, new religious movements (NRM) and mainstream groups.\n\nThere are many reasons why people deconvert from new religious movements. A key factor to consider is that many times a NRM occurs in isolation from the outside world; when this isolation is broken deconversion may occur. NRM typically regulate interpersonal relationships, as the development of unregulated interpersonal relationships may lead to deconversion. Followers of a NRM may become frustrated when their efforts produce no success or social change and eventually abandon the movement. Finally, followers may become disillusioned with the movement or its leader and leave the movement. \n\nDeconversion may occur suddenly or be a gradual process. Generally deconversion will be a quiet process for those who have only been a member of the NRM for one year or less. However, for those who have been a follower for longer than a year tend to go through confrontational, emotional, and dramatic deconversion processes.\n\nA minority of mainstream religious followers truly reject their faith and deconvert. Apostates make up just 7% of deconversions from mainstream religion. However, 80% will withdraw and later return. \n\nGenerally there are two disengagement measures for the mainstream religious. In the first, behavioral, followers will go one month or longer without attending a religious service. The second type of disengagement, belief, sees followers go for a year or longer without religion being a part of their life.\n\nApostasy is an individual's abandonment of their religious commitment and acceptance of a nonreligious lifestyle or joining a different movement of belief.\n\nDeconversion is the process by which converts leave their faith.\n\nA revitalized commitment to a religion. This may be to a religion that one was brought up in or has only casually followed. Also referred to as \"born again\" or a \"rebirth\". In some religions the faithful follow procedures designed to induce experiences of intensification.\n\nChanging religious identification group without radically changing as a person. An example would be switching religious denomination.\n\nVarying religious participation across an individual's lifetime. Individual may drop out of religion to later return, or periodically fall out of the faith.\n\n"}

The Nyas was formed by members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council).\nSeveral Hindu religious and political organisations have sought to construct a temple on the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, to commemorate Rama. However, the Babri Mosque stood on the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, was constructed by Mughal emperor Babur after he demolished the original Rama temple on the site. The issue was taken up by organisations such as the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major Hindu nationalist political party. In 1992, a procession led by the VHP near the mosque ended up demolishing the mosque, which caused major communal violence across India between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (RJN) was founded as an independent trust by members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad on January 25, 1993 to take charge of the site of Ram Janmabhoomi and oversee the construction of the proposed Rama temple. Ramchandra Das Paramhans (1913-2003) was head of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas. Its members argued that the Nyas was created so that the secular Government of India would not control the site and end up involving itself in the construction of the temple. The RJN also operates workshops in \"Karsevakpuram\" (City of Volunteers), a major encampment of volunteer activists (called \"Karsevaks\") outside Ayodhya preparing to undertake the construction of the temple.\n\nThe leaders of the RJN welcomed the decision of the Allahabad High Court to distribute the disputed territory into three parts, with one-third going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and another to the Nirmohi Akhara Hindu denomination. However, the RJN claimed that it was the rightful party to take possession of the land and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of India to seek possession of the entire site.\n"}

The vast majority of the Orthodox Christians in the country belong to the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which declared autocephaly from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1967.\n\nMuslims are the second-largest religious group with almost one-third of the population adhering to Islam, mainly from the country's Albanian and Turkish minorities. There are also many other religious groups in Macedonia, including the Catholic Church, Protestantism, and Judaism.\n\nIn 2011, through a survey carried out by Ipsos MORI in the Western Balkans, the religious composition of Macedonia was found to be 70.7% Christian, divided in 69.6% Eastern Orthodox and 0.4% Catholics and Protestants, and 28.6% Muslim, with unaffiliated Muslims making up the 25.6%.\n\nIn 2020, PEW Research estimates that Christians will fall to 55.1% of Macedonia's population (53.7% Eastern Orthodox, 0.4% Catholic, 0.6% Protestant and other Christian denominations), while 43.6% will be Muslim, 1.3% Atheist, 0.2% Jewish, and 0.2% Other.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy has had a long history in Macedonia, and remains the majority religion. In 1019 the Archbishopric of Ohrid was established. In 1767 on order of the Sultan, the Archbishopric was abolished by the Turkish authorities and annexed to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries there was an effort to reinstate the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The Macedonian Orthodox Church gained autonomy from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1959 and declared the restoration of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. On July 19, 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared autocephaly from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Most Macedonians belong to the Orthodox faith. In 2001 the Church had about 1,350,000 adherents in Macedonia. Since 2005, canonical Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric was restored, with autonomous status within the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Macedonian Catholic Church was established in 1918. It is a Byzantine Rite \"sui juris\" particular church in full communion with Pope and the rest of the Catholic Church, alongside the Eastern Catholic Churches and uses Macedonian in the liturgy. The exarchate was dissolved in 1924. In 2001 the Holy See re-established the Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia. Currently, members of the Macedonian Catholic Church number about 11,266.\n\nThere are a number of Protestants in Macedonia. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American missionaries converted villages in the Strumica-Petrich region to Methodism, a faith still practiced. There is also a small community of Macedonian Baptists which has existed since 1928.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church operates among the Serbians in Macedonia's North. The number of adherents corresponds with the number of Serbs at 36,000.\n\nIslam has had a significant influence in Macedonia since the Ottoman invasions in the 14th and 15th centuries. Many Turks settled in Macedonia and introduced aspects of Islamic culture. Most Albanians and some ethnic Macedonians converted to Islam, these Macedonian Muslims or Torbeši generally retained their Macedonian culture and customs while many were assimilated as Turks. By the 19th Century most of the cities were primarily populated by Muslims. The Šarena Džamija in Tetovo is a legacy of the country's Ottoman past. In 2002, Muslims form approximately 33.33% of the nation's total population.There was no census since 2002 which means that it's all estimates and non-credible sources for the period between then and now.\n\nJews had been present when the region now called the Republic of Macedonia was under Roman rule in the second century AD. The population was decimated by the Crusades, but rose again following the immigration of Sephardic Jews under the Ottoman Empire. In the Second World War, Macedonia was occupied by Bulgaria, an Axis power, and the Jews were sent to concentration camps. As in the rest of the Balkans, the Holocaust and immigration to Israel means that Macedonia now has a much smaller Jewish community, numbering roughly 200. It is mainly based in the capital, Skopje, and has no functioning synagogue.\n\n"}
{"id": "184485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184485", "title": "Sadducees", "text": "Sadducees\n\nThe Sadducees (; Hebrew: \"Ṣĕdûqîm\") were a sect or group of Jews that was active in Judea during the Second Temple period, starting from the second century BCE through the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. The sect was identified by Josephus with the upper social and economic echelon of Judean society. As a whole, the sect fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the Temple. The Sadducees are often compared to other contemporaneous sects, including the Pharisees and the Essenes. Their sect is believed to have become extinct some time after the destruction of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, but it has been speculated that the later Karaites may have had some roots in—or connections with—Sadducaic views.\n\nAccording to Abraham Geiger, the Sadducaic sect of Judaism drew their name from Zadok, the first High Priest of ancient Israel to serve in the First Temple, with the leaders of the sect proposed as the Kohanim (priests, the \"sons of Zadok\", descendants of Eleazar, son of Aaron).\n\nIn any event, the name Zadok, being related to the root \"ṣāḏaq\" (to be right, just), could be indicative of their aristocratic status in society in the initial period of their existence.\n\nFurthermore, Flavius Josephus mentions in \"Antiquities of the Jews\" that in the time of Boethus: \"...one Judas, a Gaulonite, of a city whose name was Gamala, who taking with him Sadduc, a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt...\". Paul L. Maier notes, \"It seems not improbable to me that this Sadduc, the Pharisee, was the very same man of whom the rabbis speak, as the unhappy but undesigning occasion of the impiety or infidelity of the Sadduccees; nor perhaps had the men this name of the Sadduccees till this very time, though they were a distinct sect long before.\" The similarity of Sadduc to the Zadok above, varying largely in transliteration, lends credence to that account. The contextual inclusion of Boethus and Sadduc implies they were most likely contemporaries.\n\nThe Second Temple Period is the period in ancient Israel between the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 516 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE.\n\nThroughout the Second Temple Period, Jerusalem saw several shifts in rule. Alexander's conquest of the Mediterranean world brought an end to Persian control of Jerusalem (539 BCE–334/333 BCE) and ushered in the Hellenistic period. The Hellenistic period, which extended from 334/333 BCE to 63 BCE, is known today for the spread of Hellenistic influence. This included an expansion of culture, including an appreciation of Greek theater, and admiration of the human body. After the death of Alexander in 323 BCE, his generals divided the empire among themselves and for the next 30 years, they fought for control of the empire. Judea was first controlled by the Ptolemies of Egypt (r. 301–200 BCE) and later by the Seleucids of Syria (r. 200–167). King Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria, a Seleucid, disrupted whatever peace there had been in Judea when he desecrated the temple in Jerusalem and forced Jews to violate the Torah. Most prominent of the rebel groups were the Maccabees, led by Mattathias the Hasmonean and his son Judah the Maccabee. Though the Maccabees rebelled against the Seleucids in 164 BCE, Seleucid rule did not end for another 20 years. The Maccabean (a.k.a. Hasmonean) rule lasted until 63 BCE, when the Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem.\n\nThus began the Roman period of Judea, leading to the creation of the province of Roman Judea in 6 CE and extending into the 7th century CE, well beyond the end of the Second Temple Period. Cooperation between the Romans and the Jews was strongest during the reigns of Herod and his grandson, Herod Agrippa I. However, the Romans moved power out of the hands of vassal kings and into the hands of Roman administrators, beginning with the Census of Quirinius in 6 CE. The First Jewish–Roman War broke out in 66 CE. After a few years of conflict, the Romans retook Jerusalem and destroyed the temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple Period in 70 CE.\n\nDuring the Persian period, the Temple became more than the center of worship in Judea after its reconstruction in 516 BCE; it served as the center of society. It makes sense, then, that priests held important positions as official leaders outside of the Temple. The democratizing forces of the Hellenistic period lessened and shifted the focus of Judaism away from the Temple and in the 3rd century BCE, a scribal class began to emerge. New organizations and \"social elites,\" according to Shaye Cohen, appeared. It was also during this time that the high priesthood—the members of which often identified as Sadducees—was developing a reputation for corruption. Questions about the legitimacy of the Second Temple and its Sadducaic leadership freely circulated within Judean society. Sects began to form during the Maccabean reign (see Jewish Sectarianism below). The Temple in Jerusalem was the formal center of political and governmental leadership in ancient Israel, although its power was often contested and disputed by fringe groups.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Sadducees appear only in a few references in the Talmud. In the beginnings of Karaism, the followers of Anan ben David were called \"Sadducees\" and set a claim of the former being a historical continuity from the latter.\n\nThe Sadducee concept of the mortality of the soul is reflected on by Uriel Acosta, who mentions them in his writings. Acosta was referred to as a Sadducee in Karl Gutzkow's play \"The Sadducees in Amsterdam\" (1834).\n\nThe religious responsibilities of the Sadducees included the maintenance of the Temple in Jerusalem. Their high social status was reinforced by their priestly responsibilities, as mandated in the Torah. The priests were responsible for performing sacrifices at the Temple, the primary method of worship in ancient Israel. This included presiding over sacrifices during the three festivals of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Their religious beliefs and social status were mutually reinforcing, as the priesthood often represented the highest class in Judean society.\nHowever, Sadducees and the priests were not completely synonymous. Cohen points out that \"not all priests, high priests, and aristocrats were Sadducees; many were Pharisees, and many were not members of any group at all.\"\n\nThe Sadducees oversaw many formal affairs of the state. Members of the Sadducees:\n\nThe Sadducees rejected the Oral Torah as proposed by the Pharisees. Rather, they saw the written Torah as the sole source of divine authority. The written law, in its depiction of the priesthood, corroborated the power and enforced the hegemony of the Sadducees in Judean society.\n\nAccording to Josephus, the Sadducees believed that:\n\nThe Sadducees did not believe in resurrection of the dead, but believed in the traditional Jewish concept of Sheol for those who had died.\n\nAccording to the Christian Acts of the Apostles:\n\nThe Sadducees are said to have favored \"Sirach\", the only book in the Bible that recommends the use of a physician. \"Sirach\" is a product of the Jewish community in Alexandria dated to the first third of second century BCE There are no extant ancient texts of Hebrew origin with medicine as the primary subject. There was no medicine that was distinctly Jewish; instead, Jewish practitioners had adopted Greek and later Graeco-Roman knowledge as practice. The \"Book of Remedies\", the earliest medical text written in Hebrew, to Asaph the Jew, dates to the seventh or eighth century.\n\n\nThe Jewish community of the Second Temple period is often defined by its sectarian and fragmented attributes. Josephus, in \"Antiquities\", contextualizes the Sadducees as opposed to the Pharisees and the Essenes. The Sadducees are also notably distinguishable from the growing Jesus movement, which later evolved into Christianity. These groups differed in their beliefs, social statuses, and sacred texts. Though the Sadducees produced no primary works themselves, their attributes can be derived from other contemporaneous texts, namely, the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and later, the Mishnah and Talmud. Overall, the Sadducees represented an aristocratic, wealthy, and traditional elite within the hierarchy.\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls, which are often attributed to the Essenes, suggest clashing ideologies and social positions between the Essenes and the Sadducees. In fact, some scholars suggest that the Essenes began as a group of renegade Zadokites, which would indicate that the group itself had priestly, and thus Sadducaic origins. Within the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Sadducees are often referred to as Manasseh. The scrolls suggest that the Sadducees (Manasseh) and the Pharisees (Ephraim) became religious communities that were distinct from the Essenes, the true Judah. Clashes between the Essenes and the Sadducees are depicted in the Pesher on Nahum, which states \"They [Manasseh] are the wicked ones...whose reign over Israel will be brought down...his wives, his children, and his infant will go into captivity. His warriors and his honored ones [will perish] by the sword.\" The reference to the Sadducees as those who reign over Israel corroborates their aristocratic status as opposed to the more fringe group of Essenes. Furthermore, it suggests that the Essenes challenged the authenticity of the rule of the Sadducees, blaming the downfall of ancient Israel and the siege of Jerusalem on their impiety. The Dead Sea Scrolls brand the Sadducaic elite as those who broke the covenant with God in their rule of the Judean state, and thus became targets of divine revenge.\n\nThe New Testament, specifically the books of Mark and Matthew, describe anecdotes which hint at hostility between the early Christians and the Sadducaic establishment. These disputes manifest themselves on both theological and social levels. Mark describes how the Sadducees challenged Jesus' belief in the resurrection of the dead. Jesus subsequently defends his belief in resurrection against Sadducaic resistance, stating, \"and as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said to him \"I \"am\" the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\" He is God not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.\" According to Matthew's Gospel, Jesus asserts that the Sadducees were wrong because they knew \"neither the scriptures nor the power of God\". Jesus challenges the reliability of Sadducaic interpretation of Biblical doctrine, the authority of which enforces the power of the Sadducaic priesthood. The Sadducees address the issue of resurrection through the lens of marriage, which \"hinted at their real agenda: the protection of property rights through patriarchal marriage that perpetuated the male lineage.\" Furthermore, Matthew records John the Baptist calling the Sadducees a \"brood of vipers\". The New Testament thus constructs the identity of Christianity in opposition to the Sadducees.\n\nThe Pharisees and the Sadducees are historically seen as antitheses of one another. Josephus, the author of the most extensive historical account of the Second Temple Period, gives a lengthy account of Jewish sectarianism in both Jewish War and Antiquities. In Antiquities, he describes \"the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which are not written in the law of Moses, and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observance to be obligatory which are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers.\" The Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic use of the Oral Law to enforce their claims to power, citing the Written Torah as the sole manifestation of divinity.\n\nThe Rabbis, who are traditionally seen as the descendants of the Pharisees, describe the similarities and differences between the two sects in Mishnah Yadaim. The Mishnah explains that the Sadducees state, \"So too, regarding the Holy Scriptures, their impurity is according to (our) love for them. But the books of Homer, which are not beloved, do not defile the hands.\" \nA passage from the book of Acts suggests that both Pharisees and Sadducees collaborated in the Sanhedrin, the high Jewish court.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5271640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5271640", "title": "Sanjaya dynasty", "text": "Sanjaya dynasty\n\nSañjaya was an ancient Javanese dynasty that ruled the Mataram kingdom in Java during first millennium CE. The dynasty was an active promoter of Hinduism in ancient Java.\n\nAccording to Canggal inscription, this dynasty appears to have been founded in 732 by Sañjaya. The Canggal inscription was discovered in Canggal village, Southwest from the town of Magelang. This inscription was written in south Indian Pallava letters and in Sanskrit, and tells about the erection of a linga (symbol of Shiva) on the hill in Kunjarakunja area. This area is located at a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which is blessed with abundance of rice and gold. This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was reigned by King Sanna, whose long period of reign was marked with wisdom and virtue. After king Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. Confusion was widespread due to a lost of ruler and patron. Amidst this, Sanjaya ascended to the throne. He was the son of Sannaha (sister of Sanna). Sanjaya was a king who mastered holy scriptures, martial arts, and also military prowess. He conquered neighboring areas around his kingdom and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all his subjects.\n\nKing Sanna and Sanjaya was also known in Carita Parahyangan, a book from later period which mainly tells the history of Pasundan (Sunda Kingdom). This book mentioned that Sanna was defeated by Purbasora, king of Galuh, then he retreated to mount Merapi. Later Sanna's successor, Sanjaya, reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Bali. He was also involved in battle with Malayu and Keling (against their king Sang Srivijaya). The main theme of Carita Parahyangan corresponds to Canggal inscription. This story suggested West Java's origin and links of the dynasty.\n\nThere are some theories regarding the Sañjaya-Sailendra relationship. Some scholars suggested that there is no such things as Sanjaya dynasty, since there was only one dynasty called Sailendra that ruled central Java. This theory was proposed by Poerbatjaraka and suggested that there was only one kingdom and one dynasty; the kingdom is called Medang with the capital in Mataram area, and the ruling dynasty is Sailendra. He holds that Sanjaya and all of his offsprings were belongs to Sailendra family that initially were Shivaist.\n\nAnother suggests that the Sañjaya dynasty then was forced to the north of Java by the Sailendra dynasty, which emerged around 778. The evidence for this event is based on the Kalasan inscription. During this period, the Sañjaya dynasty existed next to Sailendra dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterized by peaceful co-existence and cooperation.\n\nThe association of Sailendra with Mahayana Buddhism began after the conversion of Raja Sankhara (Rakai Panaraban or Panangkaran) to buddhism. The later Sailendran kings, successors of Panangkaran become Mahayana Buddhist too and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga reign. This theory was based on Raja Sankhara Inscription (now missing), Sojomerto inscription and Carita Parahyangan manuscript. Shivaist Hindu gain royal patronage again since the reign of Pikatan, well until the end of the Medang kingdom.\n\nAnother evidence pointed that Sailendra family was using old Malay language in some of their inscriptions, which suggested Sailendra dynasty's foreign origin in Sumatra and their connections with Srivijaya. This theory holds that the Sailendras, with their strong connections to Srivijaya, managed to gain control of Central Java and imposing overlordship on the Rakais (local Javanese lords) including the Sañjaya, thus incorporated the kings of Mataram Sañjaya dynasty in their bureaucracy. The center of the dynasty court seems to be located in South Kedu (around Magelang, North of Yogyakarta).\n\nKingdoms of Java maintain a close relationship with Champa kingdom in mainland Southeast Asia since at least the reign of Sañjaya dynasty . Like the Javanese, the Cham are indianized Austronesian people. An example of relationship can be seen in architectural features in Cham temples, that have many similarities with architectural styles of temples in central Java that was built during the reign of Sañjaya dynasty.\n\nRakai Pikatan, who was the crown prince of the Sañjaya Dynasty, wedded Pramodhawardhani (833–856), a daughter of Samaratungga, king of Sailendra. From that time onwards, the influence of Sañjaya, who was a Hindu adherer, began to emerge in Mataram, replacing the Buddhist Sailendra. Rakai Pikatan toppled king Balaputra, son of Samaratungga, also the brother of Pramodhawardhani. As a result, in 850, the Sañjaya Dynasty was the sole ruler in Mataram. This ended the Sailendra presence in Central Java and Balaputra retreated to Srivijaya in Sumatra, where he became the paramount ruler.\n\nThe information about Sañjaya Dynasty is also found in the Balitung inscription dated 907. According to the Balitung inscription – when a ruler died, they transformed into a divine form. From this inscriptions, the scholars estimated the possible sequence of the ruling kings of Sañjaya dynasty:\n\n\nIt was also during the reign of the Sañjaya dynasty, the classic Javanese literature blossomed. The translations and adaptation of classic Hindu literatures into Old Javanese was conducted, such as the Kakawin Ramayana. Around 850s, Pikatan initiated the construction of the Prambanan temple in Central Java, later completed and expanded extensively by king Balitung. Prambanan temple complex is one of the largest Hindu temple in Southeast-Asia and its greatness rivalled Borobudur, which happened to be the biggest Buddhist temple in the world.\n\nThe successions of Sañjaya kings after Balitung are:\n\n\nIn 929, Mpu Sindok moved the court of Mataram from Central Java to East Java. It is not entirely clear the actual reasons of the movement. There are some possible reasons; an eruption of Merapi volcano, the power struggle, or political pressure from Sailendran based in Srivijaya Empire may have caused the move. \n\nThe shift to East Java marked the end for the Central Javanese Sañjaya dynasty, and from then on a new dynasty named the Isyana Dynasty emerged in East Java.\n\n\n"}

It goes back to a historic person called Mahima Svami (or Mahima Gosain).\n\nHe is said to have appeared in Puri in 1826. Dissatisfied with the ritualised idol worship of Lord Jagannath, he left Puri and travelled to the Kapilas hills near Dhenkanal, where he engaged himself in severe Yogic practices. In 1862, he became a \"siddha\" and started preaching a new \"dharma\". He is said to have attained \"samadhi\" in 1876. Under his first disciple, Govinda Baba, and the dissident saint poet Bhima Bhoi, the movement shifted away from the coastal region towards the central and western parts of Odisha. Spreading also to other states (Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam), people from different regions and sociocultural backgrounds joined as followers. Since then, several monastic as well as lay currents and competing associations emerged and various regional centres (Joranda, Khaliapali) have been established. Mahima Dharma is a popular ascetic movement which considers the void, \"shunya\", as the divine principle, opposing as such any idol worship. The void can only be venerated through fire, or its manifestation in the Sun, traits which link Mahima Dharma to the \"nirguna bhakti\" tradition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12711442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12711442", "title": "Shanghai Russians", "text": "Shanghai Russians\n\nThe Shanghai Russians were a sizable Russian diaspora that flourished in Shanghai, China between the World Wars. By 1937 it is estimated that there were as many as 25,000 Russians living in the city, the largest European group by far. Most of them had come from the Russian Far East, where, with the support of the Japanese, the Whites had maintained a presence as late as the autumn of 1922.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Russian imperial government was shifting the focus of its investment to Manchuria. As a consequence, China's trade with its northern neighbour soared. As soon as there was a regular ferry service between Vladivostok and Shanghai, the Russian tea merchants started to settle in the commercial capital of China. About 350 Russian citizens resided within the Shanghai International Settlement in 1905. In order to protect their interests, the Russian consulate was opened in 1896. The old building of the consulate, still occupied by the Russian diplomats, ranks among the Bund's minor landmarks. \n\nThe bulk of the Russian exile community relocated to Shanghai from Vladivostok following the fall of the Provisional Priamurye Government at the close of the Russian Civil War. Admiral Oskar Victorovich Stark's squadron alone brought several thousand White Russians from Vladivostok in 1922. Many Harbin Russians, attracted by the booming economy of Shanghai, moved from Manchuria to the coast over the following years. Barred by both distance and money from joining established communities in Paris and Berlin, a large number gravitated towards Shanghai, a freeport at the time, requiring no visa or work-permit for entry. For this same reason it was later to become a refuge for Jews fleeing the Nazis. \n\nAlthough free, and relatively secure, conditions for the émigrés were far from ideal. For one thing they were all stateless, as the Soviet government had revoked the citizenship of all political exiles in 1921. The only travel document most of them had was the Nansen passport, issued by the League of Nations. Unlike other foreigners in China they did not have the benefits conferred by extraterritoriality, which granted immunity from local laws. \n\nThis was made worse by the barriers to employment opportunities, which in this international city required a good command of English or French as a minimum requirement. There were whole families that depended on wives or daughters who made a living as taxi dancers (hired dancing partners). A survey by the League of Nations in 1935 reportedly found that some 22% of Shanghai Russian women between 16 and 45 years of age were engaging in prostitution to some extent. \n\nSome did find professional work, teaching music or French. Other women took work as dressmakers, shop assistants and hairdressers. Many men became career soldiers of the \"Shanghai Russian Regiment\", the only professional/standing unit within the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. By slow degrees, and despite the many difficulties, the community not only retained a good deal of cohesion but did begin to flourish, both economically and culturally. By the mid-1930s there were two Russian schools, as well as a variety of cultural and sporting clubs. There were Russian-language newspapers and a radio station. An important part was also played by the local Russian Orthodox Church under the guidance of St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco.\nMany exiles set up restaurants in the district known as \"Little Russia\" (around the Avenue Joffre, now Middle Huaihai Road, in the French Concession), contributing to the development of the local Western-style Haipai cuisine. Russian musicians (such as Oleg Lundstrem) achieved a dominance over the city's foreign-run orchestra. The most famous Russian singer, Alexander Vertinsky, relocated from Paris to Shanghai; and Fyodor Chaliapin was seen on tour. Vladimir Tretchikoff, the \"King of Kitsch\", spent his youth in the city. Russian teachers offered lessons in theatre and dancing. Margot Fonteyn, the English ballerina, studied dance in Shanghai as a child with Russian masters, one of whom, George Gontcharov, had formerly danced with the Bolshoi in Moscow. \n\nBut it was the contribution that Russian women made to the entertainment industry, dancing and otherwise, that gave the city its exotic reputation, noted in the guidebooks of the day. A fictionalized portrayal of their predicament is presented in the James Ivory film \"The White Countess\" (2005). Those who were left became the focus of earnest campaigns by the League of Nations and others to end the \"white slave trade.\" \n\nThe Japanese formed a bureau for the Russian emigrees; it provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel. The Shanghai Russians were left to choose between a Soviet citizenship or to remain stateless by support of the bureau. The stateless Russians were officially favoured by the regime, but in reality, they were not trusted and exposed to a great risk of being arrested as spies for the Soviet Union. They were also often enlisted in the army for work along the border with the Soviet Union. After 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union parted, they were in an even more sensitive situation. To separate the anti-Soviet Russians from the Soviet Russians, the former were ordered to wear a badge with the colours of the Czar — later a white numbered disk of aluminium.\n\nThe Shanghai Russians survived through the difficult days of the Japanese occupation, but left in the end with the advance of the Communists. They were forced to flee, first to a refugee camp on the island of Tubabao in the Philippines and then mainly to the United States and Australia; however, many settled in Hong Kong. The Russian monuments of Shanghai did not escape the ravages of the Cultural Revolution. The Pushkin statue, funded by public subscription and unveiled on the centenary of the poet's death, was smashed by the Red Guards in 1966. It was subsequently restored in 1987. The Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nicholas, consecrated and elaborately frescoed in 1933, was converted into a washing machine factory, and subsequently a restaurant. The municipal government terminated the lease of the Cathedral to the restaurant in 2004.\n\nIn the 1967 British film \"A Countess from Hong Kong\", written and directed by Charlie Chaplin, Sophia Loren plays the only child of Russian aristocrats who escaped, during the Russian Revolution, to Shanghai, where she subsequently was born. Her parents died there when she was thirteen; she was the mistress of a gangster at fourteen. Asked how she has come to live in Hong Kong, she replies, \"Well, there was another war, another revolution — so here we are.\"\n\n\n"}

She is known as \"torch of the gods\" and is considered an important deity in the Canaanite pantheon and among the Phoenicians. She is not to be confused with the Akkadian sun god, Shamash.\n\nIn the Epic of Baal, Shapash plays an important part in the plot, as she interacts with all of the main characters, and in the end she is favourable to Baal's position as king. She announces that El supports Yam. By delivering her verdict in the final struggle of Baal with Mot, she reveals her role as judge among the gods, and by her judgement against Mot, as saviour of humankind, two aspects, Brian B. Schmidt observes, that conform with what is known of Shamash's function in Mesopotamia. After Baal is killed, she helps Anat bury and mourn him, and then stops shining. Following El's dream about the resurrection of Baal, El asks Anat to persuade Shapash to shine again, which she agrees to, but declares that she will continue to search for him. In the battle between Baal and Mot, she threatens Mot that El will intervene in Baal's favour, a threat which ends the battle.\n\nIn the Tanakh, worshiping Shemesh is forbidden and is punishable by stoning. Worshiping Shemesh was said to include bowing to the east, in the direction of the sun, as well as rituals related to horses and chariots, which were associated with her. King Josiah was also said to have abolished sun worship (among others).\n\nThe Bible in general attempts to portray the sun non-anthropomorphically or as representing Yahweh's power. Shapash/Shemesh is usually substituted for euphemisms like \"or\" (light), and it appears that sun worship, even in an Yahwist way, was avoided at all costs. However, the Woman of the Apocalypse, may directly allude to ancient Near Eastern sun goddesses.\n\n"}

He is believed by followers as a manifestation of God.\n\nSwaminarayan was born Ghanshyam Pande in Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1781. In 1792, he began a seven-year pilgrimage across India at the age of 11 years, adopting the name \"Nilkanth Varni\". During this journey, he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 months of this journey, he settled in the state of Gujarat around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the Uddhav sampradaya by his guru, Swami Ramanand, and was given the name \"Sahajanand Swami\". In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death. Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the Swaminarayan Mantra. From this point onwards, he was known as \"Swaminarayan\". The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday.\n\nSwaminarayan developed a good relationship with the British Raj. He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from Islam and Zoroastrianism. He built six temples in his lifetime and appointed 500 paramahamsas to spread his philosophy. In 1826, Swaminarayan wrote the \"Shikshapatri\", a book of social principles. He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampraday. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing non-violent yajñas (fire sacrifices) on a large scale.\n\nSwaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, a village near Ayodhya, in a Hindi speaking region in India. Born into the brahmin or priestly caste of Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named \"Ghanshyam Pande\" by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi). The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami, celebrating the birth of Rama. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra (March–April), is celebrated as both Rama Navami and Swaminarayan Jayanti by Swaminarayan followers. This celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers.\nSwaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande. He is said to have mastered the scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the \"Ramayana\", and the \"Mahabharata\" by the age of seven.\n\nAfter the death of his parents, Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 (Ashadh Sud 10, Samvat 1849) at the age of 11. He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey. Nilkanth Varni travelled across India and parts of Nepal in search of an ashram, or hermitage, that practiced what he considered a correct understanding of Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, and Pancaratra, the four primary schools of Hindu philosophy. To find such an ashram, Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta categories:\n\n\nWhile on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered \"Astanga yoga\" (eightfold yoga) in a span of 9 months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi. In Nepal, it is said that he met King Rana Bahadur Shah and cured him of his stomach illness. As a result, the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned. Nilkanth Varni visited the Jagannath Temple in Puri as well as temples in Badrinath, Rameshwaram, Nashik, Dwarka and Pandharpur.\n\nIn 1799, after a seven-year journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi eventually concluded in Loj, a village in the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was twenty-two years older than Nilkanth, answered the five questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.\n\nAccording to the sect, Nilkanth's understanding of the metaphysical and epistemological concepts of the \"pancha-tattvas\" (five eternal elements), together with his mental and physical discipline, inspired senior \"sadhus\" of Ramanand Swami.\n\nNilkanth Varni received \"sannyasa\" initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800, and with it was granted the names \"Sahajanand Swami\" and \"Narayan Muni\" to signify his new status.\n\nAt the age of 21, Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the \"Uddhav Sampraday\" by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The \"Uddhav Sampraday\" henceforth came to be known as the \"Swaminarayan Sampraday\". According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacarya.\n\nSahajanand Swami was later known as \"Swaminarayan\" after the mantra he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the Swaminarayan mantra, to repeat in their rituals: \"Swaminarayan\". When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into samadhi (a form of meditation) This act is also called maha-samadhi (\"great samadhi\") and claimed that they could see their personal gods, even though they had no knowledge of Astanga Yoga. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari. As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, Nishkulanand Swami. This work, the \"Yama Danda\", was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect.\n\nSwaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and dharma to lead a pious life. Using Hindu texts and rituals to form the base of his organisation, Swaminarayan founded what in later centuries would become a global organisation with strong Gujarati roots. He was particularly strict on the separation of sexes in temples. Swaminarayan was against the consumption of meat, alcohol or drugs, adultery, suicide, animal sacrifices, criminal activities and the appeasement of ghosts and tantric rituals. Alcohol consumption was forbidden by him even for medicinal purposes. Many of his followers took vows before becoming his disciple. He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation: dharma, bhakti (devotion), gnana (knowledge) and vairagya (detachment). Doctrinally, Swaminarayan was close to eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja and was critical of Shankaracharya's concept of advaita, or monistic non-dualism. Swaminarayan's ontology maintained that the supreme being is not formless and that God always has a divine form.\n\nSwaminarayan insisted that education was the inherent right of all people, including women, despite considerable criticism from those in his own contemporary society who \"loathed the uplift of lower caste women\". At that time, influential and wealthy individuals educated their girls through private and personal tuition. Male followers of Swaminarayan made arrangements to educate their female family members. The literacy rate among females began to increase during Swaminarayan's time, and they were able to give discourses on spiritual subjects. Members of the sect consider Swaminarayan a pioneer of education of females in India.\n\nAccording to the author Raymond Brady Williams, \"Swaminarayan is an early representative of the practice of advocacy of women's rights without personal involvement with women\". To counter the practice of \"sati\" (self-immolation by a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre), Swaminarayan argued that, as human life was given by God it could be taken only by God, and that \"sati\" had no Vedic sanction. He went to the extent to call \"sati\" nothing but suicide. Swaminarayan offered parents help with dowry expenses to discourage female infanticide, calling infanticide a sin. For calling a halt to these prevailing practices, Swaminarayan's \"contemporaries naturally saw in him a pioneer of a reformed and purified Hinduism, and Swaminarayan Hinduism an ‘ingrazi dharma’ or British religion.\"\n\nProfessor David Harman observed that Swaminarayan \"criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental way in which they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women.\" Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to prevent ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan \"forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex.\" This strict precept was one he likely internalized \"after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [when] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman\". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive.\n\nMembers of the faith are defensive of the fact that some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.\n\nIn case of widows, Swaminarayan directed those who could not follow the path of chastity to remarry. For those who could, he lay down strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family. This may seem regressive, however it gave them \"a respected and secure place in the social order\" of the time. Swaminarayan restricted widows \"to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations.\"\n\nAfter assuming the leadership of the Sampraday, Swaminarayan worked to assist the poor by distributing food and drinking water. He undertook several social service projects and opened almshouses for the poor. Swaminarayan organized food and water relief to people during times of drought. The faith largely\nhad excluded the mass of the poor, such as marginal peasants, agricultural labourers, the informal sector working class, adivasis and dalits. Dalits were banned from Swaminarayan temples from the beginning though in one case a separate temple was created for their use.\n\nSome suggest that Swaminarayan worked towards ending the caste system, allowing everyone into the Swaminarayan Sampraday. However partaking in the consumption food of lower castes and caste pollution was not supported by him. A political officer in Gujarat, \"Mr. Williamson\" reported to Bishop Herber that Swaminarayan had \"destroyed the yoke of caste.\" He instructed his paramhansas to collect alms from all sections of society and appointed people from the lower strata of society as his personal attendants. Members of the lower castes were attracted to the movement as it improved their social status. Swaminarayan would eat along with the lower Rajput and Khati castes but not any lower. He established separate places of worship for the lower caste population where they were in large numbers. However, Dalits - those outside of the caste system - were formally excluded from Swaminarayan temples. Members of a lower caste are prohibited from wearing a full sect mark (tilak chandlo) on their forehead. Even now, however, for the vast majority of Gujarat's lower-caste, Untouchable and tribal population, the sect is out of bounds.\n\nReginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, noted that disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even included Muslims. He writes \"they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live as if they were brothers.\" Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that \"[Swaminarayan] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); that people might eat separately or together in this world, but that above \"oopur\" pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease.\" Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that moksha (salvation) was not attainable by everyone. He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.\n\nSwaminarayan was against animal sacrifices as carried out by Brahmin priests during Vedic rituals, such as yajnas (fire sacrifices), influenced by the Kaula and Vama Marg cults. The priests consumed \"sanctified\" prasad in the form of meat of these animals. To solve this problem, Swaminarayan conducted several large-scale yajnas involving priests from Varanasi. These did not have animal sacrifices and were conducted in strict accordance with Vedic scriptures. Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating ahimsa through several such large-scale yajnas. Swaminarayan stressed lacto vegetarianism among his followers and forbade meat consumption, codifying the conduct in the Shikshapatri.\n\nDuring the time when Swaminarayan came to Gujarat, the law and order situation of Gujarat was in worst ever. Neither British government nor local kings were able to control the robberies, killings, internal conflicts, rapes, and other uncultured events in Kathiyawar, Kutch and Gujarat. \nUpon reaching to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values to the extent that they would never rob, or kill any living being. Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.\n\nThe Bishop of Calcutta also noted that Swaminarayan \"preached a great degree of purity, forbidding his disciples so much as to (not) look on any woman whom they passed. He condemned theft and bloodshed; and those villages and districts which had received him, from being among worst, were now among the best and most orderly in the provinces.\" \n\nSwaminarayan ordered the construction of several Hindu temples and he had built six huge temples by himself and installed the idols of various deities such as Nara-Narayana in two temples, Laxminarayan Dev, Gopinathji Maharaj, Radha Raman Dev and Madanmohan Lalji . The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan provide evidence of the priority of Krishna. Disciples of Swaminarayan composed devotional poems which are widely sung by the tradition during festivals. Swaminarayan introduced fasting and devotion among followers. He conducted the festivals of Vasant Panchami, Holi, and Janmashtami with organization of the traditional folk dance raas.\n\nThe first temple Swaminarayan constructed was in Ahmedabad in 1822, with the land for construction given by the British Imperial Government. Following a request of devotees from Bhuj, Swaminarayan asked his follower Vaishnavananand to build a temple there. Construction commenced in 1822, and the temple was built within a year. A temple in Vadtal followed in 1824, a temple in Dholera in 1826, a temple in Junagadh in 1828 and a temple in Gadhada, also in 1828. By the time of his death, Swaminarayan had also ordered construction of temples in Muli, Dholka and Jetalpur.\n\nFrom early on, ascetics have played a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They contribute towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as \"paramhansas\" in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of \"sannyasi\" in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami.\n\nSwaminarayan propagated general Hindu texts. He held the Bhagavata Purana in high authority. However, there are many texts that were written by Swaminarayan or his followers that are regarded as shastras or scriptures within the Swaminarayan sect. Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the \"Shikshapatri\" and the \"Vachanamrut\". Other important works and scriptures include the \"Satsangi Jeevan\", Swaminarayan's authorized biography, the \"Muktanand Kavya\", the \"Nishkulanand Kavya\" and the \"Bhakta Chintamani\".\n\nSwaminarayan wrote the \"Shikshapatri\" on 11 February 1826. While the original Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it was translated into Gujarati by Nityanand Swami under the direction of Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and it is one of the very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. Acharya Tejendraprasad of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text.\n\nSwaminarayan in various places of Shikshapatri describes Shri Krishna as the greatest entity. In Shikshapatri slok 1 and 108 are few places that mentions that Swaminarayan prayed on Shri Krishna.\n\nShikshapatri slok 1\n\nवामे यस्य स्थिता राधा श्रीश्च यस्यास्ति वक्षसि ।\n\nवृन्दावनविहारं तं श्रीकृष्णं हृदि चिन्तये ॥ 1॥\n\n\"Translation: With all My heart, I meditate on Shree Krishna, who resides in the divine abode Vrindavan; with Radha on his left and Shree residing within his heart.\"\n\nShikshapatri slok 108 also mentions that Shri Krishna is the greatest entity.\n\nस श्रीकृष्णः परंब्रह्म भगवान् पुरुषोत्तमः ।\n\nउपास्य इष्टदेवो नः सर्वाविर्भावकारणम् ॥ 108॥\n\n\"Translation:\" \"The Lord, Shree Krishna is the greatest entity. I admire Him the most. He is the cause of all incarnations and is thus truly worthy to be worshiped.\"\n\nSwaminarayan's philosophical, social and practical teachings are contained in the \"Vachanamrut\", a collection of dialogues recorded by five prominent saints (Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Nityanand Swami, Shukanand Muni, & Brahmanand Swami) from his spoken words. The \"Vachanamrut\" is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect. It contains views on \"dharma\" (moral conduct), \"jnana\" (understanding of the nature of the self), \"vairagya\" (detachment from material pleasure), and \"bhakti\" (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a \"jiva\" (soul) to attain \"moksha\" (salvation).\n\nSatsangi Jeevan is the authorised biography of Swaminarayan. The book contains information on the life and teachings of Swaminarayan. It is written by Shatanand Swami and completed in Vikram Samvat 1885. Swaminarayan decided to make Gadhada his permanent residence on the insistence of Dada Khachar and his sisters. Swaminarayan instructed Shatanand Swami to write a book on his life and pastimes.\n\nTo enable Shatanand Swami to write from His childhood, Swaminarayan had blessed Shatanand Swami with Sanjay Drishti - special power to see the entire past right from His childhood.\n\nOnce written by Shatanand Swami, this book was verified and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan.\n\nIn relation to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that \"the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not and would never have been achieved by the law.\" Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi \"most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma.\" He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism.\n\nSwaminarayan strived to maintain good relationships with people of other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included Khoja Muslims. In Kathiawad, many Muslims wore kanthi necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also had a meeting with Reginald Heber, Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying Matchlocks and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him to see two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another.\n\nSwaminarayan enjoyed a good relationship with the British Imperial Government. The first temple he built, in Ahmedabad, was built on of land given by the government. The British officers gave it a 101 gun salute when it was opened. It was in an 1825 meeting with Reginald Heber that Swaminarayan is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of Krishna. In 1830, Swaminarayan had a meeting with Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay (1827 to 1830). According to Malcolm, Swaminarayan had helped bring some stability to a lawless region. During the meeting with Malcolm, Swaminarayan gave him a copy of the Shikshapatri. This copy of the Shikshapatri is currently housed at the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford. Swaminarayan also encouraged the British Governor James Walker to implement strong measures to stop the practice of sati.\n\nIn 1830, Swaminarayan gathered his followers and announced his departure. He later died on 1 June 1830 (Jeth sud 10, Samvat 1886), and it is believed by followers that, at the time of his death, Swaminarayan left Earth for Akshardham, his abode. He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in Gadhada.\n\nPrior to his death, Swaminarayan decided to establish a line of acharyas or preceptors, as his successors. He established two \"gadis\" (seats of leadership). One seat was established at Ahmedabad (Nar Narayan Dev Gadi) and the other one at Vadtal (Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi) on 21 November 1825. Swaminarayan appointed an acharya to each of these \"gadis\" to pass on his message to others and to preserve his fellowship, the Swaminarayan Sampraday. These acharyas came from his immediate family after sending representatives to search them out in Uttar Pradesh. He formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed them to the office of acharya. Ayodhyaprasad, the son of Swaminarayan's elder brother Rampratap and Raghuvira, the son of his younger brother Ichcharam, were appointed \"acharyas\" of the Ahmedabad Gadi and the Vadtal Gadi respectively. Swaminarayan decreed that the office should be hereditary so that \"acharyas\" would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family. The administrative division of his followers into two territorial dioceses is set forth in minute detail in a document written by Swaminarayan called Desh Vibhaag Lekh. Swaminarayan stated to all the devotees and saints to obey both the Acharyas and Gopalanand Swami who was considered as the main pillar and chief ascetic for the Sampraday.\n\nThe current \"acharyas\" of the Swaminarayan Sampraday are Koshalendraprasad Pande, of the Ahmedabad Gadi, and Rakeshprasadji Pande, of the Vadtal Gadi.\n\nDecades after his death, several divisions occurred with different understandings of succession. This included the establishment of Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), the founder of which left the Vadtal Gadi in 1905, and \"Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan\", the founder of which left the Ahmedabad Gadi in the 1940s. The followers of BAPS hold Gunatitanand Swami as the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan, asserting that on several occasions Swaminarayan revealed to devotees that Gunatitanand Swami was Aksharbrahm manifest. Followers of BAPS believe that the acharyas were given administrative leadership of the sect while Gunatitanand Swami was given spiritual leadership by Swaminarayan. The current spiritual and administrative leader of BAPS is Mahant Swami Maharaj. The followers of the Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan hold Gopalanand Swami as the successor to Swaminarayan. The current leader of this sect is Purushottampriyadasji Maharaj.\n\nAccording to the biographer Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died, he had a following of 1.8 million people. In 2001, Swaminarayan centres existed on four continents, and the congregation was recorded to be five million, the majority in the homeland of Gujarat. The newspaper Indian Express estimated members of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism to number over 20 million (2 crore) worldwide in 2007.\n\nIn his discourses recorded in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans would not be able to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.\n\nSome of Swaminarayan's followers believe he was an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story of the birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in 1825.\n\nThe belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1347900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1347900", "title": "Tom Harpur", "text": "Tom Harpur\n\nThomas William \"Tom\" Harpur (April 24, 1929 – January 2, 2017) was a Canadian author, broadcaster, columnist and theologian. An ordained priest, he was a proponent of the Christ myth theory, the idea that Jesus did not exist but is a fictional or mythological figure. He was the author of a number of books, including \"For Christ's Sake\" (1986), \"Life after Death\" (1996), \"The Pagan Christ\" (2004), and \"Born Again\" (2011 and 2017).\n\nBorn in the east-end of Toronto, Ontario to an evangelical family, in 1929, Harpur earned an Honours B.A. in 1951 at University College at the University of Toronto, where he won the Jarvis Scholarship in Greek and Latin, the Maurice Hutton Scholarship in Classics, the Sir William Mulock Scholarship in Classics, and the Gold Medal in Classics. He went on to study Lit.Hum. (\"Greats\" or Classics) at Oriel College at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar from 1951 to 1954 where he read the ancient historians (Herodotus, Thucydides and Tacitus) completely in their original texts. He graduated in 1954 with the B.A and was conferred the M.A. (Oxon.) two years later. Between 1954 and 1956 he studied theology at Wycliffe College, University of Toronto, where he was a tutor in Greek. At Wycliffe he won prizes in homiletics and Greek and was the senior student and valedictorian in his graduating year. He returned to Oxford in 1962 and 1963 for his post-graduate studies where he read the Early Christian writers or Church Fathers (Patristics).\n\nHarpur was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church of Canada in 1956. He served as a curate at St. John's York Mills, Toronto from 1956 to 1957. From 1957 to 1964 he served the parish of St. Margaret's-in-the-Pines in Scarborough, Ontario. During this time he lectured on ancient philosophy part-time at Wycliffe College. From 1962 to 1963 he spent a further year at Oriel College, Oxford, doing postgraduate research in Patristics and New Testament studies.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1971, Harpur was an assistant professor and then a full professor of New Testament and New Testament Greek at Wycliffe, and from 1984 to 1987 he was part-time lecturer on the Theology and Praxis of Mass Media course at the Toronto School of Theology in the University of Toronto.\n\nHarpur worked as a journalist at the \"Toronto Star\" for thirty years, twelve of which were as the newspaper's religion editor. He met his wife Susan at the \"Star\", where she worked in the legal department, and married her in 1980. After leaving the position of religion editor in 1984 he continued to contribute a regular column on religious and ethical issues. Harpur also wrote a number of books on religion and theology, ten of which became Canadian bestsellers and two of which were made into TV series for VisionTV. For a time he had his own TV show, \"Harpur's Heaven and Hell\", and has hosted a variety of radio and television programs on the topic of religion, particularly on VisionTV. He was, over the years, a frequent commentator on religious news events for most of the Canadian networks, especially CBC. In his later years, Harpur also wrote occasional opinion pieces Postmedia Network and a column for Sun Media. In 1996, his bestseller \"Life After Death\" about near-death experiences was turned into a 10-episode TV series hosted by Harpur himself. Harpur's 2004 book \"The Pagan Christ\" was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by the \"Toronto Star\" and \"The Globe and Mail\".\n\nHarpur was a Fellow of the American Religious Public Relations Council, and in 1976 won a State of Israel Silver Medal for Outstanding Journalism. His biography is included in the American \"Who's Who in Religion\", \"Canadian Who's Who\", and \"Men of Achievement\". In 2008 the CBC documentary \"The Pagan Christ\", based upon Harpur's book, won the Platinum Remi Award at the Houston International Film Festival and the Gold Camera Award at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California. He belonged to the Canadian Association of Rhodes Scholars and the Writers' Union.\n\nHarpur's 2004 book \"The Pagan Christ\" presents the case that the gospels re-work ancient pagan myths. Harpur builds on Alvin Boyd Kuhn when listing similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in the second or third centuries, the early church created the fictional impression of a literal and historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence. Having come to see the scriptures as symbolic allegory of a cosmic truth rather than as inconsistent history, Harpur concludes he has a greater internal connection with the spirit of Christ.\n\nThe book received a great deal of criticism, including a response book, \"Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea\". Robert M. Price's negative review of \"The Pagan Christ\" notes, \"Harpur grants that the gospel mythemes descend only indirectly from Egyptian prototypes, through the channels of Greco-Roman Mystery cults and even the Old Testament, most of the time his citation of Egyptian stories and iconography, a la Massey, et. al., implies a direct borrowing from Egypt ...I am friendly to this position up to a point. ...But he appeals to many, many more bits of Egyptian myth and liturgy, and most of these do not strike me with anywhere near the force that they did Harpur.\" Harpur published a more scholarly sequel called \"Water Into Wine\" in 2007.\n\nHarpur died in Lion's Head, Ontario, on January 2, 2017 at age 87.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was Josef Leib Miaczyn, a wheelwright, and his mother was Sheindel Lipshitz. In 1889 the family emigrated to England and settled in East London, where Josef worked in a textile factory. They changed their family name to the easier-to-pronounce Cohen, and Abraham went by Morris and Moishe.\n\nCohen loved the theaters, the streets, the markets, the foods and the boxing arenas of the British capital more than he did the Jews' Free School, and in April 1900 he was arrested as \"a person suspected of attempting to pick pockets\". A magistrate sent him to the Hayes Industrial School, an institution set up by the likes of Lord Rothschild to care for and train wayward Jewish lads. He was released in 1905 and Cohen's parents shipped the young Morris off to western Canada with the hope that the fresh air and open plains of the New World would reform his ways.\n\nCohen initially worked on a farm near Whitewood, Saskatchewan. He tilled the land, tended the livestock and learned to shoot a gun and play cards. He did that for a year, and then started wandering through the Western provinces, making a living as a carnival talker, gambler, grifter and successful real estate broker. Some of his activities landed him in jail.\n\nCohen also became friendly with some of the Chinese exiles who had come to work on the Canadian Pacific Railways. He loved the camaraderie and the food, and in Saskatoon came to the aid of a Chinese restaurant owner who was being robbed. Cohen's training in the alleyways of London came in handy, and he knocked out the thief and tossed him out into the street. Such an act was unheard of at the time, as few white men ever came to the aid of the Chinese. The Chinese welcomed Cohen into their fold and eventually invited him to join the Tongmenghui, Sun Yat-sen's anti-Manchu organization. Cohen began to advocate for the Chinese.\n\nMorris Cohen soon moved to the city of Edmonton in the neighbouring province of Alberta. There he became manager of one of the provincial capital’s leading real estate agencies and was appointed, on the personal recommendation of the Attorney General Sir Charles Wilson Cross, to serve the province as a Commissioner of Oaths, an appointment offered only to \"fit and proper persons\".\n\nIt was in pre-World War I Edmonton that Cohen commenced his long and varied military career by recruiting members of the Chinese community and training them in drill and musketry on behalf of Dr Sun Yat-sen’s representative organization in Canada.\n\nCohen fought with the Canadian Railway Troops in Europe during World War I where part of his job involved supervising Chinese labourers. He also saw some fierce fighting at the Western Front, especially during the Third Battle of Ypres. After the war, he resettled in Canada. But the economy had declined and the days of the real estate boom were long over. Cohen looked for something new to do, and in 1922 he headed to China to help close a railway deal for Sun Yat-sen with Northern Construction and JW Stewart Ltd. After disembarking in Shanghai, Cohen went to see George Sokolsky, the New-York born journalist who worked for Sun's English-language Shanghai Gazette. Sokolsky arranged an interview for him with Eugene Chen, Sun's English language secretary. Cohen was hired, and soon ensconced himself at Sun’s home at 29 Rue Molière in the city’s French Concession. He then got right to work.\n\nIn Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou), Cohen trained Sun's small armed forces to box and shoot, and told people that he was an aide-de-camp and an acting colonel in Sun Yat-sen's army. Fortunately for Cohen, his lack of proficiency in Chinese — he spoke a pidgin form of Cantonese at best — was not a problem since Sun, his wife Soong Ching-ling and many of their associates were Western-educated and spoke English. Cohen's colleagues started calling him Ma Kun (馬坤), and he soon became one of Sun's main protectors, shadowing the Chinese leader to conferences and war zones. After one battle where he was nicked by a bullet, Cohen started carrying a second gun. The western community were intrigued by Sun's gun-toting protector and began calling him \"Two-Gun Cohen.\" The name stuck.\n\nSun died of cancer in 1925, and Cohen went to work for a series of Southern Chinese Kuomintang leaders, from Sun's son, Sun Fo, and Sun's brother-in-law, the banker T. V. Soong, to such warlords as Li Jishen and Chen Jitang. He was also acquainted with Chiang Kai-shek, whom he knew from when Chiang was commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy, which was located outside of Canton. His dealings with Chiang, though, were minimal since Cohen was allied with southern leaders who were generally opposed to Chiang. Cohen ran security for his bosses and acquired weapons and gunboats. Eventually he earned the rank of acting general, though he never led any troops.\n\nWhen the Japanese invaded China in 1937, Cohen eagerly joined the fight. He rounded up weapons for the Chinese and even did work for the British intelligence agency, Special Operations Executive (SOE). Cohen was able to prove that the Japanese were using poison gas to exterminate the Chinese masses. Cohen was in Hong Kong when the Japanese attacked in December 1941. He placed Soong Ching-ling and her sister Ai-ling onto one of the last planes out of the British colony.\n\nCohen stayed behind to fight, and when Hong Kong fell later that month, the Japanese imprisoned him at Stanley Prison Camp. There the Japanese badly beat him and he languished in Stanley until he was part of a rare prisoner exchange in late 1943.\n\nCohen sailed back to Canada, settled in Montreal and married Judith Clark, who ran a successful women's boutique. He made regular visits back to China with the hope of establishing work or business ties. Mostly, though, Cohen saw old friends, sat in hotel lobbies and spun out tales—many of them tall—of his exploits. It was his own myth making, together with the desire of others to fabricate yarns about him, that has resulted in much of the misinformation about Cohen, from the claim that he had a hand in the making of modern China, to such outlandish ones like him having an affair with Soong Ching-ling and a wife in Canada back in the 1920s. After the 1949 Communist takeover, Cohen was one of the few people who was able to move between Taiwan and mainland China. His prolonged absences took a toll on his marriage, and he and Judith divorced in 1956.\n\nWhen the newly formed United Nations began the debate on the UN Resolution on the Partition of Palestine, following the UN Special Committee on Palestine recommendation, Morris Cohen flew to San Francisco and convinced the head of the Chinese delegation to abstain from voting when he learned they planned to oppose partition.\n\nCohen then settled with his widowed sister, Leah Cooper, in Salford, England. There he was surrounded by siblings, nephews and nieces and became a beloved family patriarch. His standing as a loyal aide to Sun Yat-sen helped him maintain good relations with both Kuomintang and Chinese Communist leaders, and he soon was able to arrange consulting jobs with Vickers (planes), Rolls Royce (engines) and Decca Radar. His last visit to China was during the start of the Cultural Revolution as an honoured guest of Zhou Enlai.\n\nMorris Cohen died in 1970 in Salford. He is buried in Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester.\n\nThere are numerous publications that focus on the life of Morris Cohen:\n\n\n\n"}

It was commanded for about eighty days in 1943 by L. Ron Hubbard, who later became the founder of Scientology. After Hubbard was removed from command for shelling Mexican territory, the \"PC-815\" served as a shore patrol vessel off San Diego, California. She was lost with one of her crew in September 1945 after colliding with the destroyer USS \"Laffey\". \"PC-815\"s short career led to the vessel being dubbed the \"jinxed sub-chaser\".\n\n\"PC-815\" was laid down on 10 October 1942 at the Albina Engine and Machinery Works in Portland, Oregon. She was fitted out commencing 5 December and was commissioned on 20 April 1943, with Lieutenant (j.g.) L. Ron Hubbard in command. A few weeks later she sailed down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she arrived on 17 May to take on supplies. On 18 May, the \"PC-815\" left Astoria for Bremerton, Washington, where she was to have radar and depth charge launchers fitted. Her journey was interrupted by an air-sea rescue operation, then was resumed with a new destination — San Diego.\n\nTwo 1,440bhp Hooven-Owens-Rentschler R-99DA diesel engines (Serial No. 6977 and 6978), Westinghouse single reduction gear, two shafts.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 May 1943, the crew of \"PC-815\" detected what Hubbard thought was first one then later two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines approximately off the shore of Cape Lookout, Oregon.

Hubbard himself thought that the echo of an active sonar ping, combined with apparent engine noises heard through the ship's hydrophone indicated contact with a submarine.\n\nOver the next 68 hours, the ship expended 37 depth charges in a \"battle\" that also involved the U.S. Navy blimps \"K-39\" and \"K-33\", the United States Coast Guard patrol boats \"Bonham\" and 78302, and the subchasers USS \"SC-536\" and USS \"SC-537\", all summoned to act as reinforcements. \"PC-815\" was finally ordered back to base on 21 May.\n\nIn his eighteen-page after-action report, Hubbard claimed to have \"definitely sunk, beyond doubt\" one submarine and critically damaged another. However, the subsequent investigation by the Commander NW Sea Frontier, Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, cast a skeptical light on Hubbard's claims. His summary memorandum to Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, stated:\n\nFletcher added that \"there is a known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped\", absolving the responding blimps from any fault as their method of detecting submarines relies on a Magnetic Anomaly Detector. This also implied that Lt. Hubbard and his crew were operating the ship's sonar equipment incorrectly. After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast. Hubbard, however, never accepted that he had been mistaken about the \"battle.\" Both he and Tom Moulton, one of his officers, claimed that the official denials of any Japanese submarine presence off the Pacific coast had been motivated by a desire to avoid panic among the U.S. population. Years later, Hubbard told Scientologists:\n\nHowever, the mouth of the Columbia River is some 75 miles north of Cape Lookout, the area in which Hubbard's naval reports claimed his anti-submarine action took place.\n\nMoreover, the Japanese submarine \"I-76\" (renamed \"I-176\" by that time) was based in Truk and operated only in the south Pacific during the time when Hubbard was in command of \"PC-815\". The I-176 was sunk in the Coral Sea in May 1944 and removed from the Japanese Navy List on July 10, 1944 – a year after Hubbard was relieved of command of the \"PC-815\".\n\nA month later, the \"PC-815\" traveled to San Diego, which was to become her home port. She arrived there on 2 June, and at the end of June was ordered to sea to join an anti-submarine training exercise. The exercise, held on 28 June, ended early and Hubbard took the opportunity to order an impromptu gunnery exercise while anchored just off the Mexican territory of South Coronado Island to the south-west of San Diego. The Mexican government sent an official protest to the U.S. Government, as no gunnery operations had been scheduled.\nOn 30 June a Board of Investigation was convened concerning \"PC-815\" which concluded that Hubbard had disregarded orders, both by conducting gunnery practice and by anchoring in Mexican territorial waters without proper authority. His orders stated that the \"PC-815\" was supposed to return after completing that day's training. Hubbard argued that his crew was inexperienced, it was foggy, and he was tired so he did not return to port as ordered. A month earlier in his after action report concerning the recent fiasco off Cape Lookout, he had described the same men as \"experienced\" and \"highly skilled\". Vice Admiral Fletcher, who both chaired the board and read the prior after action report, rated Hubbard \"below average\" and noted: \"Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised\". Hubbard was relieved of command effective 7 July 1943.\n\nAfter Hubbard was replaced, \"PC-815\" remained in San Diego as a shore patrol vessel, but appears to have been mostly inactive during this period. According to her Movement Card she took part in the occasional offshore patrol, training exercises and escorting submarines in and out of the harbor. She was restored to active duty on 2 September 1945, but at 6:47 a.m. on 11 September, the ship collided with the destroyer in dense fog off San Diego. The collision started a fire on board \"PC-815\", which sank within five minutes. One man from \"PC-815\" was recorded as missing, presumed drowned. The \"Laffey\" suffered significant damage, with the fire from \"PC-815\" spreading into one of the destroyer's compartments.\n\nNavy divers demolished the wreck in early November 1945 due to the navigation hazard that it posed to a busy shipping channel. It is reported to be lying at in of water and is said to be diveable.\n\n\n"}

It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by Melbourne University Press.\n\nHume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.\n\nPrior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her \"Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today\", which was first published by Viking Press in 1979. A second study was produced by the anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann in her \"Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England\" (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London. This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's \"Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited\" (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.\n\nLynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a religious pluralist and leading her to study the discipline of anthropology. Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a Unitarian church in Calgary, it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992. Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the Church of All Worlds and held in the rural outskirts of Canberra. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a neoshamanic meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a Vodou-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess Oya.\n\nIn preparation for \"Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia\", Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became \"not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime.\" Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, Murdoch University and at the Theosophical Society in Brisbane. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a snowball sampling method.\n\nChapter one, entitled \"Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach\", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation. The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia. The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views, while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.\n\nChapter five offers an examination of rites of passage and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca, while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in magic. The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms, and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality. In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.\n\nEmma Tomalin of Lancaster University reviewed the work for \"Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions\". Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being \"descriptive rather than discursive\", thereby appealing more to those \"interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice\nthan those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications.\"\n\n"}
