The Abbey of Abingdon was in northern Berkshire. The site is now in Oxfordshire.\n\nHistorian Susan E. Kelly regards the traditional first six abbots as fictional: \"There is good reason to think that in most cases their names were simply plucked from early charters available in the abbey's archive, the majority of which would seem to have had no connection with an early minister at Abingdon; there is no very convincing evidence that the historians had access to independent, reliable sources of information. The 'history' of the pre-Æthelwoldian minister seems to a very large extent to represent a fictional reconstruction\".\n\nProbably fictional abbots:\n\nThe historic abbots, right up to the dissolution of the abbey in 1538, are as follows:\n\n"}

Former Senator Joseph Lieberman described the paper and the Jacobson Foundation as \"independent truth telling advocates for the Jewish people and Israel\". The \"Algemeiner\"s Advisory Board was chaired by the late Nobel laureate, writer and activist Elie Wiesel.\n\nIn 1972, Gershon Jacobson founded the Yiddish-language \"Der Algemeiner Journal\", after consulting with the Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He served as editor and publisher from its inception until his death in 2005.\n\nThe inaugural issue was published by Der Algemeiner Journal Corporation on February 23, 1972. The ten-page paper was priced at 25 cents. Twenty thousand issues were printed. \"Der Algemeiner Journal\" intended to fill the gap after the daily Yiddish paper \"Der Tog Morgen Zhurnal\" closed in 1971. Jacobson had earlier written and served as its city editor. The largest-circulation Yiddish weekly in the United States, \"Der Algemeiner Journal\" emphasized Jewish community news, with a politically independent viewpoint, including reporting on tensions between rival Hasidic sects. Although Jacobson was a Lubavitcher Chasid, according to \"The New York Times\", he \"defied easy categorization.\" \n\nAt its peak , \"Der Algemeiner\"'s circulation had neared 100,000 copies. In 1989, in response to the increasing marginalization of the Yiddish language in the changing Jewish community, \"Der Algemeiner Journal\" began printing a four-page English supplement in the middle of the paper, attracting a wider and more diverse Jewish audience. \n\nIn May 2005, after Gershon Jacobson's passing, his elder son, Simon Jacobson, became the Publisher of \"Der Algemeiner Journal\". He founded the Gershon Jacobson Jewish Continuity Foundation (GJCF), a Jewish media organization with the mission to serve as a voice for Jews and Israel. In 2008, he reconceived \"Der Algemeiner Journal\" as an English-language publication, replacing the Yiddish \"Der\" in its title for \"The\". That year, Dovid Efune became the Editor-In-Chief of what was called \"The Algemeiner\" and Director of the GJCF.\n\nIn 2011, the GJCF launched the website Algemeiner.com. The site has grown rapidly; more than 600 bloggers contribute to it. \n\n\"The Algemeiner\"s print edition is published weekly every Friday, except for the weeks of Passover and Sukkot. The paper's circulation is between 18,000 and 23,000. It is sold at newsstands internationally and is available for subscription. It can also be viewed as an ePaper on Algemeiner.com. The vast majority of \"The Algemeiner\" readership and content is online.\n\nSince 2006, in conjunction with the Gershon Jacobson Foundation, \"The Algemeiner\" hosts an annual lecture series featuring a politician, Jewish leader or scholar. In 2011, Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman spoke on politics and religion.\n\nBeginning in 2010, \"The Algemeiner\" has put out an annual list of non-Jews who have had a positive influence in shaping the Jewish future. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was named first in 2010, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2011, Mitt Romney in 2012, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013.\n\nAs a prelude to the 2012 Republican primaries, \"The Algemeiner\" ranked the party's eight candidates by assessing their positive effect on Israel. Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich were viewed as the three best candidates for Israel, while Ron Paul was viewed as the least beneficial.\n\n\"The Algemeiner\" holds an annual 'Jewish 100' list celebrating the \"top 100 people positively influencing Jewish life\" at its 40th anniversary gala in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The event has featured celebrities and politicians, including Yuli Edelstein, Donald Trump, Elie Wiesel, Harvey Weinstein, Ronald Lauder, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, William Kristol, Alan Dershowitz, Tony Orlando, and others.\n\n"}

It was completed in 2007.\n\nThe Gospel of Luke in Aymara, translated by Vicente Pazos Kanki, a former priest from Alto Perú, in cooperation with the Scottish baptist pastor James Thompson, was published in 1828, which was the first publication of a whole book of the Bible in a Native American language. The first translation of the New Testament appeared in 1954, and the translation of the whole Bible into Aymara was published the first time in 1986, second time in 1997. A modernized edition in the contemporary orthography and with deuterocanonicals appeared in 2003.\n\nAymara Bible editions from both 1997 and 2011 have been accessible on Bible portals since about 2012.\n\nThe Catechism and the \"Doctrina christiana\" were published in 1584, shortly after Spanish conquest, in a version in Quechua and Aymara approved by the Council of Lima (Ciudad de los Reyes) in 1583, but attempts to translate the Bible into these languages were suppressed by the Spanish authorities and the Catholic Church. Only in the 19th century missionaries began to translate the New Testament into Quechua. In 1822 the Scottish baptist pastor James Thompson planned to translate the whole Bible into Quechua and Aymara. During the Peruvian war of independence he was called by José de San Martín to Peru in 1822. From 1822 to 1824 together with a team of four translators he translated the New Testament into Quechua, but due to the war the manuscript was lost in 1825. So the first book of the Bible to be published in Quechua was the Gospel of John in Classical Quechua in 1880. At the beginning of the 20th century, Clorinda Matto (1852–1909), a writer from Cuzco living in Buenos Aires, translated the four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistle to the Romans from Spanish into Cusco Quechua, published between 1901 and 1904. In 1907 and 1915, revised versions followed. Between 1917 and 1929, parts of the Bible in South Bolivian Quechua and Spanish were published: a bilingual Quechua-Spanish edition of the four Gospels in 1917, a bilingual New Testament in 1922 and the Psalms in 1929. A new edition of the New Testament in Bolivian Quechua appeared in 1977.\n\nIn 1923 the first translation of the four Gospels into a Central Quechua dialect appeared in Huallaga Quechua in Peru. In the Ayacucho Region the Presbyterian Quechua pastor and songwriter Florencio Segura, author of an extensive Christian Quechua songbook, which appeared in several editions, translated the Gospel of John, published in 1954 in Ayacucho Quechua. In the same year the Gospel of Luke, translated under the guidance of the Presbyterian pastor Homer Emerson into Ayacucho Quechua, was printed. In Peru, the first Quechua translation of the New Testament was published in 1947 in Cusco Quechua. Translations followed in Ayacucho Quechua in 1958 and 1981, and in Cusco Quechua 1986. The first translation of the New Testament into Quichua of Ecuador was published in 1954.\n\nIt was not until the last quarter of the 20th century that translations of the whole Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Quechua were done, but since then several Quechua Bible translations have been completed. Most work has been done by Protestant groups with international support, but two Catholic translations have also appeared. The first translation of the whole Old and New Testament into Quechua, but without deuterocanonicals, was published in 1986 in Bolivian Quechua. In the Ayacucho Region, the Quechua pastor and translator Rómulo Sauñe Quicaña was the first to give way to a whole Bible translation in Peru, which appeared 1987 in Ayacucho Quechua. For his translation from Hebrew, Sauñe traveled to Israel. In 1992 he was murdered by terrorists of the Shining Path, together with three companions. In 1988 the first translation of the whole Bible into Cusco Quechua, jointly sponsored by the Catholic Church and Protestant groups, was published. In Ecuador, Bible translations into three Kichwa varieties appeared in 1989 (Chimborazo), 1994 (Imbabura), and 2010 (Cañar). In 1996, an interconfessional team published a new edition of the Bolivian Quechua Bible, and in 2004 an extended edition with the deuterocanonicals appeared. In 2010 the first Bible translation into a Central Quechua variety was published, namely Huallaga Quechua, which was realized under the guidance of the Wycliffe Translator and linguist David Weber of SIL International.\n\nWithin the Roman Catholic Church, two translations of the whole Bible including the Deuterocanonicals into Quechua and Kichwa have been done, both published as bilingual Quechua-Spanish editions. In contrast to the other Bible translations into Quechua, no reference to a specific variety (language according to SIL International) has been made. First Catholic translations of the four Gospels were published as bilingual Quechua-Spanish editions in 1972 in Quichua of Ecuador, translated under the guidance of the bishop of Riobamba, Leonidas Proaño, and, including the Acts of the Apostles, in 1974 in Quechua of Southern Peru, translated under the bishops of Abancay and Huancavelica, Enrique Pélach y Feliu and William Dermott Molloy McDermott. In 1973 the Catholic missionary Bernarda Ortiz (“Coronita”), later the Salesian priest Antonio Brescuani and the Jesuits Miguel and Francisco Ramos in cooperation with indigenous Christians speaking several dialects of Kichwa, started in Latacunga to translate the Bible into Kichwa of Ecuador. In 1997 the result of their work was published in Madrid as a bilingual Kichwa-Spanish Bible. In Peru, the Catholic priest Mons. Florencio Coronado in Huancavelica translated the Bible into Quechua, which appeared in 2002 as a bilingual edition, with the support of the bishop of Huancavelica Mons. Dermott Molloy. In contrast to other modern translators, Coronado used the New Vulgate for his translation. Both these Catholic translations are written in a Hispanic orthography. There is also a translation of the four Gospels by the priests of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (province of Peru) Hilario Huanca Mamani und Hermann Wendling into Puno Quechua of 2007.\n\nMost Quechua Bible translations have been accessible on various internet Bible portals since about 2012, e.g. Quechua editions for Bolivia, Ayacucho, Cusco, and Ecuador, but neither the Deuterocanonicals nor the Catholic translations. The Bible in Ayacucho Quechua (1987), in Huallaga Quechua (2011) and several Quechua translations of the New Testament by the Wycliffe Translators are also accessible as PDF (under copyright).\n\nNow there are translations of the complete Bible into six specific Quechuan languages, according to Ethnologue, and two additional translations into Quechua and Kichwa, respectively, without specification. The deuterocanonicals have been included into three of these translations:\nAdditionally, there are translations of the New Testament into at least 17 Quechuan languages.\n\n2002 Old and New Testament\n\n1958 New Testament: \"Señorninchik Jesucristopa, Musuq Testamenton\", Published by Sociedades Bíblicas en América Latina [offices in 14 cities of Latin America].

He is related to the leprechaun and has sometimes been conflated with him as a shoemaker and a guardian of hidden treasure. This has led some folklorists to suppose that the clurichaun is merely a leprechaun on a drinking spree, while others regard them as regional variations of the same being. Like the leprechaun the clurichaun is a solitary fairy, encountered alone rather than in groups, as distinct from the trooping fairies.\n\nIn the folktale \"The Haunted Cellar\", recorded by Thomas Crofton Croker in 1825, a clurichaun named Naggeneen haunts the wine cellar of an Irish lord, drinking everything in sight and playing frightening pranks on the servants. He is described as a little man measuring six inches in height with a face like a withered apple. He has twinkling eyes and a nose that is red and purple from heavy drinking. He wears a red nightcap, a short leather apron, light blue stockings, and shoes with large silver buckles. When he is discovered by the master of the house, Naggeneen talks him out of moving elsewhere by implying that he would simply move with him.\n\nOther descriptions have him wearing red like other solitary fairies.\n\nIn another tale, \"Master and Man\", a young man named Billy Mac Daniel is on his way home one winter night when he is offered a glass of liquor by a clurichaun to warm himself. He takes the drink but when he refuses to pay for it he is compelled by the clurichaun to serve him for seven years and a day. Billy, however, is eventually able to break his servitude by invoking the blessing of God. In this story, the clurichaun is able to pass through keyholes to invade homes and wine cellars and can transform bog rushes into horses to be used as mounts. Clurichauns can also fly through the air on rushes similar to witches and their broomsticks.\n\nThomas Keightley in his \"Fairy Mythology\" (1828) presents the story of a clurichaun named Little Wildbean who was more helpful than others of his kind, but also quick to anger and violence when slighted. He haunted the wine cellar of a Quaker gentleman named Harris, and if one of the servants was negligent enough to leave the beer barrel running then Little Wildbean would wedge himself inside to stop the flow until someone came to turn it off. His dinner was left for him in the cellar, but one night the cook left him nothing but part of a herring and some cold potatoes. At midnight Wildbean dragged the cook out of her bed and all the way down the hard cellar stairs, leaving her battered and bruised so that she was bedridden for three weeks. In a common folktale motif Mr. Harris tried to rid himself of Wildbean by moving elsewhere but decided to turn back when he discovered the clurichaun had moved with him.\n\nThe folklorist Nicholas O'Kearney described the clurichaun in 1855 as follows:\n\nKatharine Briggs stated that he was \"a kind of buttery spirit, feasting himself in the cellars of drunkards or scaring dishonest servants who steal the wine.\"\n\nHe is also described as a trickster and practical joker, and a disturber of order and quietness in a household, making noise day and night. Despite his often troublesome nature, the clurichaun takes special care of the family to whom he has attached himself, endeavoring to protect their property and lives provided he is not interfered with. This dual nature makes him similar to the domestic hobgoblin.\n\nBesides his love of drinking, the clurichaun also enjoys pipe smoking, and the small disposable clay pipes known as \"fairy pipes\" that are often found while digging or plowing are said to belong to him. He also knows the secret of making beer from heather.\n\nAlternate spellings include cluracan, cluracaun, cluricaun, and cluricaune.\n\nThough generally regarded as separate beings, certain characteristics of the leprechaun have sometimes been merged with those of the clurichaun, particularly as a shoemaker and treasure guardian. The clurichaun is sometimes portrayed wearing a leather apron with hammer in hand, whistling as he works on a little shoe. He also carries a magical purse with varying properties. It may contain a shilling (known as the \"lucky shilling\" or \"spre na skillenagh\") that always returns to the purse no matter how often it is spent, or it may always be full of money, and for this reason mortals will often try to capture the clurichaun. Even if he is caught he has the power to vanish if he can make his captor look away even for an instant. He frequently carries two such purses, one containing the magic shilling and the other containing a normal copper coin, and if captured he will present the latter before vanishing. Like the leprechaun he is sometimes said to have knowledge of hidden treasure and can be forced to reveal its location. In such instances one of his tricks is to create the illusion of multiple treasure markers so that the seeker will not know its exact whereabouts.\n\nA clurichaun named Kweequel is a prominent character in the first story of the book \"Four Different Faces\" by C.J. Cala.\n\nThe clurichaun appears as a regular character (under the name Cluracan) in Neil Gaiman's acclaimed comic series \"The Sandman\" and its spin-off series \"The Dreaming\". Cluracan continues the tradition of constant drunkenness but is portrayed as a tall, elegant blond fairy.\n\nThe clurichaun Naggeneen (\"a little drink\") magically associates himself with \"Mary's Place\", the successor to Callahan's Bar in Spider Robinson's stories. The word is spelled 'cluricaune' there. 'Naggeneen' is used in place of his true name which is unwise for magical beings to reveal. Naggeneen saves the bar from bankruptcy through his ability to drink tremendous quantities of alcohol—and to pay for it honestly.\n\n"}

{"id": "562477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562477", "title": "Gathas", "text": "Gathas\n\nThe Gathas () are 17 Avestan hymns believed to have been composed by Zarathusthra (Zoroaster) himself. They form the core of the Zoroastrian liturgy (the Yasna). They are arranged in five different modes or metres.\n\nThe Avestan term \"\" (𐬔𐬁𐬚𐬁 \"hymn\", but also \"mode, metre\") is cognate with Sanskrit \"gāthā́\" (गाथा), both from the Proto-Indo-Iranian word \"*gaHtʰáH\", from the root \"*gaH-\" \"to sing\".\n\nThe Gathas are in verse, metrical in the nature of ancient Iranian religious poetry, that is extremely terse, and in which grammatical constructs are an exception.\n\nThe 17 hymns of the Gathas consist of 238 stanzas, of about 1300 lines or 6000 words in total. They were later incorporated into the 72-chapter \"Yasna\" (chapter: \"ha\" or \"had\", from the Avestan \"ha'iti\", 'cut'), that in turn is the primary liturgical collection of texts within the greater compendium of the Avesta. The 17 hymns are identified by their chapter numbers in the \"Yasna\", and are divided into five major sections:\nWith the exception of \"Ahunavaiti\" Gatha, that is named after the \"Ahuna Vairya\" prayer (\"Yasna\" 27, not in the Gathas), the names of the Gathas reflect the first word(s) of the first hymn within them. The meter of the hymns is historically related to the Vedic \"tristubh-jagati\" family of meters. Hymns of these meters are recited, not sung.\n\nThe sequential order of the Gathas is structurally interrupted by the \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\" (\"seven-chapter \"Yasna\"\", chapters 35–41, linguistically as old as the Gathas but in prose) and by two other minor hymns at \"Yasna\" 42 and 52.\n\nThe language of the Gathas, \"Gathic\" or \"Old\" Avestan, belongs to the old Iranian language group that is a sub-group of Eastern families of the Indo-European languages. The dependency on Vedic Sanskrit is a significant weakness in the interpretation of the Gathas, as the two languages, though from a common origin, had developed independently. Sassanid era translations and commentaries (the \"Zend\") have been used to interpret the Gathas, but by the 3rd century the Avestan language was virtually extinct, and a dependency on the medieval texts is often discouraged as the commentaries are frequently conjectural. While some scholars argue that an interpretation using younger texts is inadvisable (Geldner, Humbach), others argue that such a view is excessively skeptical (Spiegel, Darmesteter). The risks of misinterpretation are real, but lacking alternates, such dependencies are perhaps necessary.\n\n\"The Middle Persian translation seldom offers an appropriate point of departure for a detailed scholarly approach to the Gathas, but an intensive comparison of its single lines and their respective glosses with their Gathic originals usually reveals the train of thought of the translator. This obviously reflects the Gatha interpretation by the priests of the Sasanian period, the general view of which is closer to the original than what is sometimes taught about the Gathas in our time.\"\n\nThere are four monumental English translations of the Gathas worth noting: The earlier James Darmesteter version (\"Le Zend-Avesta\", 1892–1893) that is based on a translation \"from below\", that is, based on the later middle Persian commentaries and translations. The other three are Christian Bartholomae's \"Die Gathas des Awesta\" (1905, Strassburg: Trübner), Helmut Humbach's \"The Gathas of Zarathushtra\" (1959, Heidelberg: Winter), and Stanley Isler's \"The Gathas of Zarathustra\" (1975, Acta Iranica IV, Leiden: Brill). These three texts exploit the \"Vedic\" approach, and Bartholomae's was the first of its kind.\n\nThe problems that face a translator of the Avestan Gathas are significant: \"No one who has ever read a stanza of [the Gathas] in the original will be under any illusions as to the labour that underlies the effort [of translating the hymns]. The most abstract and perplexing thought, veiled further by archaic language, only half understood by later students of the seer's own race and tongue, tends to make the Gathas the hardest problem to be attempted by those who would investigate the literary monuments.\"\n\nSome of the verses of the Gathas are directly addressed to the Omniscient Creator Ahura Mazda. These verses, devotional in character, expound on the divine essences of truth (\"Asha\"), the good-mind (\"Vohu Manah\"), and the spirit of righteousness. Some other verses are addressed to the public that may have come to hear the prophet, and in these he verses, he exhorts his audience to live a life as Ahura Mazda has directed, and pleads to Ahura Mazda to intervene on their behalf.\n\nOther verses, from which some aspects of Zoroaster's life have been inferred, are semi-(auto)biographical, but all revolve around Zarathustra's mission to promote his view of the Truth (again \"Asha\"). For instance, some of the passages describe Zarathustra's first attempts to promote the teachings of Ahura Mazda, and the subsequent rejection by his kinsmen. This and other rejection led him to have doubts about his message, and in the Gathas he asked for assurance from Ahura Mazda, and requests repudiation of his opponents.\n\nAspects of Zoroastrian philosophy are distributed over the entire collection of Gathas. There is no systematic arrangement of doctrine in the texts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect translations available online:\n\nThe PDF version of \"The Divine Songs of Zarathushtra\" by Irach J. S.

{"id": "892577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=892577", "title": "Genuflection", "text": "Genuflection\n\nGenuflection or genuflexion is the act of bending at least one knee to the ground. From early times, it has been a gesture of deep respect for a superior. Today, the gesture is common in the Christian religious practices of the Anglican Church, Lutheran Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Western Rite Orthodox Church. The Latin word \"genuflectio\", from which the English word is derived, originally meant kneeling rather than the rapid dropping to one knee and immediately rising that became customary in Western Europe in the Middle Ages. It is often referred to as \"going down on one knee\" or \"bowing the knee\".\n\nIn 328 BC, Alexander the Great introduced into his court-etiquette some form of genuflection already in use in Persia. In the Byzantine Empire even senators were required to genuflect to the emperor. In medieval Europe, one demonstrated respect for a king or noble by going down on one knee, often remaining there until told to rise. It is traditionally often performed in western cultures by a man making a proposal of marriage.\n\nThe custom of genuflecting, as a sign of respect and even of service, arose out of the honor given to medieval kings. In modern times, when the folded flag of a fallen veteran is offered to the family, the presenting officer will go down on his left knee, if the recipient is seated.\n\nGenuflection, typically on one knee, still plays a part in the Anglican, Lutheran, Roman Catholic and Western Rite Orthodox traditions, among other churches; it is different from kneeling in prayer, which is more widespread.\n\nThose for whom the gesture is difficult, such as the aged or those in poor physical condition, are not expected to perform it. \n\nExcept for those people, genuflection is still today mandatory in some situations, such as (in the Catholic Church) when passing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, or during the Consecration in the Mass.\n\nGenuflection is a sign of reverence to the Blessed Sacrament. Its purpose is to allow the worshipper to engage his whole person in acknowledging the presence of and to honor Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist. It is customary to genuflect whenever one comes into or leaves the presence of the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the Tabernacle. \"This venerable practice of genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, whether enclosed in the tabernacle or publicly exposed, as a sign of adoration, ...requires that it be performed in a recollected way. In order that the heart may bow before God in profound reverence, the genuflection must be neither hurried nor careless.\" A common-sense exception applies to a sacristan or custodian for whom it would be impractical to constantly be genuflecting in the course of their duties.\n\nGenuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, the consecrated Eucharist, especially when arriving or leaving its presence, is a practice in the Anglican Communion, the Latin Rite Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Western Rite Orthodox Church. It is a comparatively modern replacement for the profound bow of head and body that remains the supreme act of liturgical reverence in the East. Since in many Anglican, Roman Catholic and Western Orthodox Churches the Blessed Sacrament is normally present behind the altar, genuflection is usual when arriving or passing in front of the altar at the communion rail. When genuflecting, making the sign of the cross is optional. Also, the Sign of the Cross usually ends with a genuflection in the same direction of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nOnly during the later Middle Ages, centuries after it had become customary to genuflect to persons in authority such as bishops, was genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament introduced. The practice gradually spread and became viewed as obligatory only from the end of the fifteenth century, receiving formal recognition in 1502. The raising of the consecrated Host and Chalice after the Consecration in order to show them to the people was for long unaccompanied by obligatory genuflections.\n\nThe requirement that genuflection take place on both knees before the Blessed Sacrament when it is unveiled as at Expositions (but not when it is lying on the corporal during Mass) was altered in 1973 with introduction of the following rule: \"Genuflection in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, whether reserved in the tabernacle or exposed for public adoration, is on one knee.\" \"Since a genuflection is, per se, an act of adoration, the general liturgical norms no longer make any distinction between the mode of adoring Christ reserved in the tabernacle or exposed upon the altar. The simple single genuflection on one knee may be used in all cases.\" However, in some countries the episcopal conference has chosen to retain the double genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, which is performed by kneeling briefly on both knees and reverently bowing the head with hands joined.\n\nAlthough prayer comes from the heart it is often expressed naturally through the body. Genuflection is an act of personal piety and is not required by the Prayer Book. In some parishes it is a customary gesture of reverence for Christ's real presence in the consecrated eucharistic elements of bread and wine, particularly in parishes with an Anglo-catholic tradition.\nGenerally, if the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the church, it is customary to acknowledge the Lord's presence with a brief act of worship on entering or leaving the building: normally, a genuflection in the direction of the place of reservation.\n\nThe General Instruction of the Roman Missal lays down the following rules for genuflections during Mass:\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, most widely observed in the Orthodox Church, genuflection plays a smaller role and prostration, known as \"proskynesis\", is much more common. During the holy mystery of reconciliation, however, following confession of sins, the penitent is to genuflect with head bowed before the Gospel Book or an icon of Christ as the confessor - either a bishop or a presbyter - formally declares God's forgiveness.\n\nGenuflection or kneeling is prescribed at various points of the Roman Rite liturgy, such as after the mention of Jesus' death on the cross in the readings of the Passion during Holy Week.\n\nA right knee genuflection is made during and after the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday.\n\nA genuflection is made at the mention of the Incarnation in the words \"et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est\" (\"and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man\") in the Creed on the solemnities of Christmas and the Annunciation.\n\nIn the Tridentine Mass this genuflection is made on any day on which the Creed is recited at Mass, as well as at several other points:\n\nIn the Maronite Catholic Church, there is an evocative ceremony of genuflection on the feast of Pentecost. The congregation genuflects first on the left knee to God the Father, then on the right knee to God the Son, and finally on both knees to God the Holy Spirit.\n\nFrom the custom of genuflecting to kings and other nobles arose the custom by which lay people or clergy of lesser rank genuflect to a prelate and kiss his episcopal ring, as a sign of acceptance of the bishop's apostolic authority as representing Christ in the local church, and originally their social position as lords. Abbots and other senior monastics often received genuflection from their monks and often others. \n\nGenuflecting before \"greater prelates\" (i.e. Bishops in their own dioceses, Metropolitans in their province, Papal Legates in the territory assigned to them, and Cardinals either outside of Rome or in the church assigned to them in Rome) is treated as obligatory in editions of the \"Caeremoniale Episcoporum\" earlier than that of 1985; during liturgical functions according to these prescriptions, clergy genuflect when passing before such prelates, but an officiating priest and any more junior prelates, canons, etc. substitute a bow of the head and shoulders for the genuflection.\n\nThe present Catholic liturgical books exclude genuflecting to a bishop during the liturgy: \"A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the ground, signifies adoration, and therefore it is reserved for the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration during the liturgical celebration on Good Friday until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.\" But outside of the liturgy some continue to genuflect or kneel to kiss a bishop's ring.\n\nThough it is frequently asserted that genuflections are to be made on the left knee when made to merely human authorities, there is no such prescription in any liturgical book.\n"}

After schooling and further education in Warsaw Him studied Roman Law in Moscow but left in 1917 when the Russian Revolution forced the closure of the university he was attending. He moved to Bonn and by 1924 had completed a PhD at the University of Bonn on the comparative history of religions before deciding to study graphic art in Leipzig. Him studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Art but even before he graduated in 1928 was already undertaking commercial commissions. Him returned to Poland where, in 1933, he changed his name and also established a design partnership with Jan Le Witt. Working as Lewitt-Him, the two established a distinctive design style which combined cubist and surrealist elements, often in a humorous context. Their most notable work in Poland were illustrations for an experimental poetry group known as \"Skamander\".\nHim and Le Witt worked together in Poland for several years before, in 1937, they relocated the Lewitt-Him design business to London, following an exhibition of their work there by the publishers Lund Humphries. The pair quickly gained commercial contracts with London Transport and Imperial Airways as well as illustrating children's books, such as \"The Little Red Engine Gets a Name\" (1942) by Diana Ross. In London during World War II the partnership received notable commissions for information and public safety posters from, among others, the General Post Office, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the Ministry of Information.\n\nHim was naturalized as a British citizen in 1948 and the Lewitt-Him partnership enjoyed great success. Notable commissions included designing the giant umbrella tree for the Wet Weather section of the 1946 \"Britain Can Make It\" exhibition, the Guinness clock tower for Battersea Park Pleasure Gardens and murals for the Education Pavilion of the 1951 Festival of Britain. The Lewitt-Him partnership was dissolved in 1954, when Le Witt decided to focus on developing his abstract paintings and artworks. Him continued to work as a commercial designer. Among the advertising campaigns he illustrated was the 1950s \"Schweppeshire\" campaign for the Schweppes drinks company. Him's other clients numbered several airlines, including Pan-American Airways, El Al and American Overseas Airlines plus the publishers of \"Punch\" and Penguin Books. He continued to illustrate books but also designed exhibition stands, such as the Australia stand at the 1960 Ideal Home Exhibition and large window displays, notably for the De Bijenkorf store in Rotterdam and the 1961 Christmas windows for the Design Centre in London.\n\nFrom 1969 until 1977, Him taught graphic design at Leicester Polytechnic. Him was an active artist up until the very end of his life. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held, one in 1976 at the London College of Printing and another in 1978 at the Ben Uri Gallery in London. In 1977 Him was awarded the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award and in 1978 became a Royal Designer for Industry.\n\n"}

At least two of the ships he built were lost. The occupants of one ship were presumed drowned. Hagoth and his shipbuilding accomplishments are briefly described in the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon:\n\n 5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.\n\nNon-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Some leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and scholars have stated that the peoples of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Polynesia, and New Zealand, are descendants of the Nephite Hagoth and his supposed followers. According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were descendants of Israel. Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor. Non-Mormon scholars largely dismiss this hypothesis, citing genetic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence which indicates that Polynesian peoples come from Maritime Southeast Asia. \n\nDespite general agreement among scholars that the principal ancestors of Polynesian peoples migrated from Southeast Asia, there are a few evidences of the possibility of contact with peoples in the Western Hemisphere. Sweet potatoes, which are native to South America, are a common traditional staple throughout Polynesia. The Quechua word for sweet potato is \"kumar\", very similar to the Polynesian word \"kumara\" for the same plant\".\" There is also DNA evidence of contact between Polynesian and South American peoples prior to European contact.\n\nDifferentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one LDS writer makes the following observations:\n\nOne problem with considering Polynesia to be at least partly peopled by \"Nephite\" descendants is that the Book of Mormon itself does not insist upon the point, and there is likewise no official doctrine in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints covering it.\n\n"}

Guyana has the highest percentage of Hindus in the Western Hemisphere.\nAfter the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act in the British Empire, the need for labor led to the recruitment of Indians in Guyana and other British West Indian territories. Upon arrival, the new workers had to adapt to the extreme tropical conditions, along with their new contracts and working conditions. Between 1835 and 1918, 341,600 indentured laborers were imported into British Guyana from India.\n\nFrom 1852, Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the indenture period, but this met with little success. When Christian missionaries started proselytizing, Brahmins started administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste. This led to the breakdown of the caste system there.\n\nIn the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. In 1910, Arya Samaj arrived in Guyana. Samaj's doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and discrimination against Hindus diminished. \n\nArya Samaj followers often did not get along with Sanātanīs (orthodox Hindus). The salience of these differences ebbed.\n\nHinduism has been decreasing for many decades. In 1991, 35.0% of the Guyanese population adhered to Hinduism, decreasing to 28.4% in 2002 and to 24.8% in 2012.\nPopulation of Hindus by region (2002 census):\nTamil (Madrasi) Hindus forms the majority in East Berbice-Corentyne region.\n\nAlthough 39.8% of the Guyana's population is East Indian, only 24.8% are Hindus.\n\nHoli-Phagwah and Diwali are National Holidays in Guyana.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838014", "title": "Hinduism in Malaysia", "text": "Hinduism in Malaysia\n\nHinduism is the fourth largest religion in Malaysia. About 1.78 million Malaysian residents (6.3% of the total population) are Hindus, according to 2010 Census of Malaysia. This is up from 1,380,400 (6.2% of the total population) in 2000.\n\nMost Malaysian Hindus are settled in western parts of Peninsular Malaysia. The Malaysian state with highest percentage of state's population as Hindus, according to 2010 Census, is Negeri Sembilan (13.4%), followed by Selangor (11.6%), Perak (10.9%) and Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (8.5%). The state with least percentage of Hindu population is Sabah (0.1%).\n\nIndians, along with other ethnic groups such as Chinese, began arriving in Malaysia in ancient and medieval era. In 2010, Malaysian Census reported there were 1.91 million citizens of Indian ethnic origin. About 1.64 million of Indian ethnic group Malaysians (86%) are Hindus. About 0.14 million non-Indian ethnic group Malaysian people also profess being Hindus.\n\nMalaysia gained its independence from British colonial empire in 1957, thereafter declared its official state religion as Islam, and adopted a constitution that is mixed. On one hand, it protects freedom of religion (such as practice of Hinduism), but on the other hand Malaysian constitution also restricts religious freedom. In recent decades, there have been increasing reports of religious persecution of Hindus, along with other minority religions, by various state governments of Malaysia and its Sharia courts. Hindu temples built on private property, and built long before Malaysian independence, have been demolished by Malaysian government officials in recent years.\n\nSimilar to the Indonesian Archipelago, the native Malays practised an indigenous animism and dynamism beliefs before the arrival of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.\n\nIt is unclear when the first Indian voyages across the Bay of Bengal occurred. Conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals to Malay shores at least 1,700 years ago. The growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of the Malay world into contact with Hinduism. Thus, Hinduism, Indian cultural traditions and the Sanskrit language began to spread across the land. Temples were built in the Indian style and local kings began referring to themselves as \"Raja\" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.\n\nSubsequently, small Hindu Malay states started to appear in the coastal areas of Malay peninsular notably the Gangga Negara (2nd century), Langkasuka (2nd century), and Kedah (4th century). Between 7th and 13th centuries many of these small, often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states came under the loose control of Srivijaya empire, a great Hindu Malay kingdom centred in Palembang, Sumatra.\n\nMany Indian settlers came to Malaya from South India during the British colonial rule from early 19th through mid 20th century. Many came to escape poverty and famines in British India, and work as indentured labourers in initially tin mining operations and coffee, sugar plantations, and later rubber plantations; they worked with immigrant Chinese laborers on these sites. Some English-educated Indians were appointed to more professional positions. Most were hired through British colonial labor offices in Nagapattinam or Madras (now Chennai).\n\nIn early years, the retention rates of Hindus in Malaysia were low and with time, fewer Hindus volunteered to live in Malaysia. The colonial rule adopted a \"Kangani\" system of recruitment, where the trusted Hindu worker was encouraged and rewarded for recruiting friends and family from India to work in British operations in Malaysia. The family and friends peer pressure reduced labor turnover and increased permanent migration into Malaysia. The \"kangani\" system led to vast majority of Hindus coming from certain parts of South Indian Hindu community. So concentrated was the immigration from South India, that the British colonial Malayan Administration named laws to highlight the focussed group, and enacted the \"Tamil\" Immigration Fund Ordinance in 1907. A minority of Indian immigrants to Malaysia during this period came from Northern India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Malaysian Hindu workers during the British era were among the most marginalised. They were forced to live in closed plantation societies in frontier zones and the plantation symbolised the boundary of their existence. Racial segregation was enforced, and British anti-vagrancy laws made it illegal for Indian Hindus (and Chinese Buddhists) to enter the more developed European zoned regions. The Hindus spoke neither English nor Malay languages, and remained confined to interacting within their own community.\n\nAfter Malaysia gained independence in 1957, local governments favored autochthonous \"Bumiputera\" and refused automatic citizenship to Indians and Chinese ethnic groups who had been living in Malaysia for decades during British colonial era. They were declared illegal aliens and they could not apply for government jobs or own land. Sectarian riots followed, targeting Indians and Chinese, such as the 1957 Chingay riot in Penang, 1964 Malaysian racial riots, the 1967 Hartal riots, and 13 May 1969 riots. Singapore, which in the early 1960s was part of Malaysia, seceded from the union and became an independent city state. The Malaysian government passed a 1970 constitutional amendment and then the 1971 Sedition law that made it illegal to publicly discuss Malaysian citizenship methodology, national language policy, the definition of ethnic Malays as automatically Muslims, and the legitimacy of Sultans in each Malaysian state. \n\nTo safeguard the interest of the Hindu organisations and Hindu temples, the Malaysia Hindu Sangam (MHS) was formed on 23 January 1965. The formation of MHS was greatly due to the ingenuity of the late Shri K. Paramalingam KMN., a barrister at law and was then the Director General of Public Trustee Department, assisted by the late Shri K. Ramanathan, Shri. G. V. Thevar, Shri Hari Chand Saradha, Shri. S. Palanivel Pillai, and Shri S. Dhuraiappah. Shri K. Ramanathan also was the president of Malaysian Indian Congress from 1950 - 1951 and the founder of Malaysian Arulneri Thirukkuttam.\n\nMalaysia Hindu Sangam is the only Hindu organization that the government of Malaysia consults on matters affecting the Hindu community in Malaysia. It is also a member of the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST) since 1984. MCCBCHST is composed primarily of officials from the main non-Muslim communities in Malaysia and acts as a consultative and liaison body towards more open dialogue and co-operation.\nMalaysia Hindu Sangam has organised many national Hindu conferences, seminars, Antharyogams and religious discussions and created a strong religious awareness among the Malaysian Hindus. Among the great contribution of MHS towards the upliftment of Hindus in Malaysia was the Gurukal training programme in the 1980s to train local young men as temple priests.\n\nSiddhas have traveled to then Malaya and performed austerities and eventually went into Jeeva Samadhi. Jeganatha Swamigal, a disciple of Ramalinga Adigal, is foremost among a handful of saints who ventured to the then Malaya. Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi is located at Tapah, Perak. Presently, the Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi and the land adjacent to its temple is owned by Malaysia Hindu Sangam. Other popular Samadhi is of Sannasi Andavar in Cheng, Malacca and Mauna Swamigal in the vicinity of Lord Saturn's temple at Batu Caves.\n\nMalaysian Hinduism is diverse, with large urban temples dedicated to specific deities, and smaller temples located on estates. The estate temples generally follow the tradition of the Indian region from which the temples' worshippers originate. Many people follow the Shaivite, or Saivite, tradition (worship of Shiva), of Southern India. However, there are also some Vaishnava Hindus in Malaysia as well, many of them of North Indian extraction, and these Hindus worship in temples such as the Geeta Ashram in Seksyen 52, Petaling Jaya, or the Lakshmi-Narayana Temple in Kampung Kasipillay, Kuala Lumpur. Services in these temples are usually conducted in Hindi and English.\n\nFolk Hinduism is the most prevalent variety, including spiritualism and worship of village deities. \n\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness also has a number of followers in Malaysia, and maintains temples in Kuala Lumpur and also all over Malaysia. The Ratha-Yatra festival is held once a year in every temple throughout Malaysia approximately 10 to 12 Ratha Yatra which will be held usually end of the Year, when the Deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva and Subhadra are placed on a chariot which is pulled through the streets by devotees, accompanied by a party chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. There also another group of Hare Krishna such as (The follower of Ritvik, follower of Hansa Duta). There is also Gaudiya math and Saraswath Math.\n\nThere are also few devotees of Sri Vaishnavism of Ramanujacharya and the Madhvacharya Sampradaya.\n\nMalaysia also has large followers of several Vedantic traditions and groups such as Ramakrishna Mission. Ramakrishna Mission in Petaling Jaya has been in existence since the 1940s and was officially affiliated to the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, India in 2001. In 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi visited the Ramakrishna Mission and unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda. Another important centre, closely connected with the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement is the Ramakrishna Ashramam, Penang which came into existence in 1938. The Vivekananda Ashrama, Kuala Lumpur is an institution started by the Jaffna (Sri Lankan) Tamil immigrants in 1904 in honour of Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902). The building, constructed in 1908, is dedicated to his work in providing education and spiritual development for the youth and community. The Vivekananda Ashram with a bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda has been declared as a heritage site in 2016.\n\nOther popular Vedanta-based organisations in Malaysia are Divine Life Society (also called Shivananda Ashram) with its headquarters at Batu Caves and Arsha Vijnana Gurukulam.\n\nSince the Second World War a revival of Hinduism has occurred among Indian Malaysians, with the foundation of organisations and councils to bring unity or to promote reform.\n\nSome of the major Hindu festivals celebrated every year include Deepavali (festival of lights), Thaipusam (Lord Murugan festival), Pongal (harvest festival) and Navaratri (Durga festival).\n\nDeepavali is the primary Hindu festival in Malaysia. The Malaysian Hindus traditionally hold open houses over Deepavali, where people of different ethnic groups and religions are welcomed in Hindu homes to share the festival of light as well as taste Indian food and sweets.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 1,777,694 people self-identifying as Hindus (6.27% of the population). Of the Hindus, 1,644,072 were Indian, 111,329 were non-citizens, 14,878 were Chinese, 4,474 Others, and 2,941 Tribals (Including 554 Iban in Sarawak). 86.18% of all the Indian Malaysians were Hindu. Information collected in the census based on respondent's answer and did not refer to any official document.\n\nThere are 5900 Balinese people in Malaysia, 90% of whom are Hindus. The 'Other Hindus' in the above Table might be representing them.\n\nIslam is the official religion of Malaysia. The constitution of Malaysia declares that Islam is the only religion of true Malay people and that natives are required to be Muslims. Conversion from Islam to Hinduism (or another religion) is against the law, but the conversion of Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians to Islam is welcomed. The government actively promotes the spread of Islam in the country. The law requires that any Hindu (or Buddhist or Christian) who marries a Muslim must first convert to Islam, otherwise the marriage is illegal and void. If one of the Hindu parents adopts Islam, the children automatically become Muslim without the consent of the second parent.\n\nThere are numerous cases in Malaysian courts relating to official persecution of Hindus. For example, in August 2010, a Malaysian woman named Siti Hasnah Banggarma was denied the right to convert to Hinduism by a Malaysian court. Banggarma, who was born a Hindu, but was forcibly converted to Islam at age 7, desired to reconvert back to Hinduism and appealed to the courts to recognise her reconversion. The appeal was denied.In 2016, an association of eight Hindu NGOs found that about 7,000 Hindus in Malaysia wrongly documented as Muslims.This problem was widespread throughout Peninsular Malaysia and involved mostly practising Hindus from the lower income group who are documented as Muslims.\n\nAfter a violent conflict in Penang between Hindus and Muslims in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate.\n\nBetween April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus. On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers. The authorities' excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land.\n\nThe president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.\n\nOn 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from Kuala Lumpur forcefully demolished part of a 90-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 3,000 Hindus. The \"Hindu Rights Action Force\", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister.\n\nHINDRAF chairman, Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy, said:\nMany Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built \"illegally\". However, several of the temples are centuries old.\n\nAccording to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a Hindu temple is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.\n\nIn 2007, Malaysian Hindu organisations protested the destruction of Hindu temples by the Malaysian regime. On 30 October 2007 the 100-year-old Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa was demolished by Malaysian authorities. Following that demolition, Works Minister and head of the Malaysian Indian Congress Samy Vellu, who is of Indian origin, said that Hindu temples built on government land were still being demolished despite his appeals to the various state chief ministers.\n\nSuch temple destructions in Malaysia have been reported by the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nHAF notes that the Government of Malaysia Restricts Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association contrary to Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and Article 10 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution, and that the application filed by Malaysian Hindus to hold gatherings have been arbitrarily denied by the police. The Government has also tried to suppress a campaign launched by an NGO, the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF) to obtain 100,000 signatures in support of a civil suit against the Government of United Kingdom. HINDRAF has accused the Malaysian government of intimidating and instilling fear in the Indian community.\n\nThe Hindraf rally prompted the Malaysian government to open dialogue with various Indian and Hindu organizations like the Malaysia Hindu Council, Malaysia Hindudharma Mamandram, and Malaysian Indian Youth Council (MIYC) to address the misgivings of the Indian community. HINDRAF itself has been excluded from these talks and no significant changes have resulted from the discussions.\n\nThe Cow head protests was a protest that was held in front of the Selangor state government headquarters at the Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Building, Shah Alam, Malaysia on 28 August 2009. The protest was called so because the act of a few participants who brought along a cow head, which they later \"stomped on the head and spat on it before leaving the site\". The cow is considered a sacred animal to Hindus.\n\nThe protest was held due to Selangor state government's intention to relocate a Hindu temple from Section 19 residential area of Shah Alam to Section 23. The protesters were mainly Muslim extremists who opposed the relocation due to the fact that Section 23 was a Muslim majority area.\n\nThe protest leaders were also recorded saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in Shah Alam. The protest was caught on video by the popular Malaysian online news portal \"Malaysiakini\".\n\nRevathi Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name, but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith.Revathi Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter.But her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because a Hindu man can't marry a Muslim girl as per the Sharia law.She was seized by the Islamic authorities when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim.She was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion ,where she was forced to eat beef (which is forbidden to Hindus),forced to make her pray as a Muslim and to wear a headscarf.However, she is adamant that she will remain a Hindu.Islamic officials took the couple's 18-month-old daughter away from Suresh (her Hindu father) and gave her to Revathi's mother (her Muslim grandmother). Officials have ordered Revathi to live with her mother and continue with her Islamic 'counseling'.\nIn 2017, a teaching module published by a leading Malaysian university (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) ) depicted Hindus in India as unclean and dirty in a slide. Another slide aimed at teaching the origins of Sikhism claimed that founder Guru Nanak had a poor understanding of Islam and had combined it with his surrounding Hindu lifestyle in forming the early foundation of the Sikh faith. A police report was lodged by the chairman of the Hindu Dharma Association of Malaysia in Sungai Petani district against UTM. Malaysia's Minister of Health, Deputy Minister of Education and others had condemned this incident. Due to these condemnations, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) was forced to apologize.\n\nIn 2008 , The National Fatwa Council of Malaysia issued fatwa against Yoga .Abdul Shukor Husim, the council's chairman, said: \"We are of the view that yoga, which originates in Hinduism, combines a physical exercise, religious elements, chanting and worshipping for the purpose of achieving inner peace and ultimately to be at one with god. For us, yoga destroys a Muslim's faith\". The fatwa says Muslims to avoid yoga because it uses Hindu prayers that could erode Muslims’ faith.Following this Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi moved to contain the damage, telling that Muslims could carry on doing yoga but avoiding the chanting.However, the fatwas by National Fatwa Council are not legally binding on the country's Muslims, unless they also become enshrined in national or sharia laws. But many Muslims abide by the edicts out of deference.But there are many muslims too who go to yoga classes .\nIn 2009 ,Indira gandhi's husband Pathmanathan converted to Islam and took up the name Muhammad Riduan Abdullah.Then he unilaterally converted his three children (one of whom was 11 months old) to Islam without the consent of his wife.The Sharia Court also granted custody of children to Riduan.This sparked a court battle for nine long years, as Indira, a Hindu, fought to gain custody of her three children — Prasana; Karan Dinish, 19; and Tevi Darsiny, 20 — and to quash their conversions.\n\nAtlast ,the Federal Court nullified their conversions and ruled that consent of both parents was needed to convert a minor.The Federal Court on 2016 had ordered the Inspector-General of Police to execute a warrant of arrest for Riduan. Karan and Tevi have declared themselves Hindus.However , Riduan escaped taking Prasana along with him,both of them are still not found.\n\n\n\n"}

A London Jew named Abraham was described in 1277 as being from \"La Gelnseye\" (Guernsey). A converted Portuguese Jew, Edward Brampton, was appointed Governor of Guernsey in 1482.\n\nGuernsey's Jewish population has historically been much smaller than that of neighboring Jersey, and there has never been a synagogue on the island.\n\nEnemy aliens, people born in a country with which Britain was at war, were restricted from entering Britain without a permit. Accordingly, a few Jews became trapped in Guernsey when the islands were occupied. In addition, a few locals decided to remain in Guernsey rather than evacuate in June 1940.\n\nDuring the occupation of the Channel Islands by Nazi Germany during World War II, laws were imposed on the authorities that required registration. All non Guernsey and British foreigners (aliens) had already been required to register with the police, but the records did not mention their faith. An advertisement appeared in the newspaper in October 1941 calling on all Jews to identify themselves. The Germans issued identity cards to everyone, which listed their nationality and faith.\n\nJews identified in Guernsey and Sark \n\nMarianne Grunfeld, born in Poland in 1912, had studied horticulture at the University of Reading before going to work on a farm in Guernsey. She was identified in April 1942 as Jewish. \n\nTheresia Steiner, an Austrian, non-practising Jew, who had come to the Islands from England and become trapped in the Islands by the invasion as she had been detained as an alien, amongst 30 enemy aliens who were arrested and detained in June 1940. She didn't have a UK visa to go to the UK as required for immigrants from Germany and Austria (from 1938). A qualified dental nurse, she was then employed as a nurse by the States of Guernsey, working at the Castel Hospital, She went, after 18 months to the German authorities to ask to contact her parents. The First Order Against The Jews was 23 October 1940 and this was the beginning of the adoption of the Nuremberg Race Laws in to the Channel Islands’ legal systems. The Islands' bailiffs collaborated with the Germans. Only Sir Abraham Lainé protested against the anti-Jewish laws. The deportation of the Jews from the Channel Islands was with the full connivance of the bailiffs and the government authorities. According to the grandson of Bailiff Carey of Guernsey, Winston Churchill did not know whether to hang William G. Carey or knight him. To hush up the level of collaboration, he was knighted and the history of Guernsey's delivery of the Jews to the Nazis was concealed for decades.\n\nThe first group of three Jews were ordered to leave the Island in April 1942. The three, Marianne Grunfeld, Auguste Spitz, and Therese Steiner, were first sent to Saint-Malo, where they took up local employment, Marianne Grunfeld was reported to be living in Laval, France, until three months later when they were rounded up in a mass deportation of French Jews. They were sent directly to Auschwitz, where they all died.\n\nThe second group of three, Elda Brouard, Elisabet Duquemin, and Janet Duquemin (18 months old), were sent with Henry Duquemin (husband of Elisabet) in February 1943. Henry was sent to Oflag VII-C in Laufen, Germany, and the two women and baby went first to a prison in Compiègne and then after 6 months to Ilag V-B in Biberach an der Riss. Both of the camps in Laufen and Biberach were civilian camps containing many Channel Island civilians.\n\nAnnie Wranowsky lived on Sark throughout the war working as a German language teacher.\n\nMiriam Jay lived in Guernsey throughout the war without being identified.\n\nSir Geoffrey Rowland, the Bailiff of Guernsey from 2005 to 2012, has stated that the government of Guernsey was powerless to stop the deportations due to the large number of German soldiers on the island.\n\nThere are still some Jews living in Guernsey today, some of whom attend the congregation in Jersey.\n\n"}

{"id": "1184490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1184490", "title": "Islam in Russia", "text": "Islam in Russia\n\nIslam in Russia is the nation's second most widely professed religion. According to a nationwide survey conducted in 2012, Muslims in Russia numbered 9,400,000 or 6.5% of the total population. However, the populations of two federal subjects with Islamic majorities were not surveyed due to social unrest, which together had a population of nearly 2 million, namely Chechnya and Ingushetia, thus the total number of Muslims may be larger. Among these Muslims, 6,700,000 or 4.6% of the total population of Russia were not affiliated with any Islamic schools and branches. Recognized under the law and by Russian political leaders as one of Russia's traditional religions, Islam is a part of Russian historical heritage, and is subsidized by the Russian government. The position of Islam as a major Russian religion, alongside Orthodox Christianity, dates from the time of Catherine the Great, who sponsored Islamic clerics and scholarship through the Orenburg Assembly. \n\nThe history of Islam and Russia encompasses periods of conflict between Muslims and the Orthodox majority, as well as periods of collaboration and mutual support. Robert Crews's study of Muslims living under the Tsar indicates that \"the mass of Muslims\" was loyal to that regime after Catherine, and sided with it over its Ottoman rival. After the Tsarist regime fell, the Soviet Union introduced a policy of state atheism, which impeded the practice of Islam and led to the execution and suppression of various Muslim leaders. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Islam regained a prestigious, legally recognized space in Russian politics. More recently, President Putin consolidated this trend, subsidizing the creation of mosques and Islamic education, which he called an \"integral part of Russia's cultural code\", encouraging immigration from Muslim-majority former Soviet bloc states, and condemning what the Russian state considers to be criminal anti-Muslim hate speech, such as caricatures of the Muhammad.\n\nMuslims form a majority of the population of the republics of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan in the Volga Federal District, and predominate among the nationalities in the North Caucasian Federal District located between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea: the Circassians, Balkars, Chechens, Ingush, Kabardin, Karachay, and numerous Dagestani peoples. Also, in the middle of the Volga Region reside populations of Tatars and Bashkirs, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. Other areas with notable Muslim minorities include Moscow, Saint Petersburg, the republics of Adygea, North Ossetia-Alania and Astrakhan, Moscow, Orenburg and Ulyanovsk oblasts. There are over 5,000 registered religious Muslim organizations, equivalent to over one sixth of the number of registered Russian Orthodox religious organizations of about 29,268 as of December 2006.\n\nIn the mid 7th century AD, as part of the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region, parts of which were later permanently incorporated by Russia. The first people to become Muslims within current Russian territory, the Dagestani people (region of Derbent), converted after the Arab conquest of the region in the 8th century. The first Muslim state in the future Russia lands was Volga Bulgaria\n(922). The Tatars of the Khanate of Kazan inherited the population of believers from that state. Later most of the European and Caucasian Turkic peoples also became followers of Islam.\n\nThe Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, the last remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia and burnt down parts of Moscow in 1571. Until the late 18th century, Crimean Tatars maintained a massive slave-trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Ukraine over the period 1500–1700.\n\nFrom the early 16th-century up to including the course of the 19th century, all of Transcaucasia and southern Dagestan was ruled by various successive Iranian empires (the Safavids, Afsharids, and the Qajars), and their geo-political and ideological neighbouring arch-rivals on the other hand, the Ottoman Turks. In the respective areas they ruled, in both the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, Shia Islam and Sunni Islam spread, resulting in a fast and steady conversion of many more ethnic Caucasian peoples in adjacent territories.\n\nThe period from the Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552 by Ivan the Terrible to the ascension of Catherine the Great in 1762 featured systematic Russian repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination - as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by the elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as mosques. The Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the various regions to preach to the Muslims, particularly the Kazakhs, whom the Russians viewed with contempt. However, Russian policy shifted toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness. Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly élite Russian military institutions. In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing pan-Turkism, though many were persecuted as a result. The government of Russia paid Islamic scholars from the Ural-Volga area working among the Kazakhs\n\nIslamic slavery did not have racial restrictions. Russian girls were legally allowed to be sold in Russian controlled Novgorod to Tatars from Kazan in the 1600s by Russian law. Germans, Poles, and Lithuanians were allowed to be sold to Crimean Tatars in Moscow. In 1665 Tatars were allowed to buy from the Russians, Polish and Lithuanian slaves. Before 1649 Russians could be sold to Muslims under Russian law in Moscow. This contrasted with other places in Europe outside Russia where Muslims were not allowed to own Christians.\n\nThe Cossack institution recruited and incorporated Muslim Mishar Tatars. Cossack rank was awarded to Bashkirs. Muslim Turkics and Buddhist Kalmyks served as Cossacks. The Cossack Ural, Terek, Astrakhan, and Don Cossack hosts had Kalmyks in their ranks. Mishar Muslims, Teptiar Muslims, service Tatar Muslims, and Bashkir Muslims joined the Orenburg Cossack Host. Cossack non Muslims shared the same status with Cossack Siberian Muslims. Muslim Cossacks in Siberia requested an Imam. Cossacks in Siberia included Tatar Muslims like in Bashkiria.\n\nBashkirs and Kalmyks in the Russian military fought against Napoleon's forces. They were judged suitable for inundating opponents but not intense fighting. They were in a non standard capacity in the military. Arrows, bows, and melee combat weapons were wielded by the Muslim Bashkirs. Bashkir women fought among the regiments. Denis Davidov mentioned the arrows and bows wielded by the Bashkirs. Napoleon's forces faced off against Kalmyks on horseback. Napoleon faced light mounted Bashkir forces. Mounted Kalmyks and Bashkirs numbering 100 were available to Russian commandants during the war against Napoleon. Kalmyks and Bashkirs served in the Russian army in France. A nachalnik was present in every one of the 11 cantons of the Bashkir host which was created by Russia after the Pugachev Rebellion. Bashkirs had the military statute of 1874 applied to them.\n\nWhile total expulsion (as practised in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal and Sicily) was not feasible to achieve a homogeneous Russian-Orthodox population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims, making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region and encouraging emigration to other parts such as the Ottoman Turkey and neighboring Persia, and almost annihilating the Circassians, Crimean Tatars, and various Muslims of the Caucasus. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighboring Ottoman Empire. The explicit Russian goal involved expelling the groups in question from their lands. They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire, in Persia, or in Russia far from their old lands. The Russo-Caucasian War ended with the signing of loyalty oaths by Circassian leaders on 2 June [O.S. 21 May] 1864. Afterwards, the Ottoman Empire offered to harbour the Circassians who did not wish to accept the rule of a Christian monarch, and many emigrated to Anatolia (the heart of the Ottoman Empire) and ended up in modern Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq and Kosovo. Many other Caucasian Muslims ended up in neighboring Iran - sizeable numbers of Shia Lezgins, Azerbaijanis, Muslim Georgians, Kabardins, and Laks.\nVarious Russian, Caucasus, and Western historians agree on the figure of 500,000 inhabitants of the highland Caucasus being deported by Russia in the 1860s. A large proportion of them died in transit from disease. Those that remained loyal to Russia were settled into the lowlands, on the left-bank of the Kuban' River. The trend of Russification has continued at different paces in the rest of Tsarist and Soviet periods, so that more Tatars lived outside the Republic of Tatarstan than inside it.\n\nA policy of deliberately enforcing anti-modern, traditional, ancient conservative Islamic education in schools and Islamic ideology was enforced by the Russians in order to deliberately hamper and destroy opposition to their rule by keeping them in a state of torpor to and prevent foreign ideologies from penetrating in.\n\nCommunist rule oppressed and suppressed Islam, like other religions in the Soviet Union. Many mosques (for some estimates, more than 83% in Tatarstan) were closed. For example, the Märcani Mosque was the only acting mosque in Kazan at that time.\n\nThere was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s. The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to Mecca increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1991. In 1995 the newly established Union of Muslims of Russia, led by Imam Khatyb Mukaddas of Tatarstan, began organizing a movement aimed at improving inter-ethnic understanding and ending Russians' lingering misconception of Islam. The Union of Muslims of Russia is the direct successor to the pre-World War I Union of Muslims, which had its own faction in the Russian Duma. The post-Communist union formed a political party, the Nur All-Russia Muslim Public Movement, which acts in close coordination with Muslim imams to defend the political, economic, and cultural rights of Muslims. The Islamic Cultural Center of Russia, which includes a madrassa (religious school), opened in Moscow in 1991. In the 1990s, the number of Islamic publications has increased. Among them are few magazines in Russian, namely: \"Ислам\" (transliteration: \"Islam\"), \"Эхо Кавказа\" (\"Ekho Kavkaza\") and \"Исламский вестник\" (\"Islamsky Vestnik\"), and the Russian-language newspaper \"Ассалам\" (\"Assalam\"), and \"Нуруль Ислам\" (\"Nurul Islam\"), which are published in Makhachkala, Dagestan.\nKazan has a large Muslim population (probably the second after Moscow urban group of the Muslims and the biggest indigenous group in Russia) and is home to the Russian Islamic University in Kazan, Tatarstan. Education is in Russian and Tatar.\nIn Dagestan there are number of Islamic Universities and madrassas, notable among them are: Dagestan Islamic University, Institute of Theology and International Relations, whose rector Maksud Sadikov was assassinated on 8 June 2011.\n\nTalgat Tadzhuddin was the Chief Mufti of Russia. Since Soviet times, the Russian government has divided Russia into a number of Muslim Spiritual Directorates. In 1980 Talgat Tazhuddin was made Mufti of the European USSR and Siberia Division. Since 1992 he has headed the central or combined Muslim Spiritual Directorate of all of Russia.\n\nPutin has said that \"Orthodox Christianity is much closer to Islam than Catholicism is\".\n\nThere was large anger from mostly Muslims from the Caucasus against the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in France. Putin is believed to have backed protests by Muslims in Russia against Charlie Hebdo cartoons and the West.\n\nPutin has allowed the de facto implementation of Sharia law in Chechnya by Ramzan Kadyrov, including polygamy and enforced veiling.\nA chain e-mail spread a hoax speech attributed to Putin which called for tough assimilation policies on immigrants, no evidence of any such speech can be found in Russian media or Duma archives.\n\nIslam has been expanding under Putin's rule. Tatar Muslims are engaging in a revival under Putin.\n\nA Muslim Tatar owned supermarket in Tatarstan sold calendars with images of American President Obama depicted as a monkey and initially refused to apologize for selling the calendar. They were then forced to issue an apology later.\n\nIn Tatarstan a Muslim Tatar staffed ice cream factory produced Obamka (little Obama) ice cream with packaging showing an earring wearing black child and staff members like director of finance Anatoli Ragimkhanov and Rasil Mustafin, deputy development director defended the sale.\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", \"Russian Muslims are split regarding the [Russian] intervention in Syria, but more are pro- than anti-war.\"\n\nThe majority of Muslims in Russia adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam. About 10% or more than two million are Shia Muslims. There is also an active presence of Ahmadis. In a few areas, notably Dagestan and Chechnya, there is a tradition of Sunni Sufism, which is represented by Naqshbandi and Shadhili schools, whose spiritual master Said Afandi al-Chirkawi received hundreds of visitors daily. The Azeris have also historically and still currently been nominally followers of Shi'a Islam, as their republic split off from the Soviet Union, significant number of Azeris immigrated to Russia in search of work.\n\nThe Muslim community in Russia continues to grow, having reached 25 million, according to the grand mufti of Russia, Sheikh Rawil Gaynetdin.\n\nNotable Russian converts to Islam include Vyacheslav Polosin, Vladimir Khodov and Alexander Litvinenko, a defector from Russian intelligence, who converted on his deathbed.\n\nA record 18,000 Russian Muslim pilgrims from all over the country attended the Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 2006. In 2010, at least 20,000 Russian Muslim pilgrims attended the Hajj, as Russian Muslim leaders sent letters to the King of Saudi Arabia requesting that the Saudi visa quota be raised to at least 25,000-28,000 visas for Muslims. Due to overwhelming demand from Russian Muslims, on 5 July 2011, Muftis requested President Dmitry Medvedev's assistance in increasing the allocated by Saudi Arabia pilgrimage quota in Vladikavkaz. The III International Conference on Hajj Management attended by some 170 delegates from 12 counties was held in Kazan from 7 – 9 July 2011.\n\nFor centuries, the Tatars constituted the only Muslim ethnic group in European Russia, with Tatar language being the only language used in their mosques, a situation which saw rapid change over the course of the 20th century as a large number of Caucasian and central Asian Muslims migrated to central Russian cities and began attending Tatar-speaking mosques, generating pressure on the imams of such mosques to begin using Russian. This problem is evident even within Tatarstan itself, where Tatars constitute a majority.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Russian census, Moscow has less than 300,000 permanent residents of Muslim background, while some estimates suggest that Moscow has around 1 million Muslim residents and up to 1.5 million more Muslim migrant workers. The city has permitted the existence of four mosques. The mayor of Moscow claims that four mosques are sufficient for the population. The city's economy \"could not manage without them,\" he said. There are currently 4 mosques in Moscow, and 8,000 in the whole Russia.\n\n\n"}

He is credited with introducing Meher Baba to the West.\n\nStarr was born in Prestbury House, Hampton, at Richmond in the County of Middlesex, England to well-to-do land owning parents (\"landed proprietors\") William Brooks Close and Mary Baker Brooks Close. When Starr was one year old his parents separated and he was raised by his mother. He received his education at Winchester College in Hampshire. Starr was a psychologist, homeopath, occultist and an editorial writer. He was also the principal player in bringing Meher Baba to the West for the first time at the start of the 1930s, although he himself did not remain a follower for very long.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Starr wrote for \"The Occult Review\", an illustrated monthly journal containing articles and correspondence by many notable occultists of the day, including Aleister Crowley, Arthur Edward Waite, W. L. Wilmshurst, Franz Hartmann, Florence Farr, and Herbert Stanley Redgrove. He probably changed his name to Meredith Starr when he was twenty in relation to his work as a reviewer and contributor for \"The Occult Review\". He also wrote for Aleister Crowley's publication \"The Equinox\", publishing \"Memory of Love\" (under the name \"Herbert Close\"), VII, 291 - Vol 7, in 1911.\n\nMeredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr established a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a couple of miles from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in a sense of humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have played a central role in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.\n\nIn December 1932, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba and wrote to him, \"Give me either the 400 pounds you owe me or illumination; otherwise, I will leave you and expose you as a fraud!\" He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he referred to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property a year and a half later. He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.\n\nHe was married firstly on 1 March 1917 at Paddington Register Office to the Honourable Mary Grey, daughter of the 8th Earl of Stamford, by whom he had two sons. He was divorced by \"decree nisi\" 10 April 1930, on his admission of an adulterous relationship of four years' duration with Margaret Ross of East Challacombe, Combe Martin, Devon. He is buried in the Municipal Cemetery, Kirkley, Suffolk.\n"}

The palace was pleasantly situated opposite to head works of the Delhi Mughal Canal, and its portions were standing till the beginning of the present century. To the same nobleman is due the construction of the canal. He is said to have designed the canal, which was conducted with a considerable knowledge of hydraulics, along the crest of the high ground between Yamuna and Hindan, so as to admit of its water being thrown off on both irrigation purposes. The canal was, however, little used till afterwards. Property in money and jewels left by the powerful minister, Ali Mardan Khan, at his death was estimated at a sum equal to Rs 18,00,000. It was in this reign that the small mahal of Jahangirabad was separated from Raipur Tatar, about the same time that the latter’s name was altered to Faizabad which became for a while the capital of the sarkar Saharanpur.\n\nInvine, on the authority of ‘Anonymous Fragments’, says that ‘Islam Khan (Salim Shah) son of Sher Khan Sur, in his days of brief authority, began to build a strong fortress under the name of Pawangarh. It was left unfinished and fell into ruins’.-Later Mughals p. 109. But the name Moklespore (mentioned in Rennels map of countries between Delhi and Candhaar, 1792), is itself suggestive of its founder. Iradat Khan calls it Daber.\n\nProf. Ganda Singh in his book \"Life of Banda Singh Bahadur\" writes on pages 55–56 The fort of Mukhlispur was built by one Mukhlis Khan under instructions from Emperor Shsh Jahan who occasionally spent his summer there. It was a strong hill-fort about halfway between the towns of Sadhaura and Nahan (about 9 km from Sadhaura), within the boundary of the village of Amuwal, among the steeps of the Himalayas on an elevated summit which could be approached only by craggy rocks and ravines. It was surrounded by two rivulets, Pamuwali and Daska-wali Khols or Khuds, which originally formed only one stream, parting into two to embrace the hillock of the fort. The fort was in a most neglected condition when Banda Singh Bahadur occupied it. It was soon repaired and was given the new name of Lohgarh or Iron Fort.\n\nSurinder Singh in his book \"Discovering Baba Banda Singh Bahadur\", writes on pages 285–286, Banda Bahadur carried out the repairs to the Mukhlispur fortress and renamed it as Lohgarh. He also fortified it by laying 3 to 4 ft high and 50- to 100-ft-long stone walls, 52 in number. Sikh soldiers could stay behind these walls and the Mughal Empire forces trying to reach the fortress and to face their gunshots and arrows about 15 times before they could reach the top. Large-scale troops could not climb and on two occasions when they were able to and large-scale assault is not possible at the Fort, follow Banda Bahadur and his troops up to Lohgarh, the imperial forces lost a large number of soldiers but were not able to catch Banda Bahadur and his men. This small defensive arrangement has been deemed as a capital by a large number of historians form Punjab when the site was hardly about 100 to 200 km from major parts of Punjab and could be easily visited and examined. The author had the occasion to visit and examine this-the Sadhaura-Lohgarh-Sitaragarh axis-a large number of times in his capacity as convenor for the raising of a suitable memorial by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. This author is of the opinion that half an acre of land on which Lohgarh has been raised is generally occupied by medium sixed bavelis (large houses). He is also of the opinion that Lohgarh was not declared as the capital of the nascent Sikh state because three series of the coins issued by Banda Bahadur from 1710–12 do not carry any name of the city or town after the word \"zarb\" meaning \"minted at\". Had it been fixed as a capital, the name of Lohgarh would have certainly come on the coin. The legend after the word \"zarb\", is \"place of perfect peace, picture of a beautiful city where the fortunate throne of Khalsa is to be located\".\n\nDr. Harjinder Singh Dilgeer in his book \"Great Sikh General Banda Singh Bahadur\", writes on page no 57, the Sikhs had captured the fort of Mukhlisgarh (Lohgarh) and had established it as capital.\n\nDr. J.S. Grewal in his book ‘The Sikhs of the Punjab’ writes on page no 83, he adopted Mukhlispur, an imperial fort now given the name of Lohgarh, as his capital and struck a new coin in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nDr. Khushwant Singh in his book \"A History of the Sikhs\" second edition writes on page no 103, Banda was too shrewd to place much reliance on the loyalties of the new converts and he made the old fort of Mukhlisgarh, in the safety of the Himalayas, his headquarters. At Mukhlisgarh, Banda learned that Bahadur Shah, after subjugation of Rajasthan and not likely to return to Delhi before the monsoons. Banda decided to utilize the opportunity to destroy the remaining vestiges of Mughal rule in northern India.\n\nDr. Hari Ram Gupta in his book ‘ History of the Sikhs, writes on page no 11, he, therefore, established his headquarters, in the beginning of February 1710, at Mukhlispur situated in lower Shiwalik hills south of Nahan, about 20 km from Sadhaura. Its fort stood on a hill top. Two kuhls or water channels flowed at its base and supplied water to it. This fort was repaired and put in a state of defence. All the money, gold and costly material acquired in these expeditions were deposited here. He struck coins and issued orders under his own seal. The name of Mukhlispur was changed to Lohgarh, and it became the capital of the first Sikh state.\n\nThe contemporary historians were Mughals, therefore they deliberately projected a wrong picture of Lohgarh. Later on, the other historians picked, their references in the context of Lohgarh leading to the depiction of wrong interpretation of history. Muklishgarh is almost 30 km away from Lohgarh.\n\nArchaeological survey of India Has spent about 2 crore rupees for the preservation and restoration of the site. see serial 261 of the list published by ASI.\n\nhttp://www.asiagracircle.in/list-of3.html\n\n"}

{"id": "708719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=708719", "title": "Novice", "text": "Novice\n\nA novice is a person or creature who is new to a field or activity. It can be seen as a person who has entered a religious order and is under probation, before taking vows. Additionally, it can be an animal, especially a racehorse, that has not yet won a major prize or reached a level of performance to qualify for important events.\n\nIn many Buddhist orders, a man or woman who intends to take ordination must first become a novice, adopting part of the monastic code indicated in the vinaya and studying in preparation for full ordination. The name for this level of ordination varies from one tradition to another. In Pali, the word is samanera, which means 'small monk' or 'boy monk'.\n\nA novice in Roman Catholic canon law and tradition, is a \"prospective\" member of a religious order who is being tried and being proven for suitability of admission to a religious order of priests, religious brothers, or religious sisters, whether the community is one of monks or has an \"active\" ministry. After initial contact with the community, and usually a period of time as a postulant (a more or less formal period of candidacy for the novitiate), the person will be received as a novice in a ceremony that most often involves being clothed with the religious habit (traditional garb) of the particular religious community. The novice's habit is often slightly different from those of professed members of the order. For instance, in communities of women that wear a dark veil over the head, novices often wear a white one; among Franciscan communities of men, novices wear an additional shirt-like chest piece over the traditional Franciscan robe; Carthusian novices wear a dark cloak over the usual white habit; etc.\n\nNovices are not admitted to vows until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the novitiate. This usually lasts one year, the minimum required by Canon Law, though in some orders and communities it is two. Novices typically have dormitories in separate areas within a monastery or community and are under the direct supervision of a novice master or novice mistress.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, a candidate may be clothed as a novice (Slavonic: послушник, \"poslushnik\", literally \"one under obedience\") by the hegumen (abbot) or hegumenia (abbess) after at least three days in the monastery. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) is simply given the riassa, belt and skoufos. Novice nuns additionally wear a veil (apostolnik) that covers the head and neck. A novice is also given a prayer rope and instructed in the use of the Jesus Prayer. In large communities, the new novice may be assigned a starets (spiritual father or spiritual mother) who will guide his spiritual development. Frequent confession of sins and participation in the sacred mysteries (sacraments) of the church is an important part of Orthodox monastic life.\n\nA novice is free to leave the monastery at any time, and the superior is also free to dismiss the novice at any time if, for instance, he or she feels the novice is not called to monasticism or if there have been discipline issues. If, however, the novice perseveres, after a period of around three years the hegumen may choose to clothe him in the first (beginning) rank of monasticism: the rassaphore.\n\nIn National Hunt racing, a novice is a horse that has not won a race under a particular code (either chasing or hurdling) before the current season.\n\nIn figure skating competitions, novice has two meanings. For the U.S. Figure Skating Association, it refers to a skill level, while the International Skating Union uses it to designate age.\n\nNovice is a level of minor hockey in Canada. Novice players are usually between the ages of 7 and 8.\n\nIn the sport of crew (rowing), the term is used for an athlete in their first year of competition.\n\nIn many sports, a novice athlete competing in their first season or league is often referred to as a rookie, and outstanding novice athletes can win Rookie of the Year.\n\nWith the rise of the internet, a novice is a person who is a newcomer to a particular website, forum, or other social community. These people are usually inexperienced and unfamiliar with the traditions and protocols surrounding that community.\n\nThus, it's a difficult task for online communities to get novices to contribute. One way to make novices contribute is to make them feel unique which makes them want to contribute. In a study at Carnegie Mellon University, researchers looked at whether reminding users of their history of rating rarely-rated movies at MovieLens.com increased their contributions. The study found that reminding users of their uniqueness increased their willingness to contribute. The study also looked at whether goal-setting could help users contribute more to the community. The study found that users with specific goals contributed more than users with a do-your-best goal.\n\nSlang terms include \"newbie\" and the more derogatory \"noob.\" Newbie is mostly used as a descriptor or qualifier, a name given to novices by more experienced users or community members to indicate someone who just entered the community and is eager to learn and participate. Noob is a word used to insult or deride novices who are disrespectful, uninterested, or unwilling to learn.\n\nIn gamer culture, a newbie is an inexperienced player with a low level, rank, or in-game abilities but wants to participate and improve, and a noob is a bad player who seems disinterested in learning or teamwork and trolls other players.\n\nOnline communities have five basic problems regarding newcomers: recruitment, selection, retention, socialization, and protection.\n\nRecruitment in online communities is about advertising to recruits and ensuring there is a healthy amount of newcomers because without newcomers, online communities can fail to survive. There many different methods that online communities use to recruit new members. For example, Blizzard entertainment used both impersonal advertisement (TV, print, online advertisement) and interpersonal advertisement (recruit-a-friend promotion) to recruit new players for World of Warcraft.\n\nSelection in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers will be a good fit in the community. This is very important because a better fit is more likely to be beneficial for the community, since better fit newcomers stay in the group longer when they join and are more satisfied with their membership. One way that selection works in online communities is through the process of self-selection, in which the potential members decide themselves to join a community based on the information about the community available to them. Another way of selection is through screening, in which the community selects certain members who they believe will be a good fit.\n\nRetention in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers stick around and stay long enough to become more committed members, who take on more important responsibilities and begin to be identify themselves with the group. One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment. For example, in World of Warcraft, newcomers have to play with other guild members for at least about a month to join.\n\nSocialization in online communities about the rest of community interacting with newcomer and teaching them the guidelines and standards of the community. For example, in World of Warcraft, old member show the newcomers ropes, by coaching them, helping them with quests,and providing mentorship in general.\n\nProtection in online communities is about protecting the community from the newcomers. Since newcomers still have not established themselves with the group or still may be unfamiliar with the norms of the community, the rest of the community has to beware of the potential damage that they can cause. One way to deal with the threats is through the use of sandboxes, which allows newcomers to try out the features and learn about the tools without causing damage to the community.\n\n"}

She is usually depicted as a naked woman who is covered with stars. She represents the \"All\", pure potentiality both as it flowers into the physical universe and as it resides beyond embodiment.\n\nWithin this system, she is one-third of the triadic cosmology, along with Hadit (her masculine counterpart), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Crowned and Conquering Child. She has several titles, including the \"Queen of Infinite Space\", \"Our Lady of the Stars\", and \"Lady of the Starry Heaven\". Nuit represents the infinitely-expanded circle whose circumference is unmeasurable and whose center is everywhere (whereas Hadit is the infinitely small point within the core of every single thing). According to Thelemic doctrine, it is the interaction between these two cosmic principles that creates the manifested universe similar to the gnostic syzygy.\n\nSome quotes from the \"First Chapter\" of \"The Book of the Law\" (\"Liber AL vel Legis\"):\n\"Every man and every woman is a star.\" (AL I:3).\n\"Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love!\" (AL I:12).\n\"For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.\" (AL I:29).\n\"The word of the Law is \"Θελημα\". Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" (AL I:39-40).\n\"For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.\" (AL I:44).\n\"Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. [...]\" (AL I:57).\n\"I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.\" (AL I:58).\n\nIn \"The Equinox of the Gods\" (ch. 7, section 6), Crowley writes of Nuit in comparison to Christianity:\n\nThe following are quotes from Crowley's commentaries to \"The Book of the Law\".\n\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Nut was the sky goddess. She is the daughter of Shu and Tefnut.\n\nThe sun god Ra entered her mouth after the sun set in the evening and was reborn from her vulva the next morning. She also swallowed and rebirthed stars. She was a goddess of death, and her image is on the inside of most sarcophagi. The pharaoh entered her body after death and was later resurrected.\n\nIn art, Nut is depicted as a woman wearing no clothes, covered with stars and supported by Shu; opposite her (the sky), is her husband Geb. With Geb, she was the mother of Osiris, Horus, Isis, Set, and Nephthys.\n\n\n\n"}

As with many liminal beings, the onocentaur's nature is one of conflict between its human and animal components.\n\nThe first mention by Pythagoras was in the time of rule of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, as quoted by Claudius Aelianus in \"De Natura Animalium\". Aelian as well uses the term \"onokentaura\" for description of the female form. He interpreted the onocentaur as: \"its body resembles that of an ass, its colour is ashen but inclines to white beneath the flanks. It has a human chest with teats and a human face surrounded by thick hair. It may use its arms to seize and hold things but also to run.

Her feast day is celebrated on November 19.\n\nThe title of \"Mary, Mother of Divine Providence\" is often traced to her intervention at the wedding in Cana. Christ's first public miracle was occasioned in part by the intercession of his mother. She helped through her foresight and concern to avoid an embarrassing situation for the newlywed couple. Our Lady of Providence is sometimes also identified as Queen of the Home.\n\nDevotion to Our Lady of Divine Providence originated in Italy, and spread to France and Spain. The devotion was brought to Puerto Rico in the early 1850s by the Servite Fathers. According to tradition, Philip Benizi (1233 – 1285) prayed to Mary for help in providing food for his friars, and subsequently found several baskets of provisions left at the door of the convent. Our Lady of Providence was declared the patroness of Puerto Rico by Pope Paul VI on November 19, 1969. Her feast day is celebrated in many immigrant Puerto Rican communities.\n\nAround 1580, the Italian painter Scipione Pulzone created a work titled \"Mater Divinae Providentiae,\" which depicted the Blessed Mother cradling the Infant Jesus. Devotion to Mary, Mother of Divine Providence in the first house of the Congregation of the Clerics Regular of St. Paul (Barnabites) in Rome at San Carlo ai Catinari church began around year 1611, when one of the clerics traveled to Loreto to pray for assistance in finding the financial resources to complete the Church of San Carlo. Upon his return, they received the necessary assistance, and the Barnabites began to promote devotion to Our Lady of Providence.\n\nPulzone's painting was given to the Barnabites in 1663. It was placed on the altar of a chapel on the first floor of the Saint Charles rectory behind the main altar. In 1732, a copy of the painting was placed in a location adjacent to the main altar of the church of San Carlo ai Catinari in Rome, where it drew many faithful visitors.\n\nIn 1774, Pope Benedict XIV authorized the Confraternity of Our Lady of Providence, a lay organization created for the purpose of promoting special works of Christian charity or piety. Pope Gregory XVI elevated it to an Archconfraternity in 1839. In 1888, Pope Leo XIII ordered the solemn crowning of the \"Miraculous Lady\" and approved the Mass and Office of Mary, Mother of Divine Providence. On August 5, 1896, Superior General of the Barnabites Father Benedict Nisser decreed that every Barnabite have a copy of the painting in their home.\n\nOur Lady of Providence is the patroness of Indiana and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island. The chapel of Saint Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts is dedicated to Our Lady of Providence.\n\nOur Lady of Divine Providence is the patroness of St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, Kansas.\n\nOur Lady of Divine Providence is also the patroness of the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.\n\nDevotion to Our Lady of Providence came to the United States after a chaplain of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, Monsignor A.J. Rawlinson, saw a reproduction of \"Mater Divinae Providentiae\" at Catholic University of America. During a trip to Rome in 1925, Rawlinson gathered historical information on the devotion to Our Lady of Providence and then brought back prints of the painting to Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana.\n\nOn May 1, 1925, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Providence was canonically erected at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods with the purpose of encouraging families to make Mary the queen of their homes. A Confraternity of Our Lady of Providence was erected, and later a certificate of affiliation of the American Confraternity was established with the Archconfraternity in Rome.\n\nThe hymn \"Our Lady of Providence,\" by Sister of Providence Cecilia Clare Bocard, is sung by the sisters at various special celebrations.\n\n"}

Works by Max are associated with the visual arts and culture of the 1960s, particularly psychedelic art and pop art.\n\nIn 1938, Max's parents fled Berlin, Germany, his place of birth, to escape the fomenting Nazi movement, settling in Shanghai, China, where they lived for the next ten years. In 1948, the family moved to Haifa, Israel where they lived for several years. From Israel, the family continued moving westward and stopped in Paris for several months—an experience that Max said greatly influenced his appreciation for art.\n\nMax and his parents first settled in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn in 1953 where he attended Lafayette High School, where he was classmates with future actor Paul Sorvino. In 1956, Max began his formal art training at the Art Students League of New York in Manhattan, studying anatomy, figure drawing and composition under Frank J. Reilly who had studied at the League alongside Norman Rockwell.\n\nIn 1962, Max started a small Manhattan arts studio known as \"The Daly & Max Studio,\" with friend Tom Daly. Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor Don Rubbo, and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. Max's interest in astronomy contributed to his self-described \"Cosmic '60s\" period, which featured what became identified as psychedelic, counter culture imagery. Max's art was popularized nationally through TV commercials such as his 1968 \"un cola\" ad for the soft drink 7-Up which helped drive sales of his art posters and other merchandise.\n\nPeter Max invited Satchidananda Saraswati to New York in 1966 for a two-day visit which turned into a permanent residence for Satchidananda, who became surrounded by many students who formed Integral Yoga International.\n\nMax appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" on August 15, 1968. He was featured on the cover of \"Life\" magazine's September 5, 1969 edition under with the heading \"Peter Max: Portrait of the artist as a very rich man.\"\n\nIn 1970, many of Max's products and posters were featured in the exhibition \"The World of Peter Max,\" which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. The United States Postal Service commissioned Max to create the 10-cent postage stamp to commemorate the Expo '74 World's Fair in Spokane, Washington, and Max drew a colorful psychedelic scene with a \"Cosmic Jumper\" and a \"Smiling Sage\" against a backdrop of a cloud, sun rays and a ship at sea on the theme of \"Preserve the Environment.\" July 4, 1976, Max began his Statue of Liberty series leading to his efforts with Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca to help in the restoration of the statue.\n\nIn 1976, \"Peter Max Paints America\" was commissioned by the ASEA of Sweden. The book project commemorated the United States Bicentennial and included the following foreword: \"Peter Max Paints America is based on works of art commissioned by ASEA of Sweden on the 200th anniversary of the founding of the United States of America, in sincere recognition of the historic bonds of friendship between the people of Sweden and the people of the United States, recalling that Sweden was one of the first countries to extend its hand in friendship to the new nation.\"\n\nMax has been the official artist for many major events, including the 1994 World Cup, the Grammy Awards, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Super Bowl and others. In 2000, Max designed the paint scheme Dale Earnhardt drove at the Winston all-star race, deviating from Earnhardt's trademark black car. He was also the Official Artist of New York City's 2000 Subway Series, the World Series of Major League Baseball, between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets.\n\nMax first painted Taylor Swift's portrait as a gift to the singer for her Grammy-winning albums Fearless and Speak Now, and has recently painted new portraits of Taylor Swift to commemorate her worldwide success.\n\nMax is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.\n\nIn 1989, Max designed the cover photo - as well as the 45 (single) picture-sleeve photo - of Aretha Franklin's 'Through The Storm' album.\n\nIn 1990, Max purchased a collection of Chevrolet Corvettes for an intended art project, but never used them and let them rot in a series of garages.\n\nIn 1994, Max designed the artwork for progressive rock band Yes's fourteenth studio album, \"Talk\". In 2012, he was chosen to paint the hull art of the New York themed ship Norwegian Breakaway by Norwegian Cruise Line. In 2017, Max did the cover art for the Aug/Sept issue of AARP magazine.\n\nMax's art work was first associated with the counter culture, neo-expressionism, and psychedelic movements in graphic design during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is known for using bursts of color, often containing much or all of the visible spectrum. His work was influenced by others. Max's repeated claims, varying in detail, to have worked on \"Yellow Submarine\" have been denied by the production team.\n\nMax works in multiple media including painting, drawing, etchings (including aquatint), collage, print making, sculpture, video and digital imagery. He also includes \"mass media\" as being another \"canvas\" for his creative expression.\n\nMax often uses American icons and symbols in his artwork. He has created paintings of presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush in addition to his \"100 Clintons\"—a multiple portrait installation. Additional commissions have included the creation of the first \"Preserve the Environment\" postage stamp, in honor of the World's Fair in Spokane, WA, border murals at the entry points Canada and Mexico by the US General Services, and exhibitions in over 40 museums and 50 galleries worldwide., He often features images of celebrities, politicians, athletes and sporting events and other pop culture subjects in his artwork.\n\nOne of Continental Airlines' Boeing 777-200ER aircraft (registered N77014) sported a livery designed by Max.\n\nHis artwork was featured on CBS's \"The Early Show\" where his \"44 Obamas,\" commemorating Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was debuted.\n\nHarper Collins in 2013 published a book of the artist's memoirs and thoughts called \"The Universe of Peter Max\". In it, he relates stories of his life as well as descriptions and thoughts surrounding of some of his artwork.\n\nMax is an environmentalist, vegan and supporter of human and animal rights. Max had a nine-year-long relationship with musician and model Rosie Vela that ended in 1985. In November 1997, Max pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal district court to charges of concealing more than $1.1 million in income from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the sales of his works between 1988 and 1991. The plea came two days before he was to go on trial on an 11-count conspiracy and tax fraud indictment. Under the deal, he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS and a charge of tax evasion, telling a federal judge that he had taken payments in cash, deposited customers' checks into his personal account and arranged other transactions to avoid tax liability. In June 1998, he was sentenced to two months in prison and a $30,000 fine. The federal judge ordered Max to pay the taxes he owed and to perform 800 hours of community service.\n\nIn 2002, Max contributed to rescue efforts for Cincinnati Freedom, a cow that escaped from an Ohio slaughterhouse. The cow jumped over a six-foot fence while the slaughterhouse workers were on break and eluded capture for eleven days. Max donated $180,000 worth of his art to benefit the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, part of a chain of events which finally led to the cow being sent to Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York, a permanent home where the cow remained for the rest of its life.\n\nMax lives in New York City and has two adult children, Adam Cosmo Max and Libra Astro Max.\n\n"}

Evidence exists for conversions by Celtic Christian missionaries as early as 850, but the Catholic Church was not established on the islands by the latter year. The \"Færeyinga saga\" is often cited with respect to the early spread of Christendom in the islands. The saga states that the king of Norway told Sigmund to go by ship to the Faroe Islands with orders from the King. Sigmund's orders were clear: he was supposed to make the 18 small islands Christian, which is what he did, according to the saga. This event is believed to have taken place around 1000, but the Faroese did not establish an organised congregation of the Catholic Church before around 1100, so there do appear to be some inconsistencies in the saga.\n\nOriginally belonging to Norway, Faroe fell under the jurisdiction of Denmark in 1523. The last Catholic Bishop of the Faroe Islands was Ámundur Ólavsson (Amund); he was replaced by the first Lutheran bishop, Jens Gregersøn Riber, in 1540.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 Hindus (0.02%), 66 Buddhist (0.19%), 12 Jews (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 Sikh (0.01%), 149 Others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%) and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).\n\nThe Catholic Church has nearly 150 adherents. There are also small groups of Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Ahmadi Muslims and Bahá'ís in the country.\n\n"}

The Andean lakes are considered sacred in the religion of the Muisca who inhabited the area before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca in the 1530s.\n\nIn the Chibcha language of the Muisca \"Siecha\" means \"House of the Lord\".\n\nThe Siecha Lakes consist of three small glacial lakes, from large to small and east to west; Siecha (63,893 m²), Guasca (56,846 m²) and De los Patos (20,662 m²). Alternative names for the smaller two are Fausto and America. The lakes belong to the municipality of Guasca. Fauna around the lakes are the birds American purple gallinule, helmeted curassow, torrent duck, Andean cock-of-the-rock, eagles and orange-fronted parakeet. In the lakes the birds \"Oxyura jamaicensis andina\", Andean teal and the American coot can be found. Mammals around the lakes include the spectacled bear, white-tailed deer, red deer and the little red brocket.\n\nIn the colonial period, the lakes were partly drained to extract the golden artefacts of the Muisca from the water. In 1855 a golden raft was found in one of the lakes, similar to the famous Muisca raft. It was named \"Balsa de Siecha\" or \"Siecha raft\" and pictured in the book \"El Dorado\" by Muisca scholar Liborio Zerda in 1883. The discovery of the raft made Zerda believe that the site of the initiation ritual of the new \"zipa\" was not in Lake Guatavita, yet in the Siecha Lakes. Later, the raft was more-or-less legally taken from Colombia to Europe. The transporting ship burnt in the harbour of Bremen and the raft was lost.\n\nTo visit the lakes certain rules apply; visits are only possible on Saturdays and Sundays, access at the entrance point needs to be not later than 10:00 AM and exit not after 4:00 PM. A maximum of 30 visitors per day is allowed.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is not used for healers.\n\nIn the Navajo language, ' translates to \"by means of it, it goes on all fours\". While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of \"\". The legend of the skin-walkers is not well understood outside of Navajo culture, mostly due to reluctance to discuss the subject with outsiders. Navajo people are reluctant to reveal skin-walker lore to non-Navajos, or to discuss it at all among those they do not trust:\n\nWhat happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions...but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I'm sorry if that seems 'unfair', but that's how our cultures survive.\n\nNavajo witches, including skin-walkers, represent the antithesis of Navajo cultural values. While community healers and cultural workers are known as medicine men and women, or by terms in the local, indigenous language, witches are seen as evil, performing twisted ceremonies and manipulating magic in a perversion of the good works medicine people traditionally perform. In order to practice their good works, traditional healers learn about both good and evil magic. Most can handle the responsibility, but some people can become corrupt and choose to become witches.\n\nAnimals associated with witchcraft usually include tricksters such as the coyote, but can include other creatures, usually those associated with death or bad omens. They might also possess living animals or people and walk around in their bodies by locking eyes with them. Skin-walkers may be male or female. \n\nSkin-walker stories told among Navajo children may be complete life and death struggles that end in either skin-walker or Navajo killing the other, or partial encounter stories that end in a stalemate. Encounter stories may be composed as Navajo victory stories, with the skin-walkers approaching a hogan and being scared away.\n\nNon-Native interpretations of skin-walker stories typically take the form of partial encounter stories on the road, where the protagonist is temporarily vulnerable, but then escapes from the skin-walker in a way not traditionally seen in Navajo stories that take place away from home. Sometimes Navajo children take Euro-derived folk stories and substitute skin-walkers for generic killers like The Hook.\n\n"}
{"id": "1984834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984834", "title": "Spiritual Assembly", "text": "Spiritual Assembly\n\nSpiritual Assembly is a term given by `Abdu'l-Bahá to refer to elected councils that govern the Bahá'í Faith. Because the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, they carry out the affairs of the community. In addition to existing at the local level, there are national Spiritual Assemblies (although \"national\" in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries).\n\nBahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi stated how Spiritual Assemblies should be elected by the Bahá'ís, defined their nature and purposes, and described in considerable detail how they should function. Since these institutions are grounded in the Bahá'í authoritative texts, Bahá'ís regard them as divine in nature, and contrast the wealth of scriptural guidance with the paucity of scriptural texts on which Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religious institutions are based.\n\nThe Universal House of Justice has added that among the responsibilities of Local Spiritual Assemblies are to be “channels of divine guidance, planners of the teaching work, developers of human resources, builders of communities, and loving shepherds of the multitudes.” On a practical level, they organize local Bahá'í communities by maintaining a local Bahá'í Fund, owning the local Bahá'í center (if one exists), organizing Bahá'í events, counseling Bahá'ís about personal difficulties, assisting with Bahá'í marriages and funerals, providing educational programs to adults and children, publicizing the Bahá'í Faith locally, fostering projects for the social and economic development of the region, and enrolling new members of the religion. Spiritual Assemblies appoint individuals, task forces, and committees to carry out many of their functions. National Spiritual Assemblies have a similar mandate at the national level: they coordinate publishing and distribution of Bahá'í literature, direct relations with national organizations and governmental agencies, oversee the work of local spiritual assemblies, and (in some countries) Regional Councils, set local Bahá'í jurisdictional boundaries, provide various educational services and programs, and set the overall tone and direction of the national community.\n\nThe origin of the institution of the local Spiritual Assembly originates from Bahá'u'lláh’s book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:\n\nThe passage gives the institution a name, a minimum number (nine, for “the number of Baha” refers to the numerical value of the letters of that word, which is nine), and a general responsibility to take care of the welfare of others even as they would take care of their own. While the resulting institution is local, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá'u'lláh also spoke about the responsibilities of the supreme or Universal House of Justice. In response to the passage, Mírzá Asadu'lláh Isfahání, a prominent Bahá'í teacher, organized an unofficial Bahá'í consultative body in Tehran, Iran, about 1878. The first official Bahá'í consultative body was organized under `Abdu'l-Bahá’s direction by Hand of the Cause Hají Ákhúnd in Tehran in 1897; by 1899 it was an elected body. Because of the difficulties in Iran caused by persecution of the Bahá'í Faith, the Tehran body served to coordinate both local and national Bahá'í activities. It is not known what name the body was organized under.\nThe development of a Bahá'í community in the United States in the 1890s necessitated the creation of local Bahá'í consultative bodies there. In 1899 the Bahá'ís of Chicago elected a local council based on their awareness of the provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (which was circulated in provisional English translation as a typescript as early as 1900). The New York Bahá'ís elected a “Board of Counsel” in December 1900. In 1901 the Chicago body was reorganized and re-elected and took the name “House of Justice of Bahais of Chicago, Ills.” In response, `Abdu'l-Bahá revealed three tablets of encouragement and guidance to the body, including prayers to say at the beginning and end of their meetings, prayers that Bahá'ís use around the world today for their Spiritual Assembly meetings.\n\nIn 1902 `Abdu'l-Bahá sent a very important tablet to the Chicago governing body where he said “let the designation of that body be ‘Spiritual Assembly’—this for the reason that, were it to use the term ‘House of Justice’, the government might hereafter come to suppose that it was acting as a court of law, or concerning itself in political matters, or that, at some indeterminate future time, it would involve itself in the affairs of government... This same designation hath been universally adopted throughout Iran.” For this reason, Bahá'í local and national governing bodies are designated “Spiritual Assemblies” to this day.\n\nThe first decade of the twentieth century saw the proliferation of local Bahá'í governing bodies. Often unaware of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s guidance, they had a variety of titles in English and Persian, such as “Council Board, “Board of Consultation,” “House of Spirituality,” and \"Executive Committee.\" Unaware `Abdu'l-Bahá had told the Chicago Bahá'ís to elect their body every five years, they were usually elected annually or even semi-annually. The number of members varied from five to nineteen (except in New York City, where `Abdu'l-Bahá, in 1911, said they should elect twenty-seven members in order to be inclusive of and to foster unity between that city’s diverse Bahá'í groups). They were male only until `Abdu'l-Bahá said, in 1911, that women should be elected to the local governing bodies existing in the United States; their exclusion from local bodies continued in Iran until the 1950s, because of Iranian cultural conventions. In the period of 1900 - 1911, consultative bodies are known to have existed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Boston, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Spokane, Washington, northern Hudson County, New Jersey, the greater San Francisco area, California, in the United States; and in Bombay, British Raj India; Cairo, Khedivate of Egypt; Acre, Ottoman Syria; Baku, Tbilisi, Ashgabat and Samarqand in the Russian Empire; and Mashhad, Abadih, Qazvin, and Tabriz, Persia. Consultative bodies also existed for the Jewish and Zoroastrian Bahá'ís in Tehran and for the women of a few Bahá'í communities.\n\nBecause efforts to organize local Bahá'í consultative bodies remained informal, few additional ones had formed by 1921 (notable exceptions being Cleveland, Ohio, and London), and some of the ones in the United States had lapsed. Upon assuming the Guardianship of the Bahá'í Faith, Shoghi Effendi read `Abdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament and made establishment of local spiritual assemblies an early priority. His second general letter to the Bahá'ís of the world, dated March 5, 1922, referred to the “vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine.” The letter also quoted extensively from Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá about the purposes and duties of Spiritual Assemblies. \n\nThe result was a rapid proliferation of local Spiritual Assemblies; a 1928 list had the following: Australia, 6; Brazil, 1; Burma, 3; Canada, 2; China, 1; Egypt, 1; England, 4; France, 1; India, 4; Japan, 1; Korea, 1; Lebanon, 1; New Zealand, 1; Palestine, 1; Iran, 5; Russia, 1; South Africa, 1; Switzerland, 1; Syria, 1; Turkey, 1; and the United States, 47, for a total of 85 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide. \n\nThe number has grown ever since; in 2001 there were 11,740 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide.\n\nNational Spiritual Assemblies are first mentioned in `Abdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament, but the fact that they would be established circulated for years before the contents of the Will became publicly available in early 1922. In 1909, wrote extensively about the role of the national House of Justice (as it would have been known then) in his \"The Universal Religion: Bahaism, Its Rise and Social Import.\" In that year, also, the Bahá'ís of the United States and Canada elected a nine-member “Executive Committee” for the Bahai Temple Unity, a continental consultative body formed to build the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Subsequently the Bahai Temple Unity, which held annual conventions, appointed committees to publish Bahá'í literature, coordinate the spread of the Bahá'í Faith across North America, and review Bahá'í publications for their accuracy. By the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s passing in November 1921, the Bahai Temple Unity functioned as a “national” Bahá'í coordinating body.\nIn the same March 5, 1922 letter to the Bahá'ís of the world that called for the election of local Spiritual Assemblies, Shoghi Effendi called on them to “indirectly” elect National Spiritual Assemblies. He also enumerated committees that a National Spiritual Assembly should have in order to carry out its responsibilities. “Indirect” election referred to the process, mentioned in the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá, of the Bahá'ís electing one or more delegates from each locality, who would represent them at a national convention and would vote for the nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly. The 1928 issue of \"The Bahá'í World\" listed nine National Spiritual Assemblies: Persia (Iran); the United States and Canada; Germany; Great Britain and Ireland; India and Burma; Egypt; Turkistan; Caucasus; and Iraq. Of these, the Iranian body was still the “Central Spiritual Assembly” in Tehran, elected by the Bahá'ís of that community; it was not until 1934 that a national Bahá'í membership list could be drawn up that allowed the election of delegates and convening of a fully representative national convention. It is possible that the Turkistan and Caucasus bodies were preliminary as well. By 1953 the number of National Spiritual Assemblies worldwide had increased to 12; in 1963, 56; by 1968, 81, by 1988, 148; by 2001, 182. \n\nAn important part of the process was the establishment of “regional” National Spiritual Assemblies; thus in 1951 all of South America elected a single National Spiritual Assembly, but by 1963 nearly every nation on that continent had its own. National Spiritual Assemblies are still being formed as areas of the world achieve religious freedom. Some National Spiritual Assemblies have been formed in areas smaller than a nation: Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have their own “national” bodies because they are geographically separated from the lower forty-eight states; Sicily has its own because Shoghi Effendi said major islands also like in the Caribbean should elect independent National Spiritual Assemblies. \n\nLike local Spiritual Assemblies, all National Spiritual Assemblies have nine members and are elected annually, usually during the Ridván Festival (April 21-May 2). All Bahá'í elections occur in an atmosphere of prayer where nominations, campaigning, and all discussion of persons is forbidden.\n\nThe members of the National Spiritual Assemblies collectively serve as the electoral college for electing the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, which was first formed in 1963.\n\n\n"}

The structures were used during the New Kingdom, in the first four years of the 18th dynasty reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, when he still used the name \"Amenhotep IV\". The edifices may have been constructed at the end of the reign of his father, Amenhotep III, and completed by Akhenaten.\n\nThe Temple of Amenhotep IV was constructed outside the boundaries of the Precinct of Amon-Re, to its east. The main temple in the complex was named \"Gm–p3–itn\" (Gempaaten), which means \"The Sun Disc is Found in the Estate of the God Aten\". The other monuments were named \"Hwt–bnbn\" (Hwt benben / \"The Mansion of the Benben stone\"), \"Rwd–mnw–n–itn–r–nḥḥ\" (Rud-menu / \"Sturdy are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever\"), and \"Tni–mnw–n–itn–r–nḥḥ\" (Teni–menu / \"Exalted are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever\").\n\nVery little of these buildings remain; they were built quickly, using Talatat blocks, and could therefore easily be demolished and reused as core for later structures.\n\nThe \"Gempaaten\" appears to have had no roof and its offering tables were exposed to direct sunlight. In this building (or associated with it) were red granite and sandstone statues of Akhenaten, red granite offering tables and other statues, including a sphinx inscribed with the name of the deity Aten. It was of a considerable size (130m x 216m), but it was so completely destroyed that even its foundations have been nearly obliterated.\n\nIt stood within a mud-brick enclosure, and was orientated to the east, possibly with an entrance to the west. It led to an open court surrounded by square pillars and colossal statues of Akhenaten and Nefertiti.\n\nErected to the east, the \"Hwt benben\" or Mansion of the Benben was devoted to a solar cult and was closely associated with the Gempaaten.\n\nThe Teni–menu seemed to contain domestic and storage rooms, and may have been a royal residence, although not enough of the structure remains to clarify the use.\n\nThe walls of the Teni-menu were reused in the Ninth Pylon of the main Karnak temple. They have since been identified and reassembled like a giant puzzle and are partly exhibited in the Luxor Museum. The reassembled walls show residential, administrative and royal scenes and solar Jubilee scenes of the first Sed festival, which Akhenaten was probably celebrating at the same time as his father Amenhotep III.\n\n"}

Their incantations might call on helpers such as the dead, \"väki\", Ukko, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, or animal spirits.\n\nMany \"tietäjät\" knew \"Kalevala\"-metre poems, as well as mythical stories, spells, and healing charms. One of the key branches of the \"tietäjä\"'s knowledge concerned aetiologies (\"synnyt\", s. \"synty\") of natural phenomena. It was believed that beings and phenomena could be controlled if their origin was known. For example, disease could be overcome if one recited or sang its \"synty\". This knowledge was closely guarded. \"Tietäjät\", sorcerers and healers were seen as protectors of a kind of cosmic equilibrium. Different kinds of beings had their own place in the universe, and if beings found themselves out of place, problems arose. The healer's role was often to return the beings to the right place. A sage generally knew the different requirements for different spells, in which often one needed to do rituals and recite spells, often also use magical substances or magic items. Their practices have often been compared with shamanism.\n\nThe \"tietäjä\" is first recorded in Gabriel Maxenius's 1733 \"De effectibus fascino naturalibus\". People known as \"tietäjät\" existed in real life, though the institution is now 'nearly extinct'. Traditions of Kalevalaic poetry, and the associated institution of the \"tietäjä\", were aggressively opposed in Lutheran early modern Sweden (which included modern Finland), but became integrated into Russian Orthodox culture in Karelia and Ingria, partly assimilating to and partly thriving alongside Christian culture. Remnants of the \"tietäjä\" tradition also persisted among the Forest Finns as late as the twentieth century.\n\nThe history of the institution before the eighteenth century is obscure. The current scholarly consensus, based on comparative anthropological and linguistic evidence, is that Finnic-speaking cultures once shared in a wider central and northern Eurasian tradition of shamanism, most distinctively characterised by ritual specialists being believed to leave their bodies in spirit form. Such people were, in the Proto-Uralic language, probably denoted with the word *\"nojta\" (cf. Finnish \"noita\" 'witch' and Sámi \"noaidi\"). However, while \"tietäjä\" traditions clearly have important characteristics in common with shamanism, \"tietäjät\" were not believed to leave their bodies; their supernatural power arose rather from their command of memorised incantations and rituals. It is thought that these aspects of the tradition, and so the institution of the \"tietäjä\" as we know it, arose from contact with Germanic-speaking cultures, which exerted huge linguistic influence on Proto-Finnic language, and on other aspects of Finnic culture, in the first millennia BCE and CE. This is not to say that the \"tietäjä\"-institution was identical to its Germanic models, nor that it did not then change over time. Further influences, for example, came from later contact with Christianity.\n\n\"Tietäjät\" also appear in Finnish mythology, the most famous mythological \"tietäjä\" being Väinämöinen, 'the mythic founder of the institution', who 'provided an identity\nmodel for its practitioners'. In Kalevalaic poetry, he is routinely referred to using the formulaic epithets \"vaka vanha Väinämöinen, | tietäjä ijän ikuinen\" ('trusty old Väinämöinen, | the soothsayer old as time').\n\n"}

The custom of tying rainbow-colored bands on wrists, which are worn for ten days and then thrown into a stream, is also a way to rejoice for children.\n\nTirgan is an ancient Iranian tradition which is still celebrated in various regions of Iran, including Mazenderan, Khorasan, and Arak. It is widely attested by historians such as Gardezi, Biruni, and Masudi, as well as European travelers during the Safavid era. \nThe celebration is dedicated to Tishtrya, an archangel who appeared in the sky to generate thunder and lightning for much needed rain.\n\nLegend says that Arash the Archer was a man chosen to settle a land dispute between the leaders of the lands Iran and Turan. Arash was to loose his arrow, on the 13th day of Tir, and where the arrow landed, would lie the border between the two kingdoms. Turan had suffered from the lack of rain, and Iran rejoiced at the settlement of the borders, then rain poured onto the two countries and there was peace between them.\n\nIt is stated in Biruni's chronology that \"by the order of God, the wind bore the arrow away from the mountains of Ruyan and brought the utmost frontier of Khorasan between Fergana and Tapuria.\" Gardizi has given a similar description, although he notes that \"the arrow of Arash fell in the area between Fargana and Bactria.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4990906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4990906", "title": "Wilderness Grace", "text": "Wilderness Grace\n\nThe Wilderness Grace, also known as the \"Worth Ranch Grace\" and the \"Philmont Grace\", is the common name of a simple prayer recited before meals at many Boy Scout camps around the United States. The original version, the \"Worth Ranch Grace\", was written in 1929 by A. J. \"Jerry\" Fulkerson, Camp Director at Worth Ranch Scout Camp in Palo Pinto County, Texas, part of the Longhorn Council in the Fort Worth Area. Fulkerson was also the Scout executive of the Fort Worth Area Council, Boy Scouts of America.\n\nThe Wilderness Grace in its most commonly used form is as follows:\n<poem>For food, for raiment,\nFor life, for opportunities,\nFor friendship and fellowship,\nWe thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.</poem>\n\nThe version of the Worth Ranch Grace that most Worth Ranch Scouts are familiar with is:\n\n<poem>For food, for raiment,\nFor life, for opportunities\nFor friends and this fellowship,\nWe thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.</poem>\n\nNote that in the present version of The Worth Ranch Grace that the third line is different from \"The Wilderness Grace\" and refers to \"this fellowship\" which is a reference to the \"Worth Ranch fellowship\" which is a line in The Worth Ranch Song, written by Faust Nobles.\n\nThe current version of The Worth Ranch Grace is slightly different from the original version:\n\n<poem>For food and for raiment,\nFor life and for opportunity,\nFor friends and this fellowship,\nWe thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.</poem>\n\nNote that the first two lines are different from either the contemporary version or the \"Wilderness\" version. This original version is copied here verbatim from a handwritten copy of The Worth Ranch Grace written on a small piece of note paper by James P. Fitch, Region Nine Scout Executive, during a trip to Worth Ranch in the 1930s. Fitch was later General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch and Phillips Properties of the Boy Scouts of America. At the top of the paper, also written in Fitch's handwriting, is the title \"The Worth Ranch Grace.\" Fitch kept this filed away in his copy of the small book \"Songs Scouts Sing,\" (Sept. 1935 printing). This is probably the earliest surviving written copy of \"The Worth Ranch Grace.\"\n\nJames P. Fitch was Region Scout Executive for Region Nine (Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico) from 1920 to 1945 when he became General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch, Cimarron, New Mexico, and Phillips Properties for the B.S.A. Fitch was the man who encouraged Waite Phillips generosity to Region Nine throughout the 1930s, and accepted the gift of Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp in 1938, and later the larger gift of land in December 1941 that became Philmont Scout Ranch. If it were not for Jim Fitch's interest in recording The Worth Ranch Grace as it was used in the 1930s, we would not have this earliest version.\n\nThe origin of The Worth Ranch Grace was corroborated by Minor S. Huffman, Sr., the first General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch in his book \"High Adventure Among the Magic Mountains: Philmont, the First 50 Years\". In that book, Huffman wrote, \"Worth Ranch was definitely the earliest camp to use the Grace.\" Huffman recalls hearing The Worth Ranch Grace on a visit to Worth Ranch in 1930 with Dr. James E. West (Scouting), Chief Scout Executive from 1911 to 1943; James P. Fitch, Region Scout Executive; and Frank Wozencraft, Region Chairman of Region Nine. (This may have been the visit by Fitch when he made his handwritten copy of \"The Worth Ranch Grace.\") This visit in 1930 was the occasion of the official dedication of Worth Ranch, although the Ranch had been in operation for over a year. That dedication ceremony is recorded on film, and may be the only visit to the Ranch by the renowned Dr. West.\n\nIn his book, Huffman recalled that at the time of their 1930 visit to Worth Ranch they thought The Worth Ranch Grace was written by Faust Nobles, a member of the Worth Ranch Camp Staff during its first decade, and a Field Scout Executive of the Council. Nobles was well known for his talent at writing verse, both in poetry and in song. But in the Spring of 1980, prior to the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Worth Ranch, Nobles denied writing The Worth Ranch Grace and identified Jerry Fulkerson as its author. Nobles also served as head Scout Executive of the Cimarron Valley Council. Nobles also wrote \"The Worth Ranch Song,\" and, in 1947, wrote a poem titled \"Novitiate\" about Philmont Scout Ranch.\n\nAnother piece in the puzzle was filled in by Minor Huffman when he confirmed that The Worth Ranch Grace was brought to Philmont in the Summer of 1943 by Clarence E. Dunn, a Worth Ranch Scouter and a Scoutmaster from the Fort Worth Area Council. Dunn, a school teacher, became a member of the Philmont Staff in the summer of 1945 with the position of Personnel Director. Dunn developed the Ranger Program and held the position of Chief Ranger for 26 years until his retirement at the end of the 1970 season. If it were not for Clarence Dunn, The Worth Ranch Grace would have never been introduced to thousands of Philmont Scouts from every part of the world over the past decades. Dunn was later honored by having an elementary school in Arlington, Texas, named for him.\n\nBecause of its continued use at Philmont Scout Ranch since the 1940s, The Worth Ranch Grace has been carried home to every corner of the U.S. where it has become widely known by two different names: \"The Wilderness Grace\" and \"The Philmont Grace.\"\n\nThe Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, have modified and added to the Wilderness Grace for use in its canoeing programs:\n\n<poem>For food, for raiment,\nFor life and opportunity,\nFor sun and rain,\nFor water and portage trails,\nFor friendship and fellowship,\nWe thank Thee, Oh Lord. Amen.</poem>\n\nNorthern Tier staff claim the Grace originated with them 90 years ago and that Philmont adopted and adapted by dropping the third line, as there's little water and no portage trails in New Mexico.\n\nThe Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve has also modified the Wilderness Grace for use in its high adventure/Jamboree programs:\n\n<poem>For this time and this place,\nFor Your goodness and grace,\nFor each friend we embrace,\nWe thank Thee, Oh Lord. Amen.</poem>\n\n\nThe history of the Worth Ranch Grace is also covered in a book by Maurice G. Lambert, \"Memories Of Worth Ranch.\" Memorbiliacs Press, 2006.\n"}
{"id": "27755380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27755380", "title": "Yihewani", "text": "Yihewani\n\nYihewani (), or Ikhwan (), (also known as Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, which means Muslim Brotherhood, not to be confused with the Middle Eastern Muslim Brotherhood) is an Islamic sect in China. Its adherents are called Sunnaiti. It is of the Hanafi school, one of the six major schools of Islam. It is also referred to as \"new sect\" \" or \"Latest sect\". Ikhwan (Yihewani), together with Qadim (Gedimu) and Xidaotang, are the three major sects of Islam in China. The Yihewani sect was labeled as the new teaching (xinjiao). In 1937 it divided into two groups.\n\nIt was the end of the 19th century when the Dongxiang imam Ma Wanfu (1849–1934) from the village of Guoyuan in Hezhou (now the Dongxiang Autonomous County was founded in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province) - who had studied in Mecca and was influenced by the Salafi movement. After his return to Gansu, he founded the movement with the ten major Ahong. He claimed that rites and ceremonies not standing in line with the Quran and the Hadith should be abolished. He campaigned against grave and Murshid (leader / teacher) worship and advocated against preaching and dawah in Chinese.\n\nThe follower of the sect radically opposed Qadeem's tradition which was influenced by Chinese culture.They put emphasis on the principle of \"following the book and eliminating customs\". Though the founder of the movement was inspired by the salafi movement, this reform movement, unlike that of the Wahhabis, did not oppose Sufism, but rather rejected the excessive veneration to Sufi masters and to their graves.They strictly follow Hanafi school of fiqh and emphasize the Ash'ari and Maturidi creeds.\n\nIn the Dungan Revolt (1895) the Yihewani backed the rebels against the Qing dynasty. However, the Muslim rebels were crushed by loyalist Muslims.\n\nThe Khafiya Sufi General Ma Anliang, especially hated the Yihewani leader Ma Wanfu, so much that when the Han general Yang Zengxin captured Ma Wanfu, Ma Anliang arranged to have him shipped to Gansu so he could execute him. As Qing authority broke down in China, the Gedimu Sunnis and Khafiya Sufis went on a vicious campaign to murder Ma Wanfu and stamp out his Wahhabi inspired teachings. The leaders of menhuans attacked Ma Wanfu, and the Gedimu requested that the Qing governor in Lanzhou inflict punishment upon Ma Wanfu.\n\nEventually, under Imams like Hu Songshan, the Yihewani was transformed from an anti assimilationist, fundamentalist brotherhood, into a modernist, Chinese nationalist sect which was supported by the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang party, promoting modern secular education and nationalism.\n\nThe Yihewani was then backed by the Ma Clique Muslim warlords, who were members of the Chinese National People's Party (Kuomintang), which espoused Chinese nationalism, and the Three Principles of the People. It was favored over the major Sufi menhuans such as the Sufi Jahriyya, Sufi Khafiya. The Salafis were crushed by the Yihewani during this period.\n\nThe Yihewani was patronized and backed by Ma Lin (warlord) and Ma Bufang to help modernize society, education, and reform old traditions. Menhuan members such as Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Fuxiang supported the Yihewani after they saw it being patronized by Ma Qi.\n\nYihewani Imams reacted with hostility to Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing, who attempted to introduce Salafism as the main form of Islam. They were branded as traitors, and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. Ma Debao established a Salafi order, called the Sailaifengye (Salafi) menhuan in Lanzhou and Linxia, and it is a completely separate sect than other Muslim sects in China.\n\nSalafis have a reputation for radicalism among the Hanafi Sunni Gedimu and Yihewani. Sunni Muslim Hui avoid Salafis, even if they are family members, and they constantly fight.\n\nThe Kuomintang Sufi Muslim General Ma Bufang, who backed the Yihewani, persecuted the Salafi. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become modernist and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be \"Heterodox\" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.\n\nThe Communist party has continued the policy of patronizing and supporting the Yihewani over all other sects among the Hui.\n\nThe Uyghur militant organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine \"Islamic Turkistan\" has accused the Chinese \"Muslim Brotherhood\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \"infidel Chinese\" language is the language of the Hui.\n\n\n\n"}

The dates of Zhu Faya's life are unknown, but he was a student of the Indian monk Fotudeng or Zhu Fotudeng 竺佛圖澄 (c. 231-349), and a contemporary of the translators Dao'an 道安 (312-385) and Zhu Fatai 竺法汰 (320-387).\n\nThe Chinese name Zhu Faya combines two Buddhist terms. The Chinese surname Zhu 竺, which originally meant \"a kind of bamboo\" and was later used for \"India (abbreviating Tianzhu 天竺)\" and \"Buddhism\", was adopted by many early Buddhist monks, such as the polyglot translator Zhu Fahu 竺法護 or Dharmarakṣa (c. 230-316). Zhu Faya took this surname in honor of his teacher Zhu Fotudeng, as did several other disciples such as Zhu Fatai (above) and Zhu Senglang 竺僧郎 , who in 351 founded the first Buddhist monastery in Shandong. The Buddhist Dharma name (rather than Chinese given name) of \"Faya\" means \"Dharmic Elegance\", with the Fa \"law; Dharma\" seen in Fatai and Fahu. The toponymic name Zhu Faya of Zhongshan 中山 (100 km west of Hejian) occurs in the (6th century) \"Memoirs of Eminent Monks\" biography of Fotudeng (tr. Wright 1948:367), which describes famous monks who travelled great distances to hear Fotudeng's discourses.\n\nThe primary source for information about Zhu Faya is his \"Memoirs of Eminent Monks\" biography. \nGaoyi 高邑 is in southwestern Hebei province. Shi Xuan 石宣 was the son of Empress Du.\n\nThe American sinologist Arthur F. Wright characterizes Zhu Faya.\nCHU Fa-ya 竺法雅 was a Chinese monk who, like several of Teng's disciples, took the surname CHU out of respect for his master. Though he was a northerner, his contribution was to the development of the intellectual Buddhism of the south. He was a careful student of both Buddhism and Taoism. Far more earnest than most of the courtier monks of the south, he was dissatisfied with superficial resemblances between Taoist and Buddhist terms and concepts and sought to clarify and regularize the use of Taoist terms in Buddhist exegesis. He called his system \"ko-i\". In the end it contributed to the understanding of Buddhism among educated Chinese and was a step forward in the long process of the Sinicization of Buddhism. (Wright 1948:327-328) \n\nTsukamoto Zenryū 塚本善隆's Japanese-language history of early Chinese Buddhism used Zhu Faya to typify the \"homilist-exegete\" (tr. Hurvitz 1969:770) among Fotudeng's disciples.\n[W]hether accurately or not, Fa-ya is credited with the invention of \"ko i\", a method of interpreting the Buddhist scriptures by appeal to alleged analogues in Chinese secular literature, specifically the I-Lao-Chuang circuit. As indicated above, there was nothing revolutionary in this, for the Taoistically inclined Chinese who found himself receptive to Buddhism automatically assumed that the two gospels were identical. Reading only Chinese, he had no way of knowing what underlay the scriptures familiar to him, and in all likelihood he did not care anyway. \"Ko i\" is significant in that it is an explicit statement to the effect that textual and doctrinal difficulties are properly solved by scrutinizing Taoist analogues. It is also worthy of anticipation that Tao-an, fellow-disciple to Fa-ya, rejected \"ko i\" out of hand—or so he thought. For the Chinese Buddhist monks who read no Sanskrit—hence for the majority of the Chinese saṃgha—\"ko i\" was in China to stay. (tr. Hurvitz 1969:770) \n\n"}
{"id": "321931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321931", "title": "Śruti", "text": "Śruti\n\nShruti or Shruthi (; ; : ) in Sanskrit means \"that which is heard\" and refers to the body of most authoritative, ancient religious texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism. It includes the four Vedas including its four types of embedded texts—the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads.\n\n\"Śruti\"s have been variously described as a revelation through \"anubhava\" (direct experience), or of primordial origins realized by ancient Rishis. In Hindu tradition, they have been referred to as \"apauruṣeya\" (authorless). The \"Śruti\" texts themselves assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot.\n\nAll six orthodox schools of Hinduism accept the authority of \"śruti\", but many scholars in these schools denied that the \"śruti\"s are divine. \"Nāstika\" (heterodox) philosophies such as the \"Cārvāka\"s did not accept the authority of the \"śruti\"s and considered them to be flawed human works.\n\nShruti (\"Śruti\") differs from other sources of Hindu philosophy, particularly \"smṛti\" “which is remembered” or textual material. These works span much of the history of Hinduism, beginning with the earliest known texts and ending in the early historical period with the later Upanishads. Of the \"śruti\"s, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and the central ideas of the Upanishadic \"śruti\"s are at the spiritual core of Hindus.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"\" (; : ) has multiple meanings depending on context. It means \"hearing, listening\", a call to \"listen to a speech\", any form of communication that is aggregate of sounds (news, report, rumor, noise, hearsay). The word is also found in ancient geometry texts of India, where it means \"the diagonal of a tetragon or hypotenuse of a triangle\", and is a synonym of \"karna\". The word \"śruti\" is also found in ancient Indian music literature, where it means \"a particular division of the octave, a quarter tone or interval\" out of twenty-two enumerated major tones, minor tones, and semitones. In music, it refers the smallest measure of sound a human being can detect, and the set of twenty-two \"śruti\" and forty four \"half Shruti\", stretching from about 250 Hz to 500 Hz, is called the \"Shruti octave\".\n\nIn scholarly works on Hinduism, \"śruti\" refers to ancient Vedic texts from India. Monier-Williams traces the contextual history of this meaning of \"śruti\" as, \"which has been heard or communicated from the beginning, sacred knowledge that was only heard and verbally transmitted from generation to generation, the Veda, from earliest Rishis (sages) in Vedic tradition. In scholarly literature, \"Śruti\" is also spelled as Shruti.\n\nSmriti literally \"that which is remembered,\" refers to a body of Hindu texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down but constantly revised, in contrast to Śrutis (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed. \"Smriti\" is a derivative secondary work and is considered less authoritative than \"Sruti\" in Hinduism. \"Sruti\" are fixed and its originals preserved better, while each Smriti text exists in many versions, with many different readings. Smritis were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone in ancient and medieval Hindu tradition.\n\nBoth śrutis and smṛtis represent categories of texts of different traditions of Hindu philosophy. According to Gokul Narang, the Sruti are asserted to be of divine origin in the mythologies of the Puranas. In contrast, states Roy Perrett, ancient and medieval Hindu philosophers have denied that śruti are divine, authored by God.\n\nThe Mīmāṃsā tradition, famous in Hindu tradition for its Sruti exegetical contributions, radically critiqued the notion and any relevance for concepts such as \"author\", the \"sacred text\" or divine origins of Sruti; the Mimamsa school claimed that the relevant question is the meaning of the Sruti, values appropriate for human beings in it, and the commitment to it.\n\nNāstika philosophical schools such as the Cārvākas of the first millennium BCE did not accept the authority of the śrutis and considered them to be human works suffering from incoherent rhapsodies, inconsistencies and tautologies.\n\nSmṛtis are considered to be human thoughts in response to the śrutis. Traditionally, all smṛtis are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by śrutis.\n\nThe śruti literature include the four Vedas:\n\n\nEach of these Vedas include the following texts, and these belong to the śruti canon:\n\n\nThe literature of the shakhas, or schools, further amplified the material associated with each of the four core traditions.\n\nOf the above śrutis, the Upanishads are most widely known, and the central ideas of them are the spiritual foundation of Hinduism. Patrick Olivelle writes,\nShrutis have been considered the authority in Hinduism. Smṛtis, including the \"Manusmṛti\", the \"Nāradasmṛti\" and the \"Parāśarasmṛti\", are considered less authoritative than śrutis.\nOnly three of the four types of texts in the Vedas have behavioral precepts:\nBilimoria states the role of śruti in Hinduism has been inspired by \"the belief in a higher natural cosmic order (\"Rta\" succeeded later by the concept \"Dharma\") that regulates the universe and provides the basis for its growth, flourishing and sustenance – be that of the gods, human beings, animals and eco-formations\".\n\nLevinson states that the role of śruti and smṛti in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that \"the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad\". The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of dharma, states Levinson, which include \"atmanastushti\" (satisfaction of one's conscience), \"sadacara\" (local norms of virtuous individuals), smṛti and śruti.\n\nThe śrutis, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE, had not been committed to writing in ancient times. These were developed and transmitted verbally, from one generation to the next, for nearly two millenniums. Almost all printed editions available in the modern era are copied manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years. Michael Witzel explains this oral tradition as follows:\n\nAncient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of śrutis. Many forms of recitation or \"pathas\" were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the \"Vedas\" and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the Principal Upanishads, as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:\n\nThese extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound. That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the \"\" (ca. 1500 BCE).\n\nThis part of a Vedic student's education was called svādhyāya. The systematic method of learning, memorization and practice, enabled these texts to be transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.\n\nMax Müller in an 1865 lecture stated:\n\n\n"}
