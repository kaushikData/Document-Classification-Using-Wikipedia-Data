Campbell was popular in Historicist circles because of his Reformed theology in the identification of the Papacy as the Antichrist of Biblical prophecy.\n\nAlan Campbell was born in Belfast on 7 August 1949 into a staunchly Presbyterian home, in a Roman Catholic area. His grandmother was a very firm adherent of the doctrine of British Israelism, and thus he was exposed to this teaching from a very early age. Despite his upbringing, however, he did not convert to Christianity until 19 September 1965, in the Ravenhill Free Presbyterian Church after listening to a sermon by Ian Paisley.\n\nBecause of his \"Kingdom Identity\" views (which hold that Israel, not the church, is the bride of Christ, in contradiction to the teachings of the Westminster Confession of Faith) and his acceptance of Pentecostal beliefs, Campbell left the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and no longer promoted Ian Paisley and his literature.\n\nCampbell began preaching in May 1974, and preached his first sermon on Bible prophecy on 24 September 1978. He was officially ordained to the ministry by Dr Francis Thomas on 18 July 1988. He graduated from the University of London with a bachelor's degree in history, and from the Queen's University of Belfast with a Certificate in Biblical Studies. He held the post of head of religious studies at Newtownabbey Community High School near Belfast where he was subject to at least one Ministry of Education inspection because of concerns about his teaching methods. He held fiercely anti-Catholic views (referring to Catholics as worshipping a \"wafer God\") and used his website to disseminate these sentiments. He was the author of a number of Bible study books, and lectured throughout the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia although his ministry centred in Ulster, and many of his messages dealt with the political situation there. Campbell had contact with the Christian Assemblies International. \n\nCampbell opposed miscegenation. In a lecture in the USA, he stated that the white race is superior and that black people are the \"beasts of the field\" referred to in the Bible.\nHe supported apartheid in South Africa, was critical of Unionist politicians meeting Nelson Mandela and called Desmond Tutu a 'little black man'.\n\nThe Sunday Life reported in December 2013, that Campbell's church had closed. Speaking to Sunday Life about the closure, Campbell said he had been seriously ill earlier that year.\n"}

It was founded by Dattopant Thengadi on 23 July 1955.\n\nThe BMS itself claims to have more than 10 million members. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, the BMS had a membership of 6,215,797 in 2002. The BMS is not affiliated to any International Trade Union Confederation. It is the labour wing of RSS. \n\nBMS was founded on 23 July 1955 – the day being the birth anniversary of Lok Manya Bal Gangadhar Tilak – veteran of Freedom Movement. Two important aspects stand out in connection with this:\n(a) \nFormation of BMS was not the result of split in the existing trade union organisations, unlike in the case of almost all other trade unions. Hence it had the formidable responsibility of building its organisational structure from the grass root level. It started from zero having no trade union, no membership, no activist (karyakarta), no office and no fund.\n(b) \nOn the very first day it was visualised as a trade union whose base-sheet anchors – would be Nationalism, would work as a genuine trade union, keeping itself scrupulously away from party politics. This was also unlike other trade unions which were linked to one or the other political party, overtly or otherwise.\n\nThe aims and objectives of BMS are:\n(a) \nTo establish ultimately the Bharatiya order of society in which they shall be secured among other things:\ni. Complete utilisation of manpower and resources leading to full employment and maximum production.\nii. Replacement of profit motive by service motive and establishment of economic democracy resulting in equitable distribution of wealth to the best advantage of all individual citizens and of the national as a whole.\niii. Development of autonomous industrial communities forming part and parcel of the nation, culminating in ‘Labourisation of industry’\niv. Provision of work with living wage to every individual through maximum industrialisation of the nation.\n(b) \nWith a view to enable the workers to strive successfully for the ultimate realisation of the above objects and to strengthen them, in the meanwhile, to make their own contribution to the cause of protecting and promoting their interest consistent with those of the community:\nv. \nTo assist workers in organising themselves in trade unions as a medium of service to the motherland irrespective of faiths and political affinities.\nvi. \nTo guide, direct, supervise and coordinate the activities of the affiliated unions.\nvii. \nTo assist the affiliated unions in the formation of state BMS units and Industrial Federations as constituent units of the BMS and\nviii. \nTo bring about unity in the trade union movement.\n(c) To secure and preserve work for the workers:\nix. \nThe right to work, the right for security of service and for social security, the right to conduct trade union activities and the right to strike as a last resort after having exhausted other legitimate methods of trade unionism for redressal of grievances.\nx. \nImprovement in conditions of work, life and social and industrial status.\nxi. \nA living wage consistent with a national minimum and due share in the profits in their respective industries as partners.\nxii. \nOther appropriate amenities\nxiii. \nExpeditious enforcement and appropriate amendment of existing labour legislation in their interest and\nxiv. \nEnactment of new labour laws from time to time in consultation with the labour representatives.\n(d) \nTo inculcate in the minds of the workers the spirit of service, cooperation and dutifulness and develop in them a sense of responsibility towards the nation in general and industry in particular\n(e) \nTo educate the labour by organising worker’s training classes, study circles, guest lectures, seminars, symposia, excursions etc., in cooperation with institutions and organisations having similar aims and objects such as the Central Board of Workers Education. Labour Research Centre, Universities etc., and also to maintain libraries.\n(f) \nTo publish or cause publication of journals, periodicals, pamphlets, pictures, books and many other types of literature mainly concerning labour and their interests and to purchase, sell & circulate them.\n(g) \nTo establish, encourage and organise Labour Research Centres and similar activities.\n(h) \nGenerally to take such other steps as may be necessary to ameliorate the social, economic, cultural, civic and general conditions of the workers. For sound health of workers and society BMS has been against the use of any type of drugs, liquor, alcohol and smoking.\n(i) \nTo render assistance or to establish cooperative societies, welfare institutions, clubs etc., for the overall welfare of the common man in general and the workers and their families in particular.\n\nIndia has a heritage of thousands of year where the dignity of labour as well as those of labourers was well established. The dire need of the hour is to re-establish the same - the Dignity of Labour by observing our own labour day. As also, most of the Nations have their National Labour Day. National Labour Day was rediscovered to be on Vishwakarma Jayanti, Vishwakarma, being the first craftsman – artisan, sculptor, and engineer - and in fact the traditional symbol of hard labour. This falls on Kanya Sankranti of each year. BMS, since its inception, has been observing Vishwakarma Jayanti – on 17 September of English Calendar Year as National Labour Day.\nWhile functioning since 1955 it has given to the labour movement new slogans benefiting its ideology:\n\nBMS has contributed quite a few new ideas which have virtually become trend setters.\n\nThe non-political nature of BMS has now gained currency and has become acceptable not only in India but also abroad. The XII World Trade Union Congress of WFTU, held in Moscow, in 1990, adopted a document to this effect.\nBMS doesn't believe in class concept and rejects the class theory propounded by Marx. Instead its struggle and fight is against the injustice on workers from whatever quarters.\nBeing non-political, its attitude towards any democratically elected government is governed by the principle of \"Responsive Co-operation\".\nBMS idea of \"Labourisation\" of Industries – a stage where workers would collectively own and manage the industrial units has initiated a national debate on it. This experiment has been successfully undertaken in New Central Jute Mills, West Bengal.\n\nWhile opposing the above policies BMS was first to give slogan for 2nd war of economic independence. At the same time it has suggested some positive alternatives. It has vigorously condemned the abject surrender to the conditionality of the IMF and WB as that would amount to giving up our sovereignty. BMS considers the movement as an opportunity to build up Swadeshi Model of Economy. Hence it has inspired movement for the use of Swadeshi (Indigenous) Products as against the foreign or MNC products.\nIt has offered to cooperate in turning the loss making PSUs profitable where practicable, it has agreed to induce the workers to take up their unit to run them on sound lines.\nTo curb excessive profiteering, which is the main culprit behind price rise; it has suggested that the Government should take steps to make the consumer aware of the cost of production of each product to daily use. This awareness will serve as a watch dog to restrain the prices.\nBMS is also of the view that for creating enough job opportunities, agricultural development should get more attention as also agro-based and small and tiny industries. Vishwakarma Sector (Self-employment sector) should get more encouragement than at present.\nOn modern technology, BMS while not being antagonistic would prefer developing our own technology based on indigenous and traditional knowledge to best suit our conditions. From this angle national technology policy should be drawn.\n\nBeing one of the most representative organisations of Labour, BMS has a place in the Indian delegation to the annual International Labour Conference held by ILO at GENEVA every year.\nBeing largest Central Trade Union Organisation of India, BMS is leading the Indian Labour delegation to ILO, Geneva each year on behalf of Indian workforce.\nSpecial Session of United Nations Organisation was held on 5–9 June 2000 in New York on \"Women 2000, Gender Equality, Development and Peace for 21st Century\". Kum. Suchitra Mahapatra of BMS participated on behalf of Indian Women workforce.\nIt works in close relations with the ILO office in Delhi, participating in all its national and regional level seminars / workshops, its endeavour being to contribute its best.\nBMS is not affiliated with any International Confederation but maintains cordial relation with all such organisations.\nInstead of giving call for the workers of the world to unite, it has given a call to the workers all over, to unite the world.\n\n\n"}

During the expedition later that year, he sent back correspondence to Heinrich Himmler complaining that the Icelandic people had abandoned traditional crafts such as forging, wood-carving, spinning, weaving and dyeing; and that they had also forgotten their traditional myths and legends, thus losing belief in the ‘transcendent nature’ that the Ahnenerbe held dearly to. The mission was eventually aborted, citing uncooperative Icelandic government officials who restricted access to certain locations.\n\nWhile Schweizer's tight commitment to Germanic racism is disputable, his linguistic works are fully acknowledged and appreciated by former and present linguists.\n\nSCHWEIZER, BRUNO (2008): \"Zimbrische Gesamtgrammatik.

Although the inherently introspective nature of Buddhism does not encourage census, adherents to these traditions are usually outspoken and supported by perhaps an even greater, though hidden number of sympathisers. Temples, centres and groups are common in the metropolitan areas and the country is thought to comprise the largest Buddhist community in Africa.\n\nApart from various Buddhist groups brought to the Cape Colony from Southeast Asia during the 1680s, and the many indentured labourers brought to Natal from India during the latter part of the 19th century (some of whom were Buddhist, and some of whom were Hindu who later converted to Buddhism once in South Africa), most Buddhists in South Africa are converts, and not Asian. Various Buddhist groups grew up in the major cities from the 1970s, and there has been a proliferation of distinct Buddhist traditions since the mid-1980s. These include Theravada, Zen, Nichiren and Tibetan schools. \nSister Palmo (Freda Bedi) was instrumental in establishing the Karma Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism in South Africa when she visited in 1972. At the behest of the 16th Karmapa, Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche set up Samye Dzong Dharma centres in the major South African cities, which are thriving today under guidance of the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Drodul Trinley Dorje. \nThe Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order has erected Nan Hua Temple, the largest Buddhist temple and monastery in Africa, in the town of Bronkhorstspruit near Pretoria. Another notable Buddhist centre in the country is the Buddhist Retreat Centre in Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal. The Nichiren Buddhist lay group Soka Gakkai International has a community centre in Parkwood, Johannesburg. Derivatives of Korean Zen have been established in the Western Cape. The Vipassana Association of South Africa founded by S.N. Goenka has been holding meditation retreats in the Western Cape. More recent additions to the collection of schools include Shambala originally conceived by Chögyam Trungpa, Diamond Way Buddhism, a multicultural Lay Buddhist tradition under the guidance of H.H. 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje and the New Kadampa tradition founded by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.\n\nA 2003 study estimated that in the late 1990s there were a total of 6,000 Buddhists in South Africa (3,000 of whom had Asian ancestry) out of a total population of 42 million (or 0.01% of the total population). And according to the 2010s estimates, the Buddhist adherents (may included Taoism and Chinese Folk Religion) is increasing to between 0.2% 0.3% of the South African population, or between 100 and 150 thousand people while the number of practising Buddhists maybe low.\n\nBuddhist leaders often visit the country to bestow teachings and blessings. The Dalai Lama attended the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1999, and again in 2004, but was denied a visa when he was asked to attend an international peace conference in March 2009. As well when he was invited to South Africa for Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday party on 7 October 2011.\n\nThe 14th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates was scheduled to take place in Cape Town, South Africa in 2014, but for the third time, the Dai Lai Lama had been refused a Visa. The summit was cancelled shortly afterwards when several other Nobel peace laureates cancelled their tickets in protest. The 14th peace summit was eventually relocated to Rome, Italy in December 2014.\n\nThe South African foreign ministry denied that it had rejected the Dalai Lama's visa application, saying instead that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip, although it is very likely that relations with China was the main reason for the VISA being denied.\nThis is evident by two facts.\nFirstly, visas have been denied to the Dai Lai Lama before, and in almost every case the destination country had strong ties with China, and it has been claimed that China asked those governments not to accommodate the Nobel peace laureate. Also, in February 2014, the Chinese government reacted in anger as US President Barack Obama ignored their request to not meet with the exiled Tibetan leader.\nSecondly, at the time of the third refusal, the top spokesperson for international relations, Clayson Monyela, could not comment on the matter since he was in China on business.\n\nFollowing the scandal, the Chinese government praised South Africa for their refusal of the visa, and international relations department spokesperson Clayson Monyela's final comment on the issue was that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip to South Africa and (that) his visa application was a closed matter.\n\nThe Dalai Lama later confirmed the media reports when he publicly denounced the South African government during a speech he made in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala. He is quoted as saying, \"The Nobel peace summit scheduled to be held in South Africa to honour the legacy of our fellow laureate, the late Nelson Mandela, has been cancelled as the South African government wouldn't allow me to attend it. This is sort of bullying a simple person.\" At the 14th Summit, fellow laureate, Jody Williams also publicly denounced President Jacob Zuma's government, accusing them of \"(selling) their soul and their sovereignty to China\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "203688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203688", "title": "Canonical hours", "text": "Canonical hours\n\nIn the practice of Christianity, canonical hours mark the divisions of the day in terms of periods of fixed prayer at regular intervals. A book of hours normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.\n\nThe practice of daily prayers grew from the Jewish practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as \"zmanim\": for example, in the \"Acts of the Apostles\", Saint Peter and John the Evangelist visit the Temple in Jerusalem for the afternoon prayers. Psalm 119:164 states: \"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws\" (of this, Symeon of Thessalonica writes that \"the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit\").\n\nThis practice is believed to have been passed down through the centuries from the Apostles, with different practices developing in different places. As Christian monasticism spread, the practice of specified hours and liturgical formats began to develop and become standardized. Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk Sabbas the Sanctified began the process of recording the liturgical practices around Jerusalem, while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner.\n\nIn 525, Benedict of Nursia set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office.\n\nThe two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the 8th century, to yield an office of great complexity.\n\nThe Cluniac Reforms of the 11th century renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the Order of Saint Benedict, with Cluny Abbey at their head.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, canonical hours are also called \"offices\", since they refer to the official set of prayers of the Church, which is known variously as the \"officium divinum\" (\"divine service\" or \"divine duty\"), and the \"opus Dei\" (\"work of God\"). The current official version of the hours in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church is called the Liturgy of the Hours (Latin: \"liturgia horarum\") in North America or divine office in Ireland and Britain.\n\nIn Anglicanism, they are often known as the daily or divine office, to distinguish them from the other 'offices' of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.).\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches, the canonical hours may be referred to as the divine services, and the \"book of hours\" is called the \"horologion\" (). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale. The usage in Oriental Orthodoxy, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Eastern Catholic counterparts all differ from each other and from other rites.\n\nAlready well-established by the 9th century in the West, these canonical offices consisted of eight daily prayer events, including lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline, as well as the night office, sometimes referred to as vigils, consisting of a number of sections called 'nocturnes'. Building on the recitation of psalms and canticles from scripture, the Church has added (and, at times, subtracted) hymns, hagiographical readings, and other prayers.\n\nThe canonical hours stemmed from Jewish prayer. In the Old Testament, God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and evening (). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the Tabernacle to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. During the Babylonian captivity, when the Temple was no longer in use, the first synagogues were established, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of Torah readings, psalms, and hymns began to evolve. This \"sacrifice of praise\" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals.\n\nAfter the people returned to Judea, the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well. As time passed, the Jews began to be scattered across the Greco-Roman world in what is known as the Jewish diaspora. By the time of the Roman Empire, the Jews (and eventually early Christians) began to follow the Roman system of conducting the business day in scheduling their times for prayer. In Roman cities, the bell in the forum rang the beginning of the business day at about six o'clock in the morning (Prime, the \"first hour\"), noted the day's progress by striking again at about nine o'clock in the morning (Terce, the \"third hour\"), tolled for the lunch break at noon (Sext, the \"sixth hour\"), called the people back to work again at about three o'clock in the afternoon (Nones, the \"ninth hour\"), and rang the close of the business day at about six o'clock in the evening (the time for evening prayer).\n\nThe narrative of Jesus' crucifixion and death refers to the sixth and ninth hours:\nThe first miracle of the apostles, the healing of the crippled man on the temple steps, occurred because Saint Peter and John the Apostle went to the Temple to pray (). Also, one of the defining moments of the early Church, the decision to include Gentiles among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying at noontime ().\n\nAs Christianity began to separate from Judaism, the practice of praying at fixed times continued. The early church was known to pray the Psalms (), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the Didache, the oldest known liturgical manual for Christians, recommended disciples to pray the Lord's Prayer three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. Pliny the Younger (63 – c. 113), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: \"they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.\"\n\nBy the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours. The prayers could be prayed individually or in groups.\n\nAs the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the Christian monastic communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in monasteries. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).\n\nIn the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to Constantinople. In particular, Theodore the Studite (c. 758 – c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in Anatolia, and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see \"typikon\" for further details).\n\nIn the West, the Rule of Saint Benedict was modeled his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the basilicas of Rome. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum \"Ora et labora\" – \"Pray and work\". The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the \"Opus Dei\" or \"Work of God.\" The fixed-hour prayers came to be known as the \"Divine Office\" (office coming from the Latin word for duty).\n\nAs the Divine Office grew more important in the life of the Church, the rituals became more elaborate. Praying the Office already required various books, such as a Psalter for the psalms, a lectionary to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a Bible to proclaim the reading, a hymnal for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from cathedrals and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the breviary, which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used. The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where Pope Innocent III extended their use to the Roman Curia. The Franciscans sought a one-volume breviary for their friars to use during travels, so the order adopted the \"Breviarium Curiae\", but substituting the Gallican Rite Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, Pope Nicholas III adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.\n\nThe Council of Trent, in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope. On 9 July 1568, Pope Pius V, the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the Roman Breviary, with his Apostolic Constitution \"Quod a nobis\", imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his Roman Missal and using language very similar to that in the bull \"Quo primum\" with which he promulgated the Missal, regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions, the obligation to use the promulgated text in all places, and the total prohibition of adding or omitting anything, declaring in fact: \"No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.\"\n\nLater Popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. Pope Clement VIII made changes that he made obligatory on 10 May 1602, 34 years after Pius V's revision. Pope Urban VIII made further changes, including \"a profound alteration in the character of some of the hymns. Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour.\" For the profound revision of the book by Pope Pius X see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X.\n\nPope Pius XII also began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the Psalms and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, Pope John XXIII, made a further revision in 1960.\n\nFollowing the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church's Roman Rite simplified the observance of the canonical hours and sought to make them more suited to the needs of today's apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.\n\nThe Council itself abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week. In the succeeding revision, the character of Matins was changed to an Office of Readings so that it could be used at any time of the day as an office of Scriptural and hagiographical readings. Furthermore, the period over which the entire Psalter is recited has been expanded from one week to four. Since 1985, with the publication of the second typical edition of the Latin liturgical books, the Latin hymns of the Roman Office were once again restored to their pre-Urban revision.\n\nThe Roman breviary is now published under the title \"Liturgia Horarum\". A translation is published by Catholic Book Publishing Corp. under the title \"The Liturgy of the Hours\" in four volumes, arranged according to the liturgical seasons of the Church year.\n\nThe current liturgical books for the celebration of the Hours in Latin are those of the \" editio typica altera\" (second typical edition) promulgated in 1985. The official title is \"Officium Divinum, Liturgia Horarum iuxta Ritum Romanum, editio typica altera\".\n\nTwo English translations are in use.\n\n\"The Divine Office\" is translated by a commission set up by the Episcopal Conferences of England and Wales, Australia and Ireland. First published in 1974 by HarperCollins, this edition is the official English edition for use the above countries, as well as many Asian and African dioceses. This title comes complete in three volumes:\n\nThe psalms are taken from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scriptural readings and canticles are taken from various versions of the Bible, including the Revised Standard Version, the Jerusalem Bible, the Knox Bible, the Good News Bible, and the New English Bible.\n\nCollins also publishes shorter editions of The Divine Office:\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Collins republished \"The Divine Office\" and its various shorter editions with a new cover.\n\nCatholic Truth Society published Prayer During the Day in 2009.\n\nThe \"Liturgy of the Hours\" is translated by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL). First published in 1975 by Catholic Book Publishing Company in the US, this edition is the official English edition for use in the US, Canada and several other English-speaking dioceses. This title comes complete in four volumes in an arrangement identical to the original Latin typical edition.\n\nThe psalms are taken mainly from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scriptural readings and canticles are taken from the New American Bible.\n\nShorter editions of the Liturgy of the Hours are also available from various publishers: Christian Prayer (Daughters of St Paul and Catholic Book Publishing Company), Shorter Christian Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company only) and Daytime Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company). In 2007, Liturgy Training Publications released the new Mundelein Psalter, which provided the complete Morning, Evening and Night Prayers from ICEL's translation set to chant tones.\n\nBoth these editions are based on the Latin 1971 \"editio typica\".\n\nPriests are required by canon law to pray the entire Divine Office each day while permanent deacons are required to pray the morning and evening hours. All clerics are free to use the Liturgy of the Hours or the traditional Roman Breviary, according to the \"motu proprio\" Summorum Pontificum, to fulfill this obligation. The practice among religious communities varies according to their rules and constitutions. The Second Vatican Council also exhorted the Christian laity to take up the practice, and as a result, many lay people have begun reciting portions of the Liturgy of the Hours.\n\nThe modern Liturgy of the Hours usage focuses on three major hours and from two to four minor hours:\n\nThe major hours consist of the Office of Readings (formerly Matins), Morning (or Lauds) and Evening Prayer (or Vespers).\n\nThe Office of Readings consists of:\n\nThe character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Both follow the same format:\n\nThe daytime hours follow a simpler format:\n\nNight prayer has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life:\n\nIn each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons, and each concludes with the traditional Catholic doxology.\n\nIn addition to the distribution of almost the whole Psalter over a four-week cycle, the Church also provides appropriate hymns, readings, psalms, canticles and antiphons, for use in marking specific celebrations in the Roman Calendar, which sets out the order for the liturgical year. These selections are found in the 'Proper of Seasons' (for Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter), and the 'Proper of Saints' (for feast days of the Saints).\n\nBecause the Rite of Constantinople evolved as a synthesis of two distinct rites — cathedral rite of Constantinople called the \"asthmatiki akolouthia\" (\"sung services\") and the monastic typicon of the Holy Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified near Jerusalem — its offices are highly developed and quite complex.\n\nTwo main strata exist in the rite, those places that have inherited the traditions of the Russian Church which had been given only the monastic Sabbaite typicon which she uses to this day in parishes and cathedrals as well as in monasteries, and everywhere else where some remnant of the cathedral rite remained in use; therefore, the rite as practiced in monasteries everywhere resembles the Russian recension, while non-Russian non-monastic customs differs significantly. For example, in the Russian tradition, the \"all-night vigil\" is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (all though it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have Matins on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, Vespers and matins are rather less abridged but the Divine Liturgy commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.\n\nAlso, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.\n\nThe Horologion (; Church Slavonic: \"Chasoslov\", \"Часocлoвъ\"), or \"Book of Hours\", provides the fixed portions of the Daily Cycle of services (, ) as used by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nInto this fixed framework, numerous moveable parts of the service are inserted. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books:\n\nVarious cycles of the liturgical year influence the manner in which the materials from the liturgical books (above) are inserted into the daily services:\n\nEach day of the week has its own commemoration:\n\nMost of the texts come from the \"Octoechos\", which has a large collections of hymns for each weekday for each of the eight tones; during great lent and, to a lesser degree, the pre-lenten season, the \"Lenten Triodion\" supplements this with hymns for each day of the week for each week of that season, as does the \"Pentecostarion\" during the pascal season. Also, there are fixed texts for each day of the week are in the \"Horologion\" and \"Priest's Service Book\" (e.g., dismissals) and the Kathismata (selections from the \"Psalter\") are governed by the weekly cycle in conjunction with the season.\n\nCommemorations on the Fixed Cycle depend upon the day of the calendar year, and also, occasionally, specific days of the week that fall near specific calendar dates, e.g., the Sunday before the Exaltation of the Cross. The texts for this cycle are found in the \"Menaion\".\n\nThe commemorations on the Paschal Cycle (Moveable Cycle) depend upon the date of Pascha (Easter). The texts for this cycle are found in the \"Lenten Triodion\", the \"Pentecostarion\", the \"Octoechos\" and also, because the daily Epistle and Gospel readings are determined by this cycle, the \"Gospel Book\" and \"Apostle Book\". The cycle of the \"Octoechos\" continues through the following great lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year's and the current year's dates of Easter.\n\nThe cycle of the eight Tones is found in the \"Octoechos\" and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter, that week using the first tone, the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent Palm Sunday.\n\nThe portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day's Matins Gospel.\n\nThe Daily Cycle begins with Vespers and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:\n\nThe Typica is served whenever the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, i.e., when there is a vesperal Liturgy or no Liturgy at all. On days when the Liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the Typica follows the sixth hour (or Matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein; otherwise, on aliturgical days or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.\n\nAlso, there are Inter-Hours for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces \"God is the Lord\" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the ecclesiarch when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.\n\nIn addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, canons) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the Eucharist.\n\nThe full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other katholika. In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation); otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the Liturgy of the Catechumens commencing straightway after the troparion following the Great Doxology.\n\nThe Midnight Office is seldom served in parishes churches except at the Paschal Vigil as the essential office wherein the burial shroud is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.\n\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday. The most common groupings are as follows:\n\n\n\nOn the eves before Great Feasts and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used. However, the all-night vigil is usually abridged so as to not last literally \"all-night\" and may be as short as two hours; on the other hand, on Athos and in the very traditional monastic institutions, that service followed by the hours and Liturgy may last as long as 18 hours.\n\n\nWhen the feast is a weekday (or, in the Russian tradition, on any day for Christmas, Theophany), Vespers (with the Liturgy in most instances) is served earlier in the day and so Great Compline functions much as Great vespers does on the vigils of other feast days.\n\nThe Alexandrian Rite is observed by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Coptic Catholic Church. The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine \"Horologion\" is the Agpeya.\n\nSeven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional \"Prayer of the Veil\" which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine Midnight Office).\n\nThe hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:\n\nEvery one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:\n\nThe East Syriac Rite (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Malabar. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning), with a rarely used Compline. When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three \"hulali\" (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.\n\nThe present arrangement provides for seven \"hulali\" at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on \"Memorials\", and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a \"Shuraya\", or short psalm, with generally a portion of Psalm 118, varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1–6, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and \"Memorials\" Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1–18, comes at the end of the psalms.\n\nThe rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (\"giyura\") inserted—like the Greek stichera, but more extensively—between verses of psalms. On Sundays the Gloria in Excelsis and Benedicte are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (\"Khuthama\", \"Sealing\" ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.\n\nThe variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called \"Before\" (\"Qdham\") and \"After\" (\"Wathar\"), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called \"Qdham u wathar\", or at full length \"Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar\", the \"Book of Before and After\".\n\nThe East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called \"Shawu'i\"; these are Advent (called \"Subara\", \"Annunciation\"), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, \"Elias and the Cross\", \"Moses\", and the \"Dedication\" (\"Qudash idta\"). \"Moses\" and the \"Dedication\" have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the \"Shawu'a\" in which they occur, \"Fourth Sunday of Epiphany\", \"Second Sunday of the Annunciation \", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a \"Shawu'a\". Most of the \"Memorials\" (\"dukhrani\"), or saints' days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as Christmas, Theophany, the Dormition, and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.\n\nThere are four shorter fasting periods besides the Great Lent; these are:\n\nThe Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the Chaldean Catholics. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the Julian Calendar is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the Seleucid era (year 1 = 311 B.C.).\n\nThe West Syriac Rite, used in Syria by the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites) and Syriac Rite Catholic is in its origin simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over Chalcedon, before the influence of Constantinople over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.\n\nIn accordance with Psalm 119:164, \"Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,\" the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:\n\nThe Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three \"qawme\" or \"watches\" (literally \"standings\"). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (\"Ramsho\"). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the \"Shhimo\", \"simple prayer.\" The \"shhimo\" has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a \"qawmo\", a set of prayers that includes the Lord's Prayer. At the end of the office, the Nicene Creed is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine odes.\n\nThe Daily Services in the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.\n\nThe Night Service (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of God the Father. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.\n\nThe Morning Service (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of God the Son. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the Myrrh-bearing Women.\n\nThe Sunrise Service (6:00 a.m.) Dedicated to the praising of the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.\n\nThe Third Hour (9:00 a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve’s original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.\n\nThe Sixth Hour (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ's Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God's help towards feeble human nature.\n\nThe Ninth Hour (3:00 p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.\n\nThe Evening Service (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe Peace Service (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ's descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.\n\nThe Rest Service (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.\n\nIn ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:\n\nDuring Great Lent, all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:\n\nThe book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of Armenian liturgical chant is the \"Sharagnots\" (see Armenian Octoechos), a collection of hymns known as \"Sharakan\". Originally, these hymns were Psalms and biblical Canticles that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine Canon. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called \"ganonaklookh\" (Canon head).\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer, first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for Anglicans and Anglican Use Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for Morning Prayer (often called Mattins or Matins) and Evening Prayer (colloquially known as Evensong).\n\nSince the early 20th century, revised editions of the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and Compline. The proposed Book of Common Prayer (1928) of the Church of England also restored the office of Prime, although it has only appeared in the 1965 prayer book oh the Church of Melanesia. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:\nSome prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. also provides an \"Order of Worship for the Evening\" as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the Phos Hilaron. In the Church of England, the publication in 2005 of \"Daily Prayer\", the third volume of Common Worship, adds \"Prayer During the Day\" to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the Church Year. The 1989 New Zealand Prayer Book provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as \"Midday Prayer,\" \"Night Prayer,\" and \"Family Prayer.\"\n\nIn 1995, the Episcopal Church (United States) published the \"Contemporary Office Book\" in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.\n\nThe traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, to return to the office's older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he eliminated the lesser hours and conflated the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, incorporating the canticles associated with each: the Benedictus and Te Deum. Similarly, Evening Prayer incorporated both the Magnificat from Vespers and the Nunc Dimittis from Compline. In Cranmer's design, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. This parallelism of two readings, each followed by a canticle, is a distinctive feature of the Anglican daily office. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated responsories and antiphons, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books.\n\nLike many other Reformers, Cranmer sought to restore the daily reading or singing of psalms as the heart of Christian daily prayer. Since his time, every edition of the Book of Common Prayer has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of Anglican Chant settings for the psalms and canticles.\n\nThe daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern.\n\nWhile Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the eucharist has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.\n\nMost Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the Book of Common Prayer or on Common Worship but with additional antiphons and devotions. The Order of the Holy Cross and Order of St. Helena published \"A Monastic Breviary\" (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the \"St. Helena Breviary\" (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The All Saints Sisters of the Poor also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The Society of St. Francis publishes \"Celebrating Common Prayer\", which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.\n\nSome Anglo-Catholics use the Anglican Breviary, an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the Sarum Rite in the style of Cranmer's original Book of Common Prayer, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was bound along with many editions of the \"Breviarium Romanum\". Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic \"Liturgy of the Hours\" (US) or \"Divine Office\" (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas' translation of the 'Monastic Diurnal' into the idiom of the 'Book of Common Prayer'. Former Anglicans worshiping in Roman Catholic parishes of the Pastoral Provision and the Personal Ordinariates maintain the Anglican flavor of the Daily Office using the Book of Divine Worship, an adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer approved for Anglican Use Catholics in 2003.\n\nHistorically, Anglican clergy have vested in cassock, surplice and tippet for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the rochet and chimere. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or alb, stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.\n\nThe canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, \"Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister.\" Canon C.26 stipulates that \"Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer...\" In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.\n\nF. W. Macdonald, the biographer of The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst, stated that Oxford Methodism \"with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England\". The traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists\", which was written by John Wesley himself. It was consequently updated in the \"Book of Offices\", published in 1936 in Great Britain, and \"The United Methodist Book of Worship\", published in 1992 in the United States. Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, \"The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke\" contains Morning, Mid-Morning, Noon, Mid-Afternoon, Evening, Compline and Vigil.\n\nThe Liberal Catholic Church, and many groups in the Liberal Catholic movement, also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the \"Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,\" the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Complin.\nIts recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.\n\nA pew edition of the Hours was published in 2002 by St. Alban's Press. However, the \"Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church\" also includes the Hours for recitation.\n\nSome Reformed churches—notably the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Church of Christ—have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of inclusive language.\n\n\"The New Century Psalter\", published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.\n\n\"Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer\", published in 1994 by Westminster John Knox Press, includes the daily offices from The Book of Common Worship of 1993, the liturgy of the Presbyterian Church USA. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter—an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American Book of Common Prayer—also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year.\n\nBoth books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.\n\nLutheran worship books usually include orders for Morning and Evening Prayer as well as Compline. Liturgies published by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the Book of Common Prayer. In recent years, under the impact of the liturgical movement, Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both \"Evangelical Lutheran Worship\" published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada as well as the \"Lutheran Service Book\" of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.\n\n\n\n"}

Many disciplines contain seven cords, symbolizing the seven deadly sins and seven virtues. They also often contain three knots on each cord, representing the number of days Jesus Christ remained in the tomb after bearing the sins of humanity. Those who use the discipline often do so during the penitential season of Lent, but others use it on other occasions, and some have used it every day.\n\nIn the Christian Bible, Saint Paul writes: \"I punish my body and enslave it, so that after proclaiming to others I myself should not be disqualified\" (1 Corinthians 9:27 NRSV). Christians who use the discipline do so as a means of partaking in the mortification of the flesh to aid in the process of sanctification; they also \"inflict agony on themselves in order to suffer as Christ and the martyrs suffered.\" In antiquity and during the Middle Ages, when Christian monastics would mortify the flesh as a spiritual discipline, the name of the object that they used to practice this also became known as the discipline. By the 11th century, the use of the discipline for Christians who sought to practice the mortification of the flesh became ubiquituous throughout Christendom.\n\nWith the Roman Catholic Church, the discipline is used by some austere Catholic religious orders. The Cistercians, for example, use the discipline to mortify their flesh after praying the Compline. The Capuchins have a ritual observed thrice a week, in which the psalms \"Miserere Mei Deus\" and \"De Profundis\" are recited while friars flagellate themselves with a discipline. Saints within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Dominic Loricatus, Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, among others, used the discipline on themselves to aid in their sanctification.\n\nVotarists of some Anglican religious orders practice self-flagellation with a discipline. Within Anglicanism, the use of the discipline became \"quite common\" among many members of the Tractarian movement. Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran Churches, practiced mortification of the flesh through fasting and self-flagellation, even sleeping in a stone cell without a blanket. Congregationalist writer and leader within the evangelical Christian movement, Sarah Osborn, practiced self-flagellation in order \"to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God\".\n\n"}

He was the son and successor of Taj al-Dawla Ziyar.\n\nWhen Eskandar ascended the Paduspanid throne, the Ilkhanate Empire was quickly declining. This gave him a favorable occasion to expand his rule over Alborz, Qazvin, and Semnan.\n\nIn 1344, the Sarbadar ruler Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud, sought to increase his territorial domains, and thus in 1344 invaded the domains of the Bavandid Hasan II of Tabaristan and Eskandar II in Mazandaran with several hostile minor dynasties allied against him. When the Sarbadars advanced on Amol, Hasan decided to abandon the city. He then turned around and defeated the Sarbadar garrison at Sari, cutting off Mas'ud's line of retreat. Despite this, Mas'ud decided to press on. When Hasan attacked his rear, however, and Eskandar II met him at his front, Mas'ud was surrounded. The Sarbadars were decimated, and Mas'ud was captured by Eskandar II. He was handed over to the son of one of Togha Temur's former officials who had died fighting the Sarbadars in 1341/1342. Mas'ud was then executed by the latter.\n\nAfter having secured his kingdom from enemy threat, Eskandar began strengthening his kingdom; he founded the city of Kojur which became his capital. He then began taking various civilians and nobles from the cities he had conquered, and re-settled them in Kojur. In 1349, Hasan was murdered by the two sons of Kiya Afrasiyab, a powerful Afrasiyab nobleman. An unnamed son of Hasan fled to the court of Eskandar, where he was warmly received. Eskandar, hoping to restore Bavand rule, invaded the domains of Afrasiyab, he was however, defeated at Amol. Eskandar later died in 1359, after being mistakenly wounded by his own bodyguard. He was succeeded by his brother Fakhr al-Dawla Shah-Ghazi.\n\n"}
{"id": "85681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85681", "title": "Etruscan religion", "text": "Etruscan religion\n\nEtruscan religion comprises a set of stories, beliefs, and religious practices of the Etruscan civilization, originating in the 7th century BC from the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture, heavily influenced by the mythology of ancient Greece and Phoenicia, and sharing similarities with concurrent Roman mythology and religion. As the Etruscan civilization was assimilated into the Roman Republic in the 4th century BC, the Etruscan religion and mythology were partially incorporated into classical Roman culture, following the Roman tendency to absorb some of the local gods and customs of conquered lands. \n\nThe Etruscan system of belief was an immanent polytheism; that is, all visible phenomena were considered to be manifestations of divine power, and that power was embodied in deities who acted continually on the world but could be dissuaded or persuaded by mortal men.\n\nLong after the assimilation of the Etruscans, Seneca the Younger said that the difference between the Romans and the Etruscans was thatWhereas we believe lightning to be released as a result of the collision of clouds, they believe that the clouds collide so as to release lightning: for as they attribute all to deity, they are led to believe not that things have a meaning insofar as they occur, but rather that they occur because they must have a meaning.\n\nAround the \"mun\" or \"muni\", or tombs, were the \"man\" or \"mani\" (Latin \"Manes\"), the souls of the ancestors. In iconography after the 5th century BC, the deceased are shown traveling to the underworld. In several instances of Etruscan art, such as in the François Tomb in Vulci, a spirit of the dead is identified by the term \"hinthial\", literally \"(one who is) underneath\".\n\nA god was called an \"ais\" (later \"eis\"), which in the plural is \"aisar\". The abode of a god was a \"fanu\" or \"luth\", a sacred place, such as a \"favi\", a grave or temple. There, one would need to make a \"fler\" (plural \"flerchva\"), or \"offering\".\n\nThree layers of deities are portrayed in Etruscan art. One appears to be lesser divinities of an indigenous origin: Catha and Usil, the sun; Tivr, the moon; Selvans, a civil god; Turan, the goddess of love; Laran, the god of war; Leinth, the goddess of death; Maris, Thalna, Turms and the god Fufluns, whose name is related in some unknown way to the city of Populonia and the populus Romanus.\n\nRuling over them were higher deities that seem to reflect the Indo-European system: Tin or Tinia, the sky, Uni his wife (Juno), and Cel, the earth goddess.\n\nAs a third layer, the Greek gods were adopted by the Etruscan system during the Etruscan Orientalizing Period of 750/700-600 BC. Examples are Aritimi (Artemis), Menrva (Minerva; Latin equivalent of Athena), and Pacha (Bacchus; Latin equivalent of Dionysus), and over time the primary trinity became Tinia, Uni and Menrva.\n\nThe Etruscans believed their religion had been revealed to them by seers, the two main ones being Tages, a childlike figure born from tilled land who was immediately gifted with prescience, and Vegoia, a female figure.\n\nThe Etruscans believed in intimate contact with divinity. They did nothing without proper consultation with the gods and signs from them. These practices were taken over in total by the Romans.\n\nThe Etruscan scriptures were a corpus of texts termed the \"Etrusca Disciplina\". This name appears in Valerius Maximus, and Marcus Tullius Cicero refers to a \"disciplina\" in his writings on the subject.\n\nMassimo Pallottino summarizes the known (but non-extant) scriptures as the \"Libri Haruspicini\", containing the theory and rules of divination from animal entrails; the \"Libri Fulgurales\", describing divination from lightning strikes; and the \"Libri Rituales\". The last was composed of the \"Libri Fatales\", detailing the religiously correct methods of founding cities and shrines, draining fields, formulating laws and ordinances, measuring space and dividing time; the \"Libri Acherontici\", dealing with the hereafter; and the \"Libri Ostentaria\", containing rules for interpreting prodigies. The revelations of the prophet Tages were given in the \"Libri Tagetici\", which included the \"Libri Haruspicini\" and the \"Acherontici\", and those of the prophetess Vegoia in the \"Libri Vegoici\", which included the \"Libri Fulgurales\" and part of the \"Libri Rituales\".\n\nThese works did not present prophecies or scriptures in the ordinary sense: the \"Etrusca Disciplina\" foretold nothing itself. The Etruscans appear to have had no systematic ethics or religion and no great visions. Instead they concentrated on the problem of the will of the gods: questioning why, if the gods created the universe and humanity and have a will and a plan for everyone and everything in it, they did not devise a system for communicating that will in a clear manner.\n\nThe Etruscans accepted the inscrutability of their gods' wills. They did not attempt to rationalize or explain divine actions or formulate any doctrines of the gods' intentions. As answer to the problem of ascertaining the divine will, they developed an elaborate system of divination; that is, they believed the gods offer a perpetual stream of signs in the phenomena of daily life, which if read rightly can direct humanity's affairs. These revelations may not be otherwise understandable and may not be pleasant or easy, but are perilous to doubt.\n\nThe Etrusca Disciplina therefore was mainly a set of rules for the conduct of all sorts of divination; Pallottino calls it a religious and political \"constitution\": it does not dictate what laws shall be made or how humans are to behave, but rather elaborates rules for asking the gods these questions and receiving answers.\n\nCicero saidFor a hasty acceptance of an erroneous opinion is discreditable in any case, and especially so in an inquiry as to how much weight should be given to auspices, to sacred rites, and to religious observances; for we run the risk of committing a crime against the gods if we disregard them, or of becoming involved in old women's superstition if we approve them.\n\nHe then quipped, regarding divination from the singing of frogs:Who could suppose that frogs had this foresight? And yet they do have by nature some faculty of premonition, clear enough of itself, but too dark for human comprehension.\n\nDivinatory inquiries according to discipline were conducted by priests whom the Romans called haruspices or sacerdotes; Tarquinii had a college of 60 of them. The Etruscans, as evidenced by the inscriptions, used several words: \"capen\" (Sabine \"cupencus\"), \"maru\" (Umbrian \"maron-\"), \"eisnev\", \"hatrencu\" (priestess). They called the art of haruspicy \"ziχ neθsrac\".\n\nA special magistrate, the \"cechase\", looked after the \"cecha\" or \"rath\", sacred things. Every man, however, had his religious responsibilities, which were expressed in an \"alumnathe\" or \"slecaches\", a sacred society. No public event was conducted without the \"netsvis\", the \"haruspex\", or his female equivalent, the \"nethsra\", who would read the bumps on the liver of a properly sacrificed sheep. We have a model of a liver made of bronze, whose religious significance is still a matter of heated debate, marked into sections which perhaps are meant to explain what a bump in that region would mean.\n\nEtruscan beliefs concerning the hereafter appear to be an amalgam of influences. The Etruscans shared general early Mediterranean beliefs, such as the Egyptian belief that survival and prosperity in the hereafter depend on the treatment of the deceased's remains. Etruscan tombs imitated domestic structures and were characterized by spacious chambers, wall paintings and grave furniture. In the tomb, especially on the sarcophagus (examples shown below), was a representation of the deceased in his or her prime, often with a spouse. Not everyone had a sarcophagus; sometimes the deceased was laid out on a stone bench. As the Etruscans practiced mixed inhumation and cremation rites (the proportion depending on the period), cremated ashes and bones might be put into an urn in the shapes of a house or a representation of the deceased.\n\nIn addition to the world still influenced by terrestrial affairs was a transmigrational world beyond the grave, patterned after the Greek Hades. It was ruled by Aita, and the deceased was guided there by Charun, the equivalent of Death, who was blue and wielded a hammer. The Etruscan Hades was populated by Greek mythological figures and a few such as Tuchulcha, of composite appearance.\n\nAfter the Etruscan defeat in the Roman–Etruscan Wars, the remaining Etruscan culture began to be assimilated into the Roman. The Roman Senate adopted key elements of the Etruscan religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent, long after the general population had forgotten the language. However, in the last years of the Roman Republic the religion began to fall out of favor and was satirized by such notable public figures as Marcus Tullius Cicero. The Julio-Claudians, especially Claudius, who claimed a remote Etruscan descent, maintained a knowledge of the language and religion for a short time longer, but this practice soon ceased. A number of canonical works in the Etruscan language survived until the middle of the first millennium AD, but were destroyed by the ravages of time, decree of the Roman Senate, and by fire.\n\nThe mythology is evidenced by a number of sources in different media; for example, representations on large numbers of pottery, inscriptions and engraved scenes on the Praenestine \"cistae\" (ornate boxes; see under Etruscan language) and on \"specula\" (ornate hand mirrors). Currently some two dozen fascicles of the \"Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum\" have been published. Specifically Etruscan mythological and cult figures appear in the \"Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae\". Etruscan inscriptions have recently been given a more authoritative presentation by Helmut Rix, \"Etruskische Texte\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "717197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=717197", "title": "Flying Dutchman", "text": "Flying Dutchman\n\nThe Flying Dutchman () is a legendary ghost ship that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from the 17th-century golden age of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The oldest extant version has been dated to the late 18th century. Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. If hailed by another ship, the crew of the \"Flying Dutchman\" will try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom.\n\nThe first print reference to the ship appears in \"Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and Africa during a series of thirty years and upward\" (1790) by John MacDonald :\n\nThe next literary reference appears in Chapter VI of \"A Voyage to Botany Bay\" (1795) (also known as \"A Voyage to New South Wales\"), attributed to George Barrington (1755–1804):\n\nThe next literary reference introduces the motif of punishment for a crime, in \"Scenes of Infancy\" (Edinburgh, 1803) by John Leyden (1775–1811):\n\nThomas Moore (1779–1852) places the vessel in the north Atlantic in his poem \"Written on passing Dead-man's Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Late in the evening, September, 1804\": \"Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark / Her sails are full, though the wind is still, / And there blows not a breath her sails to fill.\" A footnote adds: \"The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost-ship, I think, 'the flying Dutch-man'.\"\n\nSir Walter Scott (1771–1832), a friend of John Leyden's, was the first to refer to the vessel as a pirate ship, writing in the notes to \"Rokeby; a poem\" (first published December 1812) that the ship was \"originally a vessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid act of murder and piracy had been committed\" and that the apparition of the ship \"is considered by the mariners as the worst of all possible omens.\"\n\nAccording to some sources, 17th-century Dutch captain Bernard Fokke is the model for the captain of the ghost ship. Fokke was renowned for the speed of his trips from the Netherlands to Java and was suspected of being in league with the Devil. The first version of the legend as a story was printed in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" for May 1821, which puts the scene as the Cape of Good Hope. This story introduces the name Captain Hendrick Van der Decken for the captain and the motifs (elaborated by later writers) of letters addressed to people long dead being offered to other ships for delivery, but if accepted will bring misfortune; and the captain having sworn to round the Cape of Good Hope though it should take until the day of judgment.\n\nThere have been many reported or alleged sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries. A well-known sighting was by Prince George of Wales, the future King George V. He was on a three-year voyage during his late adolescence in 1880 with his elder brother Prince Albert Victor of Wales and their tutor John Neill Dalton. They temporarily shipped into after the damaged rudder was repaired in their original ship, the 4,000-tonne corvette \"Bacchante\". The princes' log (indeterminate as to which prince, due to later editing before publication) records the following for the pre-dawn hours of 11 July 1881, off the coast of Australia in the Bass Strait between Melbourne and Sydney:\n\nNicholas Monsarrat, the novelist who wrote \"The Cruel Sea\", described the phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean in his unfinished final book \"Master Mariner\", which was partly inspired by this tale (he lived and worked in South Africa after the war) and the story of the Wandering Jew.\n\nProbably the most credible explanation is a superior mirage or Fata Morgana seen at sea.\nThe news soon spread through the vessel that a phantom-ship with a ghostly crew was sailing in the air over a phantom-ocean, and that it was a bad omen, and meant that not one of them should ever see land again. The captain was told the wonderful tale, and coming on deck, he explained to the sailors that this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that was sailing on the water below this image, but at such a distance they could not see it. There were certain conditions of the atmosphere, he said, when the sun's rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the earth, like the images one sees in glass or water, but they were not generally upright, as in the case of this ship, but reversed—turned bottom upwards. This appearance in the air is called a mirage. He told a sailor to go up to the foretop and look beyond the phantom-ship. The man obeyed, and reported that he could see on the water, below the ship in the air, one precisely like it. Just then another ship was seen in the air, only this one was a steamship, and was bottom-upwards, as the captain had said these mirages generally appeared. Soon after, the steamship itself came in sight. The sailors were now convinced, and never afterwards believed in phantom-ships.\n\nAnother optical effect known as looming occurs when rays of light are bent across different refractive indices. This could make a ship just off the horizon appear hoisted in the air.\n\nThere is a 20-foot one-design high-performance two-person monohull racing dinghy named the \"Flying Dutchman\" (FD). It made its Olympic debut at the 1960 Olympic Games and is still one of the fastest racing dinghies in the world.\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman\" has been captured in paintings by Albert Ryder, now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., and by Howard Pyle, whose painting of the \"Flying Dutchman\" is on exhibit at the Delaware Art Museum.\n\nDutch artist Joyce Overheul also adapted the name of \"The Flying Dutchman\" onto her crochet pattern designs (\"The Flying Dutchman Crochet Design\"), resembling the similarity of her designs 'roaming' the world just like the ghost ship once did.\n\n\"Flying Dutchman\" Tobacco was a popular blend for pipes and smoking. Many of their tins are still readily collected by those who appreciate packaging art and design.\n\n\nThe story was dramatised in the 1951 film \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\", starring James Mason (who plays the Dutch captain Hendrick van der Zee) and Ava Gardner (who plays Pandora). In this version, the Flying Dutchman is a man, not a ship. The two-hour long film, scripted by its director Albert Lewin, sets the main action on the Mediterranean coast of Spain during the summer of 1930. Centuries earlier the Dutchman had killed his wife, wrongly believing her to be unfaithful. Providence condemned him to roam the seas until he found the true meaning of love. In the only plot device taken from earlier versions of the story, once every seven years the Dutchman is allowed ashore for six months to search for a woman who will love him enough to die for him, releasing him from his curse, and he finds her in Pandora.\n\nIn the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films, the ship made its first appearance in under the command of the fictional captain, Davy Jones. The story and attributes of the ship were inspired by the actual \"Flying Dutchman\" of nautical lore.\n\nThe 1797–98 poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", contains a similar account of a ghost ship, which may have been influenced by the tale of the \"Flying Dutchman\". One of the first \"Flying Dutchman\" short stories was titled \"Vanderdecken's Message Home; or, the Tenacity of Natural Affection\" and was published in \"Blackwood's\" during 1821.\n\nDutch poet J. Slauerhoff published a number of related poems, particularly in his 1928 volume \"Eldorado\".\n\nThis story was adapted in the English melodrama \"The Flying Dutchman; or the Phantom Ship: a Nautical Drama, in three acts\" (1826) by Edward Fitzball (1792–1873), music by George Rodwell, and the novel \"The Phantom Ship\" (1839) by Frederick Marryat. This in turn was later adapted as \"Het Vliegend Schip\" (\"The Flying Ship\") by the Dutch clergyman, A. H. C. Römer. In Marryat's version, Terneuzen, in the Netherlands, is described as the home of the captain, who is called \"Van der Decken\" (\"of the decks\").\n\nAnother adaptation was \"The Flying Dutchman on Tappan Sea\" by Washington Irving (1855), in which the captain is named Ramhout van Dam. Irving had already used the story (based on Moore's poem) in his \"Bracebridge Hall\" (1822). Hedvig Ekdal describes visions of the \"Flying Dutchman\" from the books she reads in the attic in Henrik Ibsen's \"The Wild Duck\" (1884).\n\nJohn Boyle O'Reilly's \"The Flying Dutchman\" was first published in \"The Wild Goose\", a handwritten newspaper produced by Fenian convicts being transported to Western Australia in 1867.\n\n\"The Death Ship\", by W. Clark Russell, was published in 1888. It is narrated by Geoffrey Fenton, descendent of Edward Fenton, second mate of the English ship \"Saracen\" on a voyage to the East Indies in 1796. Fenton's ship encounters the \"Flying Dutchman\", and an accident leaves him stranded aboard the cursed ship with her ghostly crew. The captain, Cornelius Vanderdecken, tells Fenton that his ship, the \"Braave\", sailed from Batavia in 1653. \n\nBritish author Brian Jacques wrote a trilogy of fantasy/young adult novels concerning two reluctant members of the \"Dutchman\"s crew, a young boy and his dog, who were swept off the ship by a wave on the night the ship was cursed; however, the same angel who pronounced the curse on the ship and crew appeared to them and blessed them, charging them to help those in need . The first novel was titled \"Castaways of the Flying Dutchman\" and was first published by Puffin Books in 2001. The second was titled \"The Angel's Command\" and was released by Puffin in 2003. The third and final book of the trilogy (due to Jacques' death in 2011) was titled \"Voyage of Slaves\" and was released by Puffin in 2006.\n\nIn the novel \"The Flying Dutchman\" (2013) by the Russian novelist Anatoly Kudryavitsky, the ghost ship rebuilds itself from an old barge abandoned on the bank of a big Russian river, and offers itself as a refuge to a persecuted musicologist.\n\nThe comic fantasy \"Flying Dutch\" by Tom Holt is a version of the \"Flying Dutchman\" story. In this version, the Dutchman is not a ghost ship but crewed by immortals who can only visit land once every seven years when the unbearable smell that is a side-effect of the elixir of life wears off.\n\nThe Roger Zelazny short story \"And Only I Am Escaped To Tell thee\" tells of a sailor who escapes from the \"Flying Dutchman\" and is rescued by sailors who welcome him to the Mary Celeste.\n\nWard Moore in his 1951 story \"Flying Dutchman\" used the myth as a metaphor for an automated bomber plane which continues to fly over an Earth where humanity long since totally destroyed itself and all life in a nuclear war.\n\nAmiri Baraka's 1964 play, \"Dutchman\", uses the metaphor of ship-lost-at-sea to express the way White liberal America has alienated African Americans in their own country.\n\nRichard Wagner's opera, \"The Flying Dutchman\" (1843) is adapted from an episode in Heinrich Heine's satirical novel \"The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski\" (\"Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski\") (1833), in which a character attends a theatrical performance of \"The Flying Dutchman\" in Amsterdam. Heine had first briefly used the legend in his \"Reisebilder: Die Nordsee\" (\"Pictures of Travel: the North Sea\") (1826), which simply repeats from \"Blackwood's Magazine\" the features of the vessel being seen in a storm and sending letters addressed to persons long since dead. In his 1833 elaboration, it was once thought that it may have been based on Fitzball's play, which was playing at the Adelphi Theatre in London, but the run had ended on 7 April 1827 and Heine did not arrive in London until the 14th. Heine was the first author to introduce the chance of salvation through a woman's devotion and the opportunity to set foot on land every seven years to seek a faithful wife. This imaginary play, unlike Fitzball's play, which has the Cape of Good Hope location, in Heine's account is transferred to the North Sea off Scotland. Wagner's opera was similarly planned to take place off the coast of Scotland, although during the final rehearsals he transferred the action to another part of the North Sea, off Norway.\n\nPierre-Louis Dietsch composed an opera \"Le vaisseau fantôme, ou Le maudit des mers\" (\"The Phantom Ship, or The Accursed of the Sea\"), which was first performed on 9 November 1842 at the Paris Opera. The libretto by Paul Foucher and H. Révoil was based on Walter Scott's \"The Pirate\" as well as Captain Marryat's \"The Phantom Ship\" and other sources, although Wagner thought it was based on the scenario of his own opera, which he had just sold to the Opera. The similarity of Dietsch's opera to Wagner's is slight, although Wagner's assertion is often repeated. Berlioz thought \"Le vaisseau fantôme\" too solemn, but other reviewers were more favourable.\n\nAmiri Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones) wrote the play \"Dutchman\" in 1964. The play's abstract nature makes it difficult to draw a direct correlation between it and the myth, but its emphasis on fate and doom recasts themes of the legend in terms of race relations in the contemporary United States.\n\n\nThe story was adapted by Judith French into a play, \"The Dutch Mariner\", broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 13 April 2003.\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman\" is a cheat unit in the original \"Age of Empires\" computer game. It is a ship that can travel on both land and sea.\n\nIn the 1993 multiplatform game \"Alone in the Dark 2\", fictional detective Edward Carnby investigates a missing girl who he discovers has been kidnapped by the undead One-Eyed Jack who, in the game, is captain of the undead crew of \"The Flying Dutchman\".\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman\" is depicted in the sandbox platformer game \"Terraria\" as a flying wooden ship with four destructible, broadside cannons. It appears within the Pirate Invasion as a boss enemy.\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman\" is also used as a warship in a game called Warship Battle:3D .\n\nThe Efteling amusement park in the Netherlands has a roller coaster called The Flying Dutchman which features the captain named Willem van der Decken ().\n\nWorlds of Fun amusement park in Kansas City, Missouri has a swinging boat ride called The Flying Dutchman.\n\nSix Flags over Georgia, an amusement park located in Austell, Georgia also had a swinging boat ride called The Flying Dutchman which was added in 1980.\n\nThe Haunted Mansion attraction in Disneyland features a painting of the \"Flying Dutchman\" before it became a ghost ship that transforms into a ship with torn sails sailing during a storm.\n\nIn Disneyland Shanghai, the park's Pirates of the Caribbean Ride features a battle between ships under the sea; one of which is the \"Flying Dutchman\".\nThe Dutch aviation pioneer and an aircraft manufacturer Anthony Fokker was nicknamed \"The Flying Dutchman\".\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines references the endless traveling aspect of the story by having \"The Flying Dutchman\" painted on the rear sides of on all its aircraft with regular livery.\n\nThe nickname of Lebanon Valley College is \"The Flying Dutchmen\", and its mascot \"The Flying Dutchman\". The nickname references the college's location in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country.\n\nHofstra University in Long Island, New York was unofficially named \"The Flying Dutchman\" and has many references to Dutch culture around the university including residence halls.\n\nHope College in Holland, Michigan is also the home of \"The Flying Dutchman\" because it was founded by settlers from the Netherlands in 1866.\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman\" is also the mascot of Guilderland High School in Guilderland, New York.\n\n\n"}

The constitution of Kuwait provides for absolute freedom of belief and for freedom of religious practice. The constitution stated that Islam is the state religion and that Sharia is a source of legislation. In general, citizens were open and tolerant of other religious groups. Regional events contributed to increased sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shia.\n\nThere are 1.2 million citizens and 2.6 million non-citizens. In 2001, there were 1125,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens, 130,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 920,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total thus Sunnis formed 84% and Shias formed 13.5% of the Kuwaiti citizen population. In 2002, the US Department of State reported that Shia Kuwaitis formed 10%-15% of Kuwait's citizen population, noting there were 525,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens and 855,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total (87% Sunnis, 13% Shias). In 2004, there were 600,000 Sunni Kuwaitis citizens, 300,000-350,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 913,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total. There is also a small number of Ahmadi Muslims in Kuwait.\n\nThere are also Christian Kuwaiti citizens. There are between 200 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaiti citizens residing in Kuwait. There is also a small number of Bahai Kuwaiti citizens. An estimated 150,000 noncitizen residents are Shia. While some areas have relatively high concentrations of either Sunnis or Shia, most areas are religiously well integrated.\n\nThere are an estimated 600,000 non-citizen Hindus. The non‑citizen Christian population is estimated to be more than 450,000. The government-recognized Christian churches include the Roman Catholic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the National Evangelical Church Kuwait (Protestant), the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church (referred to in Arabic as the Roman Orthodox Church), the Greek Catholic (Melkite) Church, and the Anglican Church. There are also many unrecognized Christian religious groups with smaller populations. There are an estimated 100,000 Buddhists, 10,000 Sikhs, and 400 Bahais, the majority of whom are non-citizens.\n\nThe constitution provides for religious freedom. The constitution provides for \"absolute freedom\" of belief and for freedom of religious practice. The constitution states that Islam is the state religion.\n\nThe law requires jail terms for journalists convicted of defaming any religion and prohibits denigration of Islam and Judeo-Christian religious figures, including Muhammad and Jesus. The law prohibits publications that the government deems could create hatred, spread dissension among the public, or incite persons to commit crimes.\n\nThe government has Islamic religion studies in public schools for all students. Non-Muslim students are not required to attend these classes. High school Islamic education textbooks are based largely on the Sunni interpretation of Islam.\n\nThe government does not designate religion on passports or national identity documents, with the exception of birth certificates. On birth certificates issued to Muslims, the government does not differentiate between Sunnis and Shia.\n\nThe Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs is officially responsible for overseeing religious groups. The procedures for registering and licensing religious groups are similar to those for NGOs. There are seven officially recognized churches: the National Evangelical, Catholic, Coptic Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, and Anglican churches. They work with a variety of government entities in conducting their affairs. These include the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor for visas and residence permits for clergy and other staff, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Municipality of Kuwait for building permits and land concerns, and the Ministry of Interior for security and police protection of places of worship. The government imposes quotas on the number of clergy and staff officially recognized religious groups can bring into the country.\n\nReligious courts administer personal status law. Shia Muslims follow their own jurisprudence in matters of personal status and family law at the first instance and appellate levels. In 2003 the government approved a Shia request to establish a court of cassation to oversee Shia personal status issues. The court is not yet established. An independent Islamic charity administers Shia religious endowments.\n\nGovernment restrictions primarily affected non-Sunni citizens and residents. Municipal authorities became more active in obstructing religious gatherings at unofficial, private spaces.\n\nKuwait does not have Shia religious training institutions for clergy. Kuwaiti Shias who wanted to serve as imams had to seek training and education abroad (primarily in Iraq, Iran, and to a lesser degree Syria) due to the lack of Shia jurisprudence courses at Kuwait University's College of Islamic Law, the country's only institution to train imams.\n\nThe government exercised direct control of Sunni religious institutions. The government appointed Sunni imams, monitored their Friday sermons, and financed construction of Sunni mosques. In some instances, Sunni imams were suspended for delivering sermons whose content the government deemed inflammatory. The government did not exert this control over Shia mosques, which the Shia community, not the government, funded.\n\nShia worshipers gathered peacefully in public spaces to attend sermons and eulogies during Ashura and the government provided security to Shia neighborhoods. However, the government did not permit self-flagellation (public reenactments) of the martyrdom of Hussein.\n\nWhile seven Christian churches were legally recognized, others were not, including the Indian Orthodox, Mar Thoma, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints (Mormons), and Seventh-day Adventist Church. These religious groups freely operated in rented villas, private homes, or the facilities of recognized churches. Members of these congregations reported that they were able to worship without government interference provided they did not disturb their neighbors or violate laws.\n\nShia were represented in the police force and some branches of the military/security apparatus, although not in all branches and often not in leadership positions. Some Shia alleged that a \"glass ceiling\" of discrimination prevented them from obtaining leadership positions in some of these organizations. However, since 2006 the prime minister has appointed two Shia ministers to each cabinet, including the current one. The emir had several senior-level Shia advisors.\n\nMany hotels, stores, and other businesses patronized by both citizens and non-citizens openly acknowledged non-Muslim holidays such as Christmas, Easter, and Diwali. During the Christmas season, stores, malls, and homes were decorated with Christmas trees and lights, and Christmas music, including songs with explicitly Christian lyrics, was broadcast in public spaces and on the radio. Christian holiday decorations were widely available for purchase. None of the many stores that had Christmas-themed displays reported negative incidents. The news media regularly printed reports of religious holiday celebrations, including large supplement sections detailing the religious significance of Christmas.\n\n"}

The Government generally respected the right to religious freedom in practice; however, witchcraft is a criminal offense under the penal code. Private actors continued to abuse and discriminate against those accused of witchcraft.\n\nThe country has an area of approximately and a population of 4,369,000. According to a 2005 census report, Protestants compose 51 percent of the population, Catholics 29 percent, and Muslims 10 percent. The remainder of the population practices traditional beliefs (animism), although many traditional beliefs are also incorporated into Christian and Islamic practice throughout the country.\n\nIn general, immigrants and foreign nationals in the country who practice a particular religion characterize themselves as Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim.\n\nThere were many foreign missionary groups operating in the country. Many missionaries who left the country due to fighting between rebel and government forces in 2002 and 2003 returned to the country and resumed their activities.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally permitted adherents of all religious groups to worship without interference. The Constitution prohibits what the Government considers to be religious fundamentalism or intolerance. The constitutional provision prohibiting religious fundamentalism was widely perceived as targeting Muslims; however, it is not supported by any additional legislation.\n\nAlthough witchcraft or sorcery is a criminal offense punishable by execution under the penal code, most sentences are from 1 to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,500 (817,836 CFA francs). No one accused of witchcraft received the death penalty during the reporting period, but numerous individuals were arrested for these practices, often in conjunction with some other offense, such as murder. Accusations of witchcraft appear unrelated to religious practice and are often associated with interpersonal disputes. The Government reinforces societal attitudes about the efficacy of sorcery by arresting and detaining persons accused of witchcraft, often under the guise of protecting the accused from harm by people within their communities.\n\nDuring a typical trial of someone accused of sorcery, traditional doctors and neighbors are called as witnesses, and cuttings of clothes are submitted as evidence. In the past, the Minister of Justice acknowledged that investigations into allegations of sorcery were difficult. Authorities free most people imprisoned for witchcraft and sorcery offenses for lack of evidence; however, government authorities in May 2007 identified 8–10 inmates as being imprisoned for witchcraft in Bimbo, the women's prison in Bangui.\n\nReligious groups that the Government considered \"subversive\", a term not specifically defined by the Government, are subject to sanctions by the Ministry of Interior. When imposing sanctions, the Ministry of Interior may decline to register, suspend the operations of, or ban any organization that it deems offensive to public morals or likely to disturb the peace. The Ministry of Interior may also intervene in religious organizations to resolve internal conflicts about property, finances, or leadership within religious groups.\n\nThe Government celebrates several Christian holy days as national holidays including Christmas, Easter Monday, Ascension Day, the Monday after Pentecost, and All Saints' Day. The Government does not officially celebrate Islamic holy days; however, Muslims are allowed to take these days off from work. There is no state religion.\n\nReligious groups (except for traditional indigenous religious groups) are required by law to register with the Ministry of Interior. Registration is free and confers official recognition and certain limited benefits such as customs duty exemption for the importation of vehicles or equipment. The administrative police of the Ministry of Interior monitored groups that failed to register; however, the police did not attempt to impose any penalty on such groups.\n\nReligious organizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize and worship throughout the country.\n\nStudents are not compelled to participate in religious education, and they are free to attend any religious program of their choosing. Although the Government does not explicitly prohibit religious instruction in public schools, such instruction is not part of the overall public school curriculum, nor is it common. Religious instruction is permitted without government interference in private schools. Private Catholic schools generally include 1 hour of religious education per week.\n\nThe Government grants religious groups 1 day each week, of their choosing, to make free broadcasts on the official radio station. All religious representatives that wish to broadcast on public airwaves are required to pay a fee when covering certain activities or making religious advertisements. There are four religious broadcasting stations—two Protestant, one Catholic, and one Islamic.\n\nThe Government continued to take positive steps to promote religious freedom, such as the organizing of interfaith services for the purpose of promoting peace and interfaith dialogue.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion, with the exception of any practice considered subversive or witchcraft related. The Government continued to ban the Unification Church, claiming that it is a subversive organization likely to disturb the peace because of its alleged training of younger church members as paramilitaries. In December 2006 President Bozize ordered security forces to burn several houses belonging to deacons of Kina Baptist Church in Bangui in response to the deacons' burning of a pastor's house following an interpersonal dispute. Security forces arrested two deacons and beat one of them before releasing them.\n\nThe Government maintained burdensome legal requirements that restricted the activities of some groups. Two of the churches suspended by the Government in 2003 failed to reopen, unable to prove they had a minimum of one thousand members and church leaders who graduated from what the Government considered high caliber religious schools.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nImprovements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom\n\nThe Government approved the reopening of a Protestant church in Bangui that had been closed by the Government in March 2006 after authorities learned that two factions within the church were planning to fight each other with knives. The church members later reconciled.\n\nPrivate actors continued to abuse and discriminate against people accused of witchcraft. Although there is widespread belief in the efficacy of sorcery, accusations of witchcraft generally arose from interpersonal disputes, not from specific religious or cultural practices.\n\nWitchcraft is widely understood to encompass attempts to harm others not only by magic but also by covert means of established efficacy such as poisons. Although many traditional indigenous religious groups include or accommodate belief in the efficacy of witchcraft, they generally only approve of harmful witchcraft for defensive or retaliatory purposes. Witchcraft was a common explanation for diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\n\nGovernment authorities sentenced four residents of Bangui's Miskine suburb to more than 10 years in prison for the 2005 killing of a woman they accused of being a witch. Although courts have tried, convicted, and sentenced some persons for crimes committed against suspected witches in the past, violence against these individuals continued.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "428663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428663", "title": "Hank Pym", "text": "Hank Pym\n\nDr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by editor and plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber and penciler Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in \"Tales to Astonish\" #27 (Jan. 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone science-fiction anthology story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero Ant-Man with the power to shrink to the size of an insect. Alongside his crime-fighting partner/wife Janet van Dyne, he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing Giant-Man and Goliath; the insect-themed Yellowjacket; and briefly the Wasp. He is a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers.\n\nDebuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated films; arcade and video games; television series and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards. Michael Douglas portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in \"Ant-Man\" (2015) and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018). He will reprise his role in the upcoming untitled \"Avengers\" film (2019).\n\nHank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled \"The Man in the Ant Hill\" (about a character who tests shrinking technology on himself) in the science fiction/fantasy anthology \"Tales to Astonish\" #27 (cover date Jan. 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, penciler Jack Kirby, and inker Dick Ayers, with Lee stating in 2008: \"I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun.\"\n\nAs a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed superhero Ant-Man who starred in the 13-page, three-chapter story \"Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man’s Revenge\" in \"Tales to Astonish\" #35 (Sept. 1962). The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his socialite girlfriend and laboratory assistant Janet van Dyne. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in \"Tales to Astonish\". Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title \"The Avengers\", and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.\n\nDecades later, Lee theorized as to why \"Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book,\" saying,\n\nPym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in \"Tales to Astonish\", becoming the tall Giant-Man in issue #49 (Nov. 1963). Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue #69 (July 1965), while simultaneously appearing in \"The Avengers\" until issue #15 (April 1965), after which the couple temporarily left the team.\n\nPym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity Goliath in \"Avengers\" #28 (May 1966). Gradually falling to mental strain, he adopted the fourth superhero identity Yellowjacket in issue #59 (Dec. 1968). Pym reappeared as Ant-Man in \"Avengers\" #93 (Nov. 1971) and for issues #4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of \"Marvel Feature\" (July 1972 – July 1973). During this run he appeared in a redesigned costume with a nail as a weapon. After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues, Pym would temporarily abandon a costumed persona. Pym joined the West Coast Avengers as a scientist and inventor in \"West Coast Avengers\" vol. 2, #21 (June 1987). The character returned to the Avengers as the superhero Giant-Man in \"The Avengers\" vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998). When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, using the Yellowjacket persona again, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (Sept. 2004).\n\nFollowing the death of van Dyne, a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as the new iteration of Wasp, in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time, in the one-shot publication \"Secret Invasion: Requiem\" (Jan. 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in \"Avengers Academy\" from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan. 2013). Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series \"Ant-Man & The Wasp\" (Jan. 2011), and also appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 \"Secret Avengers\" series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).\n\nAfter \"Secret Avengers\", Pym joined the \"Avengers A.I.\" after beating his creation, Ultron. Then, he appeared in many comic books like \"Daredevil\" (Vol. 3 and 4) and the graphic novel \"Rage of Ultron\".\n\nBiochemist Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym discovers an unusual set of subatomic particles he labels \"Pym particles\". Entrapping these within two separate serums, he creates a size-altering formula and a reversal formula, testing them on himself. Reduced to the size of an insect, he becomes trapped in an anthill before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to restore himself to his normal size. Deciding the serums are too dangerous to exist, he destroys them. Shortly afterward, he reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums. Pym's experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he constructs a cybernetic helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them. Pym designs a costume made of unstable molecules to prevent bites or scratches from the ants, and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.\nAfter several adventures, Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne asking for aid in contacting alien life. Pym refuses, but is attracted to Vernon’s socialite daughter Janet van Dyne. Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth, and Janet asks for Pym's help in avenging Vernon's death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet, and uses Pym particles to graft wasp wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks. Janet assumes the alias of the Wasp, and together they find and defeat Vernon's killer. The pair become founding members of the superhero team known as the Avengers.\n\nPym eventually adopts his first alternate identity as the 12-foot-tall Giant-Man. He and the Wasp develop a romantic relationship. In comics three decades later, a flashback reveals Pym adopted the Giant-Man identity out of feelings of inadequacy when compared to powerful teammates Iron Man and Thor. Shortly afterward, Pym and van Dyne take a leave of absence from the Avengers.\n\nPym adopts the new identity of Goliath upon returning. A mishap traps the character in giant form for several issues, and affects his self-esteem. After regaining control of his size-shifting ability, Pym creates the robot Ultron that accidentally achieves sentience and becomes one of the Avengers's greatest foes. During a botched experiment, Pym inhales chemicals that induce schizophrenia, and suffering from a personality crisis, reappears at Avengers Mansion as the cocky Yellowjacket, claiming to have disposed of Pym. Only the Wasp realizes it is Pym and takes advantage of his offer of marriage. Pym eventually recovers from the chemicals during a battle with the Circus of Crime at the wedding.\n\nAfter several adventures with the Avengers, including another encounter with Ultron, the pair take another leave of absence. The heroes reencounter Hank Pym at the beginning of the Kree-Skrull War, and once again as the Ant-Man persona and has a series of solo adventures.\n\nAfter aiding fellow superhero team known as the Defenders as Yellowjacket, Pym returns to the Avengers. He is eventually captured by an upgraded Ultron that brainwashes his creator, causing the character to regress to his original Ant-Man costume and personality — arriving at Avengers Mansion, thinking it to be the very first meeting of the team. Seeing several unfamiliar members, Pym attacks the team until stopped by the Wasp. After Ultron's brainwashing is reversed, Pym rejoins the Avengers as Yellowjacket. Pym is forced to briefly leave the team when the roster is restructured by government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich.\n\nAlso at this time, he noticed Scott Lang's theft of the Ant-Man suit. After Darren Cross's defeat and aware of Lang's use of the stolen goods, Pym let Lang keep the equipment albeit only to uphold the law.\n\nReturning 14 issues later, Hank Pym participates in several missions until, after demonstrating hostile behavior toward Janet van Dyne, he attacks a foe from behind once the opponent had ceased fighting. Captain America suspends Yellowjacket from Avengers duty pending the verdict of a court-martial. Pym suffers a mental breakdown and concocts a plan to salvage his credibility by building a robot, Salvation-1, and programming it to launch an attack on the Avengers that he will stop using the robot’s weakness at the critical moment, in hopes of regaining his good standing. The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her. Jim Shooter, the writer of this story, says he intended only that Pym accidentally strike her while gesturing at her dismissively, and that artist Bob Hall misinterpreted the instruction. Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers, and Janet divorces him.\n\nLeft penniless, Pym is manipulated by an old foe, the presumed-dead Egghead tricking him into stealing the national reserve of the metal adamantium. Pym is confronted by the Avengers (whom he had covertly summoned), and after being defeated is blamed for the theft, as Egghead erases all evidence of his involvement. Blaming an ostensibly dead villain is taken as further proof of Pym’s madness and he is incarcerated. During Pym’s imprisonment, Janet has a brief relationship with Tony Stark. Egghead later involves himself, and while attempting to kill Pym is himself accidentally killed by Hawkeye as the latter's brother had been murdered by Egghead years ago. With the real perpetrator exposed, Pym is cleared of all charges. After bidding farewell to Janet and his teammates, Pym leaves to devote his full-time to research.\n\nPym reappears in the West Coast Avengers, first in an advisory role, and then as a full member in a non-costumed capacity. He begins a short relationship with teammate Tigra, and after a verbal taunting by old foe Whirlwind contemplates suicide, but is stopped by the heroine Firebird. Pym and Janet eventually resume a romantic relationship.\n\nThe character eventually returns to the Avengers, joining the East Coast team as Giant-Man. The pair, together with many of the other Avengers, apparently sacrifice themselves to stop the villain Onslaught, but actually exist in a pocket universe for a year before returning to the mainstream Marvel Universe.\n\nHank Pym returns and aids the team as Giant-Man, and makes a significant contribution by defeating criminal mastermind Imus Champion and his flawed creation Ultron, simultaneously overcoming his old issues of guilt over Ultron's crimes — revealed to be due to him having used his own brain patterns to create Ultron, and so believing that Ultron's attitude reflects his darker side.\n\nDuring the Destiny War between Kang the Conqueror and Immortus, two versions of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne. Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym, but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies. Observing the final battle, Libra - who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.\n\nBack in the present, an encounter with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink it down to a more manageable level, requiring them to bring in the original Hulk to essentially merge with the other Hulks and force them to split. The two Pyms begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.\n\nAfter the events of the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline, Pym takes a leave of absence, and in the one-shot title \"Avengers: Finale\", the character and Janet leave for England to rekindle their relationship. Pym and Janet's relationship fails and it is revealed in flashback during the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline that he has been replaced by an alien of the shapeshifting Skrull race. The impostor Yellowjacket, the Skrull Criti Noll, is a central character in the \"Civil War\" storyline, joining those heroes that support the Superhuman Registration Act. At the conclusion of the Civil War, the impostor is named \"Man of the Year\" by \"Time\" magazine for his role in freeing several captive anti-registration heroes.\n\nNoll becomes one of the administrators at Camp Hammond, a U.S. military base in Stamford, Connecticut, for the training of registered superheroes in the government program The Initiative. He ends the attempt at reconciliation with Janet and begins a romantic relationship with Tigra before eventually being exposed and defeated by the hero Crusader. Following a final battle between Earth's heroes and the Skrulls, the real Pym is found with other \"replaced\" heroes in a Skrull vessel. After Janet is seemingly killed in battle, Pym takes on a new superhero persona, the Wasp. in tribute to her. He rejoins the Avengers and eventually leads the team.\n\nThe cosmic entity Eternity reveals to Pym that he is Earth's \"Scientist Supreme\", the scientific counterpart to Earth's Sorcerer Supreme. The Norse trickster-god Loki later claims to have been posing as Eternity in order to manipulate Pym.\n\nHank Pym creates Avengers Academy, a program to help train young people with newly acquired superpowers. Pym returns to his Giant-Man identity in \"Avengers Academy\" #7. Pym later joins the superhero team known as the Secret Avengers. When a future version of Pym's sentient robot Ultron conquers the world of the present in the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, a time-travel plan involving Wolverine and the Invisible Woman succeeds in having the past Pym make a change in his creation of Ultron, which destroys the robot with a computer virus.\n\nPym and Monica Chang, A.I. Division Chief of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., assemble a new team called the Avengers A.I., consisting of Pym, Victor Mancha (his grandson), the Vision, and a Doombot. The team is later joined by Alexis, who is eventually revealed to be one of six sentient A.I.s to be spawned from the Ultron virus along with Dimitrios. Months later, Pym, again using the Yellowjacket identity, is shown as a member of the Illuminati. Later, an accident merges Pym and Ultron during Ultron's latest attack. After the hybrid human/machine eventually abandons Earth, a funeral service is held in Pym's honor, and Scott Lang receives one of Hank's labs.\n\nPym/Ultron resurfaces after helping the crew of a spaceship under attack. Ultron is now Pym's armor rather than being merged with him. Back on Earth, he rejoins the Avengers, but his teammates and others discover Ultron has gained control and is impersonating Pym. The Avengers end up defeating him by plunging him into the sun, but both Hank and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.\n\nHank is later revealed to have had a daughter named Nadia through his ex-wife Maria Trovaya, and Nadia became the latest Wasp.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, the Ultron/Hank Pym had set up a base in a unidentified forest in Alaska. Upon being alerted by the approach of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, the Ultron/Hank Pym decides to give his \"family\" a warm welcome. When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and the Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers alongside Hydra's Avengers confront each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. The Ultron/Hank Pym argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea. The Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, the Ultron/Hank Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration. The Ultron/Hank Pym allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the Cosmic Cube fragment, arguing that he will leave Hydra Supreme's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.\n\nAfter discovering that the Infinity Stones were reformed back into the Univerve, Ultron/Hank Pym decided to collect them all. He send the aliens he had infected with his virus to take the Space Stone from Wolverine while he himself went to claim the Soul Stone. The aliens eventually failed at their task, but Ultron/Hank Pym was able to steal the Soul Gem from Magus after ruthlessly killing him. However, unbeknownst to Ultron, as he claimed the Soul Stone, the fragment of Hank Pym's soul entered the Soul World where he was greeted by the fragment of Gamora's soul, who revealed to him that he was going to be trapped there forever. Soon afterwards the fragment of Hank's soul encounters and battles a Soul World monster known as Devondra, that ultimately devoured him, trapping him in the process in a deluding dream which made Hank believe that he had escaped the Soul World and reunited himself with the Avengers.\n\nHank Pym is a scientific genius with a Ph.D in biochemistry and nanotechnology, and expertise in the fields of quantum physics, robotics/cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and entomology. Pym discovered the subatomic \"Pym particles\" that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension, thereby changing the size of himself or other beings or objects. Pym is the creator of the robot Ultron, who he created as an experiment after examining Dragon Man, showing his knack for AI and Cybernetics.\n\nAfter constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will, and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects. Pym retains his normal strength when \"ant\" size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in \"giant\" form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym's costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of unstable molecules and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.\n\nPym also uses a cybernetic helmet he created for achieving rudimentary communication with ants and other higher order insects. As Yellowjacket, then later as Wasp, Pym wears artificial wings and has bio-blasters called \"stingers\" built into his gloves. He took up the Wasp mantle in memory of Janet, who was believed to be dead at the time.\n\nPym also carries a variety of weaponry, provisions, and scientific instruments, which are shrunken to the size of microchips and stored in the pockets of his uniform.\n\nDuring his stay with the West Coast Avengers, Pym constructed a one-man-vehicle with artificial intelligence named \"Rover\". Rover is able to communicate with Pym, and is capable of flight and discharging energy and acid.\n\nBack with the Avengers main-team, he built a second Rover, resembling an Avengers Quinjet.\n\nAfter fusing with Ultron, he now contains all of his creation's abilities when he is in control.\n\nThere are a number of characters in the Marvel universe that have also used the \"Pym particles\" to effect size changing. These include Janet van Dyne, Clint Barton, Bill Foster, Scott Lang, Erik Josten, Rita DeMara, Cassandra \"Cassie\" Lang, Eric O'Grady, Tom Foster, Raz Malhotra and Nadia Pym.\n\nIn the world of \"Marvel 1602\", natural philosopher Henri le Pym is forced by Baron von Octavius to devise a serum that would cure him of a fatal disease. Pym is married to Janette.\n\nIn an alternate future in the miniseries \"The Last Avengers Story\" #1-2 (Nov. 1995), Ultron wishes for a decisive victory over the Avengers. After eliminating the team, he has Hank Pym gather a new group. After recruiting other heroes and mercenaries, Pym leads them to victory though fatalities are heavy on both sides.\n\nHank Pym is featured in several of the \"Marvel Zombies\" miniseries, appearing as one of the cannibalistic zombies in \"Marvel Zombies\" #1-5 (Feb.-June 2006), \"Marvel Zombies 2\" #1-5 (Dec. 2007 - April 2008) and \"Marvel Zombies Return\" #4 (Oct. 2009). Although he experiences a brief return to morality in \"Marvel Zombies 2\", throughout most of the series he is presented as being comfortable with his transformation, noting to a captured Black Panther that he thinks he might still eat people even if he was cured of the infection, and setting out to consume a new universe even after learning that the hunger can be beaten. He is opposed in his expansion efforts by the zombie Spider-Man, who finally manages to defeat his own forces with nanites configured to 'eat' zombie flesh.\n\nThe MC2 imprint title \"A-Next\", set in a futuristic alternate universe, features Henry Pym and Janet Pym's twin children (Hope Pym and Henry Pym Jr.), who have turned into the supervillains Red Queen and Big Man respectively.\n\nIn this reality, Hank Pym is an intelligent, Hulk-like brute. He also appears in issue #13 of Marvel Team-Up (vol. 3).\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic \"Old Man Logan\" storyline, Hank Pym (as Giant-Man) is one of the numerous superheroes killed by the Red Skull's army of villains. Decades after his demise, a Connecticut settlement dubbed \"Pym Falls\" is built around his massive skeleton. In addition, his Ant-Man helmet is shown in the possession of a young boy named Dwight, who uses it to command an army of ants in order to enforce the payment of tolls across a bridge.\n\nIt was shown that during the fight in Connecticut, Giant-Man became enraged when the Wasp was killed by Hobgoblin. This led him to crush Vulture with his hands and step on Crossbones. As he charged the villains, Avalanche used his abilities to shake the ground. Moloids emerged and attack Giant-Man, causing him to fall to the ground.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Henry \"Hank\" Pym is portrayed as a brilliant but mentally fragile scientist. He takes Prozac to battle his mental instability and depressive episodes. He gains his Giant-Man abilities after transfusing the blood of his mutant wife Janet Pym. The character is expelled from the Ultimates after his abusive behavior ends his marriage and his Giant-Man serum is used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to make an entire Giant-Men team. Now a pariah, he briefly joins with both pseudo heroes and then anti-American villains in his Ant-Man persona. The character eventually rejoins the Ultimates in his Yellowjacket identity. During the events of \"Ultimatum\" storyline, he sacrifices himself against the Multiple Man's suicide bomber duplicates to save the remaining Ultimates' lives.\n\nAfter his death, the character's various formulas/devices are still in usage: the Giant-Man formula further replicated by S.H.I.E.L.D. to have multiple Giant-Women agents while his technology is eventually acquired by HYDRA.\n\nGiant-Man was later revived alongside his fellow Ultimates when the Superflow that separated the different universes was destroyed by Maker and High Evolutionary.\n\nHenry Pym appears in issue 13 of \"\" as a scientist working for Janet's father with no superhero identity, and was the one who gave his wife superpowers. He is visited by Spider-Man and Storm when Janet van Dyne (Giant-Girl in this continuity) falls under insect mind-control. He tells them how to free her (severing the antennae on her mask), gives her a new costume, and uses an insect telepathy helmet (identical to his Earth-616 Ant-Man helmet) to create an illusion of several giant-sized people, scaring the insects away. He returns in issue 20, becoming Ant-Man. He not only joins the team but begins a relationship with Janet.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Apes\" universe, Henry Pym is a gorilla named Gro-Rilla, a member of the Ape-Vengers.\n\n\n\n\nHank Pym appears in the novelization of \"Spider-Man 2\". It's him instead of a nameless female scientist who asks Dr. Octo Octavius how he plans to control his metallic tentacles. Upon being informed of the inhibitor chip, he states having a cybernetic helmet which would make the process easier. After the failure of Octavius' experiment, Pym goes over to Otto to confirm he's alive, while implying that his wife Rosalie is dead. Additionally, Octavius described Pym as being a giant in a field where everyone else are ants.\n\nHank Pym was ranked as the 93rd greatest comic book character by \"Wizard\" magazine. \nIGN listed Hank Pym as the 67th greatest comic book hero, and 16th in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\".\n\nComic Book Resources placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "990994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=990994", "title": "Heimia", "text": "Heimia\n\nHeimia is a genus of flowering plants in the loosestrife family, Lythraceae. It contains two or three species of closely related shrubs commonly known as sun opener or shrubby yellowcrest. They are native to the Americas, from northern Argentina north to the southernmost United States (southern Texas). The leaves are 2–5 cm long and 1 cm broad, entire, and variably arranged alternate, opposite or whorled on the stems. All species produce five-petaled yellow flowers. The plants have a history of medicinal use in a variety of American cultures. Several pharmacologically active alkaloids have been detected in the plants. The generic names honours German physician Ernst Ludwig Heim (1747–1834).\n\nThe genus contains three species. They are similar to the extent that expert knowledge is required to differentiate between specimens of the different species. The alkaloid contents of specimens of all three species has been studied, and although similar, they have been found to be chemically distinct.\n\n\"Heimia myrtifolia\" is a shrub growing to 1 m tall. The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 1 cm in diameter. The leaves are approximately 5 mm wide by 2–3 cm long.\n\n\"Heimia salicifolia\", commonly known as Sinicuichi, is a shrub growing to 3 m tall. The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 2–3 cm in diameter. The leaves are approximately 1 cm wide and 3–5 cm long.\n\nThe alkaloid content is similar between the species in the genus. The following substances have been detected in \"Heimia salicifolia\":\n\n\n\"Heimia myrtifolia\" and \"Heimia salicifolia\" are often reported to have hallucinogenic effects. This controversial attribution of effects appears to be traceable back to a publication by J. B. Calderón in 1896 who wrote that it was said to possess a \"curious and unique physiological action ... people drinking either a decoction or the juice of the plant have a pleasant drunkenness ... all objects appear yellow and the sounds of bells, human voices or any other reach their ears as if coming from a long distance.\"\n\nCalderón actually tested the plant and did not experience any noticeable effects. Through a series of exaggerating and dramatizing citations, especially by Victor A. Reko in the first half of the last century, the plant became known as a hallucinogen despite that psychoactive properties of the plant have never been demonstrated. The mildly psychoactive effects described in the original publication have therefore been attributed to a sedative principle or unknown other contents of the brew or, simply, to its alcohol content.\n\nIn 1926, Reko observed that the native people of Mexico also called the stem and bark of \"Erythrina coralloides\", the bark of \"Piscidia erythrina\", and the seeds of \"Rhynochosia praecatoria\" by the name of \"sinicuichi\", which may have contributed to the scientific confusion.\n\nThe species make attractive ornamental plants, flowering in late summer. Although only growing as a shrub in subtropical climates, it can also be grown as a herbaceous perennial in colder areas where the above-ground growth is killed by winter cold. The plants produce very many tiny seeds which are easily cultivated. The seeds should be sown thinly across the top of fine, packed soil.\n\nBoth species prefer well-drained soil with a good supply of water. The seedlings should be watered by a fine mist or with bottom watering to avoid washing them off to the side of the pot. They should be kept out of intense sunlight until they form the first real leaves. It may be necessary to spread the seedlings out in their initial pots to avoid over-crowding.

It is distinctly characterized by a basket he carries, along with a staff, drinking gourd, and a cape affixed to which is a scallop shell, symbol of a pilgrimage to Saint James.\n\nDevotion to Holy Infant of Atocha originally began as a Marian devotion with a medieval statue of the Madonna and Child in Toledo, Spain. According to Juan Javier Pescador, it originally reflected devotions to three different depictions of the Virgin Mary: Our Lady of Atocha, Our Lady of Antigua, and Our Lady of Pregnancies that later coalesced into Our Lady of Atocha.\n\nThe image of the Divine Child was detachable, and devout families would often borrow the image of the infant when a woman was about to give birth to her child.\n\nIn the 13th century, Spain was under Muslim rule. The town of Atocha, now part of Madrid's Arganzuela district, was lost to the Muslims, and many Christians there were taken prisoners as spoils of war. The Christian prisoners were not fed by the jailers, but by family members who brought them food. According to pious legend, the caliph ordered that only children under the age of 12 were permitted to bring food. Conditions became increasingly difficult for those men without small children. The women of Atocha prayed before the statue of Our Lady of Atocha at a nearby parish, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to ask her son Jesus for help.\n\nReports soon began among the people of Atocha that an unknown child under the age of twelve and dressed in pilgrim's clothing, had begun to bring food to childless prisoners at night. The women of the town returned to Our Lady of Atocha to thank the Virgin for her intercession, and noticed that the shoes worn by the Infant Jesus were tattered and dusty. They replaced the shoes of the Infant Jesus, but these became worn again. The people of Atocha took this as a sign that it was the Infant Jesus who went out every night to help those in need.\n\nThe Holy Child of Atocha is depicted dressed as a boy pilgrim dressed in a brown cloak with white lace collar over a blue robe. He wears a brimmed hat with a plume and carries a basket full of bread in one hand and a pilgrim's staff in the other. The pilgrim's staff is often depicted with a water gourd fastened to it. On the cloak he wears a Shell of Saint James, symbol of the pilgrims to the Shrine of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. The Child is said to roam the hills and valleys, particularly at night, bringing aid and comfort to the needy, and thereby wearing out his shoes. He is usually shown seated.\n\nThe Moorish conflict extended well beyond the town of Atocha. During dire points in their journey, travelers reported that a young boy, dressed as a pilgrim, would come to them bringing food and other necessities. The boy would often travel with them until they were out of danger and then guide them to the safest roads to reach their destination. Pious legends continued to be developed and the miraculous Child later became considered to be the Child Jesus and was given the title the \"Holy Child of Atocha\".\n\nThere are two primary shrines to Niño de Atocha: at Fresnillo/Plateros in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico and Chimayo, New Mexico, USA. The original Mexican Niño de Atocha was installed in the church of Saint Augustine along with the silver Christ in 1554 not long after a silver strike in Plateros.\n\nIn those years silver was discovered in Fresnillo and mines were being opened in the mountains near the settlement. Within a few weeks of the opening of the mine of Fresnillo, there was an explosion and many miners were trapped. The wives of the miners went to the church of St. Augustine to pray for their husbands and noticed that the child on the image of Our Lady of Atocha was missing. At the same time, it was said that a child came to the trapped miners, gave them water and showed them the way out of the mine. Whenever there was a problem at the mine the child helped the miners in need. Each time this happened, the image of the child on the Virgin's arms was found to be dirty and his clothes had little holes in them. After that the Holy Child was taken off his mother's arms and put on a glass box for everyone to see. The Holy Child of Atocha has become a symbol of Zacatecas and the protector of miners. Many make pilgrimages to Plateros at Christmas to bring toys to the Holy Child.\n\nHoly Infant of Atocha is also popular amongst the mostly Catholic Filipino people. The local variant, simply known as \"Santo Niño\" (Holy Child), is portrayed very similarly to the Spanish Atocha, except that it is always standing rather than sitting. He bears a staff with an attached bag or basket, which is usually filled with coins or candy, and he dons a pilgrim hat resembling the Atocha image.\n\nThe current \"Santo Niño\" found in many Filipino homes is traditionally dressed in either green or red garments. In Filipino Folk Catholicism, red garments are suited for images enshrined at home, while green ones are for those enshrined in business establishments; a common offering to the latter is a bowl filled with coins and sweets. In addition, many Filipinos customarily dress the \"Santo Niño\" in modern attire that reflect their professional roles, such as nurses, doctors, janitors, teachers and policemen, as a means of asking for his patronage. These customs relating to dress are also applied to replicas of the Santo Niño de Cebu, brought by Ferdinand Magellan to the islands in 1521, and the Infant Jesus of Prague.\n\nIn the film \"Napoleon Dynamite\", Pedro suggests placing santos around the hallways of his high school, recommending El Santo Niño de Atocha. He says that his Aunt Concha has seen him.\n\nHoly Infant of Atocha is sometimes associated with the Yoruba orisha Eshu, or Elegua.\n\nThis holy infant appears in the 1991 novel \"Mojo and the Pickle Jar\", by Douglas Bell.\n\nIn Michael Jackson's video for \"Beat It\", there is a picture of the Santo Niño above his bed.\n\nOn the television sitcom \"George Lopez\", the Holy Infant of Atocha is displayed in the family's kitchen.\n\nThe Colombian television historical drama \"Escobar, el Patrón del Mal\" features references to the Holy Infant of Atocha. The saint is a particular favorite of Pablo Escobar's mother, Enelia Hermilda Gaviria. She displays a very large portrait of the saint (same as the image above) in her foyer and invokes him in verbal blessings upon her loved ones.\n\n\n\n"}

He was ordained in 1924. In 1927 he went to Rome where he completed a biography of Girolamo Seripando. He returned to Germany in 1930, to teach Church History at the Catholic faculty of the University of Breslau. Because of his Jewish mother, he was defined half-Jewish by the National Socialists. They stripped him of all academic titles and prohibited him from working in public institutions in Germany. Jedin returned to Rome and worked there for the Görres Society. From 1936 until 1939, he worked for his diocese in Breslau. He returned to Rome after narrowly escaping deportation to the Concentration Camp at Buchenwald.\n\nIn Rome, he lived at the Campo Santo Teutonico in the Vatican and was thus under the protection of Pope Pius XII during the German occupation. He worked on a history of the Council of Trent, which he published in the years 1951-1976. Jedin created the most comprehensive description of the Council in his \"History of the Council of Trent\" (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient with about 2400 pages in four volumes: \n\nAfter the war he was rehabilitated in Germany and accepted a professorship at the University of Bonn in 1948. Pope John XXIII nominated him to assist in the preparation of the Second Vatican Council in 1960. He continued to work for the council until it ended in 1965.\n\nHis work includes over seven-hundred titles, including forty books and 250 articles in journals. Jedin issued numerous publications on the council of Trent, which, in his view, determined the relation of Catholics and Protestants for centuries. He addressed issues of controversy, trying to give interpretations of ecumenical perspectives at that time. In addition, he oversaw the publication of a seven-volume \"Church History\" (1963-1979), an \"Atlas of Church History\" (1979), and the fundamental \"Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche\" (1957-1975, \"Encyclopedia for Theology and the Church\"). As a historian, he leaned on historicism as a method. As a theologian, he was an enlightened conservative, critical of some of the implementations of Vatican Two.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36991870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36991870", "title": "Innocence of Muslims", "text": "Innocence of Muslims\n\nInnocence of Muslims is an anti-Islamic short film that was written and produced by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. Two versions of the 14-minute video were uploaded to YouTube in July 2012, under the titles \"The Real Life of Muhammad\" and \"Muhammad Movie Trailer\". Videos dubbed in Arabic were uploaded during early September 2012. Anti-Islamic content had been added in post-production by dubbing, without the actors' knowledge.\n\nWhat was perceived as denigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad resulted in demonstrations and violent protests against the video to break out on September 11 in Egypt and spread to other Arab and Muslim nations and to some western countries. The protests led to hundreds of injuries and over 50 deaths. Fatwas calling for the harm of the video's participants were issued and Pakistani government minister Bashir Ahmad Bilour offered a bounty for the killing of Nakoula, the producer. The film has sparked debates about freedom of speech and Internet censorship.\n\nThe video titled \"The Real Life of Muhammad\", uploaded on July 1, 2012, has a running time of 13:03 in 480p format. The video \"Muhammad Movie Trailer\" was uploaded on July 2, 2012, with a running time of 13:51 in 1080p format. They are similar in content.\n\nThe trailer starts with a scene portraying the reportedly increasing persecution of Copts and poor human rights in recent-day Egypt, with rise in church-burnings, growing religious intolerance and sectarian violence that has been seen against the 10% population of Egypt that are Copts, and complaints that authorities have failed to protect this population. \"The New York Times\" stated: \"The trailer opens with scenes of Egyptian security forces standing idle as Muslims pillage and burn the homes of Egyptian Christians. Then it cuts to cartoonish scenes depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a child of uncertain parentage, a buffoon, a womanizer, a homosexual, a child molester and a greedy, bloodthirsty thug.\"\n\nMost references to Islam have been overdubbed, added after the filming over the original spoken lines. The film's 80 cast and crew members have disavowed the film: \"The entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer. ... We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred.\"\n\nThe script was written about life in Egypt 2,000 years ago and was titled \"Desert Warrior\". It was a story about a character called \"Master George\". Several actors were brought in to overdub lines. They were directed to say specific words, such as \"Muhammad\". Hiding from the attack, a doctor and his family take shelter in their home where the doctor takes up a pen and begins writing on a whiteboard: \"Man + X = BT\". \"BT\" is overdubbed as \"Islamic terrorist\". The young woman asks what \"X\" is. He tells her that she needs to discover that for herself.\n\nThe video continues with scenes set in the past. Some scenes depict the main character referred to in overdubbing as \"Muhammad\". In one scene, the \"Muhammad\" character's wife, \"Khadija\", suggests mixing parts of the Torah and the New Testament. In another scene, the Muhammad is seen speaking to the donkey known as Ya'fur in Islamic tradition.\n\nThe movie was written and produced by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, using the pseudonym of \"Sam Bacile\". Nakoula claimed that he was creating an epic, two-hour film but no such film has come to light.\n\nThe project was promoted by Morris Sadek by email and on the blog of the National American Coptic Assembly.\n\nAccording to a consultant on the project, the videos are \"trailers\" from a full-length film that was shown only once, to an audience of fewer than ten people, at a rented theater in Hollywood, California. Posters advertising the film used the title \"Innocence of Bin Laden\". The film's original working title was \"Desert Warrior\", and it told the story of \"tribal battles prompted by the arrival of a comet on Earth\". On September 27, 2012, U.S. federal authorities stated Nakoula was arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly violating terms of his probation. Prosecutors stated that some of the violations included making false statements regarding his role in the film and his use of the alias \"Sam Bacile\". On November 7, 2012, Nakoula pleaded guilty to four of the charges against him and was sentenced to one year in prison and four years of supervised release.\n\nIn July 2011, Nakoula started casting actors for \"Desert Warrior\", the working title at that time. The independent film was directed by a person first identified in casting calls as Alan Roberts, whose original cut and filmed dialog and script did not include references to Muhammad or Islam. According to the casting.backstage.com announcement, it was to be \"an HD 24P historical Arabian Desert adventure film\" with \"Sam Bassiel\" as producer with shooting to start in August 2011. The lead was to be \"George: male, 20–40, a strong leader, romantic, tyrant, a killer with no remorse, accent\".\n\nAmerican non-profit Media for Christ obtained film permits to shoot the movie in August 2011, and Nakoula provided his home as a set and paid the actors, according to government officials and those involved in the production. Joseph Nassralla Abdelmasih, president of Media for Christ, claimed that the company's name was used without his knowledge. He also stated that film was edited afterwards without Media's involvement. Steve Klein, an anti-Muslim activist, claimed to be the spokesman for the film. Klein told journalist Jeffrey Goldberg that despite previous claims, \"Bacile\" is not a real person and is neither Israeli nor Jewish and that the name is a pseudonym. Israeli authorities found no sign of his being an Israeli citizen, and there was no indication of a \"Sam Bacile\" living in California or participating in Hollywood filmmaking.\n\nBy September 13, 2012, \"Sam Bacile\" was identified as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a 55-year-old Coptic Christian from Egypt living near Los Angeles, California, with known aliases. In the 1990s, he served time in prison for manufacturing methamphetamine. He pleaded \"no contest\" in 2010 to bank fraud charges, was sentenced to 21 months in prison, and was released on probation in June 2011. Nakoula claims to have written the script while in prison and raised between $50,000 and $60,000 from his wife's family in Egypt to finance the film. The FBI contacted him due to the potential for threats, but said he was not under investigation. On September 27, 2012, U.S. federal authorities arrested Nakoula in Los Angeles for suspicion of violating terms of his probation. Violations included making false statements regarding his role in the film and his use of the alias \"Sam Bacile\". On November 7, 2012, Nakoula pleaded guilty to four of the charges against him and was sentenced to one year in prison and four years of supervised release.\n\nLaw professor Stephen L. Carter and constitutional law expert Floyd Abrams have each stated that the government cannot prosecute the film's producer for its \"content\" because of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech in the United States.\n\nThe video production \"Innocence of Bin Laden\" was advertised in the Anaheim-based newspaper \"Arab World\" during May and June 2012. The advertisement cost $300 to run three times in the paper and was paid by an individual identified only as \"Joseph\". The advertisements were noted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), whose Islamic affairs director stated, \"When we saw the advertisement in the paper, we were interested in knowing if it was some kind of pro-jihadist movie.\" Brian Donnelly, a guide for a Los Angeles based tour of famous crime scenes who noticed the poster advertising at the Vine Theater, said, \"I didn't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing. We didn't know what it was about because we can't read Arabic.\" The earlier version of the film was screened once at the Vine Theater of June 23, 2012 to an audience of only ten people. The film had no subtitles and was presented in English. An employee of the theater stated, \"The film we screened was titled \"The Innocence of Bin Laden\"\", and added that it was a \"small viewing\".\n\nA second screening was planned for June 30, 2012. A local Hollywood blogger, John Walsh, attended a June 29 Los Angeles City Council meeting, where he raised his concerns about the title of a film to be screened that appeared to support the leader of al-Qaeda. He said \"There is an alarming event occurring in Hollywood on Saturday. A group has rented the Vine Street theater to show a video entitled \"Innocence of Bin Laden\". We have no idea what this group is.\" The blog site reported that the June 30 screening had been canceled. A Current TV producer photographed the poster while it was being displayed at the theater as advertising to later discuss on the talk show \"The Young Turks\". The poster did not denigrate Muslims, but rather referred to \"my Muslim brother\". In a translation provided by the ADL, the poster stated it would reveal \"the real terrorist who caused the killing of our children In Palestine, and our brothers in Iraq and Afghanistan\", a phrase that has been used by Palestinians to protest U.S. support of Israel.\n\nThe film was supported and promoted by pastor Terry Jones, known for a Quran-burning controversy, which also led to riots around the world. Jones said that he planned to show a 13-minute trailer at his church, the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, on September 11, 2012. It was reported on September 14, 2012, that a planned screening by a Hindu organization in Toronto would be coupled with \"snippets from other movies that are offensive to Christians and Hindus\". Because of security concerns no public venue was willing to show the film although the group still planned on showing the film in the future to a private audience of about 200 people. Siobhán Dowling of \"The Guardian\" reported that \"a far-right Islamophobic group in Germany\", the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement, had uploaded the trailer on their own website and wanted to show the entire film, but authorities were attempting to prevent it.\n\nThe video clips were posted to YouTube on July 1 by user \"sam bacile\"; however, by September, the film had been dubbed into Arabic and was drawn to the attention of the Arabic-speaking world by blogger Morris Sadek. Sadek's own Egyptian citizenship had been revoked. A two-minute excerpt dubbed in Arabic was broadcast on September 9 by Sheikh Khalad Abdalla on Al-Nas, an Egyptian television station.\n\nYouTube voluntarily blocked the video in Egypt and Libya and blocked the video in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, India, and Singapore due to local laws, while Turkey, Brazil, and Russia have initiated steps to get the video blocked. Google, Inc., the owner of YouTube, also blocked the video in Libya and Egypt citing \"the very difficult situation\" in those countries. In September 2012 the governments of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sudan and Pakistan blocked YouTube for not removing the video, saying that the website would remain suspended until the film was removed. Government authorities in Chechnya and Daghestan issued orders to internet providers to block YouTube and Iran announced that it was blocking Google and Gmail. Google also agreed to block the anti-Islamic movie in Jordan.\n\nThe White House asked YouTube to review whether to continue hosting the video at all under the company's policies. YouTube said the video fell within its guidelines as the video is against Islam, but not against Muslim people, and thus not considered \"hate speech\". Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union said of this, \"It does make us nervous when the government throws its weight behind any requests for censorship.\"\n\nOn February 26, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered YouTube to remove the video from its website by a 2-1 majority. The ruling was in response to a complaint by actress Cindy Lee Garcia, who had objected to the use of her performance, which had been partially dubbed for its inclusion in \"Innocence of Muslims\". Garcia had believed during production that she was appearing in a film called \"Desert Warrior\", which was described as a \"historical Arabian Desert adventure film\", and was unaware that anti-Islamic material would be added at the post-production stage. Garcia had argued that she held a copyright interest in her performance.\n\nIn May 2015, in an en banc opinion, the Ninth Circuit reversed the panel's decision, vacating the order for the preliminary injunction. Ibrahim Hooper, the National Communications Director and spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), advised that people should not watch the film.\n\nA \"Vanity Fair\" article described the video as \"Exceptionally amateurish, with disjointed dialogue, jumpy editing, and performances that would have looked melodramatic even in a silent movie, the clip is clearly designed to offend Muslims, portraying Mohammed as a bloodthirsty murderer and Lothario and pedophile with omnidirectional sexual appetites.\"\n\nProtests were held in many nations, through Islamic countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Australia.\n\n\n"}

He also founded the Freethought Association of Canada, which created the 2009 atheist bus campaign where Trottier served as one of the spokespersons. He also founded the Canadian Secular Alliance. In 2011, he was a Green Party candidate in the 2011 Ontario provincial election. Later, Trottier co-founded and has served as the chairman and spokesperson for the Canadian Association for Equality (CAFE), and was heavily involved in CAFE's campaign to open the Canadian Centre for Men and Families in 2014. He currently serves as the Centre's director.\n\nTrottier graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Engineering Science in 2006. His uncle, Lorne Trottier, is the co-founder of Matrox computing.\n\nIn 2005 Trottier founded the University of Toronto Secular Alliance with Jennie Fiddes. The organization successfully lobbied for the secularization of the University of Toronto's graduation ceremony through the removal of convocation prayers.\n\nIn March 2006, Trottier opened the Secular Freethought Centre, the first community centre in Canada for secular humanists. By January 2007 the Secular Freethought Centre had become the Centre for Inquiry Canada (CFI) and Trottier was hired as its first Executive Director. CFI currently operates 10 branches in Canada as a national educational charity. Until 2011, Trottier served as chief spokesperson and led the national office.\n\nIn June 2010, Trottier hired Nathan Phelps, the estranged son of Pastor Fred Phelps of the notoriously anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church, to head up the Calgary, Alberta, branch of the Centre for Inquiry. Trottier's Canadian Campaign for Free Expression sparked the Centre for Inquiry's annual Blasphemy Day.\n\nTrottier co-founded the One School System Network which advocates for the defunding of the tax-payer supported Roman Catholic School System in Ontario. The One School System Network lobbied against the Conservative Party leader John Tory's 2007 election campaign proposal to fund all private faith-based schools in Ontario fully.\n\nIn June 2014 he filed an affidavit and was granted intervenor status by the Supreme Court of Canada on behalf of the Canadian Secular Alliance, in the case of Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay, a Supreme Court of Canada case looking at the constitutionality of government prayer. Atheist Alain Simoneau and the secular rights organization Mouvement Laïque Québécois had initiated an action before the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) against Jean Tremblay, Mayor of the Quebec town of Saguenay, calling for an end to the practice of the municipal council initiating its city council meetings with a Catholic prayer, on the basis that doing so infringes on freedom of conscience and religion. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with the plaintiffs, and ordered an end to the practice.\n\nTrottier is the founder and former president of the Freethought Association of Canada. During his leadership he acted as one of the primary spokespersons for the 2009 Canadian Atheist Bus Campaign, which received considerable media attention. The campaign ran atheist ads on public transit vehicles in multiple Canadian cities. A variety of cities refused to run the ads, although some withdrew their prohibition after a Supreme Court ruling found banning political or controversial ads a violation of the free speech provision in the Canadian constitution.\n\nThe Canadian Atheist bus ads sparked counter campaigns in response, which Trottier publicly supported, including an ad sponsored by Syed Sohawardy of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada and another by the United Church of Canada.\n\nTrottier has made many media appearances, representing various atheist, men's issues, and political groups. In 2010 Trottier was the skeptical voice on the pilot episode of The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett, airing on VisionTV. He subsequently became a regular guest, speaking on crop circles, the Shroud of Turin and freemasonry. He has also been featured on the cover of \"Eye Weekly\" magazine, and been interviewed for Vision TV's two-part documentary \"Godless.\"\n\nSince January 2011, Trottier has appeared regularly on the \"John Oakley Shows Tuesday morning Culture War segment on Toronto Talk Radio AM640. His debate opponents have tended to be conservative religious leaders, including Reverend Charles McVety, Pastor Scott Masson, and Rabbi Mendel Kaplan. In April 2009, he was invited to become a contributor to the \"National Posts online Holy Post blog.\n\nIn 2005, Trottier joined the board of directors of the Canadian Space Society and had served as the society's external director and as the managing editor of its publication, the \"Canadian Space Gazette\". In 2012 Trottier became the executive producer and host of the Star Spot Radio Show and podcast. The program is aired on CJRU The Scope at Ryerson University.\n\nIn 2011, Trottier became the leader of the Toronto Men’s Issues Awareness Campaign. In an interview with the \"Toronto Star\" about the campaign, Trottier stated that \"in gender issues, it’s not as simple as women are always victims and men are always the victimizers,\" and that \"there’s a far more nuanced debate that we should be having.\" Describing the campaign as \"about equality and equalism,\" Trottier suggested that \"for all our talk of equality, it’s ironic that our societal investments have really been on women’s issues.\"\n\nTrottier co-founded, and currently acts as chair and spokesperson for the Canadian Association for Equality (CAFE). CAFE has often been described in the media as being a men's rights group, and has frequently been the subject of controversy.\n\nIn 2013, CAFE announced plans to build Toronto's first \"Men's Centre,\" to be named the Canadian Centre for Men and Families. Trottier was involved in CAFE's campaign to raise funds for and open the Canadian Centre for Men and Families, and he now serves as the Centre's director. Trottier has described the centre as a \"hub for men’s and boy’s issues and for the health and well-being of boys more generally,\" but it has also faced criticism from feminist and anti-domestic violence organizations such as the Toronto YWCA and the White Ribbon Campaign. The centre opened in downtown Toronto in August 2014, with programs including grief counseling, sexual trauma support, anger management, suicide prevention, fathering, tutoring and mentorship.\n\nIn 2011, Trottier became the Green Party of Ontario candidate in Parkdale-High Park in the 2011 Ontario general election.

{"id": "100191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100191", "title": "Lakshmi", "text": "Lakshmi\n\nLakshmi (; Tamil: இலட்சுமி , IAST: \"lakṣmī\") or Laxmi, is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. She is the wife and shakti (energy) of Vishnu, one of the principal deities of Hinduism and the Supreme Being in the Vaishnavism Tradition. With Parvati and Saraswati, she forms Tridevi, the holy trinity. Lakshmi is also an important deity in Jainism and found in Jain temples. Lakshmi has also been a goddess of abundance and fortune for Tamils and was represented on the oldest surviving stupas and cave temples of Hinduism. Goddess Lakshmi in Hinduism: The goddess of abundance and fortune, Sri Lakshmi, reflected the accumulated wealth and financial independence of the Tamil monasteries. \n\nLakshmi is also called Sri or Thirumagal because she is endowed with six auspicious and divine qualities, or gunas, and is the divine strength of Vishnu. In Hindu religion, she was born from the churning of the primordial ocean (Samudra manthan) and she chose Vishnu as her eternal consort. When Vishnu descended on the Earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi descended as his respective consort. In the ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi. The marriage and relationship between Lakshmi and Vishnu as wife and husband is the paradigm for rituals and ceremonies for the bride and groom in Hindu weddings. Lakshmi is considered another aspect of the same supreme goddess principle in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism.\n\nLakshmi is depicted in Indian art as an elegantly dressed, prosperity-showering golden-coloured woman with an owl as her vehicle, signifying the importance of economic activity in maintenance of life, her ability to move, work and prevail in confusing darkness. She typically stands or sits like a yogin on a lotus pedestal and holds lotus in her hand, a symbolism for fortune, self-knowledge and spiritual liberation. Her iconography shows her with four hands, which represent the four goals of human life considered important to the Hindu way of life: dharma, kāma, artha and moksha. She is often depicted as part of the trinity (Tridevi) consisting of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati.\n\nArchaeological discoveries and ancient coins suggest the recognition and reverence for Lakshmi by the 1st millennium BCE. Lakshmi's iconography and statues have also been found in Hindu temples throughout southeast Asia, estimated to be from the second half of the 1st millennium CE. The festivals of Diwali and Sharad Purnima (Kojagiri Purnima) are celebrated in her honor.\n\nLakshmi (Lakṣmī) is one of many Hindu deities whose meaning and significance evolved in ancient Sanskrit texts.\n\nLakshmi is mentioned once in Rigveda, but the context suggests that the word does not mean \"goddess of wealth and fortune,\" rather it means \"kindred mark or sign of auspicious fortune.\"\nIn Atharvaveda, transcribed about 1000 BCE, Lakshmi evolves into a complex concept with plural manifestations. Book 7, Chapter 115 of Atharva Veda describes the plurality, asserting that a hundred Lakshmis are born with the body of a mortal at birth, some good, \"punya\" (virtuous) and auspicious, while others bad, \"paapi\" (evil) and unfortunate. The good are welcomed, while the bad urged to leave. The concept and spirit of Lakshmi and her association with fortune and the good is significant enough that Atharva Veda mentions it in multiple books: for example, in Book 12, Chapter 5 as \"punya Lakshmi\". In some chapters of Atharva Veda, Lakshmi connotes the good, an auspicious sign, good luck, good fortune, prosperity, success and happiness.\n\nLater, Lakshmi is referred to as the goddess of fortune, identified with Sri and regarded as wife of (). For example, in Shatapatha Brahmana, variously estimated to be composed between 800 BCE and 300 BCE, Sri (Lakshmi) is part of one of many theories, in ancient India, about the creation of universe. In Book 9 of Shatapatha Brahmana, Sri emerges from Prajapati, after his intense meditation on creation of life and nature of universe. Sri is described as beautiful, resplendent and trembling woman at her birth with immense energy and powers. The gods were bewitched, desire her and immediately become covetous of her. The gods approach Prajapati and request permission to kill her and then take her powers, talents and gifts. Prajapati refuses, tells the gods that males should not kill females and that they can seek her gifts without violence. The gods then approach Lakshmi, deity Agni gets food, Soma gets kingly authority, Varuna gets imperial authority, Mitra acquires martial energy, Indra gets force, Brihaspati gets priestly authority, Savitri acquires dominion, Pushan gets splendour, Saraswati takes nourishment and Tvashtri gets forms. The hymns of Shatapatha Brahmana thus describe Sri as a goddess born with and personifying a diverse range of talents and powers.\n\nAccording to another legend, she emerges during the creation of universe, floating over the water on the expanded petals of a lotus flower; she is also variously regarded as wife of Dharma, mother of Kāma, sister or mother of and , wife of Dattatreya, one of the nine Shaktis of , a manifestation of as identified with in Bharatasrama and as Sita, wife of Rama.\n\nIn the Epics of Hinduism, such as in Mahabharata, Lakshmi personifies wealth, riches, happiness, loveliness, grace, charm and splendour. In another Hindu legend, about the creation of universe as described in Ramayana, Lakshmi springs with other precious things from the foam of the ocean of milk when it is churned by the gods and demons for the recovery of . She appeared with a lotus in her hand and so she is also called Padmā.\n\nLakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from the root word \"lakṣ\" () and \"lakṣa\"(), meaning \"to perceive, observe, know, understand\" and \"goal, aim, objective\" respectively. These roots give Lakshmi the symbolism: know and understand your goal. A related term is \"lakṣaṇa\", which means \"sign, target, aim, symbol, attribute, quality, lucky mark, auspicious opportunity.\"\n\nThe image, icons and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism. Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective. Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism - dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra (Sahasrara) context. The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which its grows. It is a reminder that good and prosperity can bloom and not be affected by evil in one's surrounding. Below, behind or on the sides, Lakshmi is sometimes shown with one or two elephants and occasionally with an owl. Elephants symbolise work, activity and strength, as well as water, rain and fertility for abundant prosperity. The owl signifies the patient striving to observe, see and discover knowledge particularly when surrounded by darkness. As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight, the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth has been acquired.\nIn some representations, wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money. This symbolism has a dual meaning: wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both material as well as spiritual wealth. Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signify compassion, giving or \"daana\"(charity).\n\nLakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads, symbolism for and wealth. She, goddess of wealth and prosperity, is often represented with her husband Vishnu, the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace. This symbolism implies wealth and prosperity is coupled with maintenance of life, justice, and peace.\n\nLakshmi has numerous names and numerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite her various names:\n\n\nHer other names include: Ambika, Manushri, Mohini, Chakrika, Kamalika, Aishwarya, Lalima, Indira, Kalyani, Nandika, Nandini, Rujula, Vaishnavi, Samruddhi, Narayani, Bhargavi, Sridevi, Chanchala, Jalaja, Madhavi, Sujata, Shreeya, Prachi, Haripriya, Maheshwari, Madhu, Parama, Janamodini, Tripura, Tulsi, Ketki, Malti, Vidya, Vasuda, Vedavati, Trilochana, Tilottama, Subha, Chandika, Devi, Kriyalakshmi, Viroopa, Vani, Gayatri, Savitri, Apara or Aparajita, Aparna, Aruna, Akhila, Bala, Tara, Kuhu, Purnima, Aditi, Anumati, Avashya, Sita, Rama, Rukmini, Taruni, Jyotsna, Jyoti, Nimeshika, Atibha, Ishaani, Swarna Kamala, Smriti, Durga, Sharanya, Shivasahodari Sri.\n\nShakta Upanishads are dedicated to the trinity (Tridevi) of goddesses - Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati. Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad, describes the qualities, characteristics and powers of Lakshmi. In the second part of the Upanishad, the emphasis shifts to the use of yoga and transcendence from material craving in order to achieve spiritual knowledge and self-realisation, the true wealth. Saubhagya-Lakshmi Upanishad synonymously uses Sri to describe Lakshmi.\n\nNumerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite hymns dedicated to Lakshmi. She is a major goddess in Puranas and Itihasa of Hinduism. In ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi. For example,\n\nAncient prayers dedicated to Lakshmi seek both material and spiritual wealth in prayers.\n\nLakshmi features prominently in Puranas of Hinduism. Vishnu Purana, in particular, dedicates many sections to her and also refers to her as Sri. J. A. B. van Buitenen translates passages describing Lakshmi in Vishnu Purana as, \"Sri, loyal to Vishnu, is the mother of the world. Vishnu is the meaning, Sri is the speech. She is the conduct, he the behavior. Vishnu is knowledge, she the insight. He is dharma, she the virtuous action. She is the earth, he earth's upholder. She is contentment, he the satisfaction. She is wish, he is the desire. Sri is the sky, Vishnu the Self of everything. He is the moon, she the light of moon. He is the ocean, she is the shore\".\n\nLakshmi, along with Parvati and Saraswati, is a subject of extensive Subhashita, gnomic and didactic literature of India. Composed in the 1st millennium BC through the 16th century AD, they are short poems, proverbs, couplets, or aphorisms in Sanskrit written in a precise meter. They sometimes take the form of dialogue between Lakshmi and Vishnu or highlight the spiritual message in Vedas and ethical maxims from Hindu Epics through Lakshmi. An example Subhashita is \"Puranartha Samgraha\", compiled by Vekataraya in South India, where Lakshmi and Vishnu discuss \"niti\"(right, moral conduct) and \"rajaniti\"(statesmanship, right governance) - covering in 30 chapters and ethical and moral questions about personal, social and political life.\n\nIn eastern India, Lakshmi is seen as a form of one goddess Devi, the Supreme power; Devi is also called Durga or Adi Parashakti. Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Parvati are typically conceptualised as distinct in most of India, but in states such as West Bengal and Odisha, they are regionally believed to be forms of Durga.\n\nLakshmi is seen in two forms, Bhudevi and Sridevi, both at the sides of Sri Venkateshwara or Vishnu. Bhudevi is the representation and totality of the material world or energy, called the aparam Prakriti, in which she is called Mother Earth. Sridevi is the spiritual world or energy called the Prakriti. Lakshmi is the power of Vishnu.\n\nInside temples, Lakshmi is often shown together with Vishnu. In certain parts of India, Lakshmi plays a special role as the mediator between her husband Vishnu and his worldly devotees. When asking Vishnu for grace or forgiveness, the devotees often approach Him through the intermediary presence of Lakshmi. She is also the personification of spiritual fulfillment. Lakshmi embodies the spiritual world, also known as Vaikunta, the abode of Lakshmi-Narayana or what would be considered heaven in Vaishnavism. Lakshmi is the embodiment of the creative energy of Vishnu, and primordial Prakriti who creates the universe.\n\nIn South India, she is also worshipped as Andal,an incarnation of Lakshmi.\n\nAshta Lakshmi(Sanskrit: अष्टलक्ष्मी, lit. \"eight Lakshmis\") is a group of eight secondary manifestations of Lakshmi. The Ashta Lakshmis preside over eight sources of wealth and thus represent the eight powers of Shri Lakshmi. Temples dedicated to Ashta Lakshmi are found in Tamil Nadu, such as Ashtalakshmi Kovil near Chennai and in many other states of India.\n\nThe Ashta Lakshmis are as follows:\n\nOther secondary representations of the goddess include Lakshmi manifesting in three forms: Sri Devi, Bhudevi and Nila Devi. This threefold goddess can be found, for example, in Sri Bhu Neela Sahita Temple near Dwaraka Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, and in Adinath Swami Temple in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn Nepal, Mahalakshmi is shown with 16 hands, each holding a sacred emblem, expressing a sacred gesture, or forming a mudra(lotus, pot, mudra of blessing, book, rosary, bell, shield, bow, arrow, sword, trident, mudra of admonition, noose, skull cap and kettledrum.) In this representation, Mahalakshmi manifests as a kind, compassionate, tranquil deity sitting not on a lotus, but on a lion.\n\nSome Jain temples also depict Sri Lakshmi as a goddess of artha (wealth) and kama (pleasure). For example, she is exhibited with Vishnu in Parshvanatha Jain Temple at the Khajuraho Monuments of Madhya Pradesh, where she is shown pressed against Vishnu's chest, while Vishnu cups a breast in his palm. The presence of Vishnu-Lakshmi iconography in a Jain temple built near the Hindu temples of Khajuraho, suggests the sharing and acceptance of Lakshmi across a spectrum of Indian religions. This commonality is reflected in the praise of Lakshmi found in the Jain text Kalpa Sūtra.\n\nDevas (gods) and asuras (demons) were both mortal at one time in Hinduism. Amrita, the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar (Ocean of Milk). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The samudra manthan commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. Vishnu incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. Vasuki, the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.\n\nIn Garuda Purana, Linga Purana and Padma Purana, Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati and was named \"Bhargavi\". According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the \"Devas\"(god) and \"Asuras\"(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk(Ksheera Sagara). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow Kamadhenu, Varuni, Parijat tree, Apsaras, Chandra(the moon) and Dhanvantari with Amrita(nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.\n\nMany Hindus worship Lakshmi on Diwali, the festival of lights. It is celebrated in autumn, typically October or November every year. The festival spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil and hope over despair.\n\nBefore Diwali night, people clean, renovate and decorate their homes and offices. On Diwali night, Hindus dress up in new clothes or their best outfits, light up diyas (lamps and candles) inside and outside their home, and participate in family \"puja\" (prayers) typically to Lakshmi. After \"puja\", fireworks follow, then a family feast including \"mithai\" (sweets), and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends. Diwali also marks a major shopping period, since Lakshmi connotes auspiciousness, wealth and prosperity. This festival dedicated to Lakshmi is considered by Hindus to be one of the most important and joyous festivals of the year.\n\nGaja Lakshmi Puja is another autumn festival celebrated on Sharad Purnima in many parts of India on the full-moon day in the month of Ashvin (October). Sharad Purnima, also called Kojaagari Purnima or Kuanr Purnima, is a harvest festival marking the end of monsoon season. There is a traditional celebration of the moon called the \"Kaumudi celebration\", Kaumudi meaning moonlight. On Sharad Purnima night, goddess Lakshmi is thanked and worshipped for the harvests.\n\nCountless hymns, prayers, shlokas, stotra, songs and legends dedicated to Mahalakshmi are recited during the ritual worship of Lakshmi.\n\nThese include Sri Mahalakshmi Ashtakam, Sri Lakshmi Sahasaranama Stotra(by Sanathkumara), Sri Stuti(by Sri Vedantha Desikar), Sri Lakshmi Stuti By Indra, Sri Kanakadhara Stotra(by Sri Adi Shankara), Sri Chatussloki(by Sri Yamunacharya), Narayani Stuti, Devi Mahatmyam Middle episode, Argala Stotra, Sri Lakshmi Sloka(by Bhagavan Sri Hari Swamiji) and Sri Sukta, which is contained in the Vedas. Sri Sukta contains Lakshmi Gayatri Mantra(Om Shree Mahalakshmyai ca vidmahe Vishnu patnyai ca dheemahi tanno Lakshmi prachodayat Om).\n\nA representation of the goddess as Gaja Lakshmi or Lakshmi flanked by two elephants spraying her with water, is one of the most frequently found in archaeological sites. An ancient sculpture of Gaja Lakshmi (from Sonkh site at Mathura) dates to the pre-Kushan Empire era. Atranjikhera site in modern Uttar Pradesh has yielded terracotta plaque with images of Lakshmi dating to 2nd century BCE. Other archaeological sites with ancient Lakshmi terracotta figurines from the 1st millennium BCE include Vaisali, Sravasti, Kausambi, Campa, and Candraketugadh.\n\nThe goddess Lakshmi is frequently found in ancient coins of various Hindu kingdoms from Afghanistan to India. Gaja Lakshmi has been found on coins of Scytho-Parthian kings Azes II and Azilises; she also appears on Shunga Empire king Jyesthamitra era coins, both dating to 1st millennium BCE. Coins from 1st through 4th century CE found in various locations in India such as Ayodhya, Mathura, Ujjain, Sanchi, Bodh Gaya, Kanauj, all feature Lakshmi. Similarly, ancient Greco-Indian gems and seals with images of Lakshmi have been found, estimated to be from 1st millennium BCE.\n\nA 1400-year-old rare granite sculpture of Lakshmi has been recovered at the Waghama village along Jehlum in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nA statuette supposedly thought to be of Lakshmi found in Pompeii, Italy, dates to before the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE.\n\nGoddess Kishijoten of Japan corresponds to Lakshmi. Kishijoten is the goddess of fortune and prosperity. Kishijoten is considered the sister of the deity Bishamon (毘沙門, also known as Tamon or Bishamon-ten); Bishamon protects human life, fights evil, and brings good fortune. In ancient and medieval Japan, Kishijoten was the goddess worshiped for luck and prosperity, particularly on behalf of children. Kishijoten was also the guardian goddess of Geishas. While Bishamon and Kishijoten are found in ancient Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, their roots have been traced to deities in Hinduism.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism she is an important deity, especially in the Gelug School. She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her wrathful form is known as Palden Lhamo or Shri Devi Dudsol Dokam or Kamadhatvishvari, and is the principal female protector of (Gelug) Tibetan Buddhism and of Lhasa, Tibet.\n\nGoddess Vasudhara in Tibetan and Nepalese culture is closely analogous to goddess Lakshmi as well.\n\nGoddess Lakshmi is closely linked to a goddess worshipped in Bali, i.e. Dewi Sri, as the goddess of fertility and agriculture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1373092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1373092", "title": "Law of chastity", "text": "Law of chastity\n\nThe law of chastity is a moral code defined by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). According to the church, chastity means that \"sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\" Therefore, abstinence from sexual relations before marriage, and complete fidelity to one's spouse during marriage, are required. As part of the law of chastity, the church teaches its members to abstain from adultery and fornication. The law of chastity is taught to church members of all ages, and is especially emphasized to adolescents.\n\nWithin the LDS Church, chastity means more than abstinence from sex. It means to be morally clean in \"thoughts, words, and actions.\" It also means sexual relations are only permitted between a husband and wife. The church teaches its members that \"no one, male or female, is to have sexual relations before marriage. After marriage, sexual relations are permitted only with our spouse.\"\n\nMormons believe that sexuality between man and woman lawfully married is divinely appointed and has two purposes: to \"multiply, and replenish the Earth\" () as commanded by God to Adam and Eve, and to strengthen the bond between man and woman that they might \"become one flesh\" (). A church handbook for leaders states that married couples should be made aware \"that sexual relations within marriage are divinely approved not only for the purpose of procreation, but also as a way of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife.\" \n\nThe church has made its views clear in many publications and in recent news releases that \"marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God\". While opposing homosexual behavior, the church advises its leaders and members to reach out with understanding and respect to individuals who are attracted to those of the same gender. \n\nSexual relations are deemed proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same gender, are sinful and undermine the divinely created institution of the family. The church accordingly affirms defining marriage as the legal and lawful union between a man and a woman.\n\nAn LDS Church publication targeted at youth states: \"Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body.” Youth are taught in church classes that sexual relations are sacred, and they should avoid \"fondling of bodies, one's own or that of others\". Masturbation is \"not condoned but is not considered homosexual\".\n\nThe LDS Church places great emphasis on the law of chastity. Commitment to live the law of chastity is required for baptism, and adherence is required to receive a temple recommend.\n\nThe Book of Mormon teaches that sexual sins are \"most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost\" (). Church leaders have similarly emphasized its importance.\n\nApostle Spencer W. Kimball, in his book \"Miracle of Forgiveness\", quoted Heber J. Grant as saying, \"[t]here is no true Latter-day Saint who would not rather bury a son or daughter than to have him or her lose his or her chastity—realizing that chastity is of more value than anything else in all the world.\"\n\nLDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson wrote:\n\nViolation of the law of chastity may result in church discipline, including disfellowshipment or excommunication.\n\nThe law of chastity is one of the covenants members of the LDS Church promise by oath to keep during the endowment ceremony of the temple.\n\nActivities considered a violation of the law of chastity include both adultery and fornication as well as broader behavior. While serving as church president, Kimball taught that the law of chastity encompasses \"all sexual relations outside marriage—petting, sex perversion, masturbation, and preoccupation with sex in one's thoughts and talking. Included are every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices.\"\n\nVictims of rape, incest, or sexual abuse are not guilty of sin and are not considered to have broken the law of chastity. However, they often feel that they have lost their virtue, which intensifies the feelings of shame and guilt experienced by many victims of rape. In the Book of Mormon, it states, \"For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue\". In a general conference address, Richard G. Scott explained, \"The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender. At some point in time, however, the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed.\"\n\nIn addition, members are taught to dress modestly, to control their thoughts, and to avoid pornography. Dressing immodestly is not a violation of the law of chastity, but \"modesty promotes chastity\". Members who are married are instructed to \"be faithful to your spouse in thought, word, and action. Stay away from situations where temptation may develop.\"\n\nAccording to the church, even though the violation of the law of chastity is considered a serious sin, one who has violated the law of chastity can repent and receive forgiveness from God.\n\nThe LDS church teaches that same-sex sexual and romantic feelings are not a choice or sin and that members should be supported in identifying with terms like gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Members whose sexual orientation is not strictly heterosexual can participate in temple ordinances and remain in good standing, although, for this they are not allowed to express their sexuality through dating people of the same sex. These teachings leave strictly-homosexually-oriented members with the option of entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).\n\nOn many occasions church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the law of chastity. Salient examples of this include a church guide to stop masturbating produced in the 1970s. Another is the 1990 edition of the church's youth guidelines pamphlet which stated that the \"Lord specifically forbids ... masturbation\" with the next two editions (including the most current one) alluding to it with statements forbidding anything that \"arouses\" any sexual feelings or emotions in one's \"own body\". Apostle Spencer W. Kimball, who later served as church president, warned of the \"possible damages\" and \"dangers\" of this \"common indescretion\" on various occasions calling it a \"reprehensible sin\" that grows \"with every exercise\". \n\nThe apostle Boyd Packer gave a 1976 general conference address \"To Young Men Only\" warning young men not to tamper with their little factory (a euphemism for their reproductive system) lest it speed up and become a guilt-and depression-inducing habit that is not easy to resist. He gave vigorous exercise as a method to help control thoughts and break the habit of masturbation since it is a \"transgression\" that is \"not pleasing to the Lord\". The talk was printed as a pamphlet and widely distributed by the church from 1980 to 2016. Since 1985 the church has provided a manual for parents to use in discussing sexuality with their children. The manual includes statements that \"prophets have condemned [masturbation] as a sin\" and \"perversion of the body's passions\" that causes one to \"become carnal\". The most recent explicit mention of masturbation by top leaders in public discourse was by Tad R. Callister who stated in a 2013 speech at BYU-Idaho that God \"condemns self-abuse\" (a euphemism for masturbation).\n\nAs part of teaching the law of chastity, LDS Church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature and visual material for decades.\n\n"}

{"id": "766488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766488", "title": "Marketplace of ideas", "text": "Marketplace of ideas\n\nThe marketplace of ideas is a rationale for freedom of expression based on an analogy to the economic concept of a free market. The marketplace of ideas holds that the truth will emerge from the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse, and concludes that ideas and ideologies will be culled according to their superiority or inferiority and widespread acceptance among the population. The concept is often applied to discussions of patent law as well as freedom of the press and the responsibilities of the media in a liberal democracy.\n\nThe marketplace of ideas metaphor is founded in the philosophy of John Milton in his work \"Areopagitica\" in 1644 and also John Stuart Mill in his book, \"On Liberty\" in 1859. It was later used in opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States. The first reference to the \"free trade in ideas\" within \"the competition of the market\" appears in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s dissent in \"Abrams v. United States\". The phrase \"marketplace of ideas\" first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice William O. Douglas in the Supreme Court decision \"United States v. Rumely\" in 1953: \"Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas.\" The Court's 1969 decision in \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\" enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in American free speech law (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons, the 1976 decision \"Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council\" expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process. It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence, but the legacy of those decisions have lead to subsequent decisions like \"Citizens United v. FEC\" that curtailed the government's ability to regulate corporate speech and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political, than Americans had experienced previously.\n\nThe general idea that free speech should be tolerated because it will lead toward the truth has a long history. The English poet John Milton suggested that restricting speech was not necessary because \"in a free and open encounter\", truth would prevail. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson argued that it is safe to tolerate \"error of opinion ... where reason is left free to combat it\". Fredrick Siebert echoed the idea that free expression is self-correcting in \"Four Theories of the Press\": \"Let all with something to say be free to express themselves. The true and sound will survive. The false and unsound will be vanquished. Government should keep out of the battle and not weigh the odds in favor of one side or the other.\" These writers did not rely on the economic analogy to a market.\n\nIf beliefs such as religions are considered as ideas, the marketplace of ideas concept favors a marketplace of religions rather than forcing a state religion or forbidding incompatible beliefs. In this sense, it provides a rationale for freedom of religion.\n\nIn recent years questions have arisen regarding the existence of markets in ideas. Several scholars have noted differences between the way ideas are produced and consumed and the way more traditional goods are produced and consumed. It has also been argued that the idea of the marketplace of ideas as applied to religion \"incorrectly assumes a level playing field\" among religions. In addition, the idea of a marketplace of ideas has been applied to the study of scientific research as a social institution.\n\n"}

The priest chants Psalm 128, \"Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways...\" This psalm is one of the \"Psalms of Ascent\" sung by Jewish pilgrims on the way to the Jerusalem Temple. This point in the service most clearly reveals the \"action\" of the sacrament. The couple brings themselves, each other, their lives, and all that fills their lives, to the altar as an offering to God. As the couple enters into the midst of the Church, their relationship enters into the new reality of God's Kingdom.\n\nHaving processed into the church, the couple must individually proclaim, before the assembly, that they have come freely, without constraints or prior commitment, to be joined by God as husband and wife. (In modern practice, these proclamations are often done at the beginning, before the exchange of the rings.)\n\nThe bride and groom are then handed candles which are held throughout the service. The candles represent the couple's faith and willingness to follow the Light of Truth, Jesus Christ, and that they will have their way through life lighted by the teachings of the Church.\n\nAfter prayers are offered on their behalf, the groom and bride are crowned by the priest \"In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\":\n\nO Lord, our God, crown them in glory and in honour.\nThe crowns have two meanings. First, they reveal that the man and woman, in their union with Christ, participate in His Kingship. Second, as in the ancient Church, crowns are a symbol of martyrdom. The word \"martyr\" means witness. The common life of the bride and groom is to bear witness to the Presence of Christ in their lives and in the world. Martyrdom is usually associated with death. So the reality of God's Kingdom in the life of the husband and wife will necessarily take the form of dying to one's self, to one's will, and the giving of one's life totally to the other, and through the other, to Christ.\n\nThe epistle is taken from St. Paul's letter to the Ephesians (5:20-33). It presents the cornerstone of the Christian vision of marriage: the love of man and woman parallels the love of Christ and the Church. As Christ gives Himself totally to and for His Church, so the husband is to give himself totally to and for his wife. As the Church, in turn, is subject to Christ, so the wife subjects herself to her husband. Thus the two become one in a life of mutual love and mutual subjection to each other in Christ.\n\nThe gospel, from John (2:1-11), is the familiar account of the Marriage at Cana where Christ turns the water into wine. A person must drink water simply to survive. Wine, on the other hand, is more than just a drink that quenches thirst and continues life. Wine is associated with joy, with celebration, with life as being more than mere survival. By His presence at this wedding He changes the union of man and woman into something new. Marriage becomes more than a mere human institution, existing for whatever purpose a society assigns it. It becomes, like the Church Herself, a sign that God's Kingdom has already begun in our midst.\n\nAfter more prayers, a common cup of sweet wine is blessed and shared by the couple as a sign of their common life together, a sharing of joys and sorrows, successes and failures, hopes and fears:\n\nI shall partake in the Cup of Salvation,<br>\nand I shall invoke the name of the Lord.\n\nThis is followed by the triple procession around the center table: the \"Dance of Isaiah\". The priest, holding the Gospel or Blessing Cross and the clasped hands of the groom and bride, and followed by the best man (or woman) who holds the newlyweds' crowns above their heads, and the bridesmaids holding the lit white candles, walk three counterclockwise turns around the table in a celebratory \"dance\". Each of the three turns is accompanied by each of the three hymns, which return once more to the theme of martyrdom and union with Christ. These are the hymns that, since ancient times, the Church has used to emphasize God's blessings, and the same ones sung at ordinations to ecclesiastical orders. They signify that this couple has been set apart from the mundane world to live a life in Christ:\n\nThroughout the service, things are done in threes in remembrance of the Trinity. Man is made in the image and likeness of God. Marriage is intended by God to be an image of the Trinity. It is the union of three persons, not two. Man and woman are one with each other and one with the person of Jesus Christ.\n\nAt the end of the service, the crowns are removed and the priest prays that God will receive these crowns into His Kingdom. The reality of the Kingdom into which the bride and groom have entered is not completely fulfilled, but only begun. Husband and wife must receive God's Kingdom and make it both a present reality and a challenge and goal of their common life, in that sense, the Christ-centered marriage is eternal: \"every relationship formed in this life will continue in the next life, in a deeply healed and purified way.\" Completion and fulfillment will come when Christ returns in power and glory to complete the establishment of His Kingdom in this world by filling all things with Himself.\n\nAt the end of the service, the couple stands at the foot of the altar. From the beginning, at the back of the church, they have now progressed to the forefront. Only the eternal Kingdom of Jesus Christ, as signified by the Altar, remains ahead of them. The couple's final act is to turn and face the assembled Church. Through this sacrament, they have become an icon of the Church and icon of Christ and the assembly comes up to congratulate them and share in their joy.\n\nDivorce is permitted in the Orthodox Church for various reasons. The more usual divorce occurs under the pastoral guidance of the spiritual director of the spouses when all attempts at salvaging a marriage have been exhausted. In such cases, remarriage may be possible but there is a special rite for a second marriage which contains a penitential element for the dissolution of the first, i.e. some of the more joyful aspects are removed. Marriage is permitted up to three times in Orthodoxy but each divorce necessitates a short period of excommunication. \n\nAnother type of divorce is what is known as a \"hieratic divorce\", which does not signify the breakdown of the relationship but is a step taken for the sake of the theosis of the spouses and with the full support and blessing of the Church. This type of divorce may only take place where there is mutual agreement between the two spouses, and is usually carried out in cases where one or both spouses wish to enter into monasticism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323382", "title": "Prayer in the Hebrew Bible", "text": "Prayer in the Hebrew Bible\n\nPrayer in the Hebrew Bible is an evolving means of interacting with God, most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, though beginning in Deuteronomy, the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews.\n\nIndividual prayer is described by the \"Tanakh\" two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.\n\nOften in the Hebrew Bible, individuals spontaneously pray to God when faced with difficulty or having avoided it. As mentioned above, these prayers are not always given in full, however, many are fully related. Certain themes appear throughout the Tanakh's portrayal of this prayer type. One of the most significant is the idea of argumentation, which is frequently described by the text, or its interpreters. \n\nListed chronologically below are these occurrences of recorded individual prayer.\n\nThe first notable prayer whose text is recorded in the Torah and Hebrew Bible occurs when Abraham pleads with God not to destroy the people of Sodom, where his nephew Lot resides. He bargains with God not to destroy the city if there are fifty good men within, and eventually lowers to total to ten. God sends two angels to the city, which is ultimately destroyed with \"burning sulfur\" when they cannot find the ten requisite good people.\n\nWhen Abraham is an old man, he makes his head servant, who while not named specifically, is almost certainly Eliezer of Damascus, promise to find his son Isaac a wife from his people to marry. Eliezer expresses uncertainty that a woman will agree to return to Abraham's household, especially since he is told not to bring Isaac with him. In response, Abraham tells Eliezer that God will send an angel to assure his success in his mission. Eliezer, however, upon reaching the town of Nahor's well during evening, when the women of the city would draw water, begins to pray. \n\nEliezer's prayer makes very specific of God, hoping that God will make clear which woman is to be Isaac's wife. It takes on a petitioning tone, as opposed to the argumentative one prominent in the prayers of other characters, including his master, whose relationship and interactions with God are very different. Before he has finished with his prayer, his requests begin to be granted, and sees that Rebbecca is the chosen maiden. Eliezer rushes home with her and she and Isaac are married.\n\nWhen Jacob is to reunite with his brother Esau, he prays in distress that God save him from what he fears will be an attack on him, his family, and his servants. Similarly to his grandfather Abraham, his prayer lays out an argument, in this case by invoking statements God had made in the past to convince God to aid him. Jacob's prayer does not seem to impact his optimism, for when Esau approaches, he divides his children among his maidservants and wives, so as to protect them from what he still feels is an immanent attack. The Torah, however, when taken literally, describes a joyful meeting, with Esau disregarding formalities so as to embrace his brother, although interpreters suggest Esau actually attacked his younger brother.\n\nMoses, the most recurring character in the Torah, prays comparatively little in a truly spontaneous petitioning or thanking form. The one occasion that is most definitely prayer takes place when, in the Book of Exodus, following the making of the Golden Calf, he prays for God to be merciful with his people. The literal reading of the text does not include an argument made by Moses, in a similar manner to other characters, however, Rashi describes him as blaming God for the people's sin, and therefore interprets the prayer to be more similar to those said by Abraham and Jacob.\n\n\"See: Song of the sea\"\n\nIn the Book of Joshua, the Israelites battle against many different opposing nations. The book's seventh chapter describes how God punishes His people by causing them to lose a battle as a result of their sinning. Following news of the defeat, Joshua and the elders of Israel tear their clothes and lie face down in front of the Ark of the Covenant, and following that, Joshua prays to God bemoaning his people's lowered moral, vulnerability to attack, and possible extermination.\n\nIn 1 Samuel 1, Hannah prays for a child. 1 Samuel 1:13 says that \"Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard\" (NIV). The priest Eli thinks that she is drunk, but Hannah protests her innocence. After Hannah gives birth to a son, Samuel, she prays a prayer which is recorded in 1 Samuel 2:1-10. This is normally called the Song of Hannah, but according to 1 Samuel 2:1, it is a prayer.\n\nEugene Peterson suggests that to Eli, the \"normal way of prayer\" was \"by means of ritual, incense, and animal sacrifice, a gathering of the community directed by a priest.\" Hannah is \"soaring past all the liturgical conventions of her age... She uses her own words, her own voice, without intermediaries.\"\n\nOrganized prayer is first introduced in the Hebrew Bible in Deuteronomy, when the recitation of prayer over the fruit bringing sacrifice is mandated, and liturgy established for the first time, in Deuteronomy. Moses mandates that one who goes to offer the sacrifice recite a basic creed, declaring his people's heritage and history, as well as a prayer of thanks to God for the fruits they have harvested. Moses also requires Israelites to, at certain times, recite a declaration saying they have not transgressed any of the \"mitzvot.\"\n\n"}

The Sahajdhari Sikhs reject most of the prohibitions, including trimming of hair (Kesh). Some young Sikhs are now cutting their hair to the dismay of spiritual leaders. According to the Sikh clergy, \"the fad among youth to shed the pagri\" is being observed more commonly among the Sikh youth in Punjab than Sikhs in other Indian states.\n\nNihang Sikhs of Punjab, who are defenders of historic Sikh shrines, are an exception and consume an intoxicant called \"bhang\" (cannabis sativa), opium and other narcotics to help in meditation saying that it is \"puratan maryada\" (Punjabi for \"old tradition\"). Bhang is common in India; according to a legend, even the Hindu God Shiva was fond of bhang and it became his favourite food. In 2001, Baba Santa Singh, the Jathedar of Budha Dal, along with 20 Nihang sect chiefs, refused to accept the ban on the consumption of \"bhang\" by the highest Sikh clergy. Baba Santa Singh was excommunicated and replaced with Baba Balbir Singh, who agreed to shun the consumption of \"bhang\".\n\nThe Udasis, who consider themselves as a denomination of Sikhism, lay emphasis on being ascetic, thus violating the \"Non-family-oriented living\" principle.

Qabb Ilyas is 15 kilometers from Zahleh and from the Lebanese capital Beirut. Its average elevations is above sea level. Its area is approximately 32 km². Qabb Ilyas is the third largest city in the Beqaa Valley, after Zahleh and Baalbek in terms of area size and geography. The majority of the residents are Sunni Muslims.\n\nAccording to the 19th-century Lebanese historian Haydar al-Shihabi, the town was originally called al-Muruj. Local tradition holds that the town's current name \"Qabb Ilyas\" is derived from \"Qabr Ilyas\" (\"grave of Ilyas\"), but was shortened over time to \"Qab Ilyas\". Ilyas was an 8th-century \"muqaddam\" from Mount Lebanon, who was killed during a raid in the Beqaa Valley by the forces of the Abbasid governor of Damascus.\n\nIn the late 16th century, the Bedouin chieftain of the Beqaa Valley, Mansur ibn Furaykh, used Qabb Ilyas as one of his headquarters. He had a palatial home built in the village. Two years after his execution in Damascus by the Ottoman authorities in December 1593, the Druze sheikh Ali Jumblatt took over the Beqaa Valley during his rebellion against the governor of Damascus Eyalet. During this rebellion, Mansur's home was seized by the Druze Ma'ani emir, Fakhr ad-Din II, who refused to restore it to Mansur's brother Murad ibn Furaykh despite an imperial Ottoman decree. The sons of Mansur, Nasrallah and Muhammad, continued to struggle for control of the property during Fakhr ad-Din's exile as the Shia Harfushi sheikh Yunus al-Harfush took possession of the home.\n\nThe Ma'an dynasty built a formidable fortress in Qabb Ilyas that later emirs of Lebanon commissioned during times of rebellion against the Ottomans. Sayyid-Ahmad Shihab occupied Qabb Ilyas in 1773 and robbed a group of Damascene merchants there, for which he was condemned and evicted from the area by his brother Emir Yusuf Shihab. In the mid-1820s, the Ottoman wali of Damascus, Darwish Pasha, defeated Emir Bashir Shihab II and proceeded to demolish most of what remained of the Fakhr ad-Din Castle. He then assigned a Muslim from the Aleppo-based Araqtanji family to govern Qabb Ilyas.\n\nDuring the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, the Druze used Qabb Ilyas, which at the time was a religiously mixed village, as their local headquarters in the Beqaa Valley and it withstood a raid by fighters from the nearby Christian stronghold Zahle. During French military intervention in the conflict, the French Army occupied Qabb Ilyas and maintained a military force there to guard the Beqaa Valley and southern Mount Lebanon. The Ottomans established an army garrison at Qabb Ilyas at the French withdrawal.\n\nThe Fakhr ad-Din II Citadel in Qabb Ilyas is believed to have been one of the largest Citadel in the Beqaa Valley. It is also thought to have been built by the Druze prince Fakhr ad-Din II, who chose the location for its elevation and defensibility against potential assaults by the [Mamalik]] military. The citadel was eventually destroyed by the Ottomans, but the ruins remain.\n\nThe Haidara ruins are believed to date back to the Roman era. According to local legend, there was once a mirror on the face of the building that used to reflect sunlight down into the village, related to sun-worshiping Roman practices.\n\nQabb Ilyas is administered by an elected municipal council with six-year terms. It has administrative and financial independence, but remains under the control and supervision of the central government.\n\nIt is estimated that Qabb Ilyas had a population of around 50,000 as of 2011. By 2013, as a result of the Syrian Civil War, about 18,000 Syrian refugees were living in Qabb Ilyas as well. The population lived in the following areas: Qabb Ilyas Fauka, Qabb Ilyas Tahta, Wadi El Delm, Farm of Bmahray, Bahsasa. In the 2004 municipal elections, it counted 14,602 registered voters, of which 8,771 voted.\n\n"}

{"id": "1704133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1704133", "title": "Sarmoung Brotherhood", "text": "Sarmoung Brotherhood\n\nThe Sarmoung Brotherhood was an alleged esoteric Sufi brotherhood based in Asia. The reputed existence of the brotherhood was brought to light in the writings of George Gurdjieff, a Greek-Armenian spiritual teacher. Some contemporary Sufi-related sources also claim to have made contact with the group although the earliest and primary source is Gurdjieff himself, leading some scholars to conclude the group was merely a fictional teaching device.\n\nAccording to the author John G. Bennett, a student and aide of George Gurdjieff who first mentioned the concept, the word \"sarmoung\" uses the Armenian pronunciation of the Persian term \"sarman\", which may mean either \"he who preserves the doctrine of Zoroaster\" or \"bee\".\n\nRegarding the meaning, Bennett writes:\n\"The word can be interpreted in three ways. It is the word for bee, which has always been a symbol of those who collect the precious 'honey' of traditional wisdom and preserve it for further generations. A collection of legends, well known in Armenian and Syrian circles with the title of \"The Bees\", was revised by Mar Salamon, a Nestorian Archimandrite in the thirteenth century. \"The Bees\" refers to a mysterious power transmitted from the time of Zoroaster and made manifest in the time of Christ... \"Man\" is Persian meaning as the quality transmitted by heredity and hence a distinguished family or race. It can be the repository of an heirloom or tradition. The word \"sar\" means head, both literally and in the sense of principal or chief. The combination \"sarman\" would thus mean the chief repository of the tradition.\" Yet another possibility was \"those whose heads have been purified\", in other words: the enlightened.\nHowever, in the Persian language, 'sarman' has no meaning, and the actual word for a bee is 'zebh' or plural 'zobabeh'.\n\nThe Brotherhood was also sought by Georges Gurdjieff on his journeys (pre-1912) through Southwest and Central Asia. Describing the contents of an old letter written by a monk which he had obtained, Gurdjieff writes:-\n\"Our worthy Father Telvant has at last succeeded in learning the truth about the Sarmoung Brotherhood. Their organisation actually did exist near the town of Siranoush, and fifty years ago, soon after the migration of peoples, they also migrated and settled in the valley of Izrumin, three days journey from Nivssi...\" Then the letter went on about other matters.\n\nWhat struck us most was the word \"Sarmoung\", which we had come across several times in the book called \"Merkhavat\". This word is the name of a famous esoteric school which, according to tradition, was founded in Babylon as far back as 2500 BC, and which was known to have existed somewhere in Mesopotamia up to the sixth or seventh century AD; but about its further existence one could not obtain anywhere the least information.\n\nThis school was said to have possessed great knowledge, containing the key to many secret mysteries\n\nMany times had Pogossian and I talked of this school and dreamed of finding out something authentic about it, and now suddenly we found it mentioned in this parchment! We were greatly excited.\nGurdjieff goes on to relate the Sarmoung to the Nestorians, descendants of the ancient Byzantine, their expulsion from Mesopotamia and the city of Ninevah.\n\nGurdjiieff's experiences on these journeys, and a sketchy account of his somewhat mysterious relationship with the Sarmoung Brotherhood, can be found in his autobiography \"Meetings with Remarkable Men\". He claims he made contact with a representative of the Sarmoung through his friend, the Dervish Bogga Eddin (Bahauddin), in Bukhara. The chief monastery of the society was said to be located somewhere in the heart of Asia, about twelve days' journey from Bukhara by horse and donkey. Once he arrived at the monastery, Gurdjieff discovered that his old friend Prince Lubovedsky was already there. The Prince tells Gurdjieff that he had met a representative of the Sarmoung at the house of the Aga Khan in Kabul, Afghanistan. During his stay at the monastery, Gurdjieff recalls seeing a complex and ancient tree-like apparatus used to indicate bodily postures and train temple dancers.\n\nGurdjieff's attempts to establish a link between the Brotherhood, ancient Sumer, and even \"pre-sand Egypt\", was an intriguing attempt at acquiring esoteric knowledge that had been passed down from antiquity.\n\nAccording to \"Account of the Sarmoun Brotherhood\" (1966, 1982) by Major Desmond R. Martin, a major centre of the contemporary Sarmoun Brotherhood was in the Hindu Kush mountains of northern Afghanistan. Major Martin was an associate of the writer and Sufi teacher, Idries Shah.\n\nIn the account, the motto of the Sarmouni is said to be \"Work produces a Sweet Essence\" (Amal misazad yak zaati shirin), work being not only work for God and for others but also self-work. In relation to this, it is maintained that just as the bee accumulates honey, so the Sarmouni accumulate, store and preserve what they term \"true knowledge\" (which is equally seen as existing as a positive commodity and associated with the spiritual gift or energy of Baraka). In times of need this is released once more into the world through specially trained emissaries. He describes a tree-like, multi jointed apparatus, similar to one described by Gurdjieff, and also a \"No-Koonja\" or nine-pointed figure, similar to Gurdjieff's Enneagram. The account hints that the central Asian activities of the Sarmoun are to be shut down and the organisation shifted to the west, and mentions an absent chief of the order, the Surkaur, who lives in a place called Aubshaur or \"waterfall\" (Another account of a visit to a remote monastery, published anonymously in the Times, links the Sarkar to Idries Shah). Martin's account ends with a description of a symbolic ritual whose theme is the revival of the \"dead letter\" of traditional teaching.\n\nA lengthy account of an encounter with the Sarmouni is given in \"Among the Dervishes\" (1973) by Omar Michael Burke, an associate of (or pen name of ) Idries Shah. He takes the term \"Sarmouni\" to be synonymous with the Amudaria dervishes. He describes the Sarmouni as a diffuse set of groups, rather than being located in a single monastery. Some groups have no permanent headquarters and meet in the open or private houses. In some cases, whole villages blend Sarmouni practices with their day-to-day lives. He describes them as having a practical orientation, and avoiding mystification and personality-cults. They occasionally display extrasensory perceptions, but do not attribute great significance to them. He reports meeting a nonagenarian with memories of \"Jurjizada\" (Gurdjieff). He also says they owe their allegiance to the \"Studious King\" (a literal translation of Idries Shah's name), and agrees with Major Martin that their teaching has been exported and adapted to the West. (He mentions the Azimiyya, a modern international Sufi order).\n\nIdries Shah himself does not describe any personal contact with the Sarmoung, but mentions the \"Sarmouni\" several times in his writings. For instance, in \"Tales of the Dervishes\" he attributes a teaching story to a Sarmouni called Pir-i-Do-Sara (d. 1790). He also offers a following \"Sarmouni recital\", beginning:-\n\nIn \"Studies in Comparative Religion\" (Winter 1974), it is said that according to the Armenian book \"Merkhavat\", the Sarmoung Brotherhood, also referred to as the 'Inner Circle of Humanity', originated in ancient Babylon circa 2500 BC, at around the time the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Ouspensky Foundation state that the brotherhood was active in the golden Babylonian time of Hammurabi (1728-1686 BC) and is connected with Zoroaster, the teacher of Pythagoras (born c. 580 BC–572 BC, died c. 500 BC–490 BC). According to the Foundation, Pythagoras stayed for twelve years in Babylon. (Merkabah mysticism is in fact a form of Jewish esotericism, which Gurdjieff possibly encountered in an Armenian translation).\n\nIn \"The Masters of Wisdom\", J.G. Bennett states that the Sarman left Babylon before the arrival of the Alexander the Great (who reigned 336-323 BC), moved up the Tigris and made their headquarters in the abandoned capital of the Assyrian Kings, close to modern-day Mosul in northern Iraq.\n\nIn \"Gurdjieff in the Light of Tradition\" (2002), the Perrenialist Whitall Perry wrote that Gurdjieff believed that the northern Sufi orders could well be under the hidden direction of the Khwajagan - the 'Masters of Wisdom' - themselves in turn delegated by the Sarman 'Inner Circle', the 'Assembly of the Living Saints of the Earth'.\n\nIn \"The People of the Secret\", Edward Campbell (writing as Ernest Scott), another associate of Idries Shah, describes studies in extrasensory perception being undertaken in the contemporary Sarmoun monastery in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Canadian diplomat and Gurdjieffian James George has speculated, on the basis of the similar name and location, that Surmang, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery currently within Chinese borders may be real basis of the Sarmoung. Surmang has been more recently associated with the renowned and controversial Kagyu teacher Chogyam Trungpa. In 2007, Buddhist priest Rev. José M. Tirado presented a paper to the All & Everything Conference in Loutraki, Greece detailing the probable Buddhist influences on Gurdjieff´s teachings, and linking \"Sarmoun\" to the Surmang monastery, in \"Beelzebub´s Buddhas\".\n\nMark Sedgwick, the coordinator of the Unit for Arab and Islamic Studies at Aarhus University writes:\n\nAlthough few commentators in Gurdjieff would put it so bluntly, it seems clear to me that the Sarmoung are entirely imaginary. No Sufi \"tariqa\" of such a name is known, and in fact \"Sarmoung\" is a typically Gurdjieffian fantastical name. It is immediately obvious to anyone who knows anything about regular Sufism that there is nothing remotely Sufi about the Sarmoung Order described by Gurdjieff.\nJames Moore, in his biography of Gurdjieff, writes\n\nGurdjieff's claim to have found and entered 'the chief Sarmoung Monastery' is, in effect, a litmus test, distinguishing literal minds from those preferring allegory.\n\n\n"}

Scientology leader David Miscavige introduced the first evening of broadcast, saying, “We’re not here to preach to you, to convince you or to convert you. No, we simply want to show you, because after all, the first principle of Scientology is that it’s only true if it is true to you. So, take a look and then decide for yourself.”The network launched with six original shows, including: \"Meet A Scientologist\", \"Voices for Humanity\", and \"L. Ron Hubbard: In His Own Voice\".\n\nThe network’s launch countdown was posted via official social media accounts and an advertisement promoting the network was displayed in Times Square on the day of the launch.The teaser video announced, “The only thing more interesting than what you’ve heard, is what you haven’t.” One tweet from the church’s official Twitter handle said, “It’s time for us to tell our story.” According to entertainment website Variety.com, the network seems to be a “stepped up effort by the church to address critics.” Quartz media said, “Unfortunately for Scientology, the church picked literally the worst time to get into the TV game. The number of cable and streaming TV channels and series has increased exponentially in recent years—making it harder and harder for brands to stick out in the era of 'peak TV'.”\n\nScientology Network broadcasts from Scientology Media Productions in Los Angeles, California, located on 4401 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90027. Scientology Media Productions launched in 2016 at the previous location of the KCET studios, a cultural landmark in Hollywood that dates back to 1912. According to LA Weekly, photos acquired from the church, “depict a state-of-the-art facility offering soundstages with ‘robotically controlled cameras,’ a scenery shop, screening rooms, a visual-effects center and a television broadcast studio.” Scientology’s publishing department is also within the premises. The production facility was foreseen by the media to be the site of the Church of Scientology’s planned 24-hour TV network, before it came into fruition in 2018.\n\n"}

Established in May 1869, it was published by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston, Massachusetts. The monthly magazine describe conditions in the mission fields of the church, document the work of the society, and provide assistance to missionaries. \"The Heathen Woman's Friend\" was launched with volume 1, number 1 in May 1869. Its final issue, volume 27, number 6, was issued December 1895. The publication was relaunched as the \"Woman's Missionary Friend\" with volume 27, number 7 on January 1896, and ended with volume 73, number 7 in August 1940.\n\nThe paper was able to pay its expenses and gave large sums to the Society. From 1882 to 1893, it contributed $26,000 to other forms of church work, and aided in carrying the miscellaneous literature published by the Society, the annual reports, uniform studies, maps of mission fields, life membership certificates for adults and for children, and a great variety of missionary leaflets. \n\nAt the very beginning of the Society, it was proposed that a monthly paper be issued, and the following prospectus was printed: \"The\" paper will be devoted more especially to the interests of the work among heathen women, and will be filled with interesting facts and incidents illustrating that work, furnished by those laboring in heathen lands. Information will be given concerning the customs and social life of the people, the various obstacles to be overcome in their Christianization, and the success which attends the various departments of missionary labor among them. The design is to furnish just such a paper as will be read with interest by all the friends of the cause, and one which will assist in enlisting the sympathies of the children also, and educate them more fully in the missionary work. The price of the paper .will be only thirty cents per annum, so that it will be within the reach of all.\"\n\nThe monthly magazine was launched to describe conditions in the mission fields of the church, document the work of the society, and provide assistance to missionaries. The paper was able to pay its expenses and gave large sums to the Society. From 1882 to 1893, it contributed $26,000 to other forms of church work, and aided in carrying the miscellaneous literature published by the Society, the annual reports, uniform studies, maps of mission fields, life membership certificates for adults and for children, and a great variety of missionary leaflets. Subscriptions ranged from 3,500 in 1869, to 21,000 in 1870, and 92,591 in 1929. Subscriptions could start in July, October, January, or April, though July and January were preferable.\n\nAfter the decision was reached to publish a paper, Harriet Merrick Warren was selected as editor. She was then only 25 years old. At that time, papers and magazines conducted by women were something of a novelty, the field new and untried. She immediately went to work, and the first issue of the paper, eight pages, appeared in May, 1869. Lewis Flanders stood ready with US$500 to meet deficiencies, if at the end of the year it was needed. Others also promised financial assistance. At the close of the first year, its subscription list had reached 4,000; it paid all running expenses, and had a margin on hand. It was then enlarged to 12 pages. James P. Magee acted as general agent. \n\nA 20,000 edition was required in 1870. The subscription price was raised from $0.30 to $0.35, and Lydia Hill Daggett was appointed agent. The July number in 1871 contained a map, giving all the missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church in India, in their relation to each other and to large cities. It was prepared by Isabella Thoburn, and was the first cartographic view of these missions ever printed for the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nIn July, 1872, four more pages were added, and it became a 16-page paper. Its circulation reached 25,000. During the first seven years, a strong corps of contributing editors was annually elected. In May, 1872, the paper appeared with its first illustration. The engraving was that of the Mission House and Orphanage at Bareilly. Thereafter, this was a prominent feature. In 1875, the paper was increased to 24 pages, with a new heading, and the subscription price was raised to $0.50. In that year, a new feature was added, called the \"Home Department,\" the material being contributed by the Branch Secretaries. During the first five years of publication, the paper focused primarily on India and China. Volume VIII began with the addition of Mary Bannister Willard as editor of the Children's Department. She filled this position for two years, and was then reluctantly excused. During the 10 year, owing to financial depression, the subscription decreased to 13,388. Three years later, the number again reached 20,000. From 1878, it furnished the outline of what was entitled the \"Uniform Study\" of each month, by means of which the women of the Societies united in pursuing a systematic course of study of missionary subjects.\n\nIn November, 1882, Daggett's resignation was accepted, and Pauline J. Walden, the publishing agent, was again appointed. The paper published full reports of the General Executive Committee in annual session, and the acknowledgment of all moneys to the Society through the Branch Treasurers, and kept the thread of the history of the work on every mission field abroad, as well as much of the detail of the work by the Auxiliaries at home. The German language edition, \"Heiden Frauen Freund\", was established in 1885. Four more pages were added in 1886. The salary of the editor and the publisher was raised in 1888 from $500 to $700, and a sum sufficient to cover incidental expenses. \n\nThe February number of 1893 contained an unwritten page with the name \"Harriet Merrick Warren,\" and underneath two dates, \"September 15, 1843—January 7, 1893\", announcing her death. For 24 years, she had been the newspaper's leader. She had developed the paper so that it soon took rank as one of the model missionary periodicals of the world, and had reached the largest number of subscribers of any woman's missionary magazine published at that time. After the death of Warren, her daughter, Mary Warren-Ayars, was appointed to take the mother's place, which she accepted. In July 1893, the form of the paper was changed, as had long been contemplated, to that of a magazine, and contained 30 pages. In the Young Woman's Department was included a column of bright notes about \"Other Girls,\" carrying out a desire expressed by Warren. For greater convenience, the table of contents and the columns containing information about Branch officers and the organization's other publications were brought together on the page next to the cover. Ayars carried on the work until the close of the year, declining a further appointment. At the General Executive Committee meeting in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in November, 1893, Louise Manning Hodgkins was unanimously elected to the position of editor. \n\nHodgkins introduced some new features, a department of \"Family News,\" also a \"Post-office Box,\" and brought out some special numbers. The first was in March, 1894 —the 25th anniversary number— which was embellished with photo-engravings of the founders, Mrs. E. W. Parker (Lois Lee Parker and Mrs. Wm. Butler (Clementina Rowe Butler); and first missionaries, Isabella Thoburn and Dr. Clara Swain. The subscriptions in 1895 were nearly 22,000. But some considered the newspaper's name to be controversial and so a name change was discussed in St. Louis in 1896, with supporters claiming that it \"expresses so much\" while others argued that it was a \"misnomer\", even a \"hinderance to their work\". After discussion, it was renamed \"Woman’s Missionary Friend\". Philip Butler, a Boston artist, would design the cover.\n\nBy 1911, the publisher was Annie G. Bailey, with Elizabeth C. Northup as Editor; the subscription price was $0.50 per year. The editor of the German language version, \"Der Frauen-Missions-Freund\" was Amalie M. Achard, of Elgin, Illinois; subscription price was $0.26 per year. The publication merged into \"Methodist Woman\" in 1940.\n\n\n\n"}

However, it is not known to be extant in any of the known writings attributed to D'Abano (1250-1316). Trithemius' student Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) included it in his \"De Occulta Philosophia\" (Book III, chap. 29, 1531). It is also not known to be found in any manuscripts of the writings of Honorius of Thebes (i.e. \"Liber Iuratus Honorii\", or \"The Sworn Book of Honorius\"), with the exception of the composite manuscript found in London, British Library Manuscript Sloane 3853, which however openly identifies Agrippa as its source.\n\nIt is also known as the Honorian alphabet or the Runes of Honorius after the legendary magus (Theban is not, however, a runic alphabet), or the witches' alphabet due to its use in modern Wicca and other forms of witchcraft as one of many substitution ciphers to hide magical writings such as the contents of a Book of Shadows from prying eyes. The Theban alphabet bears little resemblance to other alphabets, and has not been found in any previous publications prior that of Trithemius. \nThere is one-to-one correspondence between Theban and the letters in the old Latin alphabet. The modern characters J, U and W are not represented, and in modern usage these are transliterated using the Theban characters for I, V and VV. Theban letters only exist in a single case. This suggests an origin for Theban as a cipher calqued on Latin, along with the various alphabets described by Trithemius and Agrippa, based on either Latin or Hebrew.\n\nEric S. Raymond, an American software developer and author, has created a draft proposal for adding the Theban alphabet to the Universal Coded Character Set / Unicode.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31874", "title": "United States Declaration of Independence", "text": "United States Declaration of Independence\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced that the Thirteen Colonies at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain would regard themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. With the Declaration, these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.\n\nThe Lee Resolution for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes. The Committee of Five had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence. John Adams, a leader in pushing for independence, had persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which Congress edited to produce the final version. The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Adams wrote to his wife Abigail, \"The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America\" – although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved.\n\nAfter ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand. Jefferson's original draft is preserved at the Library of Congress, complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, as well as Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress. The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.\n\nThe sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Its original purpose was to announce independence, and references to the text of the Declaration were few in the following years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his policies and his rhetoric, as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nThis has been called \"one of the best-known sentences in the English language\", containing \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 \"Declaration of Flanders\" issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands. It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence in Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the 19th century.\n\nBy the time that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763. Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767. Parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep them in the British Empire.\n\nMany colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.\n\nThe issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the Coercive Acts (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the colonists for the Gaspee Affair of 1772 and the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of British America, so the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in September 1774 to coordinate a response. Congress organized a boycott of British goods and petitioned the king for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister Lord North were determined to enforce parliamentary supremacy in America. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, \"blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent\".\n\nMost colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain, even after fighting began in the American Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The Second Continental Congress convened at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia in May 1775, and some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it. Many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, yet they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were disappointed in late 1775 when the king rejected Congress's second petition, issued a Proclamation of Rebellion, and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering \"friendly offers of foreign assistance\" to suppress the rebellion. A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.\n\nThomas Paine's pamphlet \"Common Sense\" was published in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. \"Common Sense\" made a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in the American colonies. Paine connected independence with Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, thereby stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss, and public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after its publication.\nSome colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, but developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the Prohibitory Act, which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. John Adams, a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the \"Act of Independency\", calling it \"a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire\". Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.\n\nDespite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by 13 different governments, which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies, and they were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action. Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue; consequently, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for it, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a \"complex political war\" was waged to bring this about.\n\nIn the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian Pauline Maier identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776. These \"declarations\" took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the Halifax Resolves of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence. Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so. Many \"declarations\" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice William Henry Drayton of South Carolina: \"the law of the land authorizes me to declare ... that \"George\" the Third, King of \"Great Britain\" ... has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him.\" Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.\n\nSome colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow. On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the Pennsylvania Assembly in a special election that had focused on the question of independence. In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and Richard Henry Lee, calling on colonies without a \"government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs\" to adopt new governments. The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's John Dickinson, the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.\n\nAs was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a preamble to explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, \"it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed\". Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under proprietary governance. Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest. Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.\n\nOn the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the Virginia Convention set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation \"to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain\". In accordance with those instructions, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia presented a three-part resolution to Congress on June 7. The motion was seconded by John Adams, calling on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:\n\nResolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\n\nLee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with Great Britain, while arguing that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority. Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to \"declare a fact which already exists\". Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress, therefore, voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks. Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.\n\nSupport for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence and, the following day, the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence. In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and a new Conference of Committees under Thomas McKean authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence on June 18. The Provincial Congress of New Jersey had been governing the province since January 1776; they resolved on June 15 that Royal Governor William Franklin was \"an enemy to the liberties of this country\" and had him arrested. On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.\n\nOnly Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence towards the end of June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.\n\nPolitical maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a \"Committee of Five\" to draft a declaration, consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited. What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally. Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly. He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was \"A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled.\"\nCongress ordered that the draft \"lie on the table\". For two days, Congress methodically edited Jefferson's primary document, shortening it by a fourth, removing unnecessary wording, and improving sentence structure. They removed Jefferson's assertion that Great Britain had forced slavery on the colonies in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Great Britain who supported the Revolution. Jefferson wrote that Congress had \"mangled\" his draft version, but the Declaration that was finally produced was \"the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity,\" in the words of his biographer John Ferling.\n\nCongress tabled the draft of the declaration on Monday, July 1, and resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation. John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.\n\nA vote was taken after a long day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.\n\nOn July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and Robert Morris abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of Caesar Rodney, who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they were allowed to do so a week later by the New York Provincial Congress. The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.\n\nJohn Adams predicted in a famous letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday. He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate Independence Day on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.\n\nI am apt to believe that [Independence Day] will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.\n\nAfter voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.\n\nThere is a distinct change in wording from this original broadside printing of the Declaration and the final official engrossed copy. The word \"unanimous\" was inserted as a result of a Congressional resolution passed on July 19, 1776:\n\nResolved, That the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of \"The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America,\" and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.\n\nHistorian George Billias says:\n\nIndependence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status. America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.\n\nThe declaration is not divided into formal sections; but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts: \"introduction\", \"preamble\", \"indictment\" of King George III, \"denunciation\" of the British people, and \"conclusion\".\n\nHistorians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:\n\nNeither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.\n\nJefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King James II. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.\n\nJefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration. English political theorist John Locke is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of \"the three greatest men that have ever lived\". In 1922, historian Carl L. Becker wrote, \"Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's second treatise on government.\" The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at \"two opposite poles\" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase \"pursuit of happiness\" instead of \"property\". Other scholars emphasized the influence of republicanism rather than Locke's classical liberalism. Historian Garry Wills argued that Jefferson was influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment, particularly Francis Hutcheson, rather than Locke, an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.\n\nLegal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists. Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's \"The Law of Nations\", the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was \"continually in the hands of the members of our Congress\". Armitage writes, \"Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood\"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was \"to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States\". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.\n\nThe Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.\n\nThe Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the U.S. State Department under Secretary Philander C. Knox. On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons. Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4. Signer Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.\n\nHistorians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776. In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4. According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2. Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.\n\nTwo future U.S. presidents were among the signatories: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John Hancock, who presumably signed first as President of Congress. Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and the term \"John Hancock\" emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for \"signature\". A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that, after Hancock signed, the delegate from Massachusetts commented, \"The British ministry can read that name without spectacles.\" Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared, \"There! I guess King George will be able to read that!\"\n\nVarious legends emerged years later about the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now \"all hang together\", and Benjamin Franklin replied: \"Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.\n\nThe Syng inkstand used at the signing was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787.\n\nAfter Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, it was being read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the 13 states. The first formal public readings of the document took place on July 8, in Philadelphia (by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall), Trenton, New Jersey, and Easton, Pennsylvania; the first newspaper to publish it was the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" on July 6. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.\n\nPresident of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General George Washington, instructing him to have it proclaimed \"at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper\". Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in New York City on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army. After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.\n\nBritish officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain. It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August, it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid-September, and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October. The first copy of the Declaration sent to France got lost, and the second copy arrived only in November 1776. It reached Portuguese America by Brazilian medical student \"Vendek\" José Joaquim Maia e Barbalho, who had met with Thomas Jefferson in Nîmes.\n\nThe Spanish-American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among Creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821. The North Ministry did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer John Lind to publish a response entitled \"Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress\". British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" to African Americans. Thomas Hutchinson, the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal. These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration. Hutchinson argued that the American Revolution was the work of a few conspirators who wanted independence from the outset, and who had finally achieved it by inducing otherwise loyal colonists to rebel. Lind's pamphlet had an anonymous attack on the concept of natural rights written by Jeremy Bentham, an argument that he repeated during the French Revolution. Both pamphlets asked how the American slaveholders in Congress could proclaim that \"all men are created equal\" without freeing their own slaves.\n\nWilliam Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war, freed his slave Prince Whipple because of revolutionary ideals. In the postwar decades, other slaveholders also freed their slaves; from 1790 to 1810, the percentage of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8.3 percent from less than one percent of the black population. All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.\n\nThe official copy of the Declaration of Independence was the one printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. It was sent to the states and to the Army and was widely reprinted in newspapers. The slightly different \"engrossed copy\" (shown at the top of this article) was made later for members to sign. The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century. Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.\n\nThe copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or parchment copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk Timothy Matlack. A facsimile made in 1823 has become the basis of most modern reproductions rather than the original because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century. In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration was transferred from the State Department to the Library of Congress, along with the United States Constitution. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944. In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the National Archives and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the \"Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom\".\n\nThe document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as \"the\" Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P. Boyd argued that the Declaration, like Magna Carta, is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.\n\nIn 1777, Congress commissioned Mary Katherine Goddard to print that listed the signers of the Declaration, unlike the Dunlap broadside. Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist. A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.\n\nSeveral early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the \"original Rough draught\". It is not known how many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting. Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.\n\nDuring the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps to other members of the drafting committee, who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase \"We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable\" to \"We hold these truths to be self-evident\". Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee. The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process, or destroyed during the debates in accordance with .\n\nOn April 21, 2017, it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in the archives at West Sussex County Council in Chichester, England. Named by its finders the \"Sussex Declaration\", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the \"Matlack Declaration\") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States. How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory James Wilson, who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.\n\nThe Declaration was given little attention in the years immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States. Early celebrations of Independence Day largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The \"act\" of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the \"text\" announcing that act attracted little attention. The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the United States Constitution, and its language was not incorporated into that document. George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words. \"In none of these documents\", wrote Pauline Maier, \"is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles.\"\n\nMany leaders of the French Revolution admired the Declaration of Independence but were also interested in the new American state constitutions. The inspiration and content of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789) emerged largely from the ideals of the American Revolution. Its key drafts were prepared by Lafayette, working closely in Paris with his friend Thomas Jefferson. It also borrowed language from George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights. The declaration also influenced the Russian Empire. The document had a particular impact on the Decembrist revolt and other Russian thinkers.\n\nAccording to historian David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of declarations of independence that announced the creation of new states.\n\nOther French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The \"Manifesto of the Province of Flanders\" (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.\n\nOther countries have used the Declaration as inspiration or have directly copied sections from it. These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804, during the Haitian Revolution, the United Provinces of New Granada in 1811, the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816, the Chilean Declaration of Independence in 1818, Costa Rica in 1821, El Salvador in 1821, Guatemala in 1821, Honduras in (1821), Mexico in 1821, Nicaragua in 1821, Peru in 1821, Bolivian War of Independence in 1825, Uruguay in 1825, Ecuador in 1830, Colombia in 1831, Paraguay in 1842, Dominican Republic in 1844, Texas Declaration of Independence in March 1836, California Republic in November 1836, Hungarian Declaration of Independence in 1849, Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand in 1835, and the Czechoslovak declaration of independence from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with Gutzon Borglum among the drafters. The Rhodesian declaration of independence, ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one as well; however, it omits the phrases \"all men are created equal\" and \"the consent of the governed\". The from December 1860 also mentions the U.S. Declaration of Independence, though it, like the Rhodesian one, omits references to \"all men are created equal\" and \"consent of the governed\".\n\nInterest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.\n\nA less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the War of 1812, thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution. In 1817, Congress commissioned John Trumbull's famous painting of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the Capitol. The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document. Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s, giving birth to what Garry Wills called the \"cult of the signers\". In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.\n\nWhen interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support. Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others. In 1848, for example, the Seneca Falls Convention of women's rights advocates declared that \"all men and women are created equal\".\n\nJohn Trumbull's painting \"Declaration of Independence\" has played a significant role in popular conceptions of the Declaration of Independence. The painting is in size and was commissioned by the United States Congress in 1817; it has hung in the United States Capitol Rotunda since 1826. It is sometimes described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but it actually shows the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.\n\nTrumbull painted the figures from life whenever possible, but some had died and images could not be located; hence, the painting does not include all the signers of the Declaration. One figure had participated in the drafting but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact, the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time. It is, however, an accurate depiction of the room in Independence Hall, the centerpiece of the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrumbull's painting has been depicted multiple times on U.S. currency and postage stamps. Its first use was on the reverse side of the $100 National Bank Note issued in 1863. A few years later, the steel engraving used in printing the bank notes was used to produce a 24-cent stamp, issued as part of the 1869 Pictorial Issue. An engraving of the signing scene has been featured on the reverse side of the United States two-dollar bill since 1976.\n\nThe apparent contradiction between the claim that \"all men are created equal\" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version. Jefferson himself was a prominent Virginia slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves. Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist Thomas Day wrote in a 1776 letter, \"If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian Bertram Wyatt-Brown wrote that \"abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document\". Abolitionist leaders Benjamin Lundy and William Lloyd Garrison adopted the \"twin rocks\" of \"the Bible and the Declaration of Independence\" as the basis for their philosophies. \"As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land,\" wrote Garrison, \"we will not despair.\" For radical abolitionists such as Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the right of revolution. Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.\n\nThe controversial question of whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.\n\nWith the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as John Randolph and John C. Calhoun found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that \"all men are created equal\" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people. During the debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1853, for example, Senator John Pettit of Indiana argued that the statement \"all men are created equal\" was not a \"self-evident truth\" but a \"self-evident lie\". Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, including Salmon P. Chase and Benjamin Wade, defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.\n\nThe Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by Abraham Lincoln, a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers. Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away. For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 Peoria speech, Lincoln said:\n\nThe meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase \"all men are created equal\" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any \"inferior or degraded race\". Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. \"I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere,\" he said. During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration:\n\nAccording to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. \"In Lincoln's hands,\" wrote Maier, \"the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document\" with \"a set of goals to be realized over time\".\n\nLike Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word \"equality\", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that \"all men are created equal\" remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: \"Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\n\nLincoln's view of the Declaration became influential, seeing it as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution. \"For most people now,\" wrote Garry Wills in 1992, \"the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it.\" Admirers of Lincoln such as Harry V. Jaffa praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably Willmoore Kendall and Mel Bradford, argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated states' rights by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.\n\nIn July 1848, the first woman's rights convention, the Seneca Falls Convention, was held in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention was organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Mary Ann McClintock, and Jane Hunt. In their \"Declaration of Sentiments\", patterned on the Declaration of Independence, the convention members demanded social and political equality for women. Their motto was that \"All men \"and women\" are created equal\" and the convention demanded suffrage for women. The suffrage movement was supported by William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.\n\nThe Declaration was chosen to be the first digitized text (1971).\n\nThe Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence was dedicated in 1984 in Constitution Gardens on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.\n\nThe new One World Trade Center building in New York City (2014) is 1776 feet high to symbolize the year that the Declaration of Independence was signed.\n\nThe adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 Tony Award–winning musical \"1776\" and the 1972 film version, as well as in the 2008 television miniseries \"John Adams\". In 1970, The 5th Dimension recorded the opening of the Declaration on their album \"Portrait\" in the song \"Declaration\". It was first performed on the \"Ed Sullivan Show\" on December 7, 1969, and it was taken as a song of protest against the Vietnam War. The Declaration of Independence is also a plot device in the 2004 American film \"National Treasure\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4581222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4581222", "title": "William Apess", "text": "William Apess\n\nWilliam Apess (1798–1839, Pequot) (also known as William Apes before 1837), was an ordained Methodist minister, writer, and activist of mixed-race descent, who was a political and religious leader in Massachusetts. After becoming ordained as a Methodist minister in 1829, he published his autobiography the same year. It is among the first autobiographies by a Native American writer. Apess was part Pequot by descent, especially through his mother's family, and identified with their culture.\n\nIn 1833, while serving as an itinerant preacher in New England, Apess visited the Mashpee on Cape Cod. Hearing their grievances against white overseers and settlers who stole their wood, he helped organize what was called the Mashpee Revolt of 1833-34. Their attempt to regain civil rights was covered sympathetically by the \"Boston Advocate,\" but criticized by local journals on Cape Cod. Apess published a book about the experience in 1835, which he summarized as \"Indian Nullification.\"\n\nApess alienated many of his supporters before dying in New York City at age 41, but he has been described as \"perhaps the most successful activist on behalf of Native American rights in the antebellum United States.\"\n\nWilliam Apess was born in 1798 in Colrain in northwestern Massachusetts to William and Candace Apess of the Pequot tribe. According to his autobiography, his father was mixed Pequot and European American, as Apess' white paternal grandfather had married a Pequot woman. He claimed descent from King Philip through his mother, who also had some European-American and African-American ancestry. Until the age of five, Apess lived with his family, including two brothers and two sisters, near Colrain.\n\nHis parents separated, and the five children were cared for by their maternal grandparents. But they were abusive and suffered from alcoholism. After seeing continued abuse, a neighbor intervened with the town selectmen on behalf of the children. They were taken away for their own safety and indentured to European-American families. Then five-year-old Apess was cared for by his neighbor, Mr. Furman, for a year until he had recovered from injuries sustained while living with his grandparents. His autobiography does not mention any contact with his Pequot relatives for the rest of his childhood. He said that he did not see his mother for twenty years after the beating. In contrast, he grew to love his adopted family dearly, despite his status as an indentured servant. When Mrs. Furman's mother died, he writes that \"She had always been so kind to me that I missed her quite as much as her children, and I had been allowed to call her mother.\" Apess was sent to school during the winter for six years to gain an education, while also assisting Furman at work. Mrs. Furman, a Baptist, gave William his first memorable experience with Christianity when he was six, and she discussed with him the importance of going to heaven or hell. Even as a young child, his devotion was ardent. He describes the joy he gained from sermons, and the depression he suffered when Mr. Furman eventually forbade him from attending.\n\nAt William was eleven, Mr. Furman discovered his ill-formed plans to run away. He never really wanted to leave, but, despite his reassurances, the family he had come to regard as his own sold his indenture to Judge James Hillhouse, a member of the Connecticut elite. The elderly judge, too old to deal with an unruly and rejected child, quickly sold his indenture to Gen. William Williams, under whom Apess spent four years. During this period, Apess grew increasingly close to the \"noisy Methodists.\" The congregation he knew had many people of mixed race, including African Americans and Native Americans. The Methodists were more welcoming than the Congregational Church, to which the town elite belonged.\n\nApess ran away from General Williams at the age of fifteen and joined a militia in New York, where he fought in the War of 1812. By the age of 16, he became an alcoholic and struggled with alcoholism for the rest of his life. From the years 1816 to 1818, he worked at various jobs in Canada.\n\nTroubled by his alcoholism, Apess decided to return home to the Pequot and his family in Massachusetts. Within a short period of time, he reclaimed his Pequot identity. He attended meetings of local Methodist groups and was baptized in December 1818.\n\nIn 1821, Apess married Mary Wood, also of mixed race. The couple had one son and three daughters together. After Mary died, Apess later remarried. He and his second wife settled in New York City in the late 1830s.\n\nAfter his marriage, Apess felt his vocation was to preach. In 1829 he was ordained as a Protestant Methodist minister, a group he found less hierarchical and rule bound than the Methodist Episcopal Church. In the same year he published his autobiography, \"A Son of the Forest: The Experience of William Apess, A Native of the Forest, Comprising a Notice of the Pequot Tribe of Indians, Written by Himself.\" Apess' work was one of the first autobiographies published by a Native American and was published partly in reaction to advocates of Indian Removal, including President Andrew Jackson. They wanted to remove Native Americans to west of the Mississippi River, especially those who were numerous in the Southeast. Apess based his narrative on his spiritual conversion, a common genre of the time, and commented also on European-American prejudices against Native Americans.\n\nAs was the Methodist practice of the day, Apess became an itinerant preacher; he preached in meetings throughout New England to mixed congregations including Native American, European-American, and African-American audiences. In 1833, following a visit to the town of Mashpee, the largest Native American town in Massachusetts, Apess became convinced the State was acting illegally in denying self-government to the Mashpee Wampanoag.\n\nThe Mashpee Wampanoag had a close culture and wooded land at the elbow of Cape Cod. Their limited autonomy had been reduced when the reservation was placed under supervision by a board of white overseers. These men allowed white settlers to take the Mashpee wood and permitted other incursions on their land. The Mashpee wanted to protect their grounds. Apess spoke out on their behalf at local meetings. He also participated in the so-called Mashpee Revolt of 1833-34, in which the Mashpee took action to restore their self-government. They wrote to the state government announcing their intention to rule themselves, according to their constitutional rights, and to prevent whites from taking away their wood (a recurring problem). In May 1833, the Mashpee tribe wrote to Harvard College, which administered the Williams Fund that paid for a minister to them.\n\nThe tribe had never been consulted in such appointment and objected to Rev. Mr. Fish, who had long been appointed to them. They did not like his preaching, and said that he had enriched himself by appropriating hundreds of acres of woodland at the tribe's expense. Lastly, they prevented a settler, William Sampson, from taking wood away from their property and unloaded his wagon. Three Indians were indicted for riot and Apess was jailed for a month as a result. An attorney assisted them in successfully appealing to the legislature, but initially Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr. threatened the group with military force.\n\nThe issues were reported sympathetically by Harnett of the \"Boston Advocate\" through June and July. The Mashpee protest followed the Nullification Crisis of 1832 on the national level, in which Southern states proposed they could nullify federal law. The historian Barry O'Connell suggests that Apess intended to highlight the Mashpee attempt to nullify Massachusetts laws discriminating against Native peoples. Apess continually drew parallels between the desire of free people of color for their rights, particularly Native Americans, and the historic struggle of European-American colonists for independence. He drew from the history of relations between Native Americans and the colonists, as well as relations within the United States.\n\nDuring the period 1831-1836, Apess published several of his sermons and public lectures, and became known as a powerful speaker. But, struggling with alcoholism and increasing resentment of white treatment of Natives, he gradually lost the respect in which he had been held; both white and Mashpee groups distanced themselves from him. In 1836, he gave a public lecture in the form of a memorial eulogy for King Philip, a seventeenth-century Indian leader who was assassinated by the Plymouth colonists. Apess extolled him as a leader equal to any among the European Americans. He had been killed after the colonists had poisoned his brother and violated several treaties.\n\nAfter publishing his lecture, Apess disappeared from New England public life. He moved to New York City with his second wife and children, trying to find work. The recession of 1837 was broadly damaging and especially affected the lower and working classes, so he struggled in New York.\n\nAt the age of 41, William Apess died of a cerebral hemorrhage (stroke) on April 10, 1839 at 31 Washington Street in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4648920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4648920", "title": "Youth for Human Rights International", "text": "Youth for Human Rights International\n\nYouth for Human Rights International (YHRI) is a Los Angeles–based non-profit organization. Founded and largely staffed and financed by Scientologists, its stated mission is \"To teach youth around the globe about human rights, thus helping them to become valuable advocates for the promotion of tolerance and peace.\"\n\nThe organization promotes Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's writings on human rights and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by sponsoring essay and art contests and by providing materials for students and teaching guides for schools.\n\nAccording to the Church of Scientology International, Scientologist Mary Shuttleworth founded the organization in August 2001 \"in coordination with the Church of Scientology International's Human Rights Office\". Scientology's website states that by 2004 it had established activities in more than 26 countries, including Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\n\nYHRI's president and founder is Mary Shuttleworth (formerly Mary Untiedt), former president of YHRI's parent organization International Foundation for Human Rights and Tolerance. She also founded the Applied Scholastics schools \"Shuttleworth Academy\" and \"Mary's Schoolhouse.\" Shuttleworth holds an executive position at TXL Films, the company that created the music video \"UNITED\" with YHRI. She is a Scientologist.\n\nAccording to the newsletter \"Church of Scientology International\", the executive director of YHRI is Tim Bowles, former law partner of Bowles & Moxon, serving as general legal council for the Church of Scientology. Bowles also acts as an advisor to Scientology's Citizens Commission on Human Rights.\n\nLynsey Bartilson, who appears on the television series \"Grounded for Life\", is a prominent YHRI spokesperson. She was raised and remains a Scientologist, and her mother Laurie Bartilson was a former law partner at Moxon & Bartilson. In her online biography, she states that she worked as creative director and choreographer for the Scientology Celebrity Center’s “Kids on Stage for A Better World.”\n\nYHRI has teamed with TXL Films (founded by Taron Lexton, son of YHRI founder Mary Shuttleworth ) to create the award-winning music video, \"UNITED.\" In June 2006, they released 30 public service announcements for TV, illustrating each of the 30 rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights., which were created by the Human Rights Department of the Church of Scientology International for YHRI.\n\nYHRI distributes materials related to its interpretation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and YHRI programs, to schoolchildren in a variety of developed nations, such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. YHRI is also active in Germany. In Belgium, it handed out a prize, and also held an awards ceremony in Bulgaria for the same prize. YHRI awarded one prize to a Chinese actress, who promoted the group's views on her web site, and another to a young Israeli Scientologist who screened the film, \"UNITED\", and distributed YHRI materials in his school. It held a conference in Zurich. It discussed plans to lecture and distribute its materials to schoolchildren in Ghana and Liberia. It advocated lower school fees in Uganda, and held a peace rally in Nigeria. In South Africa, Mary Shuttleworth's country of origin, it is pushing for a \"human rights month.\" The organization's work is supported by the actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise and cooperates with human rights organizations, such as, allegedly, local chapters of Amnesty International. According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, neither Amnesty in Berlin nor Amnesty International headquarters in London had knowledge of any such collaboration and Amnesty International, as of March 2013, has been removed the list of collaborators on the YHRI website.\n\nIn 2005, Youth for Human Rights International organized a conference at a Los Angeles High School. Stephen Strachan, principal of Jordan High School, said that although he knew some of the organizers were Scientologists, he did not know of YHRI's relationship to the church until the Church of Scientology was listed on publicity materials as a co-sponsor. After learning of the connection, an agreement was negotiated to remove any mention of the Church of Scientology from literature, and letters were sent to parents saying students would need permission to attend the event.\n\nIn 2007, YHRI led a pilot human rights course in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, at which it distributed L. Ron Hubbard's tract \"The Way to Happiness\" to students ranging from 12 to 17 years old, and taught them Scientology jargon like the tone scale, while trying to enroll them in Drug Free Marshalls, a Scientology organization like Narconon. An official in the provincial government said he hoped to bring it to the province's 4.44 million children.\n\nIn 2007, at a human rights youth forum organized by YHRI, in Sydney, Australia, three students from Canterbury Girls High School expressed concern at overt references to Scientology in the promotional materials. One said she felt \"exploited.\" The Department of Education is looking into the students' complaints. However, David Clarke, a Liberal of the New South Wales upper house and a member of the Catholic group Opus Dei, said that he had also been unaware of any strong links between the youth forum and the Church of Scientology. But, Clarke added, \"I'm a practising Catholic. There was no pushing as far as I could see of Scientology.\"\n\nA German journalist has accused Scientology of false advertising through YHRI, recruiting members indirectly, and government officials in Germany have said YHRI serves as a cover-up tactic for Scientology.\n\nThe Florida Holocaust Museum complained that YHRI's connection to Scientology was not disclosed when they worked with them to organize at a human rights march in St. Petersburg, Florida in March 2007.\n\nIn each of the above cases the YHRI organizer responded that, while the Church of Scientology supported their group, it was a YHRI event, not a Church event and the message was human rights, not Scientology. However, the Herald reported that, on the materials handed out at the event in Australia, L.Ron Hubbard's image and quotes figured more prominently than those of such activists as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nUrsula Caberta, the Commissioner for the Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority, a Scientology watchdog group, stated the YHRI is one of a number of Scientology-linked groups that mask their connection to the church and seek to attract and recruit the young.\n\nIn 1995, the Hamburg Senate released a report on Scientology, describing its structure and the dangers it presented to individuals and society. One passage, citing Scientology documents, clarified the role of all organizations, which, like YHRI, are linked to the church.\n\n\"In an internal memo, Scientology described the function of affiliate organizations:\n\n'All organizations and groups form a global network. Each one has its own individual role and responsibilities. But all service organizations have the goal to draw attention to L.Ron Hubbard's technology and deliver it to the public.'\n\nThus, each activity, however distantly it is related to Scientology, fits into a long-term strategic plan, which is ultimately steered by the highest management.\" \n\nAccording to the official Scientology website, YHRI is part of its overall campaign. YHRI, known in German as \"Jugend für Menschenrechte,\" is active in both Switzerland and Germany, organizing human rights conferences for youth to promote religious tolerance. Referring to the campaign, Antje Blumenthal, a member of the German parliament, expressed concern that the good intentions of the young were being misused.\n\nThe governments of France\nand Germany\nhave investigated Scientology in regard to human rights violations, investigations the Scientology organization calls discriminatory. It has responded with an opposing campaign through the Church of Scientology International European Office for Public Affairs and Human Rights, using public service announcements issued by YHRI, and created by the Human Rights Department of the Church of Scientology International.\n\n\n"}
