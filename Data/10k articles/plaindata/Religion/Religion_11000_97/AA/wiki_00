They were supposed to have descended from their mountain home near Reate (an ancient Sabine town) upon Latium, where they expelled the Siceli and subsequently settled down as Latini under a King Latinus.\n\nThe most generally accepted etymology of the Latin word aborigines is that it derives from \"ab origine\", according to which they were the original inhabitants of the country, although Cato regarded them as Hellenic immigrants, not as a native Italian people. Other etymological explanations suggested are \"arborigines\", meaning \"tree-born,\" and \"aberrigines\", meaning \"nomads\". Lycophron calls a people of central Italy, \"Boreigonoi\".\n\nThe Aborigines were believed to have been descendants of the Pelasgians, the mythical ancestors of all Greek peoples. Their earliest known home was Reate, an ancient Sabine town to the north-east of Latium near Carseoli. These Aborigines were driven from their mountain home by the Sabines and settled on the river Anio. The Sicels, who inhabited Latium at the time, gave way to the Aborigines, and a portion of them emigrated to Sicily, providing the origin for the island's name. The emigration of the Sicels to Sicily is said to have taken place in either 1264 BC or 1035 BC (Thucydides).\n\nThe remaining Siculians joined with the Aborigines eventually becoming the people known as \"Prisci Latini\" (meaning \"old Latins\"), that is \"Prisci et Latini\", or simply \"Latini\". The Aborigines did not become \"Latini\" until the reign of their king, Latinus, from whom the Romans attributed their name. This was after the arrival of the Trojans with Aeneas in the aftermath of the Trojan War.\n\nThe following list is based on Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\nAll of these cities are claimed to have been taken from the Umbrians. In Latium itself the Aborigines had the cities Antemnae, Caenina, Ficulnea, Tellenae, and Tibur some of which Dionysius attests were taken from the Siculians.\n\n\n"}

The best-known defender of the argument is Roger Scruton.\n\nTom Wright suggests that materialist philosophy and scepticism has \"paved our world with concrete, making people ashamed to admit that they have had profound and powerful 'religious' experiences\". The reality of Love in particular (\"that mutual and fruitful knowing, trusting and loving which was the creator's intention\" but which \"we often find so difficult\") and the whole area of human relationships in general, are another signpost pointing away from this philosophy to the central elements of the Christian story. Wright contends \"both\" that the real existence of love is a compelling reason for the truth of theism \"and\" that the ambivalent experience of love, (\"marriages apparently made in heaven sometimes end not far from hell\") resonates particularly with the Christian account of fall and redemption.\n\nPaul Tillich suggested (in 1954) even Spinoza \"elevates love out of the emotional into the ontological realm. And it is well known that from Empedocles and Plato to Augustine and Pico, to Hegel and Schelling, to Existentialism and depth psychology, love has played a central ontological role.\" and that \"love is being in actuality and love is the moving power of life\" and that an understanding of this should lead us to \"turn from the naive nominalism in which the modern world lives\".\n\nThe theologian Michael Lloyd suggests that \"In the end there are basically only two possible sets of views about the universe in which we live. It must, at heart, be either personal or impersonal... arbitrary and temporary [or emerging] from relationship, creativity, delight, love\".\n\nCatholic philosopher Peter Kreeft summarises the argument as \"Love is the greatest of miracles. How could an evolved ape create the noble idea of self-giving love? Human love is a result of our being made to resemble God, who himself is love. If we are made in the image of King Kong rather than in the image of King God, where do the saints come from?\" Philosopher Alvin Plantinga expressed the argument in similar terms.\n\nAccording to Graham Ward, postmodern theology portrays how religious questions are opened up (not closed down or annihilated) by postmodern thought. The postmodern God is emphatically the God of love, and the economy of love is kenotic.\n\nA variant on the argument is a defence of the rationality of theism by comparing faith in God with love, and to suggest that if it isn't irrational to love someone then it shouldn't be seen as irrational to believe in God. The philosopher Roger Scruton suggests: \"Rational argument can get us just so far...It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself — this placing of your life at God's service — is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational.\"\n\nAnother variant of the argument is that the evidence for God's love is sufficiently compelling that people can reasonably believe in it, and hence \"a fortiori\" believe in God. This approach is criticised by Richard Dawkins who suggests that it is an \"Argument from emotional blackmail\".\n\nIf we are going to consider love as an argument for God's existence, then it seems we can say hate is an argument for God's non-existence.\n"}

He and some of his disciples were arrested and Bademus was martyred in the year 376; he was subsequently recognized as a saint.\n\nIn the thirty-sixth year of Shapur II's persecution, Bademus was arrested with seven of his monks. For months, he lay in chains in a dungeon. At the same time, a Christian lord named Nersan, Prince of Aria, was also imprisoned because he refused to convert to Zoroastrianism. At first, he appeared resolved to keep the faith, but at the sight of tortures he gave in, and promised to conform. In order to test Nersan's sincerity, King Shapur ordered that Bademus be moved into Nersan's cell, which was actually a chamber in the royal palace. Shapur further instructed Nersan that if he would kill Bademus, his princely rights and dignities would be restored.\n\nNersan accepted the conditions. A sword was placed in his hand, and he advanced so as to plunge it into the abbot's chest. However, he was seized with a sudden terror, so he stopped short, and was unable to lift up his arm to strike for some time. Even so, he attempted to harden himself, and continued, trembling, to aim at Bademus' sides. A combination of fear, shame, remorse, and respect made his strokes weak and unsteady. The martyr's wounds were so numerous that the bystanders are said to have been in admiration of his invincible patience.\n\nThe resolute martyr chided his torturer, saying, \"Unhappy Nersan, to what a pitch of impiety do you carry your apostasy. With joy I run to meet death; but could wish to fall by some other hand than yours: why must you be my executioner?\"\n\nIt took four strokes for Nersan to successfully separate Bademus' head from his body. A short time after, Nersan committed suicide. The body of Saint Bademus was cast out of the city by the Sassanids, but was carried away and buried in secret by the Christians. His disciples were released from their chains in 379, after the death of King Shapur.\n\n"}

Its style is described as Afro-Caribbean. It was established in 1884 following the abolition of slavery. A moveable holiday, it takes place between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday, ending on Mardi Gras. The participants – French, Brazilian, Chinese and Creole people – dress in vibrant costumes. Main events include a parade and a burlesque-style marriage. \n\nThis celebration is a cultural tradition of the Guianan Creole, its origin traced to carnival customs practiced in Europe. It debuted during the beginning of colonization when settlers took part in carnival, forbidding the slaves from participating. Defying the ban, the slaves practiced carnival in clandestine ways, seeing it as a way to regain some freedom, to commemorate African fertility, and to deride the settlers. In the present day, metropolitan, Brazilian and Chinese communities take part in the event. Its occurrence varies, prescribed by the religious calendar and taking place between the Epiphany in early January, and Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent. Carnival ends on Shrovetide.\n\nThere are several traditional costumes in the French Guiana carnival, representing various figures. King Vaval is a mythical figure who serves as carnival king. He is introduced at the beginning of the festival and dies on Ash Wednesday, to be reborn like the Phoenix in the following year. The most famous character is the Touloulou, an elegantly dressed lady who wears a petticoat, hood, Domino mask, and long gloves, so that none of her skin is visible. The aim of the woman who masquerades as a \"touloulou\" is to not be recognized. She strolls down the street and participates in the masked balls. The character represents the bourgeois women of 18th and 19th centuries. Neg'Marrons are groups of men dressed in \"kalimbé\" (red loincloth) and coated with molasses. Representing fugitive slaves, they seek to make order of the festival. Other traditional characters include the \"Zombi baréyo\", a zombie character; \"Jwé farin\", who is dressed in white trousers, shirt, pointed hat, and mask, representing a baker; \"Bobi\", is dressed in old potato sacks and appears as a bear led by a leash; \"Karolin\", representing a rich woman with gold who is jealous and protects other women; \"Lanmò\", who represents death, is dressed in white; \" Soussouris\", who represents the bat, is a winged character who commonly wears black or two tones, and is renowned for its vampire behavior; and \"Diab rouj\" (red devil), who dresses in red and black. The \"tululu\" (mask) is worn in French Guiana while celebrating carnival.\n\nFridays commonly include eating a cake, known as the \"galette des rois\" (cake of kings, which in mainland France would be eaten only for the Epiphany), representing the Three Kings. Blaff is also commonly consumed during this period.\n\nOn the Saturday preceding Lent, carnival Queens (locally, \"Touloulous\") dress in colourful, camouflaged dresses and wear masks while they dance through the streets. Their costumes – lace and petticoats, tights and gloves – cover them from head to toe. They speak in disguised voices to retain anonymity. The women invite the men to join them, which is a mandatory requirement. On Friday and Saturday nights, the Toulouois assemble in large dance halls. Men who are invited have to pay an entry fee. Sunday is the day of parades. \"Vides\" (street parades), require months of preparation. They occur on the streets of Cayenne, Kourou, and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. Groups dress according to the theme of the year. The parade includes decorated floats and there are musicians playing drums and brass. Thousands of spectators line the sidewalks and sit in the stands which are set up for the occasion. Brazilian groups have similar costumes to those encountered at Rio Carnival, while the country's Asian community incorporates dragons in the festivities. On Monday, a sham act of marriage with women (brides) in men's gowns and men (grooms) in women's dresses is the main spectacle. Tuesday, the last day of the festival, is marked by the appearance of the main spirit of King Vaval, who is considered by the locals to be \"the devil and soul of carnival\". He arrives on a canoe in the form of an effigy, made of straw. A very large number of people gather on the beach to welcome him. On this occasion the dancers are dressed in black or red coloured costumes adorned with horns and tails and holding pitchforks. The effigy is then burnt in the night and on the following day, Ash Wednesday, people wear black and white dresses to mourn the passing of Vival.\n\n"}

It is based on the sacrifices of the sons of the 10th Sikh guru Guru Gobind Singh—Sahibzada Ajit Singh, Jujhar Singh, Jorawar Singh, and Fateh Singh. Om Puri provided the film's narration, and the voice artists for various characters were kept anonymous. It was also the highest grossing Punjabi film when it was released. It was surpassed by Carry on Jatta 2 in July 2018.\n\nProduced by Pammi Baweja under the banner Baweja Movies, the film was released on 6 November 2014 to positive reviews from critics and audiences, and the movie emerged as a major box office success, eventually becoming the highest grossing animated movie ever to have been produced in India.\n\nThe film starts with invasions of India by Mughal and Turkish kings. Guru Tegh Bahadur (9th Guru of Sikhs) sacrificed his life for the human rights and freedom of religion of Kashmiri pandits. Then, Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa to counter the invading forces with martyrdom as the fundamental principle.The film depicts the Battle of Anandpur (1700) in which Mughal General Painde khan was killed by Guru Gobind Singh. The film also depicts the Battle of Chamkaur which took place in December, 1704 CE in which 42 Sikhs (under Guru Gobind singh) fought bravely against 10 lakh mughal forces (under wazir Khan). In the battle of chamkaur,both the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Sahibzada Ajit Singh 18 years old and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh 14 years old were martyred.The mughals were in large number but still they failed to capture Guru Gobind Singh and hence Sikhs defeated Mughals. The Younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh Sahibzada Zorawar Singh who was 9 years old and Sahibzada Fateh Singh who was 7 years old were taken to Wazir Khan's palace and were cruelly and inhumanely executed by the Mughal ruler of Sirhind. Wazir Khan gave orders that masons were to brick the Gurus two youngest sons into a section of the city's wall.\n\n\nPammi Baweja produced the film under the banner of Baweja movies. The Bollywood actor Harman Baweja is the creative producer of the film and Harry Baweja directed the film. The production took nearly five years. Harry Bajwa spent two years doing research for the project. He met the \"Dharam Parchar Committee\" of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and discussed his project. It is prohibited in Sikhism to depict Sikh Gurus in an animated form and their still images were used in this film. The voice artists for other characters were kept anonymous. The film was produced in Punjabi and Hindi and also dubbed in American English. Animation work for the movie was handled by iREALTIES and the film trailer was launched in Mumbai.\n\nAmrinder Gill sung \"Mitar Pyaare Nu\", while Jaspinder Narula and Shipra Goyal sung the song \"Veyla aa gaya hai\". Other tracks from the film are the title track \"Chaar Sahibzaade\", \"Satguru Nanak Pargateya\" and \"Sochte Hue Guru\". Harman Preet Singh Brar , Jaidev Kumar, Amar Mohile and Anand Raj Anand served as music directors. The songs were written by Harman Preet singh brar and Masroor.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics for its story, animation and in-depth research. Jasmine Singh of \"The Tribune\" gave the movie 4.5 stars out of 5. He praised its story, calling it a realistic portrayal and commending the delivery of dialogue and narration by Puri. He regarded the animation quality highly especially as it was the first 3D animated Punjabi film. Shubha Shetty Saha of \"Mid Day\" gave the film 3 stars and acclaimed the story for its sincerity but criticized the animation for its apparent lack of flexibility and expressions on the faces of characters. Jesse Brar of PunjabiReviews.com also positively reviewed the story. He complimented the film's pacing and called it realistic by showing younger sons more like children and not morally objectified. He also approved of the film for keeping the story historical and \"saving itself from becoming religious propaganda.\" Renuka Vyavahare of \"The Times of India\" gave the film 3.5 stars. She enjoyed the film overall and recommended it for children to show them real Indian heroes.\n\nIn India, the film earned 3.5–4 crore in the first week. In the United States, the film earned and in the UK. In total it earned at the international box office across its opening weekend.\n\nIt is available on the DVD format but the Blu-ray edition is yet to be confirmed.\n\nA sequel titled \"Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur\" was released on 11 November 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "4367922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4367922", "title": "Christian hedonism", "text": "Christian hedonism\n\nChristian hedonism is a Christian doctrine found in some evangelical camp, more specifically those of the Reformed tradition especially in the circle of John Piper. The term was coined by Reformed Baptist pastor John Piper in his 1986 book \"Desiring God\" based on Vernard Eller's earlier use of the term \"hedonism\" to describe the same concept. Piper summarizes this philosophy of the Christian life as \"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\"\n\nChristian Hedonism may anachronistically describe the theology of Jonathan Edwards: \"God made the world that he might communicate, and the creature receive, his glory; but that it might [be] received both by the mind and heart. He that testifies His having an idea of God's glory [doesn't] glorify God so much as he that testifies also his approbation of it and his delight in it.\" Piper has said, \"The great goal of all Edward's work was the glory of God. And the greatest thing I have ever learned from Edwards...is that God is glorified most not merely by being known, nor by merely being dutifully obeyed, but by being enjoyed in the knowing and the obeying.\"\n\nThe Westminster Shorter Catechism summarizes the \"chief end of man\" as \"to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\" Piper has suggested that this would be more correct as \"to glorify God \"by\" enjoying Him forever.\" Many Christian hedonists, such as Matt Chandler, point to figures such as Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Edwards as exemplars of Christian hedonism from the past, though their lives predate the term.\n\nChristian hedonism was developed in opposition to the deontology of Immanuel Kant. Kant argued that actions should be considered praiseworthy only if they do not proceed from the actor's desires or expected benefit, but rather from a sense of duty. On the contrary, Christian hedonists advocate for a consequentialist ethic based on an understanding that their greatest possible happiness can be found in God. In this critique of Kant, John Piper was influenced by Ayn Rand.\n\nBritish writer C. S. Lewis, in an oft-quoted passage in his short piece \"The Weight of Glory,\" likewise objects to Kantian ethics:\n\nIf there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and to earnestly hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I suggest that this notion has crept in from Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith. Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires, not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.\nPiper later argues:\n\nBut not only is disinterested morality (doing good \"for its own sake\") impossible; it is undesirable. That is, it is unbiblical; because it would mean that the better a man became the harder it would be for him to act morally. The closer he came to true goodness the more naturally and happily he would do what is good. A good man in Scripture is not the man who dislikes doing good but toughs it out for the sake of duty. A good man loves kindness (Micah 6:8) and delights in the law of the Lord (Psalm 1:2), and the will of the Lord (Psalm 40:8). But how shall such a man do an act of kindness disinterestedly? The better the man, the more joy in obedience.\n\nSome Christians object to Christian Hedonism's controversial name. It has little commonality with philosophical hedonism; however, Piper has stated that a provocative term is \"appropriate for a philosophy that has a life changing effect on its adherents.\" Critics charge that hedonism of any sort puts something (namely, \"pleasure\") before God, which allegedly breaks the first of the Ten Commandments: \"You shall have no other gods before me.\" In response, Piper states in \"Desiring God\" that \"By Christian Hedonism, we do not mean that our happiness is the highest good. We mean that pursuing the highest good will always result in our greatest happiness in the end. We should pursue this happiness, and pursue it with all our might. The desire to be happy is a proper motive for every good deed, and if you abandon the pursuit of your own joy, you cannot love man or please God.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It aims to encourage community celebrations, spiritual healing, research, networking and education.\n\nCircle was founded in 1974 by Selena Fox, and sponsors gatherings and encourages nature conservation, nature meditations and workshops at a range of locations, with the primary site being a site near Mount Horeb, Wisconsin set in forested hills. Circle Sanctuary's land is fully owned by Circle Sanctuary Inc., a 501(c)3 non-profit.\n\nThe organization has been prominent in the campaign to permit the pentacle to be displayed on the gravestones of Wiccan members of U.S. forces, and Selena Fox was one of the plaintiffs in the successful action to obtain this permission. Nine of the gravestones are displayed at the Sanctuary's cemetery at Barneveld, Wisconsin, about west of Madison.\n\nSince its creation in 1974, Circle Sanctuary has provided support to Neopagans in several ways, chiefly as a networking resource. For many years, Circle was the only national networking resource available to most Neopagans, especially those who were not located in major cities with large Pagan or Neopagan populations (such as New York City, Chicago, Illinois, and San Francisco, California). Circle Network News, originally a newspaper-like quarterly and now a quarterly magazine, provided a method for Pagans in less populated areas to find others of like mind. Networking support remains one of Circle's core functions.\n\nCircle sponsors many gatherings, the best-known of which is the Pagan Spirit Gathering, held annually at Litha (Midsummer). Other major festivals on Circle Sanctuary land include Beltane (near May 1), Green Spirit (Lughnasadh, around August 1) and Samhain (around October 31). Additional smaller gatherings, classes and celebrations are held year-round.\n\nCircle has 26 active ministers who perform community support and passage rite work throughout the United States.\n\nFounded in 1974 by Selena Fox and Jim Alan, Circle's first public event was a Yule ritual hosted at the couple's home in Madison, Wisconsin. The following year, Circle moved to a farm in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (just outside Madison). In 1978, a favorable article written by Jacqueline Mitchard appeared in The Capital Times, which marked the beginning of Circle's public outreach. The same year, Fox and Alan began hosting a Thursday night, weekly half-hour radio program called \"Circle Magic\" on 89.7 FM WORT in Madison and a television show \"Magick Circle\"(sic) on cable 4; the radio program ran for four years.\n\n1978 was a pivotal year for Circle. Incorporated as a Wiccan Church in Wisconsin on October 27, 1978, the organization's legal name was changed to \"Church of Circle Wicca, Inc.\" Circle's original coven structure was replaced with a church structure, including a board of directors and ordained ministers. Fox and Alan released a tape entitled \"Circle Magick Music\", one of the first Neopagan music collections to be widely distributed. They also published a paperback collection of music in \"Circle Magic Songs\". A weekly, hour-long cable television show was added on Cable 4 of Madison. The following year, Circle was featured in \"Time\" magazine on the Religion page, in an article about a handfasting the couple performed at the third Pan Pagan Festival at Demotte, Indiana.\n\nIn 1979 Jim Alan and Selena Fox began working with the Chameleon Club, a Cleveland, Ohio-based group. They hosted several appearances at Case Western Reserve University and other Cleveland venues, and on the ABC television talk shows Morning Exchange and Live on Five. Circle helped launch the first Starwood Festival in 1981, just one month after the first Pagan Spirit Gathering.\n\nIn 1980, Circle received federal recognition as a church, and moved to another rented farm in Black Earth, Wisconsin. The first Litha gathering was held, a precursor for the Pagan Spirit Gathering that made its debut in 1981. Fundraising for a land purchase began in 1980, and the land was purchased in 1983.\n\nIts current legal name, \"Circle Sanctuary, Inc.,\" was registered with the State of Wisconsin on September 30, 1983.\n\nDuring 1984, Circle Sanctuary assisted in updating the United States Army's \"Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\". By that time, Circle Network had existed for several years, bringing Neopagans of many paths together. Circle was also involved in legal battles during the mid- to late-80's, as the local township government attempted to use zoning laws to prevent Circle from establishing the sanctuary land as church land. This effort failed, as Circle won key decisions that culminated in the same local government granting Circle the nation's first official recognition as a church of Witchcraft in 1988. Today, Circle enjoys excellent relations with the local town board.\n\nThe 1990s were a period of increasing growth for Circle. Both of its executive directors received advanced degrees by tying their fields of study into their Neopagan experience, with Selena achieving an M.S in Counseling in 1995 from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Dennis achieving a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1994 from Saybrook Institute. Circle was a sponsor for the Parliament of World Religions in 1993, bringing Circle wide enough notice to attract the attention of fundamentalist Christian activists such as Pat Robertson, who described Circle Sanctuary on his television program \"The 700 Club\" and in his book \"The New World Order\" as \"a 1000 acre [4 km²] sanctuary for witches\", exaggerating the Sanctuary's land area fivefold.\n\nCircle also participated in the Nature Religion Today conference sponsored by Lancaster University, United Kingdom in 1996. In 1997, the Pagan Spirit Gathering moved to Wisteria Campground in southern Ohio, having been held in southwestern Wisconsin at Eagle Cave near Blue River, Wisconsin. In 1998, \"Circle Magazine\" debuted as a quarterly magazine, replacing \"Circle Network News\" which had been published as a newsletter/newspaper since 1978.\n\nCircle Network was founded in 1977 for the purpose of assisting Pagans of all paths to \"connect with each other and share information, ideas, and energy\". There is no cost to affiliate, and membership is open to any Pagan whose path espouses a reverence for nature and holds an ethical structure consistent with the Wiccan Rede.\n\nCircle Sanctuary sponsors gatherings year-round, but its largest festival is the Pagan Spirit Gathering (PSG), held annually to coincide with the Summer Solstice. At first, the festivals were held at Eagle Cave in Grant County Wisconsin, but it outgrew the facilities and in 1997 moved to a location near Athens, Ohio at Wisteria. In 2009, PSG moved to Camp Zoe near Salem, Missouri, and in 2011, PSG moved to Stonehouse Farm in central Illinois.\n\nAll other gatherings sponsored by Circle happen on Circle Sanctuary land, with the exception of the Winter Solstice pageant held at a Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Madison.\n\nCircle Sanctuary founded the Lady Liberty League in 1985. The LLL is the \"religious freedom support service\" of Circle, providing information and networking for those who are working with religious freedom issues relevant to Wicca and/or Nature spirituality. In addition, the LLL worked actively to counter negative stereotypes of Neopagans, and has assisted others in furthering Wicca's acceptance. A recent example is the struggle to win approval from the United States Military to place pentacles on the memorial markers for Wiccan soldiers killed in the line of duty.\n\nCircle Sanctuary is located on a private nature preserve. Owned by Circle Sanctuary Inc, founded as a preserve in 1983 and zoned as \"sacred land\" in 1988, the Preserve is dedicated not only to support and maintain local biodiversity, but also to allow people to study interactions on the land from both a scientific and a spiritual basis.\n\nThe land is not open to drop-in visitors, in accordance with its purpose as a nature preserve. However, the land and its sacred sites are open for:\n\n"}

{"id": "11313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11313", "title": "Father Ted", "text": "Father Ted\n\nFather Ted is a British sitcom that was produced by Hat Trick Productions for Channel 4. Written by Irish writers Arthur Mathews & Graham Linehan and starring a predominantly Irish cast, it originally aired over three series from 21 April 1995 until 1 May 1998, including a Christmas special, for a total of 25 episodes. The show aired on RTÉ Two in Ireland, and in Australia on Nine Network (series 1) and ABC Television (series 2 and 3).\n\nSet on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland's west coast, the show starred Dermot Morgan as the eponymous Father Ted Crilly, alongside fellow priests Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly). Exiled on the island for various past incidents, the priests live together in the parochial house with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). The show was critically acclaimed, receiving several BAFTA awards, and remains a popular sitcom in Britain and Ireland. In 2004, it was ranked Number 11 in a poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom.\n\nThe show follows the misadventures of three Irish Roman Catholic priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly, Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle, who always wants to serve them tea.\n\nThe three priests answer to Bishop Len Brennan, who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money 'resting' in his account and a child being deprived of a visit to Lourdes so that Ted could go to Las Vegas), Dougal for something only referred to as the \"Blackrock Incident\" (resulting in many nuns' \"lives [being] irreparably damaged\"), and Jack for his alcoholism and womanising, particularly for an incident at a wedding in Athlone.\n\nThe show revolves around the priests' lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted's schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.\n\n\"Father Ted\" ran for three series from 1995 to 1998, including a Christmas special. A total of 25 episodes were produced.\n\nLinehan and Mathews first met while working at \"Hot Press\". In the late 1980s, Mathews, Paul Woodfull and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a U2 tribute band. The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.\n\nIn 1991, Mathews left his job at \"Hot Press\" and moved into Linehan's London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as \"The All New Alexei Sayle Show\" and \"The Fast Show\". One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called \"Irish Lives\", with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in Maynooth College. Producer Geoffrey Perkins suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.\n\nMathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required. Maurice O'Donoghue, who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness. Mathews always preferred Dermot Morgan; Linehan was initially reluctant, fearing he would play Ted the same as \"Father Trendy\", a character he played on the RTÉ television show \"The Live Mike\", but Morgan lobbied hard for the role and was cast.\n\nThe show was pitched directly to the UK's Hat Trick Productions and Channel 4 by the duo, contrary to rumours that RTÉ (the Irish national broadcaster) were originally offered the series but rejected it.\n\nThree series and one Christmas special were aired. Declan Lowney directed the first two series and the Christmas special, while the third series was directed by Linehan (location scenes) and Andy De Emmony (studio scenes). In addition, Morgan and O'Hanlon hosted an hour of Comic Relief in character, during which Kelly and McLynn also made brief guest appearances. One day after the shooting of series three wrapped, Dermot Morgan died of a heart attack, aged 45. As a mark of respect, the third series was first broadcast a week later than originally planned.\n\nJust weeks before his death Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being typecast: \"I don't want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years.\"\n\nFollowing Morgan's death, the production company received calls from numerous agents and casting directors suggesting either new actors for the role of Ted or spin-offs without the character; Linehan and Mathews declined all offers.\n\nIn 1994, the writers asked alternative rock band Pulp to compose the theme music for \"Father Ted\", requesting a parody of a typical sitcom theme. When Pulp declined involvement, they contacted Neil Hannon, frontman of Northern Irish chamber pop band The Divine Comedy. Hannon's first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkins's advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer Darren Allison at The Jesus and Mary Chain's private studio. One of William Reid's guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon. Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedy's 1996 album \"Casanova\": the final \"Father Ted\" theme became \"Songs of Love\", while Hannon's rejected theme became \"A Woman of the World\".\n\nIn 2010, Linehan discussed the dramatic effect this choice had on the tone of the series: \"'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [Hannon] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and \"Songs of Love\", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [Perkins] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nThe Divine Comedy also contributed most of the show's original music, including the songs \"Big Men in Frocks\" (for the episode \"Rock-a-Hula Ted\"), \"My Lovely Horse\" and \"The Miracle is Mine\" (for \"A Song for Europe\"), and \"My Lovely Mayo Mammy\" (for \"Night of the Nearly Dead\"). Neil Hannon also provided Ted and Dougal's vocals in the dream sequence version of \"My Lovely Horse\", which was produced by Allison and Hannon, and later appeared as a B-side on the band's single \"Gin Soaked Boy\".\n\nLocation work for \"Father Ted\" was done mostly in County Clare, including locations at Corofin, Ennis, Kilfenora, Ennistymon, and Kilnaboy. The Parochial House is McCormack's at Glenquin, on the Boston road from Kilnaboy. The cinema featured in \"The Passion of St Tibulus\" was the Ormonde Cinema, Greystones, County Wicklow and \"The Field\", the location for Funland in \"'Good Luck, Father Ted'\", is in Portrane, North County Dublin. The 'Very Dark Caves' featured in \"The Mainland\" were the Aillwee caves in the Burren, County Clare.\n\nSome exterior shots for the episode \"And God Created Woman\" were filmed in Dún Laoghaire, South County Dublin. The opening sequence (including shots of the \"Plassy\" shipwreck) were filmed over Inisheer — the smallest of the Aran Islands. The interior scenes were recorded at the London Studios in front of a live studio audience.\n\nThe series is set in a humorously surreal world in which Ted is the only fully rounded normal character among \"caricatures\", according to Graham Linehan: \"exaggerated-over-friendly, over-quiet, over-stupid, over-dull [...] they really only got one thing, they've got one job.\"\n\nEmbarrassment plays a role in many storylines, in a similar fashion to \"Fawlty Towers\". Linehan says, \"if Ted is in a situation that is slightly embarrassing we get him out of it [...] by having him lying or cheating, basically digging a massive hole for himself\". Arthur Mathews has described \"Seinfeld\" as a major influence on the comedy of \"Father Ted\", with himself and Linehan being \"big fans\" of the show. \"Father Ted\" also contains references to pop culture, and some film parodies, such as the episode \"Speed 3\".\n\nRegarding the series's religious content, Linehan says \"Ted doesn't have an anti-religious view of life, but a non-religious view. It's a job to him. He doesn't care about religion.\" While writing, he says the show's creators imagined Ted and Dougal as \"just two people who happen to be [priests]\".\n\n\"Father Ted\" was met with critical acclaim and is one of the most popular sitcoms in Irish TV history.\n\nIn 1996 and 1999, the show won the BAFTA award for Best Comedy, while Morgan also won Best Comedy Performance. In 1995 the show won Best New TV Comedy at the British Comedy Awards, with O'Hanlon receiving Top TV Comedy Newcomer Award. At the 1996 British Comedy Awards the show won Top Channel 4 Sitcom Award, McLynn took the Top TV Comedy Actress award. In 1997 the show was given the Best Channel 4 Sitcom Award. It was also ranked at number 50 in the BFI's 2000 list of the 100 greatest British television programmes of the 20th century, the highest ranking Channel 4 production on the list. In 2004, it came 11th in the poll for Britain's Best Sitcom.\n\nIn August 2012, Channel 4 viewers voted the series as the No 1 in \"C4's 30 Greatest Comedy Shows\".\n\nNotable fans of the show include director Steven Spielberg, musicians Liam Gallagher, Madonna, Cher and Moby, actors Jim Carrey and Steve Martin, comedian Ricky Gervais, and wrestler Sheamus. Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees was buried with a copy of the DVD box set. Singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor is a fan, and attended the recording of the Christmas special. Irish musician Bono also requested to appear in the series.\n\nThe Irish media frequently uses the series as a point of comparison in political stories.\n\nIn January 2007, a dispute arose between Inisheer and Inishmore over which island can claim to be Craggy Island, and thereby host a three-day Friends of Ted Festival. The dispute was settled by a five-a-side football match that February. Inishmore won 2–0 allowing them to use the title of Craggy Island until February 2008, while Inisheer was given the title of Rugged Island. The Friends of Ted Festival, better known as Ted Fest, has been held annually as a \"Father Ted\" fan convention since 2007.\n\nOn 1 January 2011, Channel 4 dedicated a night of programming to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary year. This included \"Father Ted: Unintelligent Design\", a documentary on the show's influences, and \"Small, Far Away: The World of Father Ted\", a documentary revisiting the show's history with the writers and many of the surviving cast (Pauline McLynn declined to take part).\n\nIn 2001, Pauline McLynn reprised her role as Mrs Doyle in a run of advertisements for the UK's Inland Revenue, reminding people to get their taxes in on time with her catchphrase from the programme (\"Go on, go on, go on...\"). It was voted in an Adwatch poll of 1,000 people as the year's worst advertisement.\n\nLater in 2001, Ardal O'Hanlon returned to the role of Father Dougal for a series of PBS advertisements to coincide with \"Father Ted\"s American broadcast; these segments were included on later DVD releases as \"Fundraising with Father Dougal\".\n\nIn 2012, Frank Kelly made a brief appearance as Father Jack on an episode of \"The One Show\" with Graham Norton.\n\nIn 2014, guest star Ben Keaton returned to the role of Father Austin Purcell, performing a stand-up routine and hosting the pub quiz \"Arse Biscuits\" in-character. Keaton also set up a Twitter page for the character, and a website where fans can purchase customised Father Purcell video greetings. In 2015, he launched the spin-off web series \"Cook Like a Priest\".\n\nIn February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling marked the anniversary of Morgan's death with \"Ah Ted\", an event held in Dublin's Tivoli Variety Theatre. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, Patrick McDonnell, Joe Rooney and Michael Redmond reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, withstanding one wrestler's attack on his crotch because he has \"no willy\", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's \"The Time I Met the Devil\", which follows him on the way to give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.\n\nSince the end of the series, several attempts to remake \"Father Ted\" have been reported, but none has yet materialised.\n\nIn July 2003, it was announced that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by Spike Feresten, who previously wrote for US sitcoms \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Simpsons\". Ferensten stated: \"I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles.\" Hat Trick founders Denise O'Donoghue and Jimmy Mulville were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted \"The Kumars at No. 42\" for an American audience.\n\nIn March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York. Steve Martin and Graham Norton would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid £500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.\n\nIn November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in New England. American actor John Michael Higgins was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: \"The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't have that in our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that. So I'll be Father Ted, we'll see how it goes.\" Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.\n\nIn January 2015, Linehan said that there had been \"a few attempts\" by US broadcasters to remake the show, including one which would have been set in Boston – an idea Linehan considered \"ridiculous\".\n\nIn an interview with \"Radio Times\" in January 2015, Linehan revealed that he wanted to revive \"Father Ted\" as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series itself, \"because of the risk you poison people's memories of the original\", but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. Linehan mentioned the possibility of a dance number with \"spinning cardinals\". He said that the musical would have to reference the Catholic child abuse scandals, stating, \"The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just can't ignore this stuff.\" Mathews was \"not as convinced\" of the musical idea, though Linehan still insisted it could work.\n\nIn December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a \"Father Michael Cleary-type character\", and that the \"Father Ted\" musical may follow. He expressed concerns that it would \"dilute the product\" or be seen as a \"cash-in\", but said that he believed there was an audience for the project.\n\nIn April 2017, Linehan said that the musical would draw inspiration from \"The Book of Mormon\", and would \"go for the jugular ... you get all the things people loved about it, all the innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge\". Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a \"world-shaking\" story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to \"some weird succession thing\". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.\n\nIn June 2018, Linehan announced that \"Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical\" was nearing completion, with a script by Linehan and Mathews and music by Hannon. Linehan said, \"It's the real final episode of \"Father Ted\". This is true and not one of my stupid jokes, I promise. Didn't want to do something until the right idea came along. This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days.\". Matthews confirmed his involvement in the musical in July 2018.\n\n\n"}

Occulta) is a magical organization and \"Aquarian Age\" mystery school in the Western Mystery Tradition. The FLO teaches occult sciences, such as Tarot, Qabalah, Alchemy, Astrology, and related Arcane Sciences.\n\nThe Fraternity of the Hidden Light traces its lineage to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Fraternity website (in a section entitled \"History\") tells the story of the rise of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn but also of a new Order that was founded by former members of the Thoth-Hermes temple of the Alpha et Omega, in New York. Though this description does not give names, the events of which it speaks point to and suggest Paul Foster Case's founding of the School of Ageless Wisdom, later called the Builders of the Adytum or B.O.T.A.\n\nThe Fraternity of the Hidden Light was founded in the early 1980s, by Dr. Paul Clark, who trained with B.O.T.A.The Fraternity has lodges on all continents (except Antarctica).\n\nAccording to its website, the Fraternity of the Hidden Light exists for a three-fold purpose: “(1) To act as a modern day repository of the Ancient Wisdom teachings of the Tarot, Qabalah, Alchemy, Astrology and related Arcane sciences; (2) To train its members for the service to humanity, by providing a seeding ground for their growth and development through group and individual applications of the Wisdom teachings; (3) To promulgate the Ancient Wisdom teachings in an effort to elevate the consciousness of humanity.” In the Statement of Purpose, the Fraternity emphasizes the importance of service and states that the practices of the Fraternity are for the development of \"Wisdom, Power and Love\".\n\nThe Fraternity of the Hidden Light is structured into several levels. There is first the \"Probationary\" level, in which training in general esoteric knowledge and basic skills, such as meditation, is given.\n\nThe others are initiatory levels. The first or \"outer\" order focuses on the \"growth of Wisdom, Love and Power\" and the development \"of their being, resulting in balance and harmony. The second or \"inner\" order consists of those who have both achieved this inner harmony but have also received \"illumination,\" i.e. the higher Self is \"awakened and in control of their lives.\" The third order includes the \"Great Adepts and Masters\" from the throughout ages who guide the Fraternity.\n\nPaul Foster Case's work is a major influence on the Fraternity of the Hidden Light. Indeed, the Fraternity has published the original lessons that Case wrote for the School of Ageless Wisdom, the organization that later became B.O.T.A. The Steward of the Fraternity has recently published a book entitled \"Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works\". Ann Davies, who took over the leadership of BOTA after the death of Case, is also an important influence on the Fraternity. Paul Clark is also an acknowledged authority on the thought of Dion Fortune who also influences the Fraternity. The emphasis on the triad Wisdom, Power and Love in the Statement of Purpose echoes the goals of the esoteric orders according to Dion Fortune in \"Esoteric Orders and their Work\", Chapter 3.\n\nThe Fraternity of the Hidden Light also publishes occult books.

Typically Friends meeting houses do not have steeples.\n\nQuakers do not believe that meeting for worship should occur in any special place. They believe that \"where two or three meet together in my name, I am there among them\" (Revised English Bible, Matthew, Ch 18, v 20). Therefore, meeting for worship may take place in any place. Early Quakers often met for worship outdoors or in local public buildings. However, when the Religious Society of Friends began to grow there became a need for buildings to house their meetings.\n\nQuakers have always reserved the word \"church\" to mean the body of people who make up the worshipping community: Quakers do not use the word \"church\" to refer to the bricks and mortar of a worshipping community. George Fox, an early Quaker, spoke of places of worship that have steeples as \"steeple houses\", and those that do not as \"meeting houses\". This practice is shared by a number of other non-conformist Christian denominations, including Unitarians, Christadelphians, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Mennonites.\n\nSome Friends meeting houses were adapted from existing structures, but most were purpose-built. Briggflatts Meeting House in Cumbria, England is an example of the latter. The hallmark of a meeting house is extreme simplicity and the absence of any liturgical symbols. More specifically, though, the defining characteristics of the Quaker meetinghouse are simplicity, equality, community, and peace. Though never explicitly written or spoken about, these tenets (or “Testimonies”) of Quakerism were the basic, and only, guidelines for building a meetinghouse, as was seen through the continuity of the use of Testimonies within meetinghouse design. While meetinghouse design evolved over time to a standardization of the double-cell structure without explicit guidelines for building, the meetinghouse’s reflective architecture revealed a deeper meaning. The meetinghouse design manifested and enhanced Quaker Testimonies and the cultivation of the Inner Light that was essential to Friends. Quakers easily moved from one place of meeting to another, but when given the opportunity to design and construct their own place of meeting, Friends infused their Testimonies in the planning, design, and construction of the building. \n\nMeeting Houses built in a traditional style usually had two meeting rooms: one for the main meeting for worship, and another where the women's business meeting may be held (often referred to as the women's meeting room). Meeting houses of this style usually have a \"minister's gallery\" at one end of the meeting room, where traditionally those \"traveling in the ministry\" would have sat, with an \"elders bench\" immediately in front of this. Wooden benches facing this occupy the rest of the room, often with a gallery for extra seating. Meeting houses of this style usually have high windows so that worshippers sitting in meeting for worship cannot see outside.\n\nMeeting houses built in a more modern design will usually consist of: a large meeting room, smaller rooms for committees, children's classes, etc., a kitchen and toilets.\n\nThe meeting room itself is a place for Friends to withdraw from the world. The windows are set sufficiently high that worshippers will not be distracted by the activities of the world's people outside, or in some cases they provide a view into the meeting house garden. The seating was originally long, hard and wooden. Today it is usually separate chairs but the layout remains the same – a square or rectangle facing inwards to a central table.\n\nSee also \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The channel features many types of programs with Buddhist content, and has programs in several languages.\n\nThe channel started in 2002, as a means to reach remote provinces in Thailand. Controversially, the channel made international headlines in 2012 when it featured a teaching on the afterlife of Steve Jobs. On 26 December 2016, Thai authorities withdrew the permit for the satellite channel permanently, during the legal investigations into the temple by the Thai junta. In April 2017, it was reported, however, that the channel's programming had continued, but broadcast through the Internet only.

The channel originated from an initiative in 2001 when people living in the far provinces of Thailand wanted to listen to the teachings of the temple. The temple therefore provided live teachings through a thousand public telephone lines, through which people could follow the activities. The telephone lines had many restrictions in use, and the temple started to broadcast through a satellite television channel instead. Later, in 2005, the temple developed an online counterpart to the channel.\n\nThe channel is managed by Phra Maha Nopon Puññajayo, who supervises a team of thirty volunteers. Previously, it was known by the pun 'the Dhamma satellite' (). The channel was one of the first widely spread satellite channels in Thailand, described as a form of \"positive television\" (). The channel's taglines were \"The secrets of life revealed\" and \"The only one\". Although the channel broadcasts over thirty different programs, the soap operas with Buddhist content have been most awarded: in 2008, the channel received an award from the Society for Positive Television in Thailand, and in 2010, it received an award from the National Anti-Corruption Commission—both were given for the edifying effects of the channel's soap operas. However, a more general award was also given by the House of Representatives in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, the channel was ordered to shut down and its permit eventually withdrawn permanently during the junta's crackdown on Wat Phra Dhammakaya during the Klongchan controversy. The channel was later revived in a new digital format, called GBN, short for Global Buddhist Network, which can only be accessed through the Internet.\n\nThe main focus of the channel, as described by the temple, is moral education. It has programs for people of different ages. It broadcasts guided meditations, talks, preaching, songs, documentaries, dramas, live events and cartoons twenty-four hours a day. Songs played on the channel are often parody versions of popular songs, in diverse genres, with Buddhist content. They explain Buddhist customs and pay homage to important teachers. The programming is aimed at different age groups and diverse communities: e.g. there is a cartoon series about the Jātaka tales for children. The most popular program is a broadcast of a teaching called \"Fan Nai Fan\", which also includes a guided meditation. Before the 2016 crackdown by the Thai junta, the channel could be watched or listened to for free through satellite television, Internet, cable and radio. In 2005, it was reported that DMC had a hundred thousand viewers. In 2016, the satellite channel could be received in all continents in the world, except for South America and Antartica. The channel has programs in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese language.\n\nThe channel was also broadcast in public places like temples, hotels and prisons. It sought cooperation with other Buddhist countries as well: the temple has assisted with establishing a Sri Lankan television channel with Buddhist content called Shraddha TV, for which it has made content available for free and hired Sri Lankans to help translate. Discussion has also taken place about broadcasting Abhidhamma teachings from Burmese teachers through the channel.\n\nIn 2012, the temple broadcast a talk by Luang Por Dhammajayo, the then abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, about what happened to Steve Jobs after his death. The talk came as a response to a software engineer of Apple who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a \"deva\" (heavenly being) living close to his former offices, as a result of the karma of having given knowledge to people. He was a deva with a creative, but angry temperament. The talk was much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple answered the critics, saying that the talk was meant to illustrate principles of karma, not to defame Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state.\n\nCritics such as Phra Paisal Visalo and religion scholar Surapot Taweesak pressed the Supreme Sangha Council, who leads the monastic community in Thailand, to investigate further as to whether Luang Por Dhammajayo had fraudulent intentions. Surapot, known for his liberal views on separation of religion and state, was criticized by sociologist Kengkit Kitirianglap and others, however, for abandoning his liberal position. With regard to the teaching about Steve Jobs, Kengkit argued that the state, of which the council is part, should not get involved in what is \"true Buddhism\" and what is not. Surapot replied that urging the council to crack down on Luang Por Dhammajayo does not go against democratic principles, because the monastic discipline applies to all monks equally.\n\nIn 2014, Wat Phra Dhammakaya came under scrutiny under the new military junta and in 2015 was implicated in the Klongchan controversy. 11.37 billion baht ($3.6M, €2.9M or £2.6M, ) was allegedly embezzled from the Klongchan Credit Union Cooperative, in which a portion totaling over one billion baht was found to have been given to the temple via public donations. The investigations resulted in several failed raids on the temple and the channel was ordered to shut down for thirty days, authorities citing that the channel was used to mobilize people to resist a possible arrest of the former abbot, as people had done during the first raid. The temple appealed to a higher court, denying the accusations and stating that insufficient evidence had been provided. The temple further described the shutdown as an infringement of human rights.\n\nThe channel's broadcast permit was permanently withdrawn the same month, on 26 December. Critics compared the shutdown with the military crackdown during the 1992 Black May protest, news outlet Bangkok Post criticizing the junta's broadcasting commission for \"operating outside the courts and justice system\". DMC's radio station had not been withdrawn yet, pending an investigation by the police, and the online channel was also still available. Despite the channel being shut down, Thai Rath and other main media outlets have continued to broadcast the temple's ceremonies. The temple has stated that the number of people joining ceremonies has increased since the shutdown, people showing sympathy with the temple and the satellite channel.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, a host of \"Inside Thailand\" program on Spring News noticed a revival of the Dhammakaya Media Channel through a new digital format, called GBN, short for Global Buddhist Network. The new tagline of the channel was \"Channel for the path to the cessation of suffering and attainment of Dhamma\". The channel could be received through the Internet only, and featured very similar contents as before, although the temple's spokesperson assured there would be no further attempts at mobilizing people. Thus, the channel continued in online formats only, through a website and a separate online broadcast. the website ranked 674th of all Thai websites on the Alexa ranking.\n\nThe closing down of DMC was not the last time that the junta decided to impose sanctions against a media outlet. In March 2017, the junta closed down Voice TV for seven days, after the channel criticized the martial law imposed on Wat Phra Dhammakaya during the junta's crackdown. And in August the same year, Peace TV was also closed down for a month, the junta citing \"it broke the rules of the NCPO\". Some reports related this to a policy of removing former PM Thaksin's influence, a policy which has also been connected with Wat Phra Dhammakaya.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3190054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3190054", "title": "Heru-ra-ha", "text": "Heru-ra-ha\n\nHeru (literally \"Horus sun-flesh\", among other possible meanings) is a composite deity within Thelema, a religion that began in 1904 with Aleister Crowley and his \"Book of the Law\". Heru-ra-ha is composed of Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-paar-kraat. He is associated with the other two major Thelemic deities found in \"The Book of the Law,\" Nuit and Hadit, who are also godforms related to ancient Egyptian mythology. Their stelae link Nuit and Hadit to the established ancient Egyptian deities Nut and Hor-Bhdt (Horus of Edfu).\n\nThe Active Aspect of Heru-ra-ha is Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Egyptian: Ra-Hoor-Khu-It, Ra-Har-Khuti, Ra-Har-Akht or Ra-Horakhty), more commonly referred to by the Greek transliteration \"Ra-Herakhty\", means \"Ra (who is) Horus on the Horizon.\" Ra-Hoor-Khuit or Ra-Hoor-Khut is the speaker in the Third Chapter of \"The Book of the Law\". Some quotes from his Chapter:\n\n\nWithin Thelema, Ra-Hoor-Khuit is called the Lord of the Aeon (which began in 1904 according to Thelemic doctrine), and The Crowned and Conquering Child. \n\nAccording to the instructions that Crowley claimed to have received from the 8th Enochian Aethyr, the five-pointed \"star of flame\" symbolizes Ra-Hoor-Khuit in certain contexts.\n\nAn appellation of Ra, identifying him with Horus, this name shows the two as manifestations of the singular Solar Force. \"Khuit\" also refers to a local form of the goddess Hathor at Athribis, who guarded the heart of Osiris. \"Khut\" refers to the goddess Isis as light giver of the new year, and by some accounts can also mean the fiery serpent on the crown of Ra. This last meaning serves as a title of Isis in one of the hymns to \"Isis-Hathor\" at the Temple of Philae. Hathor also has the titles \"Uraeus of Ra\" and \"Great Flame\".\n\nThe Passive Aspect of Heru-ra-ha is Hoor-pa-kraat (Egyptian: Har-par-khered), more commonly referred to by the Greek transliteration \"Harpocrates\", meaning \"Horus the Child\"; Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, sometimes distinguished from their brother Horus the Elder, who was the old patron deity of Upper Egypt. Hoor is represented as a young boy with a child's sidelock of hair, sucking his finger. The Greeks, Ovid and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn attributed silence to him, presumably because the sucking of the finger is suggestive of the common \"shhh\"-gesture. \n\nAiwass, the being who dictated \"The Book of the Law\" to Crowley, introduces himself as \"the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat\" in the book's first chapter. \n\nAlso known as \"The Babe in the Lotus\", Hoor-paar-kraat is sometimes thought of as the baby Ra-Hoor-Khuit and sometimes as the younger brother of Horus. The former interpretation in the works of Aleister Crowley portrays Ra-Hoor-Khuit—in place of the Golden Dawn's Osiris/Jesus—as a model for the initiate, and thus describes attainment as a natural growth process, de-emphasizing the metaphor of death and resurrection. In the second interpretation, the Golden Dawn placed Hoor-paar-kraat at the center of their Hall of Ma'at while the officers of the temple (one of whom represented Horus) revolved around him.\n\nThe Cry of the First Aethyr in Crowley's \"Liber 418\" presents Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, as the union of many opposites.\n\n\"It is a little child covered with lilies and roses. He is supported by countless myriads of Archangels. The Archangels are all the same colourless brilliance, and every one of them is blind. Below the Archangels again are many, many other legions, and so on far below, so far that the eye cannot pierce. And on his forehead, and on his heart, and in his hand, is the secret sigil of the Beast. (fn: Sun and moon conjoined) And of all this the glory is so great that all the spiritual senses fail, and their reflections in the body fail.(...)This child danceth not, but it is because he is the soul of the two dances, --- the right hand and the left hand, and in him they are one dance, the dance without motion.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39241541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39241541", "title": "Hiacoomes", "text": "Hiacoomes\n\nHiacoomes (~1610s – 1690) was a Wampanoag American Indian from the island of Martha's Vineyard, (Wampanoag: ), who in 1643 became the first member of his society to convert to Christianity under the tutelage of the missionary Thomas Mayhew Jr. He would then, with the assistance of Mayhew, become a leading preacher to his fellow Wampanoag on the island, playing a major role in the widespread conversion of the Wampanoag from their traditional beliefs to Christianity.\n\nLittle is known of Hiacoomes' early life except that he was of 'mean' descent and described as \"a man of a sad and sober spirit\" who had a low ranking in the then existing social hierarchy of the Wampanoag. In 1639 the first English settlement of the island, under the direction of Thomas Mayhew Senior, had begun at Edgartown. Hiacoomes took an unusual interest in these newcomers and eventually began to form relationships with some of the English with whom he visited in their houses and they in his wigwam. He even attended religious meetings, where he managed to catch the curiosity of Thomas Mayhew Junior (1618?–1657), son of the island's governor and local pastor to the English. Seeing this curiosity, the younger Mayhew invited Hiacoomes to his house each Sabbath evening where the soon-to-be missionary to the Indians would teach and instruct his native charge in the doctrines and ideas of Puritanism. Under his direction, Hiacoomes became a professed Christian, learning how to read in the process. A letter reference dating from 1651 puts him at that moment as about 30 years of age, so if that is to be believed then Hiacoomes at this stage would have been in his early-to-mid 20s.\n\nAt first Hiacoomes mostly faced opposition from his fellow Wampanoag, some of whom mocked him and called him \"an English man\". Opposition from sachems to this English innovation was widespread. However, in 1646 an epidemic hit the island devastating the native population, following a similar epidemic which had occurred three years earlier. It is estimated that about half of the native population of the island perished in these plagues. But Hiacoomes and his family were unaffected. That, and the use of cures by Thomas Mayhew Junior, gave a medical appeal to Christianity in a place where traditional shamanism had failed. This interest was transferred to a group of sachems, led by Miohqsoo and Towanquatick, who invited Hiacoomes to a meeting six miles away late at night where he was to discuss his religion with these sachems. The records of this discussion are described in Experience Mayhew's \"Indian Converts\":\n\nFrom this point on, with greater community support Hiacoomes began preaching more openly on theological topics such as sin, the Trinity, the fall of Adam and the redeeming role of faith in Christ. He especially attacked the shamans, who were deemed to be agents of the Devil by the English as well as being seen as the principal source of opposition to the new faith. In 1649 he publicly faced down the shamans by challenging them to kill him using their magic, which he said was inferior to that of God. He survived and this failure must have helped discredit the shamans as it was followed by a rash of conversions. By 1651 Christian Practices were already spreading quickly throughout the community and according to Thomas Mayhew Junior, there were already 199 Wampanoag who \"professed themselves to be worshippers of ... God\". Several of these converts were ex-shamans. By then, Hiacoomes was preaching twice every Sunday in sermons agreed upon with Mayhew who was still very much teaching and instructing his first charge.\n\nIn this path he continued for the rest of his life, although greatly interrupted by the untimely death of Thomas Mayhew Junior in 1657, but despite this setback, he continued to play a major role in spreading Christianity, so that by 1660 nearly all the island's Wampanoag community had formally become Christian. Even as late as 1674, Hiacoomes was still seen by one English commentator as the leading \"Indian teacher\" on the island. By then, it was Wampanoag missionaries themselves and not English ones who were leading the conversion charge. He had several children, one of whom, Joel or Ioel, was one of the five Indian students who attended Harvard Indian College during its brief existence but died while there. In 1670, under the aegis of John Eliot and John Cotton Jr., the first formal Indian church was created on the island, with Hiacoomes ordained as minister alongside John Tackanash. He gave the funeral oration after the latter's death in 1683. He died in 1690. Several members of his family and descendants would also become leading Christian Indians on the island.\n\n"}
{"id": "4162372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4162372", "title": "Islam in Europe", "text": "Islam in Europe\n\nIslam is the second largest religious belief in Europe after Christianity. Although the majority of Muslim communities in Europe are of recent migrations, there are pre-Modern ones in the Balkans.\n\nIslam entered southern Europe through the invading \"Moors\" of North Africa in the 8th–10th centuries; Muslim political entities existed firmly in what is today Spain, Portugal, South Italy and Malta for several centuries. The Muslim community in these territories was converted or expelled by the end of the 15th century (see \"Reconquista\"). Islam expanded into the Caucasus through the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Ottoman Empire expanded into southeastern Europe, invading and conquering huge portions of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries. Over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire also gradually lost almost all of its European territories, until the empire collapsed in 1922. The countries of the Balkans continue to have large populations of native Muslims, though the majority are unobservant or secular.\n\nThe term \"Muslim Europe\" is used for the Muslim-majority countries of Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Transcontinental countries, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have large Muslim populations, as does Russia in the North Caucasus.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries substantial numbers of Muslims immigrated to Western Europe. By 2010 an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%). They are projected to comprise 8% by 2030. They are often the subject of intense discussion and political campaigns. These have been periodically revived by events such as terrorist attacks by Islamists, the cartoons affair in Denmark, debates over Islamic dress, and ongoing support for populist right-wing parties that view Muslims as a threat to European values, culture and ways of life. Such events have also fueled growing debate regarding the topic of Islamophobia, attitudes toward Muslims and the populist right.\n\nThe Muslim population in Europe is extremely diverse with varied histories and origins. Today, the Muslim-majority regions of Europe are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Kosovo, parts of Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as some Russian regions in Northern Caucasus and the Volga region. The communities consist predominantly of indigenous Europeans of the Muslim faith whose religious tradition dates back several hundred years. The transcontinental countries of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan also are Muslim majority.\n\nMuslim forays into Europe began shortly after the religion's inception, with a short-lived invasion of Byzantine Sicily by a small Arab and Berber force that landed in 652. Islam gained its first genuine foothold in continental Europe from 711 onward, with the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The Arabs renamed the land Al-Andalus, which expanded to include the larger parts of what is now Portugal and Spain except for the northern highlands. It is estimated that Al-Andalus had a Muslim majority by the 10th century after most of the local population willingly converted to Islam. This coincided with the \"La Convivencia\" period of the Iberian Peninsula as well as the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. The Christian counter-offensive known as the \"Reconquista\" began in the early 8th century, when Muslim forces managed to temporarily push into southern France. Slowly, the Christian forces began a re-conquest of the fractured Taifa kingdoms of Al-Andalus. There was still a Muslim presence north of Spain, especially in Fraxinet all the way into Switzerland until the 10th century. Muslim forces under the Aghlabids conquered Sicily after a series of expeditions spanning 827–902, and had notably raided Rome in 846. The Emirate of Sicily was established in 965. Arabs held onto southern Italy until their expulsion by the Normans in 1072. By 1236, practically all that remained of Muslim Spain was the southern province of Granada.\n\nThe Arabs imposed Sharia, thus, the Latin- and Greek-speaking Christian communities, as well as a community of Jews, had limited freedom of religion under the Muslims as \"dhimmi\" (non-Muslims). They were required to pay \"jizya\" (poll tax), \"kharaj\" (land tax), but exempt from the Muslim tax of \"zakaat\". These taxes marked their status as subject to Muslim rule, albeit in exchange for protection against foreign and internal aggression.\n\nArabic-speaking Christian scholars saved influential pre-Christian texts and introduced aspects of medieval Islamic culture (including the arts, economics, science and technology). (See Latin translations of the 12th century and Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe for more information).\n\nMuslim rule endured in the Emirate of Granada, from 1238 as a vassal state of the Christian Kingdom of Castile, until the completion of La Reconquista in 1492. The Moriscos (Moorish in Spanish) were finally expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by Philip III during the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nThroughout the 16th to 19th centuries, the Barbary States sent pirates to raid nearby parts of Europe in order to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in the Arab World throughout the Renaissance period. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th centuries, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. These slaves were captured mainly from the crews of captured vessels and from coastal villages in Spain and Portugal, and from farther places like Italy, France or England, the Netherlands, Ireland, the Azores Islands, and even Iceland.\n\nFor a long time, until the early 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. The Crimean Tatars frequently mounted raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland-Lithuania, and Russia to enslave people whom they could capture.\n\nThe Böszörmény Muslims formed an early community of Muslims in Hungary. Their biggest settlement was near the town of present-day Orosháza in the central part of the Hungarian Kingdom. At that time this settlement entirely populated by Muslims was probably one of the biggest settlements of the Kingdom. This and several other Muslim settlements were all destroyed and their inhabitants massacred during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Hungary.\n\nIn the mid-7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam spread into areas that would later become part of Russia. There are accounts of the trade connections between Muslims and the Rus', apparently people from the Baltic region who made their way towards the Black Sea through Central Russia. During his journey to Volga Bulgaria in 921-922, Ibn Fadlan observed the Rus', claiming that some had converted to Islam. \"They are very fond of pork and many of them who have assumed the path of Islam miss it very much.\" The Rus' also relished their \"nabidh\", a fermented drink which Ibn Fadlan often mentioned as part of their daily fare.\nThe Mongols began their conquest of Rus', of Volga Bulgaria, and of the Cuman-Kipchak Confederation (parts of present-day Russia and Ukraine) in the 13th century. After the Mongol empire split, the eastern European section became known as the Golden Horde. Although not originally Muslim, the western Mongols adopted Islam as their religion in the early-14th century under Berke Khan, and later Uzbeg Khan established it as the official religion of the state. Much of the mostly Turkic-speaking population of the Horde, as well as the small Mongol aristocracy, became Islamized (if they were not already Muslim, like the Volga Bulgars) and became known to Russians and Europeans as the Tatars. More than half\nof the European portion of what is now Russia and Ukraine came under the suzerainty of Muslim Tatars and Turks from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The Crimean Khanate became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire in 1475 and subjugated what remained of the Great Horde by 1502. The Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered the Muslim Khanate of Kazan in 1552.\n\nLipka Tatar Muslims of Belarus and Poland-Lithuania. The material of their Mosques is wood.\n\n \n\nThe Ottoman Empire began its expansion into Europe by taking the European portions of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries up until the 1453 capture of Constantinople, establishing Islam as the state religion in the region. The Ottoman Empire continued to stretch northwards, taking Hungary in the 16th century, and reaching as far north as the Podolia in the mid-17th century (Peace of Buczacz), by which time most of the Balkans was under Ottoman control. Ottoman expansion in Europe ended with their defeat in the Great Turkish War. In the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), the Ottoman Empire lost most of its conquests in Central Europe. The Crimean Khanate was later annexed by Russia in 1783. Over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire gradually lost almost all of its European territories, until its collapse in 1922, when the former empire was transformed into the nation of Turkey.\n\nBetween 1354 (when the Ottomans crossed into Europe at Gallipoli) and 1526, the Empire had conquered the territory of present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and Hungary. The Empire laid siege to Vienna in 1683. The intervention of the Polish King broke the siege, and from then afterwards the Ottomans battled the Habsburg Emperors until 1699, when the Treaty of Karlowitz forced them to surrender Hungary and portions of present-day Croatia, Slovenia, and Serbia. From 1699 to 1913, wars and insurrections pushed the Ottoman Empire further back until it reached the current European border of present-day Turkey.\n\nFor most of this period, the Ottoman retreats were accompanied by Muslim refugees from these provinces (in almost all cases converts from the previous subject populations), leaving few Muslim inhabitants in Hungary, Croatia, and the Transylvania region of present-day Romania. Bulgaria remained under Ottoman rule until around 1878, and currently its population includes about 131,000 Muslims (2001 Census) (see Pomaks).\nBosnia was conquered by the Ottomans in 1463, and a large portion of the population converted to Islam in the first 200 years of Ottoman domination. By the time Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia in 1878, the Habsburgs had shed the desire to re-Christianize new provinces. As a result, a sizable Muslim population in Bosnia survived into the 20th century. Albania and the Kosovo area remained under Ottoman rule until 1913. Prior to the Ottoman conquest, the northern Albanians were Roman Catholic and the southern Albanians were Christian Orthodox, but by 1913 the majority were Muslim.\n\nApart from the effect of a lengthy period under Ottoman domination, many of the subject population were converted to Islam as a result of a deliberate move by the Ottomans as part of a policy of ensuring the loyalty of the population against a potential Venetian invasion. However, Islam was spread by force in the areas under the control of the Ottoman Sultan through devşirme and jizya. Rather Arnold explains Islam's spread by quoting 17th-century pro-Muslim author Johannes Scheffler who stated: \n\nIslam piqued interest among European scholars, setting off the movement of Orientalism. The founder of modern Islamic studies in Europe was Ignác Goldziher, who began studying Islam in the late 19th century. For instance, Sir Richard Francis Burton, 19th-century English explorer, scholar, and orientalist, and translator of \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\", disguised himself as a Pashtun and visited both Medina and Mecca during the Hajj, as described in his book \"A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah.\"\n\nIslamic architecture influenced European architecture in various ways (for example, the Türkischer Tempel synagogue in Vienna). During the 12th-century Renaissance in Europe, Latin translations of Arabic texts were introduced. The Koran was also translated (for example, Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete).\n\nMuslim emigration to metropolitan France surged during the Algerian War of Independence. In 1961, the West German Government invited first Gastarbeiters and similar contracts were offered by Switzerland; some of these migrant workers came from majority-Muslim countries such as Turkey. Migrants came to Britain from its majority-Muslim former colonies Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n \nThe exact number of Muslims in Europe is unknown. According to estimates by the Pew Forum, the total number of Muslims in Europe (excluding Turkey) in 2010 was about 44 million (6% of the total population), including 19 million (3.8% of the population) in the European Union.\n\nAs of 2011, Approximately 9 million Turks were living in Europe outside of Turkey. This made Turks the largest immigrant Muslim population in Europe. Estimates of the percentage of Muslims in Russia (the biggest group of Muslims in Europe) vary from 5 to 11.7%, depending on sources. It also depends on if only observant Muslims or all people of Muslim descent are counted.\n\n58.8% of Albania adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are Secular Sunni with a significant Bektashi Shia minority. The percentage is 93.5% in Kosovo, 39.3% in Macedonia (according to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim in Macedonia) and 50.7% in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In transcontinental countries such as Turkey 99%, and 93% in Azerbaijan of the population is Muslim respectively. According to the 2011 census, 20% of the total population in Montenegro are Muslims. In Russia, Moscow is home to an estimated 1.5 million Muslims.\n\nA Pew Research Center study, published in January 2011, forecast an increase of Muslims in European population from 6% in 2010 to 8% in 2030. The study also predicted that Muslim fertility rate in Europe would drop from 2.2 in 2010 to 2.0 in 2030. On the other hand, the non-Muslim fertility rate in Europe would increase from 1.5 in 2010 to 1.6 in 2030. Another Pew study published in 2017 projected that in 2050 Muslims will make 7.4% (if all migration into Europe were to immediately and permanently stop - a “zero migration” scenario) up to 14% (under a “high” migration scenario) of Europe's population. Data from the 2000s for the rates of growth of Islam in Europe showed that the growing number of Muslims was due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates.\n\nIn 2017, Pew projected that the Muslim population of Europe would reach a level between 7% and 14% by 2050. The projections depend on the level of migration. With no net migration, the projected level was 7%; with high migration, it was 14%. The projections varied greatly by country. Under the high migration scenario, the highest projected level of any historically non-Muslim country was 30% in Sweden. By contrast, Poland was projected to remain below 1%.\n\nIn 2006, the conservative Christian historian Philip Jenkins, in an article for the Foreign Policy Research Institute thinktank, wrote that by 2100, a Muslim population of about 25% of Europe's population was \"probable\"; Jenkins stated this figure did not take account growing birthrates amongst Europe's immigrant Christians, but did not give details of his metholodogy. in 2010, Eric Kaufmann, professor of politics at Birkbeck, University of London said that \"In our projections for Western Europe by 2050 we are looking at a range of 10-15 per cent Muslim population for most of the high immigration countries – Germany, France, the UK\"; he argued that Islam was expanding, not because of conversion to Islam, but primarily due to the religion's “pro-natal” orientation, where Muslims tend to have more children. Other analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the claimed Muslim population growth, stating that because many European countries do not ask a person's religion on official forms or in censuses, it has been difficult to obtain accurate estimates, and arguing that there has been a decrease in Muslim fertility rates in Morocco, the Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nA 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections may be overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in \"Foreign Affairs\" whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center in 2018, most Europeans favour restrictions on face-covering veils. An estimated 13 out of 15 favoring a ban of face-covering veils in Western Europe. As opposed to politicians and intellectuals, people perceive Islamic dress to not represent religious symbols but a repressive ideology in the form of islamism which intends to extend its influence into family, society and politics.\n\nA 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB) found that Islamic fundamentalism was widespread among Muslims in Europe. The study conducted a poll among Turkish immgrants to six European countries: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Sweden. In the first four countries also Moroccan immigrants were interviewed. Fundametalism was defined as: the belief that believers should return to the eternal and unchangeable rules laid down in the past; that these rules allow only one interpretation and are binding for all believers; and that religious rules have priority over secular laws. Two thirds of Muslims the majority responded that religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam. Of the respondents, 44% agreed to all three statements. Almost 60% responded that Muslims should return to the roots of Islam, 75% thought there was only one possible interpretation of the Quran.\n\nThe conclusion was that religious fundamentalism is much more prevalent among European Muslims than among Christian natives. Perceived discrimination is a marginal predictor of religious fundamentalism. The difference between countries defies a \"reactive religious fundamentalism\", where fundamentalism is viewed as a reaction against lacking rights and privileges for Muslims. Instead, it was found that Belgium which has comparatively generous policies towards Muslims and immigrants in general also had a relatively high level of fundamentalism. France and Germany which have restricitive policies had lower levels of fundamentalism.\n\nIn 2017, the EU Counter-terrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove stated in an interview that there were more than radicals and jihadists in Europe. In 2016, French authorities stated that of the individuals on the list of security threats belong to islamist movements. In the United Kingdom, authorities estimate that jihadists reside in the country, of which about 3000 are actively monitored. In 2017, German authorities estimated that there were more than militant salafists in the country.\n\nThe European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia reports that the Muslim population tends to suffer Islamophobia all over Europe, although the perceptions and views of Muslims may vary.\n\nIn 2005 according to the \"Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau\" annual report, half the Dutch population and half the Moroccan and Turkish minorities stated that the Western lifestyle cannot be reconciled with that of Muslims.\n\nA 2015 poll by the Polish Centre for Public Opinion Research found that 44% of Poles have a negative attitude towards Muslims, with only 23% having a positive attitude towards them. Furthermore, a majority agreed with statements like \"Muslims are intolerant of customs and values other than their own.\" (64% agreed, 12% disagreed), \"Muslims living in Western European countries generally do not acquire customs and values that are characteristic for the majority of the population of that country.\" (63% agreed, 14% disagreed), \"Islam encourages violence more than other religions.\" (51% agreed, 24% disagreed).\n\nA February 2017 poll of 10 000 people in 10 Eurpean countries by Chatham House found on average a majority were opposed to further Muslim immigration, with opposition especially pronounced in Austria, Poland, Hungary, France and Belgium. Of the respondents, 55% were opposed, 20% offered no opinion and 25% were in favour of further immigration from Muslim-majority countries. The authors of the study add that these countries, except Poland, had in the preceding years suffered jihadist terror attacks or been at the centre of a refugee crisis. They also mention that in most of the polled countries the radical right has political influence.\n\nAccording to a study in 2018 by Leipzig University, 56% of Germans sometimes thought the many Muslims made them feel like strangers in their own country, up from 43% in 2014. In 2018, 44% thought immigration by Muslims should be banned, up from 37% in 2014.\n\nAccording to a WZB report investigating Muslims in Germany, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland, Muslims in Europe generally have higher levels of unemployment which is to a great part caused by the lack of language skills, the lack of inter-ethnic social ties and a traditional view of gender roles where women are not to work outside the home. Discrimination from employers caused a small part of the unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born near the present-day town of Cleveland, Tennessee. His Cherokee name was \"Unaduti\". As a young man, he was ordained a Baptist minister. \n\nA member of the John Ross faction of the Cherokee, he was dispatched by Ross in 1837 on a mission to the Seminole. Although Bushyhead opposed the federal policy forcing Indian Removal to west of the Mississippi River, he accepted the inevitable and led a party of about 1,000 people on the Trail of Tears. On his arrival in 1839 near present-day Westville, Oklahoma, he established the Baptist Mission. This marked the end of the Cherokee Trail of Tears. He became chief justice of the Cherokee nation in 1840 and remained in that office until his death. His eldest son, Dennis Bushyhead, held several offices in the Cherokee Nation, including as Principal Chief. He served from 1879 to 1887.\n\nJesse Bushyhead was born in September 1804 to a half-blood Cherokee woman named Nancy Foreman in a Cherokee settlement near the present city of Cleveland, Tennessee. His father was also of mixed-race Cherokee ancestry. He was educated at Candy's Creek Mission, and taught at several schools for boys in the Candy's Creek area.\n\nBushyhead was baptized as a Christian and became an avid member of the Baptist church in 1830. He began converting other Cherokee to Christianity, established a church at Amohee in Tennessee (then his home town), and became a close associate of noted Baptist missionary, Reverend Evan Jones. Jones preached in English, while Bushyhead translated the sermon into Cherokee. One writer claimed that Bushyhead was, \"... the best interpreter in the nation.\" \n\nIn 1832, Reverend Jones recommended to the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions that Bushyhead be appointed as an assistant missionary. The appointment was made, and Bushyhead served in this role for the next eleven years. He is said to have been the first Cherokee to have been ordained as a Baptist minister. He continued to work closely with Jones, not only preaching to the Cherokees, but translating the Book of Genesis and other religious books into the Cherokee language, using the Cherokee Syllabary. He also served as pastor of the Amohee church.\n\nJesse Bushyhead married twice. He had two children with his first wife, whose name is apparently unknown. His second wife was Eliza Wilkerson or Wilkinson, who bore nine children. His oldest son, Dennis Bushyhead, was notable for serving as Principal Chief for two terms, from 1879 to 1887. His home in Cleveland is now occupied by Cleveland High School.\n\nJesse Bushyhead had opposed removal of the Cherokees from their homeland in the Southeast. As the deadline approached when General Winfield Scott and the U.S. Army would escort the people to a new homeland in the Indian Territory, Rev. Bushyhead volunteered to lead one of the groups of emigres. The group who followed him was from a part of the nation where there was no capable leader.\n\nThe group led by Bushyhead followed the same northern route taken by the group led by Evan Jones. The route led them north through Tennessee and Kentucky to an Ohio River crossing at Golconda, Illinois, then west to cross the Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. After that, they turned southwest to Indian Territory. At the start of the trek, the group numbered 950 people. During the journey, the group experienced 38 deaths and 6 births, so that 898 arrived safely at their destination on February 23, 1838.\n\nThe trek terminated at a place Bushyhead called Pleasant Hill, about north of the present day town of Westville, Oklahoma and about from Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Cherokees called the place \"Breadtown\" because food rations were distributed there. Later, they named the place \"Baptist Mission.\"\n\nJesse Bushyhead died on July 17, 1844 after a brief, but unspecified illness. He was buried at the old Baptist Mission cemetery near Westville\n\nJesse Bushyhead's grave at the Baptist Mission Cemetery is marked by a marble monument. His grave is the only surviving property associated with his life, and as such is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOne side of the monument reads: \"Sacred to the memory of Rev. Jesse Bushyhead, born in the old Cherokee Nation in East Tennessee, September, 1804; died in the present Cherokee Nation, July 17, 1844. 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'\" An inscription in Cherokee is at the bottom.\n\nThe other side of the monument bears the following inscription:\n\"Rev. Jesse Bushyhead was a man noble in person and noble in heart. His choice was to be a true and faithful minister of his Lord and Master rather than any high and worldly position. He loved his country and people, serving them from time to time in many important offices and missions. He united with the Baptist Church in his early manhood and died as he had lived, a devoted Christian.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "7648689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7648689", "title": "Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)", "text": "Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)\n\nLac Ste. Anne is a large lake in central Alberta, Canada. It is located in Lac Ste. Anne County, along Highway 43, 75 km west of Edmonton.\n\nThe lake has a total area of 54.5 km, a maximum depth of 9 m, and an average depth of 4.8 m. Lac Ste. Anne lies at an elevation of 730 m, and has a drainage area of 619 km. The eutrophic lake is formed along the Sturgeon River through which it drains into the North Saskatchewan River. Two islands are found at the western end of the lake, \"Farming Island\" and \"Horse Island\", while the small \"Castle Island\" and tiny \"Rock Island\" lie at the eastern tip of the lake.\n\nAlong the southern area coal mines generate power and employment, and recreational businesses have flourished because of the lakes. Agriculture is still a mainstay and the area is known for some of the best oat crops in Canada.\n\nLac Ste. Anne was first called \"Wakamne\", or God's Lake by the Nakota Sioux, and \"Manitou Sakhahigan\" (Lake of the Spirit) by the Cree first nations before the arrival of the settlers.\n\nThe legend goes that the Indians hunted buffalo and fished in the lake called Manitou Sakhahigan. The legend told of a large monster that lived in the lake, and as it moved it would create dangerous and unpredictable currents, which could easily capsize a canoe. Very few people saw the monster but when the Hudson's Bay Company came they renamed the lake Devil's Lake possibly in reference to the reported lake monster.\n\nElders of Alexis Reserve remember their grandparents telling of how as children they would go out on the lake and peer down through the then clear water to the lake bottom in search of the monster. They would hope and fear that they might actually see its legendary form.\n\nThe village of Lac Ste. Anne is one of the first permanent settlements in Alberta and the first permanent Catholic mission.\nLac Ste. Anne (then called Devil's Lake or Manito-Sakahigan) was visited by Father Jean-Baptiste Thibault in 1842. Two year later in 1844 he established the Mission of Lac Ste. Anne to serve 30 French Métis families, who had settled there in the 1830s, and the native population of the area. He also renamed the lake \"Lac Ste. Anne\", honouring Saint Anne. Lac Ste. Anne was in a central location with good fertile fields, tall trees for lumber, and plenty of fish and wildlife. It was also far enough away from the Hudson's Bay Company politics in Fort Edmonton.\n\nThe missionaries began the teachings of the Church, and also taught the people how to farm. They had predicted the demise of the buffalo and strove to make the Métis people self-sufficient. By 1859 the mission boasted 17 fat and fine cows, 15 horses, 10 dogs, 10 cats, and a garden with flowerbeds. Pigs and sheep were not raised because of the dogs and wild predators. Crops included wheat, barley, potatoes, cabbage, onions, and turnips.\n\nIn 1859 three Grey Nuns made the journey from Montreal to the Mission. They were the third, fourth and fifth white women to travel to Alberta. On September 24 Lac Ste. Anne welcomed these brave women with enough mud to bog down their wagon at the entrance to the Mission. The Sisters began their lives here by learning the Cree language, starting a school, helping in the gardens and painting the windows of the church so that worshippers would not be distracted during services.\n\nThe Mission grew until there were over two thousand people. A Hudson's Bay Company post, a separate school, an orphanage retreat, a North-West Mounted Police barracks, a dance hall, a post office, several stores, saloons and hotels moved into the area complimenting the church, rectory and convent.\n\nAt one time the mission was larger in population and commerce than Fort Edmonton.\n\nFather Lacombe, who arrived in 1852, was a priest with vision and a great deal of common sense. In 1861 he decided for many sound reasons to build a new mission at St. Albert. When he left the mission of Lac Ste. Anne was almost deserted by pastors and flock. All that was left were a few homes, the church, the rectory and the Grey Nun's residence.\n\nFather Lestanc organised the first pilgrimage to Lac Ste. Anne in 1889 in honour of Saint Anne whose feast day is on July 26. In 1926 over 5,500 pilgrims attended. Many came by a special train from the city of Edmonton 45 miles away. Today pilgrims come to the lake from all over North America, many walking miles bare-footed as penance to witness or be a part of the miracle of healing. A display of crutches and canes have been left behind in the shrine by pilgrims.\nThirty to forty thousand people now attend the annual pilgrimage in the last week of July. Oaths of sobriety, along with other life style promises are made, and prayers and forgiveness are given.\n\nThe \"Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage\" was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 2004 for its social and cultural importance.\n\nSeveral miles east, Lac Ste. Anne was the hostess of more history. In 1912 the Alberta Northern Rail built the railroad to what is now Alberta Beach, it brought its employees out for company picnics and holidays. By 1920 they had incorporated the area as a summer village, built a dance pavilion, a large wooden pier, and several cabins. Other companies such as Marshall Wells and Woodwards then began to bring their employees out for the same relaxing and beautiful atmosphere.\n\nThere was such a demand for this atmosphere that the Moonlight express was started. A.N.R. picked people up in Edmonton on Saturday mornings, took them to Alberta Beach., then picked them up Sunday night to take them back to Edmonton.\n\nSoon people began purchasing and building their own cabins and small businesses. On January 1, 1999, the Summer Village of Alberta Beach became a village. It now has 884 year-round residents and can swell to over 3,000 people during long weekends. A hotel and many small businesses operate within the village. Alberta Beach has developed in many ways while still preserving the reason for its popularity. The tranquility and beauty of the lake still draw admiration and provides relaxation to those who come to enjoy the area.\n\nIn the 1900s the Hamlet of Gunn (named after Peter Gunn) was also developing as a major trade center, consisting mainly of Métis and Indian people. There were two flour mills, a blacksmith shop, the hotel, several stores and trading posts that nestled beside the train station. In the 1930s an Army training center was built where the Gunn housing center now operates. Prosperity reigned until the Army left and the C.N.R. removed its rail station. With it, many of the residents and businesses also left.\n\nToday all that remains is a combination store, laundromat, restaurant, car wash and a Post Office, Community hall and University observation and research station, as well as the Gunn Housing and Senior's Center.\n\nA French Viscount by the name of Charles de Caze, In the 1890s began building a castle on the small island located on the northeast shores of Lac Ste. Anne, which he named Constance Island, in honor of his only daughter. The castle was to be four stories high, built of stone. The walls were to be three feet thick crowning it was to be a stone battlement running all the way around.\n\nThe castle was to be his retirement home but unfortunately he died at the age of 44 and did not complete his project. For many years, only the two stories of his dream castle remained to pique the curiosity of people stopping to picnic and enjoy the panoramic view of the lake.\n\nApproximately twenty years later a Mr. Shorty purchased the Island. He demolished the castle and transported several cabins to Constance Island. During prohibition it was an excellent spot for parties and fun. Years later he built a causeway which provided better access to the island. Eventually the Island was sold, renamed Castle Island, subdivided, and incorporated into a summer village.\n\nA rail station in 1912 also created the community of Darwell, located between Lac Ste. Anne and Isle Lake. The naming of this station caused many debates with no resolution, until an enterprising man took out his hymnbook and randomly picked a good tune. The tune had the name Darwell in it.\n\nIt also became known throughout Alberta as Hobo stop because of a ranch which never turned away anyone asking for shelter. Many a man out of work rode the rail to Darwell to get food and lodging in exchange for work. As the story goes many a man wanted by the law also found refuge and the North-West Mounted Police spent many a trip going to the Hobo Ranch.\n\nToday Darwell boasts a store, garage, and school. The old ranch has long disappeared, but the hospitality of this community still exists today.\n\nThe Alexis Indian Reserve of the Alexis Nakoda Nation is located on the northern shore of the lake, and Alberta Beach is located on the southeastern shore. The Summer Villages of Ross Haven and Yellowstone, along with the subdivision of Corsair Cove, and the unincorporated hamlet of Gunn lie along the northern shore. The Summer Villages of Castle Island, Sunset Point and Val Quentin lie to either side of Alberta Beach. The Summer Village of West Cove lies on the southern shore of the west basin.\n\nTwo campgrounds are located around the lake, one at Alberta Beach and the other at Gunn, on the north-eastern shore. There are also two golf courses in the immediate area, one at Alberta Beach, and the other in Ross Haven. There are two Bible Camps with lakefront property on Lac Ste. Anne, Ross Haven Bible Camp, located in Ross Haven, and run by the Canadian Sunday School Mission, and Sunset Point Christian Camp, in Sunset Point, and run by the Alberta Pentecostal Missions Society.\n\nFishing is a popular recreational activity, species including whitefish, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.\n\nWater based sports include sailing, water skiing and windsurfing in summer and snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in winter.\n\n"}

Immediately after the blessing the priest goes to the Gospel side of the altar. \n\nHe begins with the \"Dominus vobiscum\" as at the Proclamation of the Gospel during Mass; however, since he reads from an altar card, he makes a Sign of the Cross with his right thumb on the altar's surface instead of the Gospel text, before signing his own forehead, lips, and chest. At the words \"Et Verbum caro factum est\" (\"And the Word became flesh\"), the priest (and, if present, the congregation) genuflects.\n\nThe text of John's Gospel is perhaps best known for , \"\"In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum\",\" which in most English translations has been rendered as \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"\n\nThe third Mass of Christmas Day, where this same Gospel is read as the Gospel of the Mass, has no Last Gospel; before 1954, the Gospel for the Feast of the Epiphany would be read here.

A new, completely updated and original translation was published in 2013.\n\nThe work consists of five chapters; \"The Person and the Sexual Urge\"; \"The Person and Love\"; \"The Person and Chastity\"; \"Justice to the Creator\"; and \"Sexology and Ethics\".\nIt is described as 'a defence of the traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint'. In his introduction to the first edition, Fr. Wojtyla describes his reasons for writing the book as being \"born principally of the need to put the norms of Catholic sexual morality on a firm basis, a basis as definitive as possible, relying on the most elementary and incontrovertible moral truths and the most fundamental values or goods\". Fr. Wojtyła was originally inspired to write the book while being a professor at the Catholic University of Lublin, through the experiences he had in teaching young Catholics.\n\nWhile at the university, Fr. Wojtyła gathered a group of about 20 young people, who began to call themselves \"‘Rodzinka’\", the \"little family\". They met for prayers, philosophical discussions, and helping the blind and sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200 participants, and their activities expanded to include annual skiing and kayaking trips. The insight he gained from these meetings and discussions helped him develop the raw material for the text.\n\nFr. Wojtyła writes that marital sexual intercourse is the best image of God who is love, for he sees the human body as the only one capable of making the invisible — the spiritual and the divine — visible. He says that human beings were created by God for a purpose: to be persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between husband and wife is a symbol of their total mutual self-donation, and further fosters, strengthens and enriches it not just for the present but also for the future. For Fr. Wojtyła, \"The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and divine.\"\n"}
{"id": "1761514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1761514", "title": "Magic sword", "text": "Magic sword\n\nA magic sword is any mythological or fictional sword imbued with magical power to increase it's strength or grant it other supernatural qualities. The archetype originated in myth and legend, and occurs regularly in fantasy fiction.\n\nRenowned swords appear in the folklore of every nation that used swords. Sometimes the sword is ascribed no powers of its own. It is famous because it is the hero's sword, or because of its origin, as when a god gives it to the hero. Other swords keep their wielders safe or destroy their enemies.\n\nA more localized motif is the sword that has been broken and must be reforged, commonly found in Northern Europe. Such a sword symbolizes the initial defeat and loss of honor of its wielder. Subsequent victory and the restoration of honor is achieved by reforging it, either at the wielder's hand or that of his heir.\n\nIt is probable that the roots of the sentient weapon myths stem from ancient peoples belief that sword making and metallurgy was in fact a magical process. Through the fires of the forge (\"fire was also given spiritual connotations\") a lump of earth was transformed into a shiny usable object that could be hammered into many shapes. Extending further from the transformation of ore into metal, the difficulty of actually obtaining a quality blade; which took intense concentration and skill added to its esoteric qualities. While any blacksmith could manufacture a knife or an axehead only a swordsmith could create a high quality sword. The secrets of doing so were jealously guarded as well as formulas for alloys.\n\nThe skill necessary to forge a balanced blade - one which is not too brittle or too soft and able to hold a usefully sharp edge - in the age before automated machines, blast furnaces, and the knowledge of molecular chemistry made the creation of a sword seem almost miraculous. A few degrees too hot or too cold within a very limited temperature range, which could only be discerned by the glowing hue of a hot billet, could make or break a sword. A lack of expertise in knowing when and how to apply carbon and flux and quench the blade could ruin weeks of work. Thus the swordsmith almost felt like he was one with his work, giving the process his complete devotion of concentration and thought. This led to the belief that he was actually imbuing the blade with an essence of his spirit. In Japan, the swordsmiths were so concerned with this belief that they would undergo purification rituals and meditation before even attempting to start a new blade, for fear that they might inadvertently create an evil sword.\n\nThe Vikings prized their swords above all other things, handing them down from generation to generation and giving them names. The value of the blade was not only determined by its quality but also by how many battles that it was used in. Polynesian people such as the Māori also had comparable reverence for their weapons. They believed a weapon contained a spiritual force called \"mana\" and that the weapon held the spirits of its maker, its line of owners and also stole the spirits of those it killed. These weapons where highly prized for their \"mana\" and cherished as heirlooms. The Samurai of Japan believed that their swords had their own soul that could possess them. It was not the wielder but their swords that desired to kill; Samurai were just the instrument that the sword used to complete that task. Since most of them were Buddhists (a religion that finds violence and murder abhorent), that train of thought gave them some peace of mind in their killing vocation.\n\nLater, as the concept of demons, spiritual possession, and elementals entered the realm of mythological themes, it was only a natural leap to attribute magical properties of the swords of folklore to indwelling spirits.\n\nMagic swords may exhibit various degrees of sentience, from being merely influenced by the wielder to being able to think for itself or even control its owner.\n\nThe Bible relates in the Book of Genesis how God, seeking to deter Adam and Eve from returning to the Garden of Eden, \"placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way\". By some accounts, the Cherubim are replaced with the Archangel Michael, who wields a similar weapon.\nKing David was given the sword of the slain giant Goliath by the priest Ahimelech, to which was attached extra-biblical mythology and traditions.\nIn the Book of Revelation, Jesus is symbolically described wielding a double-edged sword that proceeds out from his mouth, in reference to the \"sword of the spirit\" which is the \"word of truth\".\n\nIn the legend of King Arthur, the king himself is related to two magical swords, in most variants. The first is the Sword In the Stone. Only Arthur could draw it out, thereby proving that he is the rightful king. In some tales, this is his only sword. In most variants, this sword was then broken, and he receives from The Lady of the Lake a new sword called Excalibur, arguably the most famous of magic swords. However, in other variants Excalibur itself is the sword in the stone. It is not clear from the various accounts of the Arthur legend whether Excalibur itself was possessed of magical powers or merely had a magical origin, though its scabbard protected its bearer from physical harm. Many interpretations of the legend appear to endow Excalibur with a cutting strength and durability beyond that of ordinary weapons.\n\nIn Wolfram Von Echenbach's Parzival, the eponymous hero is given a sword by the Grail king, Anfortas. Parzival's cousin explains that \"“The sword will withstand the first blow unscathed; at the second it will shatter. If you then take it back to the spring, it will become whole again from the flow of the water. You must have the water at the source…If the pieces are not lost and you fit them together properly, as soon as the spring water wets them, the sword will become whole again, the joinings and edges stronger than before.”\n\nAncient Chinese mythology relates the tale of Lü Dongbin, who \"slew dragons\" with a magic sword and performed \"freak feats\" with it.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the god Frey \"possessed a magic sword that struck out at Jotuns of its own accord\". Many other swords appear in Norse legend in the hands of heroes.\n\nTyrfing appears in the \"Hervarar Saga\". Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki, and a grandson of the god Odin. He caught the dwarves, Dvalin and Durin, and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke, would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes. The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was used and that it would be the cause of three great evils. They also cursed it so that it would kill Svafrlami himself. It would cost the life of not only Svafrlami, but also the life of the Swedish hero Hjalmar.\n\nA similar sword to Tyrfing is Dáinsleif, a sword from the legend of the eternal battle Hjaðningavíg, made by the dwarf Dáin. Like Tyrfing, Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and could not be unsheathed without killing a man. There is also Mistilteinn, a sword from the \"Hrómundar saga Gripssonar\", which could never go blunt and which Hrómund won from the undead witch-king Þrainn. Like Tyrfing, it was taken from a barrow-wight.\n\nThe various iterations of the story of the Völsungs include several magic swords. The first magical sword which enters the story is Gram (=\"wrath\"), stuck by Odin into the tree Barnstokkr in the hall of the Völsungs. Only Sigmund could pull it out. This caused considerable envy and conflict. Eventually, Sigmund fought Odin disguised as an old man, and Odin shattered the sword. Sigmund left it for his son Sigurd, who reforged it to kill Fafnir. In the Nibelungenlied, Sîfrit (the Middle High German version of \"Siegfried,\" the equivalent to Norse Sigurd) discarded Gram in exchange for another magic sword, Balmung (= \"destruction\"). Wagner's version of the story calls the sword Nothung (\"child of necessity/distress\"), rather than Balmung.\n\nThe legendary smith Wayland Smith forged the magic sword Mimung, which appears both in the Anglo-Saxon poem Waldere and in the German/Scandinavian \"Þiðrekssaga\".\n\nBeowulf wielded the sword Hrunting that was according to the poem annealed in venom. The sword was useless against Grendel's Mother. In desperation Beowulf grabbed a giant sword of great age and with it took off the head of the she monster.\n\nIn Japanese mythology, there is a magical sword called Kusanagi, which was one of the three crown jewels given to the Emperor Jimmu by the goddess Amaterasu. Additionally, the katana forged by Masamune and Muramasa were reputedly of such high quality as to be near-magical. In the case of the Masamune and Muramasa blades, it was believed that some element of the smith's personality was imputed into the blade. These three swords have been used extensively in popular culture since then, especially in the realm of video game RPGs. Despite legends about Nihontō, those three are the most famous. Excellent japanese swords often received nicknames reflecting their cutting prowess. Also, unlike other magical swords, they exist (or still exist). There is, for example, 10 or 11 blades attributed to Masamune who still exist today, such as Kanze Masamune, Kotegiri Masamune or Musashi Masamune.\n\nMore pragmatical, Spanish legends talk too about magical swords. Two belonged to the warrior Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, \"El Cid\", both with magical powers according to the medieval epical poem \"Cantar del mio Cid\". The First \"Tizona\" has personality of its own, with variable strength according to the man who used it, and even his sight was powerful, as it is stated in the \"Cantar del mio Cid\":\n\n\"Él dexó la lança, e mano al espada metió; (He left aside the spear, and took the sword)\ncuando lo vio Ferrán Gonçález, conuvo [reconoció] a Tizón, (When Ferrán González saw it, he recognized Tizón) \nantes qu'el colpe esperasse dixo: —¡Vençudo só!— (And before the first strike, he said: I am lost)\nCantar de mio Cid, versos 3642–3645. Edición de Montaner Frutos (2011:213-214).\"\n\nThe same is the case for \"Colada\" which was powerful only in the hands of a brave warrior.\n\nIn the Matter of France, Roland possessed an indestructible sword, Durendal, which he threw into a poisoned stream to prevent its capture. Durendal was one of a set of three swords supposedly forged by Wayland and provided as ransom for a Norse captive, the other two being variously Bishop Turpin's sword Almace, Charlemagne's Joyeuse, or Ogier's sword Curtana.\n\nIn the English or Scottish medieval epic poem Greysteil, the hero uses a magic sword 'Egeking' which was made in the Far East.\n\nEdmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" features a golden sword called Chrysaor, the personal weapon of Sir Artegal, the Knight of Justice. The sword was given to him by Astræa, who had been holding it since the days when Zeus had used it to battle the Titans. Because it was \"Tempred \"[ sic ]\" with Adamant\", it was described as being able to cleave through anything.\n\nIn \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", Richard Wagner drew on the legends of Grimm for the sword Nothung, belonging to the hero Siegmund and later reforged by his son Siegfried and used by him to kill Fafner. It is finally used by Siegfried to shatter the spear of his grandfather, the God Wotan, thus ending his power.\n\nThe hero of Lewis Carroll's poem \"Jabberwocky\" slays the Jabberwock with a vorpal sword. Although the poem does not define the word \"vorpal\" (and contains many nonsensical words with no meaning), the term has been adopted in role playing games to describe a sword which possesses a magical ability to decapitate those against whom it is wielded. \nIn the works of J. R. R. Tolkien such as \"The Lord of the Rings\", many magical swords, usually with powers for good, are wielded by important characters. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring in his battle with the Balrog, who wields its own sword of flame. Glamdring's sister blade, Orcrist, is buried with Thorin Oakenshield under the Lonely Mountain in \"The Hobbit\". Bilbo, Frodo and Samwise carry the sword Sting. It and Glamdring both glow blue when orcs are near. Aragorn bears the sword Andúril, a potent weapon against the evil of Mordor and a symbol of his right to rule. Turin Turambar, the main character of The Children of H%C3%BArin, wields the sword Gurthang. He eventually kills himself using the sword, which speaks to him before he dies, telling him it will kill him. This story is based on the Finnish hero Kullervo, whose sword also agreed to kill him. In addition, in \"Farmer Giles of Ham\", the protagonist is given and wields a magic sword named Caudimordax which, in the story, is translated to mean \"Tailbiter\".\n\nHal Foster's Prince Valiant wields the Singing Sword, which makes its bearer undefeatable if he fights for a good cause.\n\nIn Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Darksword series the Darksword is a sword capable of absorbing magic.\n\nMichael Moorcock created a sinister magic sword in \"Stormbringer\", wielded by Elric of Melniboné. This black sword has the power to suck out the souls of its victims and transfer their energy to its holder. It also appears to have a mind of its own, sometimes striking against its \"master's\" will. Mercedes Lackey's creation, the sword Need is similarly independent, although along less sinister lines.\n\nThe Twelve Swords of Power are the primary plot device in Fred Saberhagen's \"Books of the Swords\".\n\nLawrence Watt-Evans's \"The Misenchanted Sword\" (1985) involves the difficulties of dealing with the sword of the title; the protagonist must kill a man when he draws it, can only kill one, will die if he ever kills a hundred men with it – and will not die without killing them, but will ceaselessly age.\n\nThe Blue Sword contains a blue sword, known as Gonturan, that is both a symbol of power (as it can only be used by a damalur-sol, a woman hero), an amplifier of magic and a very sharp sword. It is also a sword with a mind of its own.\n\nIn Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\" is the sword \"Callandor\", which is actually not a sword, but a powerful Sa'angreal shaped as a sword and made out of crystal. It is kept within the Stone of Tear. It can only be taken by the Dragon and is a major sign of his return. Until he takes it the Stone of Tear will never fall to any invaders, but when the sword is taken the Stone is said to fall to the \"People of the Dragon\". It is later revealed that unlike other Sa'angreals it does not have the safety mechanism that prevents a wielder from absorbing too much of the One Power through it.\n\nTerry Goodkind's series is named for its magical weapon, the Sword of Truth. This blade, with the word \"Truth\" inlaid into the handle, factors into many of the moral decisions made by Richard Rahl, the series' protagonist. The blade, like most magic in the series, is focused on need. The sword's master is referred to as the Seeker of Truth. The Seeker gains the swordmastery of all those that have wielded the blade previously. Many false Seekers have carried the sword, but a true Seeker can only be named by the First Wizard (Rahl is named by his grandfather, Zeddicus Zorander). A true Seeker has the ability to turn the blade white when he kills in compassion and forgiveness. Richard has done this twice. Once, killing the Mord-Sith which captured him in Wizard's First Rule, and again to kill a Sister of the Dark in Stone of Tears.\n\nThe eponymous sword from \"The Sword of Shannara\" series, by Terry Brooks, has a distinctive pommel in the form of the druidic symbol from the series: a hand holding aloft a torch (similar to the Statue of Liberty). Otherwise it is visually unremarkable, though very well made and unworn. Its ability lies in revealing absolute truth, which can be difficult to bear. The sentiment of the enchantment follows that of the \"To thine own self be true...\" advice to Laertes. A prospective wielder, upon drawing the blade for the first time, is made to confront all their personal flaws, shortcomings, fears, delusions and morally questionable acts. If the being's psyche cannot deal with the revelations, they might not be permanently harmed, but the blade is unusable to them. However, if they can accept the truth of themselves, though it is still a jarring experience, they come out of it wiser for the self-knowledge. Also, they are able to wield the Sword as both a particularly strong and sharp weapon, and as a harsh mirror of Truth to those touched by the blade. This exposure to reality, like many years of counseling condensed into a moment, can actually destroy anyone \"evil\" enough, e.g. the Warlock Lord of the same book. It also can reveal illusions and give some protection from magical effects.\n\nAlso of note is the Sword Nightblood from the book \"Warbreaker\". Nightblood is a sentient sword which was given a direction when awakened. This direction was to 'destroy evil.' However, being a sword, Nightblood could not judge right and wrong and killed almost indiscriminately. Simply undoing the clasp (which was extraordinarily tempting for one without a pure heart) was enough for nightblood to utterly destroy the one holding it. Nightblood was often recovered by Vasher sticking clean through a man, not even unsheathed. Nightblood, when fully drawn consumed Its user's BioChromatic breaths at an alarming rate, while sending tendrils of darkness out to destroy anything the sword deemed 'evil.' The sword could also telepathically communicate with its wielder, often asking questions such as \"Hello, would you like to kill someone today?\" or alternatively asking to be unsheathed.\n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series of novels by J.K. Rowling features the Sword of Gryffindor, which is used by several of the book's prominent characters. The sword is an indestructible weapon crafted from goblin metal, the properties of which allow the sword to absorb any substance into itself that will make it stronger, in the case of the books, the immensely deadly venom of a basilisk.\n\nIn series: The Dancing Gods, by Jack L. Chalker, the protagonist, the barbarian Joe, is given \"The last unnamed magical sword in Husaquahr\". In order for the sword to bond with Joe, he has to give it a name, preferably something heroic. However Joe names the sword \"Irving\" after his son. In response to the exclamations concerning his choice of name, he states \"...but I like the name Irving\". Once bonded, the sword will fight for no other user, and will return to Joe if he calls it.\n\nMovies and Television across varying genres depict swords with magical qualities. \n\n\n\nVideo games and fantasy role-playing games feature a great variety of magical armaments, most commonly represented by swords and similar archetypal weapons. These swords are rarely unique, and in many role-playing scenarios, magical weapons are so ubiquitous that the player characters are expected to come into possession of them as a matter of course.\n\n\n"}

His first appearance is on the band's 2016 album, \"California\".\n\nSkiba has also recorded and performed solo and with his side-projects, Heavens and the Hell. In 2012, he released a solo album, \"Babylon\", with his backing band the Sekrets. A second album, \"Kuts\", was released on June 1, 2015.\n\nMatt Skiba was born in Chicago and moved to nearby McHenry at the age of three. He began playing piano and drums at an early age. His first concert was Public Image Ltd. In 1996, while working as a bike messenger, he decided to switch from drums to guitar. Prior to that he played in bands including Blunt, Jerkwater, and the Traitors.\n\nHis mother Joan Skiba is a fourth and fifth grade teacher at Woods Creek Elementary School in Crystal Lake, Illinois. His father Thomas Skiba is an oral surgeon in Crystal Lake. He has two younger twin sisters.\n\nSkiba studied design at Chicago's Columbia College but left in 1996 to form Alkaline Trio with drummer Glenn Porter and bassist Rob Doran.\n\nAfter the group recorded their demo and the single \"Sundials\", they recorded the \"For Your Lungs Only\" EP, during which Doran left the group. Dan Andriano joined and played bass on the EP. The band released their debut full-length \"Goddamnit\" on Asian Man Records in 1998, followed by \"Maybe I'll Catch Fire\" and the compilation \"Alkaline Trio\" in 2000.\n\nThe group's lineup changed again in 2000 when Porter left and former Smoking Popes drummer Mike Felumlee joined. \"From Here to Infirmary\", released by Vagrant Records in the spring of 2001. In 2002 Jade Tree Records released a Hot Water Music/Alkaline Trio split EP which was well received. Both bands contributed original tracks and covers of each other's songs. \"Good Mourning\" followed in 2003, marking the band's first album with drummer Derek Grant, formerly of Suicide Machines and Thoughts of Ionesco. While recording \"Good Mourning\", Skiba had a problem with acid reflux because of his diet, lack of vocal warm-up and his earlier troubles with alcohol and drugs.\n\nFollowing a tour and throat surgery for Skiba, the band recorded and released \"Crimson\" in 2005 and the compilation \"Remains\" in 2007. \"Agony & Irony\", their first record on Epic Records, was released in July 2008. In January 2010 they released \"This Addiction\" on their own Heart & Skull label in partnership with Epitaph Records. In July 2011, they released a semi-acoustic LP called \"Damnesia\" to commemorate 15 years as a band.

Following a five-year hiatus from the studio, the band released their ninth album, \"Is This Thing Cursed?\", on August 31, 2018.\n\nFollowing the departure of Tom DeLonge from Blink-182 in 2015, Mark Hoppus announced that Skiba would \"fill in\" for the band and performed two club shows and a slot at the Musink festival in March 2015. Later that year, the band confirmed that Skiba was now an official member. He then appeared on the Blink-182 album \"California,\" released July 1, 2016.\n\nIn 2001 he began his first full solo tour with The Plea for Peace Tour, consisting mostly of acoustic versions of Alkaline Trio songs with backing drums and bass in a few shows.\n\nHis first solo release came in 2002 in the form of a split with Kevin Seconds of 7 Seconds fame. The songs were mostly acoustic with drums, bass, and piano played by Skiba. Alkaline Trio still occasionally performs the song \"Good Fucking Bye\".\n\nIn 2005 Skiba contributed the song \"Demons Away\" to the Fat Wreck Chords' compilation \"\".\n\nIn 2006 Skiba launched the band Heavens with F-Minus bassist Josiah Steinbrick. The group released \"Patent Pending\" on September 12, 2006.\n\nAlso in 2006 Skiba contributed to the track \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" featured on \"\", a tribute album released on Go-Kart Records.\n\nIn May 2007 Skiba performed five shows with Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music.\n\nIn late December 2008 Steinbrick announced on Heavens' MySpace page, \"This is no longer a Heavens page. Sorry, that's just the way it's going down. Matt will still be doing Trio stuff and last I heard he might be working on a wonderful solo record. I'm not really positive actually but I'm sure it will be great.\" A falling out between Skiba and Steinbrick led to the breakup.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, at Debonair Social Club in Chicago, IL, Skiba, Grant and Greg Corner and Jonny Radtke of Kill Hannah debuted the supergroup cover band Them Crooked Vulvas (and occasionally played under the name A Perfect Circus).\n\nOn August 10, 2010, he released a solo album titled \"Demos\" on Asian Man Records. The album is said to be a precursor to a future Alkaline Trio album .\n\nIn January 2012, Skiba released an EP along with former Angels and Airwaves and The Offspring drummer Atom Willard under the moniker The Hell. The Hell's debut EP is entitled \"Sauve Les Requins\".\n\nSkiba's second full-length solo album, \"Babylon\", was released on May 8, 2012. The album features Skiba leading a band called Matt Skiba and the Sekrets, the backing band includes AFI bassist Hunter Burgan, and former touring drummer for My Chemical Romance Jarrod Alexander. \"Voices\" impacted radio on May 1, 2012.\n\nIn early 2013, Matt Skiba encouraged Mike Park of Asian Man Records to release The Smith Street Band first two albums in America.

It is believed that they are dummy cabinets now, but Skiba occasionally mics them with Blink, showing that if they are not being used for this purpose, they are most likely for stage-use only.\n\n\nSkiba is a vegan and practices Transcendental Meditation according to an interview with AOL Interface. He said that the clear and calm state of mind it provides has greatly helped his creative process, though initially he believed the \"tortured soul\" mindset was more beneficial. The book \"Catching the Big Fish\" by David Lynch caused him to change his mind and he now believes a calm state is more artistically helpful.\n\nSkiba moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2001, though he currently lives in Los Angeles. He has \"Love Song\" tattooed on his knuckles.

They were established in the 12th century (c. 1130) by the Almohad Caliphate ruler Abd al-Mu'min.\n\nThe name \"menara\" derives from the pavilion with its small green pyramid-shaped roof (\"menzeh\"), meaning lighthouse (منارَة [manaara]). Although there is no actual lighthouse in the gardens, any building that sits at a high elevation is locally known as menara, such as the mosque Menaret manaara. The pavilion was built during the 16th century Saadi dynasty and renovated in 1869 by sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, who used to stay here in summertime.\n\nThe pavilion and basin (an artificial lake) are surrounded by orchards and olive groves. The intention of the basin was to irrigate the surrounding gardens and orchards using a sophisticated system of underground channels called a \"qanat\". The basin is supplied with water thanks to an old hydraulic system, which conveys water from the mountains located approximately 30 km away from Marrakech. It also served as a martial station.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1009234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009234", "title": "Milarepa", "text": "Milarepa\n\nJetsun Milarepa (, 1028/40–1111/23) was a Tibetan siddha, who famously was a murderer as a young man then turned to Buddhism to become an accomplished buddha despite his past. He is generally considered as one of Tibet's most famous yogis and poets, serving as an example for the Buddhist life. He was a student of Marpa Lotsawa, and a major figure in the history of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nMilarepa's life-story is famous in the Tibetan culture, and retold many times. The best-known biography, \"The Life of Milarepa\", written by Tsangnyön Heruka (1452-1507) in the fifteenth century and drawing from older biographies, is still very popular. Most of the present-day stories on Milarepa come from this single source. While \"very little [is known] about him as a historical person at all,\" Milarepa is venerated by all Tibetan schools \"as an exemplar of religious dedication and mastery,\" and his lifestory established the lineage of the Kagyu sect and its key figures.\n\nAccording to \"The Life of Milarepa\", Milarepa was born in western Tibet to a prosperous family. When his father died, his family was bereft of their wealth by his aunt and uncle. At his mother's request, Milarepa left home and studied sorcery to take revenge, killing many people. Later he felt sorrow about his deeds, and became student of Marpa the Translator. Before Marpa would teach Milarepa, he had him undergo abuse and trials, such as letting him build and then demolish three towers in turn. Milarepa was asked to build one final multi-story tower by Marpa at Lhodrag, which still stands. Eventually, Marpa accepted him, explaining that the trials were a means to purify Milarepa's negative karma. Marpa transmitted tantric Tantric initiations and instructions to Milarepa, including \"tummo\" (\"yogic heat\"), the \"aural transmissions\" (), and \"mahamudra\". Marpa told Milarepa to practice solitary meditation in caves and mountain retreats, which, according to the biography, after many years of practice resulted in \"a deep experiential realization about the true nature of reality.\" Thereafter he lived as a fully realized yogin, and eventually even forgave his aunt, who caused the misfortune of his family.\n\nAccording to Lopez, \"The Life of Milarepa\" represents \"Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, projected back in time,\" and contains \"many of the key terms and doctrines of Buddhism.\" Tsangnyön Heruka did his best to establish a lineage of teachers which connects the Kagyu tradition with the Indian \"siddha\" tradition, portraying Marpa as a student of Naropa, though Naropa had already died when Marpa went to India.\n\nLopez notes that Tsangnyön Heruka used stylistic elements from the biography of Gautama Buddha to portray Milarepa effectively as a Tibetan Buddha, \"born and enlightened in Tibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an Indian master.\" The lifestory of Milarepa portrays \"the rapid method of the Tantric path,\"in which liberation is gained in one lifetime. It describes how Milarepa practiced the generation stage and completion stage, to achieve \"mahamudra\", \"spontaneous realization of the most profound nature of mind.\" Yet, in his instructions to his Tibetan audiences, Milarepa refers to the basic Buddhist teachings of \"impermanence, the sufferings of \"saṃsāra\", the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its arrival, the frightful rebirth that is the direct result of our benighted deeds.\" But, his own life also is an example that even a murderer can transform into a Buddha. Lopez further notes that \"The Life of Milarepa\" portrays two parallel worlds, a profane world and a sacred world, which are ultimately one, showing that the world itself is sacred.\n\nPrevious biographies of Milarepa were enlarged with religious poetry and song cycles, which doubled the volume of biographical information. Tsangnyön Heruka published these songs in a separate volume as \"The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa\", summarizing the various song cycles in chapter eleven of \"The Life of Milarepa\".\n\nMilarepa lived during the socalled second dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet (10th-12th century), when Buddhism was re-introduced. Three pivotal figures in this Tibetan Renaissance were Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055), who translated sutras, tantras and commentaries; Atiśa (982-1054), whose student Dromtön founded the Kadam school of Tibetan Buddhism; and Marpa Lotsawa, the teacher of Milarepa, and himself regarded as student of Naropa. Marpa introduced tantric texts and oral instructions from the Bengali siddha tradition into Tibet, and Marpa's purported connection with Naropa established the lineage of the Kaguy school, thereby reaching back to the Buddha himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35824191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35824191", "title": "Ndut initiation rite", "text": "Ndut initiation rite\n\nThe Ndut is a rite of passage as well as a religious education commanded by Serer religion that every Serer (an ethnic group found in Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania) must go through once in their lifetime. The Serer people being an ethnoreligious group, the Ndut initiation rite is also linked to Serer culture. From the moment a Serer child is born, education plays a pivotal role throughout their life cycle. The ndut is one of these phases of their life cycle. In Serer society, education lasts a lifetime, from infancy to old age.\n\nThe name Ndut comes from the language of the Ndut people, a sub-group of the Serer people. In a religious sense, it means nest. It is a place of sanctuary, and the place where Serer boys lodge in preparation for their circumcision. These boys are called \"njuli\" (initiates). The word \"njuli\" comes from the Serer word juul (variations: \"juu\") which means a little boy's penis. Because of its religious connotations, the word has been borrowed by the Wolof to designate a Muslim person (juulit) (see :Serer religion's influence in Senegambia).\n\nThere are two main types of Ndut initiation rites. The first concerns the circumcision for Serer boys whilst the second concerns the initiation of Serer girls. Serer religion and culture forbids the circumcision of Serer girls (female genital mutilation). Only Serer boys are circumcised. Serer girls receive their initiation through \"njam\" or \"ndom\" (the tattooing of the gums). Preparation for the initiation starts early in childhood. In many cases, boys are circumcised when they reach 13 years old. However it is not uncommon for some to be circumcised when they are 19 to 26 years old. Likewise, Serer girls receive their initiation when they are 11 to 18 years.\n\nThe purpose of this initiation is to mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is also to teach young Serers how to be good, brave and honourable citizens. In Serer society, a Serer man who has not undergone the Ndut iniation rite is not deemed to be man. It is also taboo for a Serer woman to marry a Serer man who has not been circumcised. In a religious and hygienic point of view, an uncircumcised penis is deemed uncleanly and impure. Likewise, in old Serer culture, a Serer woman who has not undergone the \"njam\" was not deemed to be a real woman. Though prejudice against Serer women who have not undergone the njam is less prevalent nowadays due to modernity, prejudice against Serer men who have not undergone circumcision still prevails in Serer culture.\n\nThe preparation for the Ndut takes several years, and involves the participation of the whole family and lineages (both maternal and paternal) as well as the community. It is a long process where physical, sychological, spiritual and economic \nfactors all come into play, in preparation for the child before the actual act of circumcision (for boys) or njam (for girls). The entire family play a vital role in preparing the child for this journey.\n\nBefore a Serer boy is circumcised, he must make a public pronouncements called \"Kan boppam\" in Serer. This public pronouncements is made in the form of a poem (\"ciid\" in Serer language) or song. One of these chants is given below:\n\nIn the initiation of both Serer boys and girls, Serer women play an important role. Although women are forbidden to participate in the actual act of circumcision or to enter the Ndut (the nest sanctuary), the boy's female family play an important role before and after the act of circumcision. They are part of the family unit that helps the child to prepare for the circumcision. It is not only the male relatives who helps the child, but the whole family. The child's paternal aunt (his father's sister) would give a bracelet (usually silver) to the child to be worn on his left arm as a sign of good luck. In most cases, it is the father who give the child this bracelet as protection. Just after the circumcision, the boy's mother would sometimes even breast feed the child for the last time. This breast feeding act is symbolic of rebirth after death, and requires \"the ingestion of lifegiving nourishment from the mother\". Thus the woman is seen as a giver of life and the protection of life. The importance of women is best preserved in the Serer mythology of \"Mama\" (\"the grandmother\" in Serer language) :\n\nThe structure of a Serer girl's initiation is somewhat similar to the structure of a Serer boy's initiation. For a Serer girl, the njam surgery is performed by an elderly woman with her helpers. These elderly women have undergone the surgery themselves. One of the head of these women is called the \"njamkat\". She is the one who will perform the operation (tattoo of the gums). The circumcision of Serer boys is also performed in a structured situation. It involves the circumciser and his helpers as well as a person who supervises the operation. This supervisor is the master of the circumcision (\"kumax\" in Serer). He is the eldest male in the community and must possess all the qualities of a good kumax, which include: generosity, supportive and patience. All the men involved in the rite of passage must have undergone the operation themselves. A boy and his age group are usually circumcised together, under the guidance of the \"selbe\" (the person who accompanies the children to be circumcised). They form a pact of brotherhood.\n\nThe building where the circumcision takes place is called the \"ndut\" (nest). It is a temporary hut far away from the town or village. It is temporary because the hut must be set on fire just after the initiation. The burning of the ndut is symbolic. It represents that the sanctuary the initiates have been living in for the past three months, shut off from the outside world was only a dream, an artificial place that does not exist in real life. However, they can refer back to the dream and use what they have learned from the dream when faced with the dangers of real life. It is also taboo for a child to attend the same ndut where his father has received his circumcision. Upon arrival in this sacred place, the boys chant the names of the Pangool (singular: \"Fangol\", Serer saints and ancestral spirits) :\n\nReciting this verse acknowledges the ancestors who have long departed, and are called upon to come near and protect the children from any bad spirit or evil that may befall the ndut especially at night.\n\nThe ndut is also a place for education. In classical ndut teachings, initiates get to learn about themselves, teamwork, how to be upstanding citizens, history of the Serer people, the supernatural world, Serer creation myth, the cosmos, mysteries of the universe and the formation of the stars etc. Every morning, a dream interpretation exercise takes place. These exercise guide the children as to how to analysis each other's dreams as well as their own, and helps them develop their skills of clairvoyancy. It is also a place where they receive their sex education, especially among the older members of the initiates. These young men are told not to engage in sexual activities with women until their operation has healed. The ceremony of washing is also emphasised. This helps in the healing process. The first ceremony of washing takes place near the ndut. Washing symbolizes purification.\n\nChildren compose songs, sing and dance together. This exercise helps them to forget the actual circumcision pending. It also develops their artistic and team working skills. Friendships and brotherhood are formed which last a lifetime. Most of these songs are religious in nature. It is from these religious songs that the njuup tradition derives from (a conservartive Serer music, and the progenitor of mbalax).\n\nAfter years of preparation, comes the actual act of circumcision for boys or njam for girls. This is where they test their honour according to the Serer principle of Jom - a code of beliefs and values that govern Serer lives. \"Jom\" in Serer means honour. The child must show no signs of anxiousness or fright. They must show bravery from start to finish, and must not twitch or cry during the operation. If the child shows signs of nervousness or fright just before the operation, the operation will not go ahead. It means that the child's family have not prepared the child sufficiently for this operation. The parents are judged according to the child's behaviour. In these circumstances, the kumax or njamkat will ask the family to take the child and reassure him or her then bring them back later. If the child has been reassured by the family then brought back later for the operation but they are still anxious, then the operation is cancelled. Serer religion dictates that, in circumstances like these, the child should not be humiliated. Instead, they should be encouraged and supported with words of praise and better prepared for the operation next time. In spite of these religious commandments, the Serer people being governed by the code of \"Jom\", it was not uncommon for some Serer parents and family members to commit suicide because of what they viewed as humiliation or dishonour of the family name. Suicide is only permitted if it satisfies the Jom principle (see Serer religion).\n\nIf the boy shows no sign of anxiety, he is encouraged to open the tissue covering the head of the penis. In Serer, this is called \"war o sumtax\" (to kill the foreskin). The word \"war\" (as in War Jabi) means to kill in Serer. The boy to be circumcised would seat on a mortar with his legs opened. He must muster the courage to do this on his own and should not be forced. The mortar symbolises the feminine world, and after the boy has been circumcised, he must never sit on a mortar again. Before the circumciser starts the operation, he ask the boy for forgiveness. He would utter the word \"waasanaam\" (please forgive me), and the boy would usually answer \"waasanaaong\" (I forgive you). This is a symbolic gesture of respect, communion and spirituality. It shows that the circumciser is well aware of the pain he is about to inflict, as he has undergone the operation himself and any mistake may result in death and tars his professional reputation forever.\n\nThe blade is sterilized before the actual circumcision in order to avoid infection. After the foreskin has been removed, a special kind of powder is applied on the penis to avoid infection and help in the healing process.\n\nAfter several weeks, usually three months, the initiates finish their rite of passage and go home. The ndut is set a blaze. Children receive presents from family members. In pre-colonial times, the boys would perform a dance in front of the Serer kings and the rest of the royal family who would in turn give them presents for their courage (see Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "597956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597956", "title": "Nikaya Buddhism", "text": "Nikaya Buddhism\n\nThe term Nikāya Buddhism was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi as a non-derogatory substitute for Hinayana, meaning the early Buddhist schools. Examples of these groups are pre-sectarian Buddhism and the early Buddhist schools. Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term. The term Theravada refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the Pāli Canon.\n\nEarly Buddhism in India is generally divided into various monastic fraternities, or nikāyas. Conventionally numbering eighteen, the actual count varied over time. The doctrinal orientation of each school differed somewhat, as did the number of piṭakas in their canon. An example of this is the Dharmaguptaka, which included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a Dhāraṇī Piṭaka.\n\nThe Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas generally advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Therefore, for the Mahāsāṃghikas, the bodhisattva ideal and buddhahood was advocated over the ideal of becoming an arhat.\n\nAvalokitavrata wrote of the Mahāsāṃghikas as using a \"Great Āgama Piṭaka\", which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the \"Prajñāparamitā\" and the \"Ten Stages Sutra\". In the Caitika group of nikāyas, the Pūrvaśailas and the Aparaśailas each were known to have the \"\" in Prakrit. Bhāvaviveka also wrote of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Pūrvaśailas and Aparaśailas both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, implying organized collections of Mahāyāna texts within these Mahāsāṃghika nikāyas.\n\nIn the Sthavira nikāya, the Sarvāstivādins were a major nikāya. The Sarvāstivādin \"\" is known to employ the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of three vehicles: Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna, and Bodhisattvayāna. References to the Bodhisattvayāna and the practice of the Six pāramitās are commonly found in Sarvāstivāda works as well.\n\nThe Theravada sect from Sri Lanka generally accepts the three vehicles, but categorizes these as three different types of bodhi, or enlightenment. The Theravada nikaya only uses the Pāli Canon, which has three piṭakas, and does not contain separate literature for bodhisattvas. Walpola Rahula writes of this, \"At the end of a religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three Bodhis - Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they wish according to their capacity.\"\n\nJan Nattier writes that there is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has similarly noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the Indian nikāyas, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to one of these nikāyas. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikāya in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda nikāya in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nMany commentors on Buddhism have used the term Hīnayāna to refer to Nikāya Buddhism. However, that term is now generally seen as flawed:\n\nAccording to Robert Thurman, the term \"Nikāya Buddhism\" was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, as a way to avoid the usage of the term Hinayana. \"Nikaya Buddhism\" is thus an attempt to find a more neutral way of referring to Buddhists who follow one of the early Buddhist schools, and their practice.\n\nThe term Śrāvakayāna (literally, \"hearer vehicle\" or \"disciples' vehicle\") is also sometimes used for the same purpose. Other terms that have been used in similar senses include sectarian Buddhism or conservative Buddhism. Note that nikāya is also a term used in Theravāda Buddhism to refer to a subschool or subsect within Theravada.\n\nLike the term Hinayana Buddhism, the term Nikāya Buddhism focuses on the presumed commonality between the schools, and not on the actual schools themselves. This commonality is thought to be found in a certain attitude. The term \"Nikāya Buddhism\" tries to shift the attention to the more neutral issue of attitude concerning the authenticity of scriptures.\n\nA concise analysis by the Tibetan Buddhist, Reginald Ray, summarises the mistaken and confusing use of the term \"Hīnayāna\" to refer to any contemporary extant schools:\n\n"}

{"id": "916669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=916669", "title": "Self-immolation", "text": "Self-immolation\n\nSelf-immolation is an act of killing oneself as a sacrifice. While usage since the 1960s has typically referred only to setting oneself on fire, the term historically refers to a much wider range of suicidal options, such as leaping off a cliff, starvation, or \"seppuku\" (also called \"harakiri\" — ritual disembowelment). Self-immolation is often used as a form of protest or for the purposes of martyrdom. It has centuries-long traditions in some cultures, while in modern times it has become a type of radical political protest. The British sociologist Michael Biggs compiled a list of 533 \"self-immolations\" reported by Western media from the 1950s to 2002, using the general definition (not just by fire), and including any intentional suicide \"on behalf of a collective cause\".\n\nThe English word \"immolation\" originally meant (1534) \"killing a sacrificial victim; sacrifice\" and came to figuratively mean (1690) \"destruction, especially by fire.\" Its etymology was from Latin \"immolare\" \"to sprinkle with sacrificial meal (mola salsa); to sacrifice\" in ancient Roman religion. \"Self-immolation\" \"setting oneself on fire, especially as a form of protest\" was first recorded in Lady Morgan's \"France\" (1817).\n\nIt was Western media coverage of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức's suicide by fire in protest of the Buddhist crisis caused by the Vietnamese Ngô Đình Diệm regime in 1963 that introduced the word \"self-immolation\" to a wide English-speaking audience and gave it a strong association with fire. The alternative name \"bonzo\" comes from the same era, because the Buddhist monks who immolated themselves were often referred to by the term \"bonze\" in English literature before the mid-20th century, particularly when describing monks from East Asia and French Indochina. This term is derived from the Japanese word \"bonzō\" (凡僧) for a priest or monk, and has become less common in modern literature.\n\nSelf-immolation is tolerated by some elements of Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism, and it has been practiced for many centuries, especially in India, for various reasons, including \"jauhar\", \"sati\", political protest, devotion, and renouncement. Certain warrior cultures, such as those of the Charans and Rajputs, also practiced self-immolation.\n\nThe act of sacrificing one's own body, though not by fire, is a component of two well-known stories found in the ancient Buddhist text known as the \"Jataka Tales\", which, according to Buddhist tradition, gives accounts of past incarnations of the Buddha. In the \"Hungry Tigress\" Jataka, Prince Sattva looked down from a cliff and saw a starving tigress that was going to eat her newborn cubs, and compassionately sacrificed his body in order to feed the tigers and spare their lives. In the \"Sibi Jataka\", King Śibi, or Shibi, was renowned for selflessness, and the gods Śakra and Vishvakarman tested him by transforming into a hawk and a dove. The dove fell on the king's lap while trying to escape the hawk, and sought refuge. Rather than surrender the dove, Śibi offered his own flesh equivalent in weight to the dove, and the hawk agreed. They had rigged the balance scale, and King Śibi continued cutting off his flesh until half his body was gone, when the gods revealed themselves, restored his body, and blessed him.\n\nThe Bodhisattva \"Medicine King\" (Bhaishajyaraja) chapter of the \"Lotus Sutra\" was associated with auto-cremation. In a previous life, 'Medicine King' Bodhisattva burnt his body as a supreme offering to the Buddha. The \"Lotus Sutra\" describes the Bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana drinking scented oils, wrapping his body in an oil-soaked cloth, and burning himself. His body flamed for 1,200 years, he was reincarnated, burned off his forearms for 72,000 years, which enabled many to achieve enlightenment, and his arms were miraculously restored.\n\nZarmanochegas was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch around 13 ACE and burnt himself to death in Athens shortly thereafter.\n\nSelf-immolation has a long history in Chinese Buddhism. The relevant terms are: \"wangshen\" \"lose the body\" or \"forget the body\", \"yishen\" \"abandon the body\", and \"sheshen\" \"give up the body\". James A. Benn explains the semantic range of Chinese Buddhist self-immolation. \nBut \"abandoning the body\" also covers a broad range of more extreme acts (not all of which necessarily result in death): feeding one's body to insects; slicing off one's flesh; burning one's fingers or arms; burning incense on the skin; starving, slicing, or drowning oneself; leaping from cliffs or trees; feeding one's body to wild animals; self-mummification (preparing for death so that the resulting corpse is impervious to decay); and of course, auto-cremation.\n\nThe monk Fayu 法羽 (d. 396) carried out the earliest recorded Chinese self-immolation. He first informed the \"illegitimate\" prince Yao Xu 姚緒—brother of Yao Chang who founded the non-Chinese Qiang state Later Qin (384-417)—that he intended to burn himself alive. Yao tried to dissuade Fayu, but he publicly swallowed incense chips, wrapped his body in oiled cloth, and chanted while setting fire to himself. The religious and lay witnesses were described as being \"full of grief and admiration.\"\n\nFollowing Fayu's example, many Buddhist monks and nuns have used self-immolation for political purposes. Based upon analysis of Chinese historical records from the 4th to the 20th centuries, Benn discovered, \"Although some monks did offer their bodies in periods of relative prosperity and peace, we have seen a marked coincidence between acts of self-immolation and times of crisis, especially when secular powers were hostile towards Buddhism.\" For example, Daoxuan's (c. 667) \"Xu Gaoseng Zhuan\"(續高僧傳, or \"Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks\") records five monastics who self-immolated on the Zhongnan Mountains in response to the 574–577 persecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (known as the \"Second Disaster of Wu\").\n\nWhile self-immolation practices in China were based upon Indian Buddhist traditions, they acquired some distinctively Chinese aspects. An \"unburned tongue\" (cf. Anthony of Padua), which supposedly remained pink and moist owing to self-immolation while chanting the \"Lotus Sutra\", was based on the belief in Śarīra \"Buddhist relics; purportedly from a master's remains after cremation\". \"Burning off fingers\" was a kind of gradual self-immolation, often in commemoration of relics or textual recitations. The Tang Dynasty monk Wuran 無染 (d. c. 840) had a spiritual vision in which Manjusri told him to support the Buddhist community on Mount Wutai. After organizing meals for one million monks, Wuran burned off a finger in sacrifice, and eventually after ten million meals, had burned off all his fingers. Xichen 息塵 (d. c. 937; with two fingers left) became a favorite of Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin for practicing finger burning to memorialize sutra recitions. \"Buddhist mummies\" refers to monks and nuns who practiced self-mummification through extreme self-mortification, for instance, Daoxiu 道休 (d. 629). \"Spontaneous human combustion\" was a rare form of self-immolation that Buddhists associated with samādhi \"consciously leaving one's body at the time of enlightenment\". The monk Ningyi 寧義 (d. 1583) stacked up firewood to burn himself, but, \"As soon the torch was raised, his body started to burn 'like a rotten root' and was soon completely consumed. A wise person declared, 'He has entered the fiery \"samādhi\".\" \nJames A. Benn concludes that, \"for many monks and laypeople in Chinese history, self-immolation was a form of Buddhist practice that modeled and expressed a particular bodily or somatic path that led towards Buddhahood.\"\n\nJan Yun-Hua explains the medieval Chinese Buddhist precedents for self-immolation.\n\nJimmy Yu has shown that self-immolation cannot be interpreted based on Buddhist doctrine and beliefs alone but the practice must be understood in the larger context of the Chinese religious landscape. He examines many primary sources from the 16th and 17th century and demonstrates that bodily practices of self-harm, including self-immolation, was ritually performed not only by Buddhists but also by Daoists and literati officials who either exposed their naked body to the sun in a prolonged period of time as a form of self-sacrifice or burned themselves as a method of procuring rain. In other words, self-immolation was a sanctioned part of Chinese culture that was public, scripted, and intelligible both to the person doing the act and to those who viewed and interpreted it, regardless of their various religion affiliations.\n\nDuring the Great Schism of the Russian Church, entire villages of Old Believers burned themselves to death in an act known as \"fire baptism\" (self-burners: \"soshigateli\"). Scattered instances of self-immolation have also been recorded by the Jesuit priests of France in the early 17th century. However, their practice of this was not intended to be fatal: they would burn certain parts of their bodies (limbs such as the forearm or the thigh) to symbolise the pain Jesus endured while upon the cross. A 1973 study by a prison doctor suggested that people who choose self-immolation as a form of suicide are more likely to be in a \"disturbed state of consciousness\", such as epilepsy.\n\nRather than give up their way of life, a number of Buddhist monks (including the most famous case of Thích Quảng Đức) immolated themselves by fire in protest of the persecution of Buddhists under the administration of Roman Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm in South Vietnam. An important source of inspiration for the monks and nuns who self-immolated is the twenty-third chapter of the \"Lotus Sutra\" which recounts the life story of Bodhisattva Medicine King. In this section of the Sutra, Medicine King demonstrates his insight into Śūnyatā and the selfless nature of all things by ritualistically setting his own body aflame, which burned for 1,200 years to demonstrate the immeasurable power of the Buddhadharma. Thich Nhat Hanh adds: \"The bodhisattva shone his light about him so that everyone could see as he could see, giving them the opportunity to see the deathless nature of the ultimate.\"\n\nThe widespread coverage of the self-immolations of the Buddhist monks in mid 20th century Western media established the practice as a type of a political protest in the Western mind. Self-immolations are often public and political events that catch the attention of the news media through their dramatic means. They are seen as a type of altruistic suicide for a collective cause, and are not intended to inflict physical harm on others or cause material damage. They attract attention to a cause and those who undergo the act are glorified in martyrdom. While the burning of vital tissue can be very painful during self-immolation, one criminologist surmises that shock or asphyxiation quickly make the event painless, as do the onset of third-degree burns which destroy the nerve endings. However, fire immolation does not guarantee death for the burned.\n\nThe example set by self-immolators in the mid 20th century did spark numerous similar acts between 1963 and 1971, most of which occurred in Asia and the United States in conjunction with protests opposing the Vietnam War. Researchers counted almost 100 self-immolations covered by \"The New York Times\" and \"The Times\". In 1968 the practice spread to the Soviet bloc with the self-immolation of Polish accountant Armia Krajowa and veteran Ryszard Siwiec, as well as those of two Czech students, Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc, and of toolmaker Evžen Plocek, in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. As a protest against Soviet rule in Lithuania, 19-year-old Romas Kalanta set himself on fire in Kaunas. In 1978 Ukrainian dissident and former political prisoner Oleksa Hirnyk burnt himself near the tomb of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko protesting against the russification of Ukraine under Soviet rule.\n\nThe practice continues, notably in India: as many as 1,451 and 1,584 self-immolations were reported there in 2000 and 2001, respectively. A particularly high wave of self-immolation in India was recorded in 1990 protesting the Reservation in India. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of self-immolations in India to date.\n\nSince 2009, there have been, as of June 2017, 148 confirmed and two disputed self-immolations by Tibetans, with most of these protests (some 80%) ending in death. The Dalai Lama has said he does not encourage the protests, but he has spoken with respect and compassion for those who engage in self-immolation. The Chinese government, however, claims that he and the exiled Tibetan government are inciting these acts. In 2013, the Dalai Lama questioned the effectiveness of self-immolation as a demonstration tactic. He has also expressed that the Tibetans are acting of their own free will and stated that he is powerless to influence them to stop carrying out immolation as a form of protest.\n\nA wave of self-immolation suicides occurred in conjunction with the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa, with at least 14 recorded incidents. These suicides assisted in inciting the Arab Spring, including the 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution, the main catalyst of which was the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, the 2011 Algerian protests (including many self-immolations in Algeria), and the 2011 Egyptian revolution. There have also been suicide protests in Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and Syria.\n\n\n\n"}

A series of letters to Olcott, alleged to be from Serapis, encouraging Olcott to support Blavatsky in the founding of the Theosophical Society were published in the book \"Letters from the Masters of the Wisdom\".\n\nIt is thought that Serapis Bey was incarnated as a high priest in one of the \"Temples of the Sacred Fire\" on Atlantis who migrated to Egypt at the time of the destruction of Atlantis. It is also believed that he was incarnated as the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (who constructed the Temple of Luxor to the god Amun) and also as Leonidas, the King of Sparta, who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of Thermopylae against the invasion of Greece by Emperor Xerxes I of Persia.\nAccording to the teachings of Agni Yoga, Serapis Bey was in past lives the Roman King Numa Pompilius, the philosophers Confucius, Plato and Lucius Anneus Seneca. He is referred in the book Supermundane as \"The Thinker\".\n\nAdherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that Serapis Bey, after being killed as Leonidas in the battle of Thermopylae, immediately reembodied as Phidias (c. 480 BC - c. 430 BC), the greatest of all classical Greek sculptors. He then attained his Ascension, becoming an Ascended Master about 400 BC.\n\nSerapis Bey has been identified by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings with the god Serapis who was the syncretic Hellenistic/Egyptian god used by King Ptolemy I as the deity of his capital city of Alexandria. Serapis was the patron deity of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nC. W. Leadbeater wrote that many artists are on the fourth ray of harmony and beauty, which Serapis Bey is said to oversee as Chohan. In the teachings of Alice Bailey the fourth ray is called the ray of \"harmony through conflict\". Ascended Master Teachings organizations consider Serapis Bey to be the Chohan of the Fourth Ray of Purity, Harmony, and Discipline.\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Helena Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.\n\nAlso see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig \"New York Times\" October 5, 1980, which maintains that Helena Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13755595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13755595", "title": "Seventh-day Adventist Interfaith Relations", "text": "Seventh-day Adventist Interfaith Relations\n\nThis article describes the relations between the Seventh-day Adventist Church and other Christian denominations and movements, and other religions. Adventist resist the movement to full ecumenical integration with other churches, believing that such a transition would result in a renouncing of its foundational beliefs and endanger its distinctive message. According to one church document,\n\nAdventists have often been skeptical of other faiths. The Millerite movement, which gave birth to Seventh-day Adventism, experienced rejection and hostility from the majority of North American Christian churches of the time. Early Adventists experienced similar hostility because of their unique views about the Sabbath. They consequently came to see themselves as an obedient remnant which was encountering the wrath of the dragon, as prophesied in . Subsequent developments in Adventist eschatology saw the Sunday-keeping churches identified with Babylon the Great (). A central aspect of the Adventist mission was to call people out of Babylon, and into the remnant church, as signified by the second of the three angels' messages.\n\nThe \"Review and Herald\" (now \"Adventist Review\") October 12, 1876 contains an \"amazing\" article on cordiality between the Adventist pioneers and the Seventh Day Baptists. James White pointed out that the two bodies agreed on the two great tests of the Christian life, i.e. the divine law and redemption from its transgression through the Son. The main difference between them, White observed, was the question of immortality. Even though differences existed between the two groups, White recommended, \"that there be no controversy between the two bodies.\" He continued, \"we further recommend that Seventh-day Adventists in their work avoid laboring to build up Seventh-day Adventist churches where Seventh-day Baptist churches are already established...\" He said it is much better to seek union with Seventh Day Baptists on the points they agree than to sacrifice that union by urging on them peculiar Adventist sentiments.\n\nWhile the Adventist church matured and institutionalized in the 20th century, opposition from other churches also declined. By the 1950s, Adventists and American conservative Christians were ready to begin a dialogue. A series of discussions between Adventist and conservative leaders led to greater understanding and acceptance on both sides. Even after these milestone events, however, Adventists continued to resist full ecumenical cooperation with other churches, believing that such cooperation would endanger its distinctive message.\n\nBert Beach was the main Adventist involved with interreligious dialogue.\n\nOn January 22, 2007 church leaders voted to rename the Council on Inter-church/Inter-faith Relations to the Council on Inter-church/Inter-religion Affairs. This involved more than a change of name, representing a desire for increased dialogue with other religions.\n\n\"Seventh-day Adventists believe that freedom of religion is a basic human right.\" The Adventist church has been active for over 100 years advocating for freedom of religion for all people, regardless of faith. In 1893 its leaders founded the International Religious Liberty Association, which is universal and non-sectarian. The \"Seventh-day Adventist Church State Council\" serves to protect religious groups from legislation that may affect their religious practices.\n\nThe church publishes the magazine \"Liberty\".\n\nThe church has two professional organizations for Adventist theologians who are affiliated with the denomination. The Adventist Society for Religious Studies (ASRS) was formed to foster community among Adventist theologians who attend the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) and the American Academy of Religion. In 2006 ASRS voted to continue their meetings in the future in conjunction with SBL. During the 1980s the Adventist Theological Society was formed by Jack Blanco to provide a forum for more conservative theologians to meet and is held in conjunction with the Evangelical Theological Society.\n\nThe Adventist church generally opposes the ecumenical movement, although it supports some of the goals of ecumenism. The General Conference has released an official statement concerning the Adventist position with respect to the ecumenical movement, which contains the following paragraph:\n\nWhile not being a member church of the World Council of Churches, the Adventist church has participated in its assemblies in an observer capacity.\n\nThree Adventist leaders (John Graz, John Kakembo and Bill Johnsson) attended the Global Christian Forum of 250 Christian leaders from more than 70 nations, held in Limuru (near Nairobi), Kenya in 2007.\n\nThe official beliefs of the church (28 Fundamentals) do not mention the papacy or Roman Catholicism. An official statement \"How Seventh-day Adventists View Roman Catholicism\" was released in 1997. Adventists are concerned about the institution of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church, yet recognize many sincere individual Catholics.\n\nWoodrow Whidden wrote, \"we must forthrightly affirm that many positive things have taken place in Roman Catholicism\". According to him, the papacy \"is a mixed bag morally and ethically... All human organizations (including our own 'enfeebled and defective' denomination) are sadly sinful.\" He concludes, \"the Roman Catholic religious system\" or \"papal Rome is still the great power envisioned in Daniel 7 and 8; 2 Thessalonians 2; and Revelation 13.\" See the companion article By Grace Alone? by Clifford Goldstein.\n\nMore moderate scholars... Progressive Adventists typically reject these traditional identifications. See \"Spectrum\" 27, issue 3 (Summer 1999): 30–52.\n\nThere was a number of meetings between Seventh day Adventist and Catholic theologians including now Cardinal Walter Kasper and Msgr John Radano. A short report by Ángel Manuel Rodríguez was released.\n\nAdventist Samuele Bacchiocchi was the first non-Catholic to have graduated from the Pontifical Gregorian University.\n\nSee also Reinder Bruinsma, \"Seventh-day Adventist Attitudes Toward Roman Catholicism 1844–1965\" (Berrien Springs, Michigan: Andrews University Press, 1994) , and another article.\n\nThere was constructive theological dialogue between the Seventh-day Adventist Church and The Lutheran World Federation. Conversations started in 1994 and ended in 1998. The main issues discussed and described by the final report published in 2000 included Justification by Faith, Scripture and Authority in the Church and Eschatology.\n\nFinal report concluded that \"Lutherans in their national and regional church contexts\" should recognize the Seventh-day-Adventist Church no longer \"as a sect but as a free church and a Christian world communion\".\n\nThere is active theological dialogue between the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. In 2001 report on dialogue has been published as well, among other statements it declared that: \n\n\"We are happy to conclude that our conversation has been productive in a number of directions. We have affirmed the common doctrinal ground on which we stand, and we have specified some of the ways in which our teachings have developed over time. We have sought to dispel mutual misunderstandings concerning doctrine. We have eschewed the sectarian spirit, and have not questioned one another's status as Christians.\"\n\nThere were also informal meetings between Setri Nyomi, general secretary of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and Adventist leaders, Nyomi told them that he has experienced the positive witness of the Adventist Church.\n\nThe first meeting with the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) was in 2006. \"Although we come from different religious traditions, there was much that we shared in common and was useful to both parties\" said Angel Rodriguez. \"The meetings were designed to gain a clearer understanding of the theological positions of each body; clarify matters of misunderstanding; discuss frankly areas of agreement and disagreement on a Biblical basis; and explore possible areas of cooperation. The group also enjoyed a visit to several sites in Prague related to Protestant reformer Jan Hus.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the WEA and the Adventist church met at Andrews University from August 5–10, 2007. While the Adventist participants agreed with the WEA Statement of Faith and the discussions were described as warm and cordial, there was disagreement over certain distinctive Adventist beliefs (see: Seventh-day Adventist theology). The \"Joint Statement...\" was released in September.\n\nClark Pinnock believes Adventists are evangelical.\n\nSeventh-day Adventist church is a member of French Protestant Federation, now representing over 900,000 French Protestants and consisting of 17 churches.\n\n\"Now we can enjoy the same rights as traditional Protestant churches and we are considered theologically equal with other religious movements in our country,\" said Jean-Paul Barquon, secretary of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in France.\n\nThere was a meeting between delegates from Seventh day Adventist Church and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) at the Presbyterian Church's national headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky August 22 to 24 (2007) to affirm common beliefs and dispel stereotypes. \n\n“The Adventist church has a responsibility to clear up misconceptions other Christian denominations might have of us, and meetings such as this one give us an opportunity to do so,” said Ángel Manuel Rodríguez, director of the Biblical Research Institute.\n\nThere is active dialogue and friendly relation between Salvation Army and Seventh day Adventist Church. Theologians from both denominations met several times .\n\n\"It was most important to see the very similar approaches to the Gospel message that we have; very compatible lifestyles and Christ-centeredness in The Salvation Army and the Seventh-day Adventist Church,\" Dr. Beach told ANN. \"Adventists have always had considerable respect for the work of Salvationists, and I hope that in the future we would increase our knowledge of each other and our cooperation in meeting many of humanity's crying spiritual and material needs.\"\n\nIn 2003 there was meeting in Belgrade between Jan Paulsen (president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church), Patriarch Pavle and Stanislav Hočevar, Roman Catholic archbishop of Belgrade.\n\n\"Mutual respect must continue between the Adventist Church and the Orthodox Church in Serbia in order to protect religious liberty, Paulsen said. The conversation between the two leaders was informal, amicable and cordial, and covered brief exchanges on world affairs and also the Adventist position on health.\n\nPaulsen also visited Stanislav Hocevar, Roman Catholic archbishop of Belgrade. The prelate's numerous questions about the faith and theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church gave Paulsen an in-depth opportunity to explain the church's understanding of Bible teachings.\"\n\nWhile not being a member church of the World Council of Churches, the Adventist Church has participated in its assemblies in an observer capacity.\n\nWorld Council of Churches see Seventh-day Adventist Church as \"a denomination of conservative evangelical Christians\".\n\nWillow Creek Association is an international, evangelical Christian association that runs workshops, conferences, and one large annual conference. According to one article, \"Seventh-day Adventist pastors and church members have been attending these conferences for years\".\n\nAdventist theology is distinctly Protestant, and holds much in common with Evangelicalism in particular. However, in common with many restorationist groups, Adventists have traditionally taught that the majority of Protestant churches have failed to \"complete\" the Reformation by overturning the errors of Roman Catholicism (see also Great Apostasy) and \"restoring\" the beliefs and practices of the primitive church—including Sabbath-keeping, adult baptism and conditional immortality. The Adventist church is thus classified as a Restorationist sect by some religion scholars. On the same basis it may be associated with the Anabaptists and other movements of the Radical Reformation.\n\nProminent Adventist evangelist George Vandeman affirmed other churches in \"What I Like About... The Lutherans, The Baptists, The Methodists, The Charismatics, The Catholics, Our Jewish Friends, The Adventists\".\n\nAdventists typically do not associate themselves with Fundamentalist Christianity:\n\nHowever one stream of Adventist thought is often considered fundamentalist.\n\nBaptist scholar Clark Pinnock gave very favourable reviews of Alden Thompson's \"Inspiration\", and Richard Rice's theology textbook \"Reign of God\". Pinnock was earlier impressed by Richard Rice's book \"The Openness of God\", and later was the editor for another work of the same name, contributed by authors Rice, John E. Sanders and others. Ray Roennfeldt wrote his PhD on Pinnock's view of biblical inspiration. Pinnock also wrote the foreword to \"Immortality or Resurrection?\" by Samuele Bacchiocchi.\n\nBaptist Wayne Grudem wrote the foreword to Samuele Bacchiocchi's book \"Women in the Church\".\n\nAt an Adventist conference, Methodist scholar Donald Dayton described himself as a \"sympathetic outsider\". He affirmed Adventists for being ahead of their time on certain beliefs, although not necessarily entirely correct.\n\nAnglican minister Geoffrey Paxton had significant interaction with Adventists, particularly with Robert Brinsmead. He lost his job as principal of the Queensland Bible Institute (now Crossway College) because of his association with Adventists.\n\nDefrocked Adventist minister Desmond Ford has presented sermons to a wide variety of Christian denominations.\n\nEvangelical Tony Campolo has written about his positive experiences speaking on numerous Adventist university campuses in the forward to \"Adventism for a New Generation\" by Steve Daily. He presented at the first International Conference on Adventists in the Community, in 2004.\n\nEvangelical author Philip Yancey gave a presentation at Avondale College Church on October 20, 2001, which was broadcast throughout the South Pacific Division. He returned to speak again at Avondale College in 2007.\n\nHistorian Martin E. Marty describes Adventism as trans-modern, as opposed to counter-modern fundamentalists.\n\nThis section describes the interaction between the Adventist church and other religions beside Christianity.\n\nThe General Conference body Global Mission started in 1990 after a decision at the General Conference Session. The [Office of] Adventist Mission was formed in 2005, as a merger of Global Mission and the Office of Mission Awareness.\n\nGlobal Mission has centers specializing in the study of Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, secularism/postmodernism and Islam.\n\nSee \"New Directions in Adventist—Muslim Relations\", a \"Spectrum\" interview with Global Center for Adventist-Muslim Relations director Jerald Whitehouse. See also.\n\nSamir Selmanovic, the pastor of Church of the Advent Hope in New York City, was honored by the group Muslims Against Terrorism for his assistance following the September 11, 2001 attacks, including holding a Christian-Muslim discussion at the peak of tensions.\n\nAs of 2009, a partnership between the Adventist church and the World Health Organization (WHO) is being explored. According to one report, \"While WHO has previously partnered with other faith-based organisations, this would be the first time it could extend official relations to a church denomination.\"\n\n\"Ministry\" magazine is sent to over twice as many non-Adventists as Adventists.\n\n\"Shabbat Shalom\" describes itself as \"The Journal of Jewish-Christian Reconciliation\".\n\n\n\nVoted statements and similar documents:\n\nOther links:\n"}

The temple is notable for its size and frontage, over on the M. A. Jinnah Road in Karachi city. The temple celebrated its anniversary of 150 years in April 2004. It is believed that not only Hindus but also adherents of Islam visit the temple, which adds to its notability. There is a sacred cowshed within the premises of this temple. The temple is located at the centre of a Hindu neighborhood in Karachi. The building that housed a \"dharmshala\" (guest house) for visiting devotees has now been converted to the office of the City District Government.\n\nThe temple became a refugee camp in 1947. The original images of Swaminarayan were removed and taken to India during the turbulent times of independence. One murti that was originally at this temple is now located in Khan Village, Rajasthan. People who wished to settle in India from all over Sindh awaited their departure to India by ship at this temple. The temple was visited by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan during this period. In 1989, for the first time since the independence in 1947, a group of sadhus from the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad visited the temple. Since then, small groups from the Ahmedabad temple pay this temple a visit every few years in a pilgrimage.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Hindu Council, Swaminarayan Jayanti, Ram Navami, Janmastami, Dussehra, Diwali and almost all of the main religious festivals are celebrated by Hindus in this temple. Holi is celebrated with the holi bonfire lit at the centre of the temple grounds, followed by the play with colours. Janmashtami is celebrated with singing bhajans and sermons on Krishna, while on Diwali, devotees light lamps and candles to welcome Rama from his fourteen-year exile, at the end of which he defeated Ravana and young men burst crackers at the temple on the occasion. The Holi festival celebrations that take place at this temple are the biggest in Karachi.\n\nThe temple also doubles as a marriage venue. In 2008, a mass wedding arrangement was made for 20 poor couples.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Hindu Council, there is a Guru Nanak temple within the Swaminarayan Temple complex. Here, every Moon Night and for the birthday of Guru Nanak, Baisakhi is celebrated.\n\nThe Hinglaj yatra starts from the Swaminarayan Temple complex here annually.\n\nIn the Swaminarayan Mandir complex in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan where a small Hindu community lives, a Gurdwara has been created for the small Sikh community.\n\nThe Gurdwara Sahib houses three sets of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji in the Palki Sahib. There are pictures of the Gurus and a small shrine devoted to Guru Nanak Dev Ji. There is a Hindu bell in the Gurdwara Sahib as well.\n\nThe whole compound is protected by a security guard to protect the small number of Hindu families.\n\n"}
{"id": "3112780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3112780", "title": "The event of Ghadir Khumm", "text": "The event of Ghadir Khumm\n\nThe event of Ghadir Khumm (Arabic and Persian: واقعه غدیر خم) is an event that took place in March 632. While returning from the Hajj pilgrimage, the Islamic prophet Muhammad gathered all the Muslims who were with him and gave a long sermon. In the sermon, Muhammad announced that Ali ibn Abi Talib would be his successor. This sermon included Muhammad's famous declaration that \"to whomsoever I am \"Mawla\", Ali is also their \"Mawla\".\"\n\nThe Islamic prophet Muhammad also described Ali with the leadership titles \"\"Imam\",\" \"\"Ameer\",\" and \"Khalifah\" in the lengthy speech. After the sermon, the following verse of the Qur'an was revealed: \"This day I have perfected your Religion for you: Completed My favor upon you, and have chosen For you Islam as your Religion.\" This verse (the fourth verse of Surah Maidah, the fifth chapter of the Qur'an) was the last verse of the Qur'an to be revealed.\n\nIn addition, after the sermon, Muhammad instructed everyone to pledge allegiance to Ali.\n\nThis event, which over one hundred thousand people were present at, is considered to mark the completion of Islam. It is also known as the official appointment of Ali as Muhammad's successor. The day's anniversary in the Islamic calendar (18 Dhu al-Hijjah) is celebrated by Muslims (primarily Shias) as Eid-e-Ghadeer.\n\nTen years after the migration and on the last days of Dhu al-Qi'dah (coinciding with 632 in the Gregorian calendar), Muhammad moved from Medina to Mecca accompanied by thousands of his followers. He only once attended Hajj rituals, a few months before he died. Since this Hajj took place in the last year of his life, he made his farewells to people. Ali was in Yemen, preaching Islam, when he was informed about Muhammad's Hajj, so he moved towards Mecca together with some people and joined Muhammad before rituals began. When the rituals of Hajj were finished, Muhammad left Mecca for Medina together with other Muslims.\n\nOn Thursday the 18th of Dhu al-Hijjah in the year 10 A.H. (March 632), after the Farewell Pilgrimage, the Muslims arrived at Ghadir Khumm. The following verse of the Quran was revealed:\n\nAccording to the verse, Muhammad was obliged to proclaim an important message. The verse clearly denotes the importance of the message, by saying that if he does not announce it, then he has not performed his mission. After revelation of the verse, Muhammad ordered the caravan to stop, and ordered those who had passed Ghadir Khumm to return, and for them to wait there until the arrival of those who were still on their way.\n\nBoth Shia and Sunni sources state that this verse relates to the event of Ghadir Khumm. According to Sunni traditional narratives, this verse was revealed during the event, and over 360 Sunnis traditional scholars have mentioned about Ghadir and its connection with the mentioned verse.\nOn the way back to Medina from Mecca, Muhammad ordered his companions to stop at Ghadir Khum and delivered a lengthy sermon. The most well-known part of the sermon occurred when he raised Ali's hand and said, \"whomever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla.\" When Abu Bakr and Umar heard this, they said to Ali: \"O son of Abu Talib, you have become the Mawla of every male and every female believer, morning and evening, congratulations.\"\n\nA portion of a part of sermon is as follows:\n\nAnother similar narration of part of the hadith goes as follows,\n\nAccording to Shia scholar Sheikh Abdul Hosein Amini's work \"Al-Ghadir\", immediately after Muhammad had finished his speech, the following verse of the Quran was revealed:\n\nThis day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion (5:3).\n\nSunni Muslims believe this verse was revealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage of the Prophet Muhammad on the Day of Arafah, the ninth day of Dhul Hijja.\n\nOnly then, Muhammad left the rostrum, and gave the order for the establishment of a tent in which Ali would sit to receive the allegiance oath of Muslims. Thousands of people, group by group, including women, went to him and saluted and congratulated him as Amir al-Mu'minin, commander of the faithful. Umar ibn Al-Khattab was the first to offer congratulations.\n\nOn the completion of Muhammad's sermon, Umar said, \"Congratulations to you, Ali! This morning has brought you a great blessing. Today you have become the Mawla of all believing men and women.\" At a later occasion when Umar was asked about his special treatment to Ali as compared to other companions, his reply was, \"He is my master.\" Shias believe that, with Muhammad's approbation he recited verses in honour of Ali. The verse are recorded in Ibn Shahrashoub and affirms that ʿAlī was named as the successor of Muhammad on the day of Ghadir Khum.\n\nMir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, writes in his book, \"Mawaddat al-Qurba\" in Mawadda 5, that many companions quoted Umar in different places as having said that Muhammad made Ali the chief and leader of the nation and that Muhammad announced publicly that Ali was their master. Umar was also quoted saying that on the day of that announcement, a handsome youth was sitting besides him and that the youth said to him, \"Surely, the Prophet has bound a covenant which none but a hypocrite would break. So Umar! Avoid breaking it.\" When Umar told Muhammad about the incident, Muhammad said that the youth was not of Adam's (Adem) progeny but was Gabriel (Jibril) and was stressing the point about Ali.\n\nIt is also reported that Abu Bakr said to Ali, \"Well done Ibn Abi Talib! Today you became the leader (Mawla) of all believing men and women.\" Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman are all said to have given their allegiance to Ali, a fact that is reported by both Shia and Sunni sources.\n\nThe word \"mawla\" is significant in the first narration of this hadith, and can refer to a leader, client, patron, friend, partner, ally or numerous other similar relationships. Twenty-seven (27) different meanings are given for the word \"mawla\" and hence the exact meaning should be derived from their syntactical and situational contexts.\n\nUnlike the words \"Imam, Ameer, Khalifah, Ulil-Amr, Sultan\" which are very clear words to describe leader, the word \"Mawla\" is more ambiguous. However, Shias argue that the context of the sermon makes it clear that the word Mawla is meant as leader. In addition, Muhammad did use the words \"Imam,\" \"Ameer,\" and \"Khalifah\" to describe Ali elsewhere in the sermon.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Prophet used many titles for Ali in the sermon. The words \"Wali,\" \"Mawla,\" and \"Imam\" were used over 27 times, indicating that Ali as the successor to Muhammad in a spiritual sense, as well as a political sense (as the word \"Khalifa\" was used three times in the sermon). Hence, the sermon established Ali's right as the political and spiritual successor to Muhammad.\n\nAccording to some, the event of Ghadir Khumm took place because of a dispute between Ali and two sahaba in Yemen prior to the Farewell Pilgrimage. When Muhammad found out about this dispute, he ordered his companions to never anger Ali. The dispute was thus resolved with Muhammad's statement before the Farewell Pilgrimage. This indicates that there was no need to gather over a hundred thousand people around to discuss the dispute after the pilgrimage, as the dispute had already been settled.\n\nThe event of Ghadir Khumm has been revealed in both Shia and Sunni sources. Narrators of the Hadith of Ghadir Khumm are many, including:\nThis Hadith is considered to be Hasan by many scholars, and some consider it Sahih. Furthermore, all Shia Hadith scholars, and some great Sunni scholars, consider this Hadith to be Mutawatir. Shia scholar Sheikh Abdul Hosein Amini collected all the references for the event of Ghadir Khum from Sunni sources and issued them together with all other reasons for this event in eleven volumes in of his book \"Al-Ghadir\".\n\nThe above hadith have been cited in various Sunni sources including:\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad, a gathering at Saqifah elected Abu Bakr, rather than Ali, to be the successor of Muhammad as the first Rashidun Caliph. This choice was disputed by some Muslims, who believed that Ali had been appointed as successor. This dispute led to the schism between Sunnis and Shias.\n\nAfter the First Fitnah, during the days of the Umayyad Caliphate, when Muawiyah arrived (in Mecca) during one of his pilgrimages, accordingly, Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas came to see him, and they happened to mention Ali. Muawiyah disparaged Ali. As a result, Sa`d became angry and said: \"You are speaking of this man! I have heard the Messenger of Allah—peace and salutation of Allah be upon him—declare (On the day of Ghadir): \"Of whomsoever I am the Mawla, then Ali is his Mawla.\" I have (also) heard him say: 'You Ali are to me in position that Harun was to Musa, except that there is no prophet after me (See Hadith of position).\" And I have heard him announce: \"Today I am indeed going to hand over the banner to a person who loves Allah and his Messenger, and Allah and his Messenger also loves him.\"\n\nShia Muslims celebrate the occasion of Muhammad declaring Ali as his successor on the 18th of Dhu al-Hijjah. Fasting, doing Ghusl (ritual bath), reciting the Du'a Nudba, and giving food to believers is among recommended practice of Eid al-Ghadeer. It is a public holiday in countries such as: Iran, India, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia,\nIraq, UAE, Yemen, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Syria, Turkey. The Shia Muslim also celebrate Eid Ghadir in Europe and Americas, among in: The U.S., England, Germany, France, and so on.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3852840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3852840", "title": "Tiridates I of Armenia", "text": "Tiridates I of Armenia\n\nTiridates I (, \"Trdat A\"; , \"Tīridāt\"; , \"Tiridátes\") was King of Armenia beginning in 53 AD and the founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63 AD. In an agreement to resolve the Roman–Parthian conflict in and over Armenia, Tiridates I (one of the brothers of Vologases I of Parthia) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor Nero in 66 AD; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a client kingdom, various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had de facto ceded Armenia to the Parthian Empire.\n\nIn addition to being a king, Tiridates I was also a Zoroastrian priest and was accompanied by other magi on his journey to Rome in 66 AD. In the early 20th century, Franz Cumont speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of Mithraism which became the main religion of the Roman Army and spread across the whole empire. Furthermore, during his reign, he started reforming the administrative structure of Armenia, a reform which was continued by his successors, and which brought many Iranian customs and offices into it.\n\nTiridates I is one of the principal characters in George Frideric Handel's opera \"Radamisto\" and Reinhard Keiser's opera \"Octavia.\"\n\nTiridates I was one of the sons born to Vonones II, king of Media Atropatene and later king of Parthia, by a Greek concubine. Virtually nothing is known about Tiridates' youth, which he spent in Media Atropatene. \"Tiridates\" means \"given by Tir\". Tir was the Armeno-Parthian god of literature, science and art based on the Avestan Tishtrya and fused with the Greek Apollo.\n\nIn 51 AD the Roman procurator of Cappadocia, Julius Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country, then under an Iberian usurper Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus had killed his uncle Mithridates, the legitimate king of Armenia, by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of Gornea.\nActing without instruction, Paelignus recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia. Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages, but he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia.\nIn 52 AD King Vologases I of Parthia took the opportunity to invade Armenia, conquering Artaxata (\"Artashat\" in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates I as king. This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor Augustus and Parthian king Phraates IV which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia. Vologases I considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime. A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son Vardanes forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the prince Tiridates I in early 55. Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river Araxes. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates I received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy. Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Pharasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power.\n\nUnhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings. A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given Lesser Armenia (Nicopolis and Satala) and Sohaemus of Emesa received Armenia Sophene. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and Antiochus IV of Commagene attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates I sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the Moschoi tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates I fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards Tigranocerta through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault. By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome.\n\nNero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the kings of Cappadocia, the grandson of Glaphyra (daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia) and Alexander of Judea (the brother of Herod Archelaus and the son of Herod the Great), who assumed the Armenian name Tigranes (his uncle was Tigranes V). His son, named Gaius Julius Alexander, married Iotapa, the daughter of Antiochus IV of Commagene and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country. Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including Polemon, Parasmanes, Aristobolus and Antiochus.\n\nVologases I was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the Hyrcanians who were revolting. Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene and deposed its King Monobazes in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians.\nVologases I considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates I to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of spahbod Moneses a well-disciplined force of cataphracts along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases I gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia. Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and Marcus Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the Euphrates and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.\n\nMoneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases I in Nisibis located from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases I agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace. Vologases I demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates I be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.\n\nPaetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the legions of XII \"Fulminata\" commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IV \"Scythica\" commanded by Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Lucius Annius Vinicianus to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.\n\nPrior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates I visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his wife and children and two of his brothers. His escort included an imposing retinue, comprising many feudal lords, several sages, 3,000 Parthian horsemen, and also a large number of Romans. His route lay across Thrace, through Illyria, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and Picenum, in northeastern Italy. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates I rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side. The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates I.\n\nCassius Dio, a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates I favorably at the time of his arrival: \"Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence.\" Nero greeted Tiridates I at Neapolis (Naples) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. \n\nAccording to Dio's account, Tiridates I refused to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). Nero was reportedly so impressed by this act that he ordered a gladiatorial games be staged in honor of his guest at Puteolis (present day Pozzuoli, near Naples). The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. Ethiopian women, men and children fought as gladiators and gladiatrices at the games to impress the Armenian king.\n\nThe climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.\nOn the day after Tiridates I's arrival, Nero came to the Forum clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates I and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the dais, Tiridates I knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates I addressed the emperor:\n\nTo which Nero replied:\n\nTiridates I then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A Praetor, speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek. According to Pliny the Elder, Tiridates I then introduced Nero to magian feasts (\"magicis cenis\"). Tacitus claimed that Tiridates I was also interested in all things Roman.\n\nPublic festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the Theatre of Pompey and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as \"the Golden Day.\" Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a chariot race. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with zither accompaniment. Tiridates I was amazed and disgusted by Nero's extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master. He made no concealment of his views to Nero's face and said to him sarcastically: \"Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo.\"\n\nIn memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of Imperator, or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates I and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates I of fifty million sesterces.\n\nOn his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates I viewed an exhibition of pancratium. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates I saw exclaimed: \"That's an unfair contest. It isn't fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.\"\n\nLater, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases I to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: \"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the visit of Tiridates I, an event that greatly impressed contemporaries, was adapted by Christians to become the story of the adoration of the Christ Child by the Three Magi. The Christian legend changed Rome into Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Ruler of the coming Kingdom of God, and replaced Tiridates I with that contemporary king who was already connected with Christianity through the Acts of St. Thomas: Gondophares, otherwise known as Kaspar.\n\nPeace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the Temple of Janus, which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates I returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor; he embellished the royal residence at Garni, nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome. Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero's death and through the entire duration of Vespasian's rule in the East. Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically. \n\nThe immediate dividend of the peace was Rome's ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the First Jewish–Roman War just one year after Tiridates' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible. Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians. The name of Legio XII Fulminata discovered carved on a mountain in Gobustan (in modern Azerbaijan), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the Caspian Sea in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription. The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor Trajan invaded Armenia in 114.\n\nIn 72 the Alans, a warlike nomadic Sarmatian tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates I and his brother Pacorus, King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates I was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene. The King of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from Vespasian, who helped reconstruct the fortress of Harmozica around the Iberian capital Mtskheta, near modern Tbilisi. An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates I also warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates I's reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor. It is known that Tiridates' nephew, Axidares, the son of Pacorus II of Parthia, was King of Armenia by 110.\n\nFranz Cumont in \"Les Réligions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain\" (\"The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism\") pointed out that Tiridates I was instrumental in the development of Mithraism in Rome, which ultimately became the most dominant Roman religion throughout the empire.\n\nTiridates I is one of the principal characters in George Frideric Handel's opera \"Radamisto\" and Reinhard Keiser's opera \"Octavia.\"\n\n\n"}

Sometimes a kiddush will be held at the synagogue for family and friends. Although ceremonies can be found in Ashkenazic sources. Rabbi Yacov Emden includes a text in his famous prayer book.\n\nIn the 20th century, interest in traditional ceremonies for welcoming baby girls has been revived, and new ceremonies have evolved. These ceremonies are often known under the newly coined terms \"simchat bat\" or a \"brit bat\". There is no explicit source in the Mishnah or Talmud specifying when girls should be named.\n\nIn medieval times, girls were named during \"shavua habat\" (lit. 'week of the daughter'). In early German Jewish communities, a baby naming ceremony was developed for both girls and boys called a \"Hollekreisch\" (of unknown derivation, possibly meaning 'secular shout'), in which the children received their secular names. The ritual took place after Shabbat lunch. The babies were dressed up, and boys were draped in a tallit. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) was placed in the crib. The crib would then be lifted up and the following recited in German: \"Hollekreisch! How shall the baby be called? So-and-so So-and-so So-and-so (i.e. his or her name three times).\" Nuts, sweets and fruits were then distributed to the guests. The custom applied to both boys (who had already received their Hebrew names at their brit mila) and girls. This ceremony was widely observed in Jewish circles in Germany as early as the 14th century. In the 17th century this custom was observed in naming boys and girls only in South Germany, while in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Poland it was not used for boys, and only rarely for girls.\n\nIn the Sephardi community the zeved habat is usually celebrated within the first month of the birth. It is held privately in the synagogue or at a party at home. It is often led by the \"ḥakhám\" or hazzan. The main elements of the ceremony are the mother's thanksgiving for deliverance (Birkat HaGomel); the recital of Song of Songs (and, in the case of the first daughter born to the mother, Song of Songs ); and the namegiving prayer itself in the form of \"Mi sheberakh (imoteinu)\" (see below). Additional elements may include Psalm 128 and the Priestly Blessing (Birkat kohanim).\n\nThe words in parentheses are recited in the Moroccan Jewish community.\n\nMany Ashkenazi communities use a prayer for the health of a mother and newborn, recited by someone called up to read from the Torah scroll, as an opportunity to name a baby girl.\n\nThe \"Simchat Bat\" (\"celebration of the daughter\") or \"Brit Bat\" (loosely, welcoming the new daughter into the covenant) are now becoming more common. The celebration typically consists of a communal welcoming, a naming done over a cup of wine with the quotation of appropriate Biblical verses, and traditional blessings.\n\n\"Moreh Derekh\", the Rabbi's manual of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, presents a ceremony based on traditional Jewish forms, with a number of options that parents may choose to perform: (A) Lighting seven candles (symbolizing the seven days of creation) and holding the baby towards them, (B) Wrapping the baby in the four corners of a tallit (Jewish prayer shawl), or (C) Lifting the baby and touching her hands to a Torah scroll.\n\n\n"}
