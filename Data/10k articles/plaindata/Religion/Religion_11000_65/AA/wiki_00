{"id": "8356104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8356104", "title": "Anthony B. Pinn", "text": "Anthony B. Pinn\n\nAnthony B. Pinn is an American professor working at the intersections of African-American religion, constructive theology, and humanist thought. Pinn is the Agnes Cullen Arnold Professor of Humanities and Professor of Religious Studies at Rice University. He is also the Founder and Executive Director of the Center for Engaged Research and Collaborative Learning in Houston, Texas, and Director of Research for the Institute for Humanist Studies in Washington, D.C. He earned his Ph.D. in the Study of Religion at Harvard University in 1994. His dissertation was entitled \"I Wonder as I Wonder: An Examination of the Problem of Evil in African-American Religious Thought.\" The topic of theological responses to evil and suffering in Black religion provided the foundation of Pinn's early work. Today, Pinn's research interests span theory and method in the study of religion, black religious aesthetics, religion and popular culture, and African-American humanism.\n\nThroughout his work, Pinn refers to his approach to humanism as a \"religion.\" In so doing, Pinn cites humanist Gordon Kaufman's definition of religion as \"that which helps humans find orientation ‘for life in the world, together with motivation for living and acting in accordance with this orientation.’\" In other words, for Pinn, religion need not be theistic.\n\nIn \"Why Lord?\", Pinn's humanism \"involves an increase in humanity's importance which makes impossible the location of a space for God.\" He continues, \"Religious answers to life's meaninglessness promote an embracing of suffering which reinforces life's meaninglessness rather than ending it.\" In other work, however, Pinn moderates this claim. In a 1997 essay, Pinn describes humanism as another contribution to the plurality of religious traditions. In \"Varieties of African American Religious Experience\" (1999), he acknowledges that \"the needs of various human communities are complex and varied enough to allow for a plurality of religious traditions.\" In a 2002 interview, Pinn states that the Black Church, although in crisis, \"has tremendous potential\" for addressing the social justice issues that affect African Americans. Although Pinn's work reaches into non-Christian sources of theology, much of his academic focus remains centered on the history and theology of the African-American Christian Church.\n\nImportantly, Pinn differentiates Black humanism from other non-theistic worldviews such as atheism. Citing the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and Richard Wright, Pinn notes that Black humanism has no interest in disproving the existence of God. Rather, it is \"not overly concerned with God as a negative myth, but rather God as a liberating myth that is nonetheless unsubstantiated.\" Thus, oppressed African Americans need not waste their time disproving God's existence, but are simply better off seeking their liberation with the human tools of \"desire for transformation, human creativity, physical strength, and untapped collective potential.\"\n\nThis \"full human potential\" is capable of analyzing and working to rectify problems of oppression in the African-American community.\n\nIn \"Why Lord? Suffering and Evil in Black Theology\" (1995), Anthony Pinn establishes himself as a black theologian and Black humanist. In \"Why Lord?\", Pinn seeks to critique various responses found within Black religion to the question of theodicy, or God's role in the suffering of humanity. His critique is based on the ultimate goal of Black liberation. Pinn cites John Hick's options for \"the resolution of the problem of evil,\" which are the following: \"(1) a rethinking of the nature/purpose of evil; or, (2) the postulating of a 'limited' God; or, (3) a questioning/denial of God's existence.\"\n\nThe solutions that Black theology has formally articulated, Pinn argues, have essentially been limited to the first two options. All theodicean arguments following the first approach are not useful in the struggle for the liberation of oppressed people because, to varying degrees, they all rely on the concept of redemptive suffering.\n\nPinn considers these arguments \"unacceptable because they counteract efforts at liberation by finding something of value in Black suffering.\" He places the work of James H. Cone, an early promulgator of Black theology, in the first category. Although Cone refuses to accept Black suffering as God's will, he nonetheless embraces suffering which Blacks incur as a result of resistance to oppression. Pinn rejects this distinction between positive and negative suffering, which he calls purely academic. Instead, a Black theology of liberation must characterize suffering \"as unquestionably and unredeemably evil.\"\n\nPinn follows the thinking of existentialist writer Albert Camus, who rejects theodicean arguments for God limiting God's own intervention, arguing that \"if God is omnipotent and permits human suffering, then God is a murderer.\" Theodicean arguments based on the postulating of a limited God, as presented by William R. Jones and Delores Williams, are not valid at all, as Pinn questions the efficacy and worth of worship and action in the service of a limited, ultimately ineffective deity.\n\nRather, Pinn proposes that Black theologians examine the third theodicean solution: the questioning or denial of God's existence. In this approach, Pinn draws on William R. Jones’ important work \"Is God a White Racist?\" (1998), which questions God's goodness. He ultimately takes this point farther than Jones, arguing that if God exists and is self-limiting in God's support for Black liberation, as Jones concludes, God is indeed a racist.\n\nPinn describes his approach as fundamentally pragmatic: where faith in God entails a justification of human suffering, he \"would rather lose God than human value.\" James H. Cone writes that \"Black theology must relate itself to the human situation unique to oppressed persons generally and blacks particularly. If black theology fails to do this adequately, then the black community will and should destroy it.\"\n\nTo this end, Pinn advocates a position of \"strong humanism,\" a non-theistic religion that concerns itself, above all, with human life, while rejecting the existence of God.\nIn 2017 Pinn published a book, \"When Colorblindness Isn't the Answer: Humanism and the Challenge of Race,\" on why humanists should embrace racial justice.\n\nPinn draws on a variety of historical traditions in the formation of his religion of Black humanism. Examples from Black folk stories and jokes, spirituals, blues, rap, and political discourse form the basis of Pinn's work. In his analysis of these diverse sources, Pinn employs what he terms \"nitty-gritty hermeneutics,\" an approach to theological thought that is constructed from the hard realities of human experience, unconfined by a need to fit into preconceived Christian doctrines. In other words, nitty-gritty hermeneutics privilege solutions to the problem of oppression over the maintenance of religious tradition.\n\nHe suggests that this approach is already widespread within hip-hop music, citing lyrics and quotes from Salt-n-Pepa, NWA, Dr. Dre, Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five, KRS-One, and Chuck D, all of which seek to describe the harsh realities of life. Essentially, Pinn attempts to transform the language of rap music, which expresses nitty-gritty theology on a popular level, into professional theology, acceptable to academia.\n\nIn his analysis of often overtly Christian sources, Pinn finds meaningful support for the historical legitimacy of Black humanism. The tradition of spirituals, communally composed by African slaves in the United States, provides an early study in Black theodicy, questioning the purpose of slaves’ suffering. He quotes Daniel Payne, a leader in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, who in 1839 wrote about the extent to which slaves, aware of the hypocrisy of their Christian masters, \"distrust both the goodness and justice of God.\" In a telling example, Pinn quotes a runaway slave, who said he was not a Christian because \"white men treat us so bad in Mississippi that we can’t be Christians.\" Pinn also finds critiques of God's efficacy in Riggin Earl's \"Brer Rabbit\" stories, slave folklore that portrays God as weak or comical, and blues and rap music that seek worldly solutions and reject theistic religion. Pinn also refers to humanism among African Americans within the American Communist and Civil Rights struggles of the 20th century. Academic sources for Black humanism include Richard Wright and Nella Larsen. Pinn cites Wright's rejection, in the 1940 novel \"Native Son\", of religion's solutions to \"life's complexity and absurdity,\" which \"promote an embracing of suffering which reinforces life's meaninglessness rather than ending it.\" He affirms Larsen's conclusion, asserted in her 1928 novel \"Quicksand\", that God's failure to deliver humans from suffering means that oppressed people must overcome \"through human strength, but without guarantee of success.\"\n\nIn \"Anybody There? Reflections on African American Humanism,\" Pinn acknowledges the importance of the work of theologians such as James H. Cone in the 1960s and 70s. He states that Cone's early writings, which presented theological arguments for Black power and liberation, ultimately became part of the separation between the Christian-based Civil Rights Movement and the more radical Black Power movement.\n\nIn \"Varieties of African-American Religious Experience\", Pinn considers a wide range of non-Christian theological sources, including \"Voodoo, Orisha devotion, Santeria, the Nation of Islam, and Black Humanism,\" and advocates a broader understanding of African-American \"sources, norms, and doctrines\" beyond the Protestant church.\n\nBook Series:\n\nEncyclopedias:\n\nMonographs:\n\nEdited Volumes:\n\nJournal Special Issues:\n"}

He was the son of the Persian satrap of Phrygia, Pharnabazus, and younger kinsman (most probably his brother) of Ariobarzanes of Phrygia who revolted against Artaxerxes II around 356 BC.\n\nIn 362 BC, Artabazos was sent by Artaxerxes II to capture Datames, the satrap of Cappadocia, who had joined in the Satraps' revolt by Artabazus' brother, Ariobarzanes. However, Artabazos was defeated by Datames.\n\nFollowing the capture and death of his brother, Artabazos was made satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, but in 356 BC he refused obedience to the Persian king, Artaxerxes III. Artabazos then became involved in a revolt against the king and against other satraps who acknowledged the authority of Artaxerxes III.\n\nArtabazos was at first supported by Chares, an Athenian general, and his mercenaries, whom he rewarded very generously. Later, Artabazos was also supported by the Thebans, who sent him 5,000 men under Pammenes. With the assistance of these and other allies, Artabazos defeated his enemies in two great battles.\n\nHowever, Artaxerxes III was later able to deprive Artabazos of his Athenian and Boeotian allies, whereupon Artabazos was defeated by the king's general, Autophradates, and was taken prisoner. Mentor and Memnon, two brothers-in-law of Artabazos, who had supported him, still continued the revolt, as they were aided by the Athenian mercenary leader, Charidemus. Together they were able to free Artabazos.\n\nAfter this, Artabazos seems either to have continued his rebellious operations or at least started a fresh revolt. However, eventually, he had no choice but to flee with Memnon and his family. They went into exile and took refuge with Philip II of Macedonia.\n\nDuring the absence of Artabazos, Mentor, his brother-in-law, was of great service to the king of Persia in his war against Nectanebo II of Egypt. After the close of this war, in the summer of 342 BC, Artaxerxes gave Mentor the command against the rebellious satraps of western Asia. Mentor took advantage of this opportunity to ask the king to grant a pardon to Artabazos and Memnon. The king agreed and both men and their families were able to return to Persia.\n\nIn the subsequent reign of Darius III Codomannus, Artabazos distinguished himself by his loyalty and commitment to the new Persian king. He took part in the Battle of Gaugamela, and afterwards accompanied Darius on his flight from Alexander's Macedonian armies. After the final defeat and death of Darius III in 330 BC, Alexander recognised and rewarded Artabazos for his loyalty to the Persian king by giving him the satrapy of Bactria.\n\nArtabazos' daughter, Barsine, may have married Alexander and may have been the mother of Heracles. Another daughter, Artacama, was given in marriage to Ptolemy; and a third daughter, Artonis, was given in marriage to Eumenes. In 328 BC, Artabazos resigned his satrapy, which was given to Cleitus.\n\nArtabazos had a son named Pharnabazus (fl. 370 - 320 BC).\n\n\n"}

It opposes some decisions of the Second Vatican Council and aspects of ecumenism and interreligious dialogue practised by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Holy See.\n\nThe Society also opposes the replacement of the traditional Church Slavonic language by the vernacular Ukrainian language in the liturgy, and opposes liturgical de-latinisation, the removal of Latin Rite practices such as Eucharistic adoration, the Rosary, and the Stations of the Cross, which had been adopted within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.\n\nOn 10 February 2004, Cardinal Lubomyr Husar, Archbishop of Lviv and Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, declared that Kovpak, through his close links to the SSPX, had incurred excommunication by \"recognis(ing) the uncanonical foreign Bishop Bernard Fellay, who does not recognise the authority of the Pope of Rome and is not united with the Catholic Church.\" Kovpak denied that he recognised Bishop Fellay as his own canonical bishop, and declared his intention to appeal to the Vatican.

In it, he charged that bishops have harassed traditional Greek Catholic priests and refused Ukrainian laity Holy Communion because of the laity insisting on kneeling for it.\n\nHe also accused the UGCC leaders of having publicly posed for photographs and conducted interreligious payer meetings with Buddhists and Hare Krishnas.

It was founded in 1971.\n\nHaving begun in April 1971, Christians for Socialism first gained notoriety when a collection of eighty Chilean priests, known as the \"Group of 80\", publicly declared their support of the construction of socialism along the lines being followed by then-President Salvador Allende. The Secretariat of Christians for Socialism was formally established in September 1973. The group was predominantly composed of Roman Catholic members of the Christian left who were inspired and spurred on by the Second Vatican Council.\n\nCPS was founded to counteract a presumption that Christian institutions were inherently opposed to socialism. While its founders found aspects of socialist programs that they wished to critique, they wanted to do so as insiders within the socialist movement, rather than as adversaries. From their beginnings as supporters of Allende, CPS has been associated with firm support for socialist leaders. Accordingly, CPS leaders cultivated strong ties with Cuban Marxist politician Fidel Castro. It was intended as a movement of active political involvement and participation, and involved discussions bringing together current political events and church documents in light of each other. CPS inspired a series of social programs in the public sector. Priests in CPS led union units and organized peasant federations.\n\nIn Chile the immediate antecedent to CPS was the \"\" movement. In Italy, many of the young people who had been involved in the Italian student and worker protests of 1968 joined the movement, and the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI) was very supportive.\n\nLópez Trujillo considers a major leader of CPS. Another prominent leader was the Salesian priest , who was also a significant figure in the Italian Catholic resistance during World War II. In Spain, Alfonso Carlos Comín was a key leader in establishing the movement. The theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez was also a member and led sessions at all the major conferences.\n\nCPS faced opposition from the start. Left-leaning priests from Brazil and Bolivia were supportive but unable to participate in gatherings due to severe police control. CPS was short-lived in Chile, due to strong resistance from the Episcopal Conference of Chile under the direction of its secretary general, bishop Carlos Oviedo Cavada. In their letter condemning the movement, the bishops there argued that while the church speaks to \"politics insofar as it underlies every social reality\", it should not be involved in \"partisan activity\". Chilean clergy involved in the movement were banned from political participation altogether in April 1973. The movement was suppressed by the Chilean military government after the coup of 1973. Father , one of the most active members of CPS, left Chile at this time.\n\nA number of important gatherings have been held under the auspices of Christians for Socialism. In 1972, 400 members met for a week at a textile union hall, urging \"class struggle [as] the only valid course to necessary social change in Latin America.\" CPS brought together similar Latin American movements in the Latin American Meeting of Christians for Socialism 1974 in Santiago, Chile.\n\nIn 1975, the Christians for Socialism conference in Detroit, Michigan, formally introduced liberation theology to the United States. This event was a significant convergence where black, feminist, and third-world anti-imperialist movements joined together and recognized each other as peers in the same process of liberation, while also strongly critiquing one another. A detailed account of the meeting was published.\n\nChristians for Socialism groups sprung up in France, Italy, and West Germany. In Germany, CPS was a radical rival to Enlightenment liberalism and \"German idealism's aspirations to freedom\".\n\nThe CPS group has as fundamental milestone the celebration of its annual conferences that are held in Spain, alternately in Madrid and Barcelona. CPS has a presence mainly in Madrid, Catalonia, Menorca and with individuals in different autonomous communities, such as Andalusia, Galicia, Aragon and others.\nAt present, the CPS group remains within a larger movement called \"Christian Networks\", as a critical and reflective encounter in relation to the church, society, and politics.\n\nIn the United States, Christians for Socialism was most active through the 1970s and early 1980s. After the election of Ronald Reagan, the movement lost some of its momentum and disbanded. However, in January 2018, Christians for Socialism: North America restarted its struggle for a Christian left organized around the same ideas from the movement started in Chile in 1972.\n\nLópez Trujillo has critiqued CPS for holding an understanding of liberation too strongly influenced by Marxist political theory rather than the integral Christian liberation stance espoused by the Latin American Episcopal Conference. It has been said that for some members of Christians for Socialism, there is \"no salvation incarnate outside of class struggle.\"\n\n"}

These deities and stories have similar elements and characteristics when compared to other mythologies, especially in Asia and Oceania. As the majority of pre-colonial societies in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization viewed everything in balance, many gods and goddesses of these societies were depicted to possess both female and male personifications or the personifications of an opposite gender, in line with the same gender balance personifications in many indigenous mythologies in Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. These \"shared beliefs\" in balancing gender personifications upholds the theory that some Southeast Asians migrated towards Oceania and later towards the Americas bringing with them portions of their culture.\n\nAncient Philippine mythology varies among the many indigenous tribes of the Philippines. During the pre-Spanish era, some tribes believed in a single supreme being who created the world and everything in it, along with lesser deities. Others worshipped a multitude of trees in a form of animism. Below are some of the gods and goddesses of the various ancient Philippine ethnic groups:\n\nThis section includes Ancient Tagalog deities from a certain pantheon story. The ancient Tagalog people used to cover the following: present-day Calabarzon region except the Polilo Islands, northern Quezon, Alabat island, the Bondoc Peninsula, and easternmost Quezon; Marinduque; Bulacan except for its eastern part; and southwest Nueva Ecija, as much of Nueva Ecija used to be a vast rainforest where numerous nomadic ethnic groups stayed and left. When the Kingdom of Tondo expanded its domain, swallowing the Bicol region except Masbate and Catanduanes, the entire Central Luzon region, Nueva Viscaya, La Union, and Benguet, the Tagalogs remained in their core zones and did not impose a migration policy. during When the Kingdom of Tondo fell due to the Spanish the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This was continued by the Americans when they defeated Spain in a war. There have been attempts to restore the Tagalog indigenous religion as the religion for the Tagalog people.\n\nThe territories where the ancient Tagalog pantheon was worshipped were the areas that were under Tagalog-majority influence prior to the biggest expansion of the Kingdom of Tondo. During that time, Hindu influences in customs and traditions were present due to trade with other Asian independent or vassal states. The first part as shown below are the residents of Kaluwalhatian (the abode of the gods, roughly corresponding to the Christian idea of Heaven). The term, \"anito\", has three meanings. The first is deity (gods and goddesses including Bathala and the lower deities living and not living in Kaluwalhatian. The second is non-ancestral spirits, the beings sent by Bathala along with the deities to aid mankind in everyday life. These non-ancestral spirit anitos can be formless or possess forms of various beings. The last is ancestral spirits, the souls of human beings who have passed on. These ancestral spirit anitos can also be summoned by Bathala to aid their relatives and descendants in special cases, usually through dreams or flickers of light. Aside from the anitos, there are also beings lower than them. These beings are diverse in forms and are considered as monsters (example is the aswang) and/or guardians (example is the tikbalang) that roam the world along with mankind. These beings usually reside within the confines of nature, but when disturbed, can inflicts severe damages to man and even cause death. Tagalogs who had spiritual prowess to contact the deities and anitos were known as \"katolanon\". The \"katolanon\", being the spiritual leader and personified contact to the deities, also assumed the role of the \"datu\" if the \"datu\" has not yet returned from his travels. He also acts as the \"datu\" during transition periods, where the official \"datu\" (leader) has yet to be chosen. Like the \"datu\", the \"katolanon\" may be male or female. Katolanon may choose to have a wife or husband as partner with his or her spiritual activities, regardless of gender. The \"katolanon\", male or female, usually has a female gender expression, according to Spanish accounts. The reason for this is because a female expression is the embodiment of natural spiritual balance, and is pleasing to the Tagalog deities. In times when certain barangays choose to establish a unification pact with other barangays, the datus of each barangay will vote among themselves who will be considered as the \"lakan\" (also known as punong datu), which is regarded as the head of all the datus within the pact. To establish the pact, a sandugo or blood compact is made. The katolanan of the datu, that was made into lakan, is also uplifted into the title of punong katalonan (head katolanan).\n\nOther definitions\nThe list includes the god/goddess-like, residents of Kasamaan (Ancient Tagalog counterpart of Hell), which is known as a 'village of grief and afflication'. They were the evil entities all opposed to Bathala and the rest of his deities. Kasamaan, also known as Kasanaan, is also the place where the spirits of evil humans are sent. In contrast, the spirits of good humans are sent to Maca. But whether a person died evil or good, he or she is still given the \"pabaon\" ritual, where the dead is given gifts that he or she may use in his or her journey to Maca or Kasamaan.\n\nThe list includes the gods and goddesses who don't have a unified pantheon within the Tagalog deities mentioned in Table #1. Many of following deities live with mankind in the middle world, except for the children of Bathala.\n\nOverall, everything in nature is considered as sacred in Tagalog mythology, from caves, rivers, seas, lakes, mountains, trees, wind, sky, and so on. Other sacred sites also include Tagalog places of death (ancient cemeteries), and temples (usually in the form of forts or enlarged huts with palisades). Usually, these sites are areas where the deities frequent, and thus serve as both a place of worship and a place for recharging the body and a person's amulet, known as anting-anting. The sites are also usually home to certain anitos (not diwatas, as research has concluded that the term diwata was used by the pre-colonial Visayans and Ibalons, not the pre-colonial Tagalogs) or the ancestral spirits and spirits sent by Bathala to aid mankind. The following are traditionally considered as the most sacred, and still are, among the sites:\n\n\nThe list includes the deities of ancient Bikolanos living in Ibalon (present Bicol Region).\n\nThis section includes the deities of the Visayans from a certain pantheon story.\n\nThe list includes the gods and goddesses who haven't have a unified pantheon within the Visayan deities mentioned in Table #5.\n\n\nThe list of Ilokano deities below is from Llamzon (1978:38).\n\n\nThe Ilokanos also believed in the following \"anito\" (spirits).\n\n\nOther mythological creatures are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also lesser gods in the Batak pantheon, some of whom are Siabuanan, Bankakah, Paraen, Buengelen, and Baybayen. They are deities of great strength.\n\n\n\n\nThe spiritual world of the Isneg is populated by more than 300 anito (spirits) who assume various forms. There are actually no gods or hierarchical deities in the otherworld of the Isneg, only good or bad spirits.\n\n\nThere are spirits who come to help the reapers in gathering the harvest. They are known as Abad, Aglalannawan, Anat, Binusilan, Dawiliyan, Dekat, Dumingiw, Imbanon, Gimbanona, Ginalinan, Sibo, and a group of sky dwellers collectively known as the Ilanit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four manifestations of the \"great creator\" who rules the world: Tigbalog is the source of life and action; Lueve takes care of production and growth; Amas moves people to pity, love, unity, and peace of heart; while Binangewan is responsible for change, sickness, and death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the gods and goddesses, ancient Filipinos also worshiped numerous forest deities known as diwatas (Filipinos counterpart of nymphs/enchanter or enchantress). There is a multitude of diwatas in the Philippine mythology and folklore, but this section includes only the list of well-known.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "23005824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23005824", "title": "Epithets of Jupiter", "text": "Epithets of Jupiter\n\nThe numerous epithets of Jupiter indicate the importance and variety of the god's cult in ancient Roman religion.\n\nJupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult are those of the state. The most important of his sanctuaries in Rome were located on the Capitoline Hill \"(Mons Capitolinus)\", earlier \"Tarpeius\". The Mount had two peaks, each devoted to acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher peak was the citadel \"(arx).\" On the \"arx\" was located the observation place of the augurs (the \"auguraculum)\", to which the monthly procession of the \"sacra Idulia\" was directed. On the southern peak was the most ancient sanctuary of the god, traditionally said to have been built by Romulus: this was the shrine of \"Iuppiter Feretrius\", which was restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (\"silex\"). The most ancient known rites, those of the \"spolia opima\" and of the fetials, connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus, and are dedicated to \"Iuppiter Feretrius\" or \"Iuppiter Lapis\". From this earliest period, the concept of the sky god encompassed the ethical and political domain.\n\n\"Juppiter Tonans\" (\"Thundering Jove\") was the aspect (\"numen\") of Jupiter venerated in the Temple of Juppiter Tonans, which was vowed in 26 BCE by Augustus and dedicated in 22 on the Capitoline Hill; the Emperor had narrowly escaped being struck by lightning during the campaign in Cantabria. An old temple in the Campus Martius had long been dedicated to Juppiter Fulgens. The original cult image installed in the sanctuary by its founder was by Leochares, a Greek sculptor of the 4th century BCE. The sculpture at the Prado is considered to be a late 1st-century replacement commissioned by Domitian. The Baroque-era restoration of the arms gives Jupiter a baton-like scepter in his raised hand.\n\nAmong Jupiter's most ancient epithets is \"Lucetius\", interpreted as referring to light \"(lux, lucis)\", specifically sunlight, by ancient and some modern scholars such as Wissowa. The \"Carmen Saliare\", however, indicates that it refers to lightning. To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet \"Elicius\": while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the \"Nudipedalia\", meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter. and the ritual of the \"lapis manalis\", the stone which was brought into the city through the Porta Capena and carried around in times of drought, which was named \"Aquaelicium\".\n\nOther early epithets connected with the amospheric quality of Jupiter are \"Pluvius\", \"Imbricius\", \"Tempestas\", \"Tonitrualis\", \"tempestatium divinarum potens\", \"Serenator\", \"Serenus\" and, referred to lightning, \"Fulgur\", \"Fulgur Fulmen\", later as nomen agentis \"Fulgurator\", \"Fulminator\": the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form \"Fulgur\" and the use of the term for the \"bidental\", the lightningwell dug on the spot hit by a lightningbolt.\n\nA group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine. The agricultural ones include \"Opitulus\", \"Almus\", \"Ruminus\", \"Frugifer\", \"Farreus\", \"Pecunia\", \"Dapalis\", \"Epulo\". Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: \"Opitulus\" because he brings \"opem\" (means, relief) to the needy, \"Almus\" because he nourishes everything, \"Ruminus\" because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, \"Pecunia\" because everything belongs to him.\n\nDumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet \"Ruminus\", as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including \"Rumina\", \" Ruminalis ficus\", \"Iuppiter Ruminus\", which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. \"Rumach\" Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, \"Ruma\", meant in fact woman's breast. Diva Rumina, as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the \"ficus ruminalis\" and was offered only libations of milk. Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by Quintus Valerius Soranus, while hypothesising \"Iuno\" (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i. e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than \"Iuppiter\": \"Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...\".\n\nIn Dumézil's opinion \"Farreus\" should be understood as related to the rite of the \"confarreatio\" the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.\n\nThe epithet \"Dapalis\" is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus. Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as \"summus\". The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the \"epulum Iovis\", from which the god derives the epithet of \"Epulo\" and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.\n\nEpithets related to warring are in Wissowa' s view \"Iuppiter Feretrius\", \"Iuppiter Stator\", \"Iuppiter Victor\" and \"Iuppiter Invictus\". \"Feretrius\" would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of \"spolia opima\" which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king: a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.\n\n\"Iuppiter Stator\" was first attributed by tradition to Romulus, who pledged to build a temple in his honor in exchange for his almighty help at a critical moment in the final battle of the war with King Titus Tatius of the Sabines. Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul Marcus Atilius Regulus vowed a temple to \"Iuppiter Stator\" if \"Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...\". in a similar manner one can explain the epithet \"Victor\", whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of Sentinum by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges and who received another vow again in 293 by consul Lucius Papirius Cursor before a battle against the Samnite \"legio linteata\". Here too the religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by the Roman chief at a time when as a chief he needs divine help from the supreme god, even though for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the \"devotio\" of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i. e. was religiously reprehensible.\n\nMore recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of \"Stator\" within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of Janus, at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover January sees also the presence of Veiovis who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of Carmenta who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, \"Prorsa\" and \"Postvorta\" (also named Antevorta and Porrima), of Iuturna, who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter \"Stator\", who plays the role of anti-Janus, i. e. of moderator of the action of Janus.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the alphabetical list of epithets listed below are those compiled by Carl Thulin for the 1890 \"Paulys Real Encyclopädie\". The abbreviation \"O.M.\" stands for \"Optimus Maximus\", one of the most common epithets for Jupiter.\n\nSt. Augustine names eleven epithets of Jupiter in his work \"De civitate Dei\".\n\n\nThe cult of \"Iuppiter Latiaris\" was the most ancient known cult of the god : it was practised since very remote times on the top of the \"Mons Albanus\" on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League, which was under the hegemony of Alba Longa.\n\nAfter the destruction of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken. The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the senate to inquire into it was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requiring the Albans to perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (\"nundinae\"). However a plague ensued: in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightningbolt. The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.\n\nThe \"feriae Latinae\", or \"Latiar\" as they were known originally, were the common festival (\"panegyris\") of the so-called Priscan Latins and of the Albans. Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual: the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to heaven and is very widespread. At the \"Latiar\" the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king Latinus, in battle against Mezentius the king of Caere: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy. The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as \"carnem petere\". Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (\"quadrigae\") was held starting from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth. This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the vajapeya: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of \"madhu\", i. e. \"soma\". The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to Niebuhr, one day for each of the six Latin and Alban \"decuriae\". According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival (the listed names too differ in Pliny NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The \"Latiar\" became an important feature of Roman political life as they were \"feriae conceptivae\", i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed irritually the \"Latiar\" had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the decemvirs.\nWissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the triumph: since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed there first with the same legal features as in Rome.\n\n\"Arcanus\" was the epithet of one of the Jupiters worshipped at Praeneste. His theology and cult are strictly connected to that of the \"Fortuna Primigenia\" worshipped in the famous sanctuary there. He is the protector of the lots \"sortes\" stored in the \"arca\", whence his epithet. G. Dumézil attempted a purely Indoeuropean interpretation of the theology of Fortuna and of her relationship with Juppiter and Juno, other scholars see the subcessive accretion of a Greek-Etruscan and then a later Greek influence on Fortuna and the theological structure underlying her relationship to Jupiter, i. .e. earlier the child and then the parent of Fortuna. Jacqueline Champeaux interprets the boy represented on the \"cista\" of the 3rd century BC from Praeneste, now at the Archaeological Museum of Villa Giulia in Rome, as Jupiter \"puer\" and \"arcanus\": the image engraved on it represents a boy sitting in a cave, reading a lot inscribed on a tablet. This might be a mythic illustration of the working of the oracle, in which Jupiter is at one time the child (\"puer\") who ritually draws the rods of the lots (here while deciphering one) and their keeper, \"arcanus\".\n\nThe \"sortes\" of Praeneste were inscribed on rods of chestnut wood: they had sprung out of earth fully inscribed when a certain Numerius Suffustius cut the earth open with his spade, under the indication of some dreams.\n\nA different interpretation of the epithet is directly connected to the word \"arx\", which designates the political, military and religious centre of ancient Italic towns. Thus Iuppiter Arcanus is the god of the \"arx\" of Praeneste. This interpretation is supported by numerous inscriptions found on the area around the local \"arx\", sited on the summit of Monte Ginestro (m. 752), which dominates the town. The wall in \"opus polygonale\" climbed from the town to surround the \"arx\": epigraphs attest the cults of Iuppiter Arcanus and Mars.\n\nThe god was venerated in a sanctuary at the mountain pass between Umbria and Marche now named Scheggia Pass, about eight miles North-East of Iguvium along the Via Flaminia, on Mount Petrara. He had a famous oracle there which gave his \"responsa\" by means of \"sortes\" (lots). Its reputation was great during the Empire and it was consulted by emperor Aurelian. Dedications have been excavated on the place and in Algeria on the top of a hill near Philippeville. Claudian mentions the oracle in his description of the travel of Honorius from Fanum Fortunae.\n\nAs was the case for the sanctuary of \"Iuppiter Poeninus\" on the Great St. Bernard, the mountain pass held a religious significance as a point of communication between different geographic areas, a passage to a different and unknown world that required a religious protection for the traveller.\n\nJupiter was worshipped also under the epithets of \"Imperator Maximus\" in Praeneste, \"Maius\" in Tusculum, \"Praestes\" in Tibur, \" Indiges\" at Lavinium and \"Anxurus\" at Anxur (now Terracina), where he was represented as a young man without beard.\n\nIn Umbro-Oscan areas he was \"Iuve Grabovius\" in the Iguvine Tables, \"Iuppiter Cacunus\" (of the top of mountains, cf. Latin \"cacumen\" and \"Iuppiter Culminalis\"), \"Iuppiter Liber\" (see section on \"Liber\" above), \"Diuve Regature\" in the Table of Agnone that Vetter interprets as \"Rigator\", he who irrigates, and Dumézil as \"Rector\", he who rules and \"Diuve Verehasus\" tentatively rendered by Vetter as \"Vergarius\".\n\n"}

{"id": "772119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772119", "title": "Household deity", "text": "Household deity\n\nA household deity is a deity or spirit that protects the home, looking after the entire household or certain key members. It has been a common belief in pagan religions as well as in folklore across many parts of the world.\n\nHousehold deities fit into two types; firstly, a specific deity - typically a goddess - often referred to as a hearth goddess or domestic goddess who is associated with the home and hearth, with examples including the Greek Hestia and Norse Frigg.\n\nThe second type of household deities are those that are not one singular deity, but a type, or species of animistic deity, who usually have lesser powers than major deities. This type was common in the religions of antiquity, such as the Lares of ancient Roman religion, the Gashin of Korean shamanism, and Cofgodas of Anglo-Saxon paganism. These survived Christianisation as fairy-like creatures existing in folklore, such as the Anglo-Scottish Brownie and Slavic Domovoy.\n\nHousehold deities were usually worshipped not in temples but in the home, where they would be represented by small idols (such as the teraphim of the Bible, often translated as \"household gods\" in Genesis 31:19 for example), amulets, paintings or reliefs. They could also be found on domestic objects, such as cosmetic articles in the case of Tawaret. The more prosperous houses might have a small shrine to the household god(s); the lararium served this purpose in the case of the Romans. The gods would be treated as members of the family and invited to join in meals, or be given offerings of food and drink.\n\nIn many religions, both ancient and modern, a god would preside over the home.\n\nCertain species, or types, of household deities existed. An example of this was the Roman Lares.\n\nMany European cultures retained house spirits into the modern period. Some examples of these include:\n\n\nAlthough the cosmic status of household deities was not as lofty as that of the Twelve Olympians or the Aesir, they were also jealous of their dignity and also had to be appeased with shrines and offerings, however humble. Because of their immediacy they had arguably more influence on the day-to-day affairs of men than the remote gods did. Vestiges of their worship persisted long after Christianity and other major religions extirpated nearly every trace of the major pagan pantheons, and indeed, they continue even today, in one form or another (and in fact may have taken on some of their own, including statues to various saints, such as St. Francis to protect a garden, or gargoyles in older churches).\n\nFor centuries Christianity fought a mop-up war against these lingering minor pagan deities, but they proved tenacious. For example, Martin Luther's \"Tischreden\" have numerous quite serious references to dealing with kobolds. Eventually rationalism and the industrial revolution threatened to erase most of these minor deities, until the advent of romantic nationalism rehabilitated them and embellished them into objects of literary curiosity in the 19th century. Since the 20th century this literature has been mined for characters for role-playing games, video games, and other fantasy personae, not infrequently invested with invented traits and hierarchies somewhat different from their mythological and folkloric roots.\n\nThe general dynamics of the origin and development of household deities over a considerable span may be traced and exemplified by the historically attested origins and current practices of the Shinto belief system in Japan. As the British Japanologist Lafcadio Hearn put it:\n\nDrawing the picture with broader strokes, he continues:\nFurthermore,\n\nMany Japanese houses still have a shrine (\"kamidana\", kami shelf) where offerings are made to ancestral kami, as well as to other kami.\n\nEdward Burnett Tylor, one of the main founders of the discipline of cultural anthropology, spoke of \"survivals\", vestiges of earlier evolutionary stages in a culture's development. He also coined the term animism. Tylor disagreed with Herbert Spencer, another founder of anthropology, as well as of sociology, about the innateness of the human tendency towards animistic explanations, but both agreed that ancestor worship was the root of religion and that domestic deities were survivals from such an early stage.\n\nIn contradistinction to both Herbert Spencer and Edward Burnett Tylor, who defended theories of animistic origins of ancestor worship, Émile Durkheim saw its origin in totemism. In reality this distinction is somewhat academic, since totemism may be regarded as particularized manifestation of animism, and something of a synthesis of the two positions was attempted by Sigmund Freud. In Freud's Totem and Taboo, both totem and taboo are outward expressions or manifestations of the same psychological tendency, a concept which is complementary to, or which rather reconciles, the apparent conflict. Freud preferred to emphasize the psychoanalytic implications of the reification of metaphysical forces, but with particular emphasis on its familial nature. This emphasis underscores, rather than weakens, the ancestral component.\n\nThe doyen of European folklorists Jacob Grimm did not hesitate to equate the Roman lar familiaris to the brownie. He explains in some detail in his Deutsche Mythologie:\n\nTo underscore the equivalence of brownie, kobold and goblin, consider the words of the English historian and folklorist Thomas Keightly:\n\nMacMichael elaborated his views on the folkloric belief complex as follows:\nDemonstrating that this evolution and functional equivalence has generally come to be accepted, and that their nature is indeed that proposed by Grimm, one may refer to the early twentieth century \"New International Encyclopaedia\":\nand also\n\nWilliam Edward Hearn, a noted classicist and jurist, traced the origin of domestic deities from the earliest stages as an expression of animism, a belief system thought to have existed also in the neolithic, and the forerunner of Indo-European religion. In his analysis of the Indo-European household, in Chapter II \"The House Spirit\", Section 1, he states:\nIn Section 2 he proceeds to elaborate:\nGeorge Henderson elaborated on the presumed origin of ancestor worship in animism:\n\nDomestic or hearth goddesses from various mythologies include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Of Jewish descent, he spent parts of his life as a Protestant missionary, Anglican priest, British Member of Parliament for Darlington, German right-wing politician and spy, Nazi collaborator and Buddhist abbot in China.\n\nIgnácz Trebitsch, (later changed to \"Trebitsch Lincoln\") was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in the town of Paks (also Orthodox shtetl) in Hungary in 1879, subsequently moving with his family to Budapest. His father, Náthán Trebitsch, () was from Moravia.\n\nAfter leaving school he enrolled in the \"Royal Hungarian Academy of Dramatic Art\", but was frequently in trouble with the police over acts of petty theft. In 1897 he fled abroad, ending up in London, where he took up with some Christian missionaries and converted from Judaism. He was baptised on Christmas Day 1899, and set off to study at a Lutheran seminary in Breklum in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, destined for the ministry. Restless, he was sent to Canada to carry out missionary work among the Jews of Montreal, first on behalf of the Presbyterians, and then the Anglicans. He returned to England in 1903 after a quarrel over the size of his stipend.\n\nHe became Tribich Lincoln (or I. T. T. Lincoln) by deed poll in October 1904 and secured British naturalisation, in May 1909.\n\nTrebitsch-Lincoln had the ability to talk himself into virtually any situation, and into any company. He made the acquaintance of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who appointed him as a curate in Appledore, Kent, his last ecclesiastical post. Soon thereafter he met Seebohm Rowntree, the chocolate millionaire and prominent member of the Liberal Party, who offered him the position of his private secretary. With Rowntree's support, he was nominated in 1909 as the prospective Liberal candidate for the Parliamentary constituency of Darlington in County Durham, even though he was still a Hungarian citizen at the time. In the election of January 1910 he beat the sitting Unionist, whose family had held the seat for decades. However, despite this dramatic entrance to political life, MPs were not at the time paid and Lincoln's financial troubles grew worse. He was unable to stand when a second general election was called in November 1910. Darlington returned to its old allegiance.\n\nIn the years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War he was involved in a variety of failed commercial endeavours, living for a time in Bucharest, hoping to make money in the oil industry. Back in London with no money, he offered his services to the British government as a spy. When he was rejected he went to the Netherlands and made contact with the Germans, who employed him as a double-agent.\n\nReturning to England, he narrowly escaped arrest, leaving for the United States in 1915, where he made contact with the German military attaché, Franz von Papen. Papen was instructed by Berlin to have nothing to do with him, whereupon Trebitsch sold his story to the \"New York World Magazine\", which published under the banner headline \"Revelation of I. T. T. Lincoln, Former Member of Parliament Who Became a Spy\". His book \"Revelations of an International Spy\" was published by Robert M. McBride in New York in 1916.\n\nThe British government, anxious to avoid any embarrassment, employed the Pinkerton agency to track down the renegade. He was returned to England – not on a charge of espionage, which was not covered by the Anglo-American extradition treaty, but of fraud, far more apt in the circumstances. He served three years in Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight, and was released and deported in 1919.\n\nA penniless refugee, Trebitsch-Lincoln worked his way bit by bit into the extreme right-wing and militarist fringe in Weimar Germany, making the acquaintance of Wolfgang Kapp and Erich Ludendorff among others. In 1920, following the Kapp Putsch, he was appointed press censor to the new government. In this capacity he met Adolf Hitler, who flew in from Munich the day before the Putsch collapsed.\n\nWith the fall of Kapp, Trebitsch fled south from Munich to Vienna to Budapest, intriguing all along the way, linking up with a whole variety of fringe political factions, such as a loose alliance of monarchists and reactionaries from all over Europe known as the White International. Entrusted with the organization's archives, he promptly sold the information to the secret services of various governments. Tried and acquitted on a charge of high treason in Austria, he was deported yet again.\n\nHe ended up in China, where he took up employment under three different warlords including Wu Peifu.\nSupposedly after a mystic experience in the late 1920s, Trebitsch converted to Buddhism, becoming a monk. In 1931 he rose to the rank of abbot, establishing his own monastery in Shanghai. All initiates were required to hand over their possessions to Abbot Chao Kung,(Ch. 照空 pinyin: Zhào Kōng) as he now called himself, who also spent his time seducing nuns.\n\nIn 1937 he transferred his loyalties yet again, this time to the Empire of Japan, producing anti-British propaganda on their behalf. Chinese sources say that he also wrote numerous letters and articles for the European press condemning Japanese imperial aggression in China. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he also made contact with the Nazis, offering to broadcast for them and to raise up all the Buddhists of the East against any remaining British influence in the area. The chief of the Gestapo in the Far East, SS Colonel Josef Meisinger, urged that this scheme receive serious attention. It was even seriously suggested that Trebitsch be allowed to accompany German agents to Tibet to implement the scheme. He proclaimed himself the new Dalai Lama after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, a move that was supported by the Japanese but rejected by the Tibetans.\n\nHeinrich Himmler was enthusiastic, as was Rudolf Hess, but it all came to nothing after the latter flew to Scotland in May 1941. After this, Adolf Hitler put an end to all such pseudo-mystical schemes. Even so, Trebitsch continued his work for the German and Japanese security services in Shanghai until his death in 1943.\n\nIn response to a letter protesting the Holocaust which Trebitsch-Lincoln had written to Hitler, the Nazi High command requested that Japanese forces poison Trebitsch-Lincoln after they invaded Shanghai in 1943. The response to this request is not known; however, Trebitsch-Lincoln did die of stomach trouble in Shanghai in 1943, aged 64.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28264928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28264928", "title": "Initiation (Theosophy)", "text": "Initiation (Theosophy)\n\nInitiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through. Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they reincarnate, although evil acts may cause bad karma which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed that when souls have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached enlightenment and have no further need to reincarnate. At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy. This concept was developed by both C. W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.\nAccording to C.W. Leadbeater, \"Initiation\" is a process by which \"we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect.\" According to Alice A. Bailey, \"Initiation\" is the \"process of undergoing an expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness\" It is believed by Theosophists that all souls that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to reincarnate that do not elect to become pratyeka buddhas and go directly into Nirvana gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond. \n\nThe concept of \"Initiation\" is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions loosely based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as \"Ascension\". \n\nThe first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of Jesus.\n\nAccording to Martin Euser, “Theosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the eternal return ]. The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reimbodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.”\n\nThe vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation).\n\nAccording to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the physical body. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their \"Individualized \"I AM\" Presence\", the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement.\n\nAlice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the astral body. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nAn individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed clairvoyance and clairaudience. According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nAn individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an Arhat (Pali) or a Paramahamsa (Sanskrit). \n\nAt this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's past lives, and one also has various minor siddhis capable of affecting one's immediate environment. \n\nSymbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the \"crucifixion\" initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation.\n\nHaving reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\". One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a \"Master of the Ancient Wisdom\". These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature \"the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man\" are:\n\nThe fifth initiation, called the \"resurrection\", comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom and in the Ascended Master Teachings as Ascended masters. \n\nSiddhis at this level include the ability to teleport and bilocate moderate\ndistances and levitate within a localized area. \n\nAccording to C. W. Leadbeater, Alice Bailey and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all—subtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. \n\nOf these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme. \n\nC. W. Leadbeater named a Master called Master Jupiter who lives in India that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level. \n\nAlice A. Bailey identified as Masters the Master P., who is said to help \"St. Germain\" bring about the Age of Aquarius in the Americas, and two different \"English Masters\" (English Master #1 and English Master #2), one of which is said to have inspired the labor movement. In addition to these three, she identified the three \"Lords of Liberation\" – (Lord of Liberation #1, Lord of Liberation #2, and Lord of Liberation #3). According to Alice A. Bailey, the three \"Lords of Liberation\" formulated the slogan \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\". Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three \"Lords of Karma\" (Lord of Karma #1, Lord of Karma #2, and Lord of Karma #3). These three beings are said to live in Shamballah and help \"Sanat Kumara\" decide where and when souls are going to incarnate in their next life. \n\nBenjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001—he stated that there is a Master in Moscow and a Master in Tokyo, but did not give their personal names. \n\nForty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name.\n\nGuy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new \"Ascended Masters\" at this level; however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists. Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as Confucius, Lord Ling, Lady Master Magda, Pallas Athena, Lanello, Kwan Yin, the Great Divine Director, Padre Pio, Godfre and his \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) Lady Master Lotus, and many dozens more.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Master Jupiter\" is referred to as Chananda.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, \"Sanat Kumara\" has a grandson named Master Cha Ara who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, therefore meaning he is functioning at the fifth level.\n\nThe Chohans (Lords) of the Seven Rays – Morya (1st Ray), Master Koot Hoomi (2nd Ray), Paul the Venetian (3rd Ray), Serapis Bey (4th Ray), Master Hilarion (5th Ray), Master Jesus (6th Ray), and the Master Rakoczi (7th Ray) – are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and communications director Djwal Khul is another, making a total of eight at this level. \n\nAll of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings. In the Ascended Master Teachings, \"Master Rakoczi\" is referred to as St. Germain.\n\nSiddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. \n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the Lady Master Nada (a \"lady\" Master recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.\n\nThe seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the Bodhisattava (Buddhism) or the Avatar (Hinduism). The Maitreya or \"World Teacher\" (known as Krishna by Hindus, the Christ by Christians, Maitreya by Buddhists, Messiah by the Jews, the Iman Mahdi by Muslims, and the Peshotan by the Zoroastrians) is at this level. At this level also are said to be the Chakshusha Manu, the Vaivasvatu Manu and the Maha Chohan, thus making a total of four beings at this level.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Chakshusha Manu\" is referred to as Lord Himalaya.\n\nAccording to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the solar system. Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a flying saucer. Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of invulnerability such that they would not be affected by a bullet fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. \n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level. \n\nLevel eight is the level of the Buddha.\n\nAt this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are The Three Pratyeka Buddhas (the task of these three Buddhas is to focus the Seven Rays from \"Sanat Kumara\" through \"Djwal Khul\" to the chohans of the Seven Rays). Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays.\n\nAlice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by telepathy. According to Theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett, beings at this level can freely roam both in interplanetary space and in nearby interstellar space in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings. In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras. Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star Sirius. \n\nThis makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with \"Sanat Kumara\".\n\nThe three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the Five Dhyani Buddhas of mainstream Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the twelve rays.\n\nLevel nine is the \"Lord of the World\": Sanat Kumara – \"The Eternal Youth\" and \"The Ancient of Days\", the Nordic alien that is believed by Theosophists to be the \"Lord of the World\", i.e., the governing deity of Earth.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level. He stated that Sanat Kumara's \"consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe. In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields \"Fohat\" [i.e. beams composed of \"bubbles in space\" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objects] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system].\" Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include omniscience regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, materialization of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby planetary systems. \n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) named Lady Master Venus who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named Lady Master Meta born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation.\n\nThe tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the Planetary Logos, also called the Spirit of the Earth, and specifically denoted as the Planetary Logos of Earth. In order to reach the status of a \"Planetary Logos\", this being would have had to have been a high level \"Planetary Deva\" in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the creation of the world. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the \"Planetary Logos\" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and Sanat Kumara, in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity. Since the formulation in the early 1970s by James Lovelock of the Gaia hypothesis, many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the Gaia philosophy, nowadays simply refer to the \"Planetary Logos of Earth\" as Gaia, the New Age version of what in many religions is called the Earth mother..\n\nIn the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the Avatar of Synthesis. Its job is to transmit the seven rays from the heart of the sun through the \"seven spirits before the [solar] throne\" to all the life waves of the solar system. According to Benjamin Creme, the \"Avatar of Synthesis\" is functioning at the \"17th level of initiation\". In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called Ray-O-Light. The only master above all these levels is the Christ.\n\nThe Solar Logos itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level. The \"Solar Logos\", the Sun God in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings Helios and his \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) Vesta, the \"God and Goddess of this solar system\", in the Ascended Master Teachings. \n\nPerhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the \"Solar Logos\" would be the Galactic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Galactic Logos\" is personified as the cosmic being Averran.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater stated, \"The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also. They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end.\"\n\nThe number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the Cosmos, because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the stars with \"stellar logoi\" and all the galaxies with \"galactic logoi\", plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder. If Alan Guth's inflation theory, which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the observable universe (itself 93,000,000,000 light years in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the large scale structures of the cosmos before reaching the level of the Cosmic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Cosmic Logos\" is personified as the cosmic beings Alpha and Omega. \n\nIf the concept of the Multiverse is true, then other hierarchies exist in other Universes. It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the Universal Logos has created many other cosmoses besides our own.\n\nMusic\n\n\n"}

He reigned during a period of great upheaval in the Sassanian empire. He became patriarch at the end of a disastrous war between Rome and Persia, which weakened both powers. Two years later the Moslem Arabs began a career of conquest in which they overthrew the Sassanian empire and occupied the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. Ishoʿyahb lived through this momentous period, and is said to have met both the Roman emperor Heraclius and the second Moslem caliph ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab.\n\nThe Syriac name Ishoʿyahb means 'Jesus has given', and is spelled variously in English. Alternative spellings include Yeshuyab and Ishu-yahb. Ishoʿyahb II is commonly known as Ishoʿyahb of Gdala, to distinguish him from two near-contemporary Nestorian patriarchs, Ishoʿyahb I of Arzun (582–95) and Ishoʿyahb III of Adiabene (649–59).\n\nIshoʿyahb's patriarchate, the Arab conquest of Iraq and Ishoʿyahb's dealings with the Moslem leaders are described in considerable detail in the \"Chronicle of Seert\". Briefer accounts are given in the \"Ecclesiastical Chronicle\" of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (thirteenth-century), and the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), ʿAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).\n\nIshoʿyahb was a native of the village of Gdala in the district of Beth ʿArbaye between Nisibis and Mosul.\n\nIshoʿyahb studied at the School of Nisibis when it was under the presidency of the controversial theologian Hnana, who searched for common theological ground between the Nestorianism of the Church of the East and the Chalcedonian doctrines held in the Roman empire. He was one of the 300 students who left the college when Hnana was expelled. After a long vacancy in the patriarchate, he was elected patriarch of the Church of the East in 628.\n\nIn 630 Ishoʿyahb led a delegation of Persian clerics to Aleppo to discuss with the Roman emperor Heraclius the possibility of a reconciliation between the Roman and Persian Churches. Although little is known of the content of Ishoʿyahb’s discussions with Heraclius, he evidently persuaded the emperor that, despite its traditional reverence for the teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the doctrinal position of the Church of the East was orthodox. He was asked for his views on monotheletism, the doctrine of the single will recently espoused by the patriarchate of Constantinople, and responded with a confession of faith which was accepted by the Roman bishops. Two masses were then celebrated, one conducted by Ishoʿyahb according to the rite used by the Church of the East, in which both Heraclius and his bishops received the eucharist from his hands, and one according to the Chalcedonian rite. In his mass Ishoʿyahb omitted the customary references to the 'three doctors' Diodorus, Theodore and Nestorius, hoping that the Romans would avoid any mention of Cyril of Alexandria in theirs; but his conciliatory gesture was not reciprocated by the Romans. On his return to Persia Ishoʿyahb was accused by the bishop Bar Sawma of Susa of making damaging concessions to the Romans.\n\nIshoʿyahb II was patriarch during the Arab conquest of Iraq, and according to later Nestorian tradition approached the Moslem leaders to win guarantees for the treatment of Christians in the Sassanian empire. The \"Chronicle of Seert\", probably written in the ninth century, records two approaches to the Moslems, one by Ishoʿyahb's emissaries to Muhammad's successor Abu Bakr (632–4), and a second by Ishoʿyahb himself to the caliph ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab (634–44). ʿUmar is said to have granted the Church of the East a charter of protection. The authenticity of these supposed approaches is very doubtful, and modern authorities are inclined to reject them.\n\nSeleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian empire and the seat of the Nestorian patriarchs at this period, fell to Saʿd b. Abi Waqqas in the spring of 637. Saʿd carried off its gates, symbolising the rulership of central Iraq, to Kufa, and for the rest of his reign Ishoʿyahb resided at Karka d'Beth Slokh (modern Kirkuk) in Beth Garmai.\n\nIn 645 Ishoʿyahb journeyed to Nisibis to settle a dispute between the city's Nestorian Christians and their metropolitan Quriaqos. He died at Karkh Guddan and was buried there.\n\nIshoʿyahb II is included in the list of Syriac authors compiled by the fourteenth-century Nestorian writer ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis. According to ʿAbdishoʿ, his principal writings were a commentary on the Psalms and a number of letters, histories, and homilies. A hymn of his has survived in a Nestorian psalter (MS BM Add. 14675).\n\nThe first recorded Christian mission to China arrived in the Chinese capital Chang'an in 635, during Ishoʿyahb's reign. The mission, whose history was recorded on the famous Nestorian Stele, erected in Chang'an in 781, was led by a Nestorian monk with the Chinese name A-lo-pen. It is possible, but by no means certain, that Ishoʿyahb was behind this initiative.\n\n\n"}

Once the procession reaches the narthex and the stichera have been sung, the deacon begins a series of lengthy petitions (these are the \"lity\" proper), asking for the intercession of many saints, and praying for the church and the world:\n\n...For the salvation of the people; for the [governmental authorities]; for the clergy; for all afflicted Christian souls desirous of aid; for this city, the country and all Christians living therein; for our deceased fathers and brethren; for deliverance from famine, epidemics, earthquake, flood, fire, the sword, the invasion of barbarians and civil strife...\".\n\n\"Lord, have mercy\" is sung multiple times after each petition, and this is followed by the priest reciting a prayer summarizing the petitions.\n\nAfter this, the priests and deacons proceed to the artoklasia table which will have been placed in the center of the nave, all others return to their usual places, and vespers continues as usual with the Aposticha (even if the Lity is celebrated in conjunction with compline, the services ends as vespers).\n\nOccasionally the lity is held outdoors. In places it is the custom to process around the church, the first and fifth intercessions being sung in front of the entrance and the other three intercessions being sung at each of the other three sides. For special festivity or on other occasions, \"e.g.\", or in times of public calamity, the lity may be held in fields (in case of famine) or in public squares or city halls, in which instance the procession that otherwise would be to the narthex of the church continues to wherever the lity is held.\n\nAfter the lity the priests and deacons go to the middle of the church to a table prepared beforehand with five loaves of leavened bread, the artoklasia loaves, bottles of wine and olive oil and, in the Russian tradition, also a dish containing wheat kernels.\n\nWhile the apolytikia (dismissal hymns) are sung — and the rubrics always mandate exactly three such hymns when there is a lity — the deacon circles the artoklasia table, censing the offerings thereon, during each, three times in all. Thereafter the priest uncovers his head and takes up one of the five loaves in his right hand, while he says the prayer:\n\nO Lord Jesus Christ our God, Who didst bless the five loaves and didst therewith feed the five thousand: Do Thou, the same Lord, bless these loaves, wheat, wine and oil; and multiply them in this holy habitation, and in all the world; and sanctify all the faithful who shall partake of them. For it is Thou, O Christ our God, Who dost bless and sanctify all things; and unto Thee we ascribe glory: with the Father Who hath no beginning, and Thine all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.\n\nDuring the words \"loaves, wheat, wine and oil\" above, he points with the loaf he holds in his right hand to each item as he names it, making thereby the sign of the cross. Then he breaks the loaf he holds in his hand.\n\nThe vespers resumes as usual with \"Blessed be the name of the Lord\" but followed by Psalm 33(34), \"I will bless the Lord at all times...\". \n\nThe typicon directs that subsequently the reading of the life of the saint whose feast it is to be read or, on a Sunday, a selection from the New Testament. During this time all sit and the a piece of the blessed bread and a cup of the blessed wine are given to each to provide nourishment to sustain him through the rest of the vigil with the caveat that they are to be consumed straightway so as to keep the fast before Communion. While this custom is still observed in some monasteries, notably on Mount Athos, usually nowadays the blessed bread is simply distributed to the faithful when they exit the service; however, in the Russian tradition, at matins following the singing of Psalm 50(51), all come forward to venerate the Gospel Book (if it is Sunday) or the icon of the feast, and each person is anointed and given a piece of the blessed bread dipped in the wine.\n\nBy sundry local customs, the wheat may be ground into flour, often for making prosphora, or may be reserved until the time of sowing.\n\nA modified artoklasia without any lity follows vespers on Holy Saturday. Since the rubrics for fasting proscribe oil that day, only bread and wine are blessed, and these are distributed to each together with \"six dates or figs\"; nowadays, however, the dates and figs are generally only distributed in monasteries where they are typically consumed with other minimalistic sustenance in the refectory.\n\nIn some Catholic sources, artoklasia was wrongly identified with the Latin practice of \"Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament,\" in which the consecrated Eucharist is exposed for the worship of the faithful. The service of artoklasia might have fallen into disuse for at time among Byzantine Catholics but never was it confused with \"Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. At least in these days, lity with artoklasia is regularly celebrated among Byzantine Catholics for feasts, albeit with various degrees of fidelity to the rubrics.\n\nThe lity takes place in the narthex so that the catechumens and penitents, who in ancient times were not allowed to enter the nave could participate in the joy and blessings of the feast and the faithful would follow the clergy into the narthex to show their humility and brotherly love towards the catechumens and penitents.\n\nTwo possible explanations have been suggested for the origins of this procession. The fourth century pilgrim Egeria states that after Vespers at the Tomb of Christ a procession would go to the site of Calvary where further prayers were said after which the congregation were dismissed. At the monastery of Mar Sabbas in the Judaean wilderness at the end of Vespers the monks would go to the tomb of St. Sabbas where the lity prayers would be said. In fact, the latter tradition may have been a monastic adaptation of the Jerusalem practice and since the liturgical traditions of the monastic community of Mar Sabbas became of central importance in the development of the Byzantine liturgical traditions, especially after the thirteenth century, the lity would have spread to the rest of the Byzantine world from there. One should also note that the processions at the end of Vespers are also found in the Ambrosian Rite and formerly during the Easter Octure in the Norbertine Rite.\n"}

Beaman (born 1963, in New Brunswick, Canada) is a Canadian scholar best known for her work in religious diversity, religious freedom, religion in the public sphere, secularism and the intersections of religion and law. Trained in philosophy, sociology and law, she holds the Canada Research Chair in Religious Diversity and Social Change and is a Full Professor at the University of Ottawa in the Department of Classics and Religious Studies. In 2015, Beaman was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Academy of the Arts and Humanities, Canada’s highest academic honour, for her work on religious diversity and her emerging model of deep equality. The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council honoured Beaman with a 2017 Insight Award in recognition of her continued work on deep equality and nonreligion.\n\nBeaman earned her B.A. in philosophy (1985), an LL.B. in law (1987), an M.A. in sociology (1992), and a Ph.D. in sociology (1996) from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, NB, Canada. She was admitted to the law society of New Brunswick in 1988 and practiced law for five years before her graduate studies.\n\nBeaman has held professorships at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec and The University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta. She is the Canada Research Chair in the Contextualization of Religion in a Diverse Canada and full professor in the Department of Classics and Religious Studies at the University of Ottawa. She teaches Religion and Law, Theory and Method, and Religion in Contemporary Canada.\n\nBeaman is the principal investigator of the Religion and Diversity Project, a $2.5 million, seven-year, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Major Collaborative Research Initiative (MCRI) headquartered at the University of Ottawa. She guides a team of 37 international researchers who study religious diversity in Canada as well as Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The project explores the contours of religious diversity and how to best respond to opportunities and challenges presented by religious diversity in ways that promote a just and peaceful society. Researchers look at the social construction of religious identities, how religion is defined and delimited in law and public policy, and how gender and sexuality emerge as volatile issues in debates over religious freedom. Perspectives from multiple academic disciplines inform the work of the project, including anthropology, communication, education, history, law, philosophy, political science, religious studies, and sociology. Advocating a shift away from the language and frameworks of tolerance and accommodation, Beaman and her team of researchers focus on the creation of innovative approaches to religious diversity in order to foster substantive or deep equality.\n\nBeaman has written extensively on religious diversity and the intersections of religion and law. In her 2008 book \"Defining Harm: Religious Freedom and the Limits of the Law\", she explores the case of an adolescent cancer patient whose objection to blood transfusions was based on religious conviction. The ensuing legal fray exposed what Beaman characterized as a \"culture of fear\" and the construction of the religious 'other' as a threat to social order (7). The work offers a critical socio-legal analysis, drawing on Foucauldian notions of genealogies of power, sedimentation, and resistance to explain how religious minorities (in particular post 9/11 Muslims) or those on the margins of normative religion are perceived as destabilizing forces that \"threaten a Christian hegemony that is itself in flux and under revision\" (5). Beaman points to \"law’s privileged status\" as a \"producer of truth\" and engages the work of Carol Smart who proposes the decentering of law in order to create more comprehensive depictions of social life (7-8). Beaman's publication record demonstrates a preoccupation with how the courts define religion and how the normalization or marginalization of certain religious groups influences the interpretation of religious freedom. She has also written about polygamy and how law frames certain types of family structures. Her commentaries on government responses to religion in the public sphere (such as the proposed Charter of Québec Values) and the complexities of religious freedom have appeared on the academic blog The Immanent Frame and in the Tony Blair Faith Foundation’s Global Perspectives Series, where she emphasized the need for positive narratives and more nuanced understandings of intra-religious diversity. Her work on diversity also considers non-belief and non-religious world views, including the growing social significance of those who identify as religious 'nones'. The status and voices of nones are a concern for Beaman, as they fall outside the purview of religious freedom protections. Beaman’s career corpus demonstrates a commitment to the broad themes of justice, fairness, equality and inclusion.\n\nIn 2015, the Royal Society of Canada acknowledged Beaman's contributions to the study of religious diversity in Canada and her research on deep equality. In the article Deep Equality as an Alternative to Accommodation and Tolerance (2014), Beaman contends that the conceptualization of diversity as a problem to be solved sets up a hierarchy of privilege whereby majorities or host cultures bestow tolerance or accommodation on minorities. She rejects the language of tolerance and accommodation as frameworks for the management of this \"crisis of diversity,\" in favor of a model she refers to as deep equality (90). Informed in part by political theorist William E. Connolly’s thoughts on deep pluralism and agonistic respect, Beaman’s paradigm of deep equality proposes the displacement of conflict narratives with a focus on empirical evidence from the successful negotiation of religious diversity in the quotidian. She argues that the exploration, understanding and mapping of micro-level instances of day-to-day cooperation and collaboration between ordinary people are crucial to shifting the perception of diversity as a problem to one of opportunity. Beaman engages Connolly’s notion of agnostic respect as foundational to the work of deep equality, noting that \"respect is 'agonistic' because it requires the abandonment of rightness and the conviction that one is imbued with the truth through some sort of transcendent authority\" (98). She also points to static representations of religion and rigid religious identities (particularly as perpetuated in the media), as well as an overreliance on law to resolve disputes as persistent impediments to the progress of deep equality. \"Law,\" according to Beaman \"has colonized the meaning of equality, watering it down and displacing it with concepts like ‘reasonable accommodation’ and tolerance\" (92). Beaman argues three points: \"1. That tolerance and accommodation are inappropriate frameworks to facilitate human thriving in a diverse context; 2. That a reconstituted notion of equality can subvert the binaries that are kept alive by tolerance and accommodation; 3. That positive narratives offer a map toward a renewed conceptualization of equality, and a recognition of day-to-day human activity in its constitution\" (104). Beaman draws from the disciplines of law, neuroscience, philosophy, political theory, sociology, and social psychology, among others, to inform her emerging model of deep equality. She projects the utility of deep equality as a lens for exploring inequality in a broad range of areas including economics, environmental relations, gender, race, religion, and sexuality. The broad notion of respect is a recurrent theme emerging from Beaman’s research, with \"the values of caring, neighborliness and shared humanity\" as core components of deep equality’s emphasis on striving to live well together with difference (98). Beaman’s work on human/non-human animal relationships is likewise linked to her interest in the diversity of religious and non-religious world views and their expression in everyday interactions. She is currently conducting empirical research on the global phenomenon of sea turtle rescue, employing aspects of the lived religion approach to explore identity construction in late modernity and narratives of cooperation that emerge from human engagement with both animals and the environment.\n\n2017 Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Award Nominee \n\n2015 Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Academy of the Arts and Humanities \n\n2014 Resident, Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio Center, Bellagio, Italy\n\n2010 - 2017 Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) $2.5 million grant, Major Collaborative Research Initiatives.

She is deemed to bring good fortune, prosperity, attract customers to a business, and found among merchants.\n\nCommonly dressed in red Thai style clothing, Nang Kwak is an incarnation of Mae Po Sop, the Thai rice goddess. She is a version of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi.\n\nNang Kwak is represented as a beautiful woman wearing a red dress (not always, but more often than other colors) fashioned in the Thai style. She also wears a golden crown on her head and is in the sitting or kneeling position. Her right hand is raised in the Thai way of beckoning a customer, with the palm of the hand curved and pointing downwards. Her left hand is resting on her side or holds a bag full of gold near her lap.\n\nThe present iconographic figure of Nang Kwak is an incarnation of Mae Po Sop (แม่โพสพ), the Siamese rice goddess. However, unlike Mae Po Sop, Nang Kwak does not wear the harvested rice sheaf on her right shoulder. The iconography of Nang Kwak is based in the Hindu goddess Sri Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.\n\nThe position of her hand in present-day iconography is similar to the Japanese Maneki Neko beckoning cat.\n\nNang Kwak is a benevolent spirit. She is deemed to bring luck, especially in the form of money, to the household. She is the patron Deity of all Merchants and Salesmen and can be seen in almost every business establishment in Thailand\n\nThai people like to have a figurine or cloth poster (called a Pha Yant, or Yantra Cloth) of this goddess in their home or shop, where it is often placed by the shrine. Some people also wear amulets with her figure around the neck, which is a logical development, due to the fact that many people in Thailand must travel around to sell their wares, which makes a portable nang Kwak amulet the obvious choice for such a person.\n\nAlthough Nang Kwak is more a figure of popular folklore than a religious deity, there are Buddhist legends that seek to incorporate her into the Buddhist fold.\n\nOne Buddhist legend presents Nang Kwak as Nang Supawadee (or Subhavadi) of a Brahmin trading family that converted to Buddhism. According to this legend, in the small town of Michikasandhanakara, in the Indian province of Sawadtii, there was a married family, Sujidtaprahma and his wife Sumanta, who had a daughter named Supawadee. They were merchants who sold small amounts of wares on the markets, only earning just enough to maintain their small family from day to day. One day, they were discussing their hopes and dreams for the future, and decided that they should try to expand their business to make more profit and begin to think of being able to save something for their old age.\n\nAs a result of this conversation, they decided to try to afford to buy a gwian (cart) in order to use to travel with and sell their wares to other towns and villages. They also then brought wares from the other towns to sell in Sawadtii and Michigaasandhanakara when they returned. Sometimes, Supawadee would ask to tag along for the ride, and help them. One day, as Supawadee was helping her parents to sell wares in a distant town, she was lucky to be able to hear a sermon by Phra Gumarn Gasaba Thaera; she was so convinced and moved by his sermon, that she became Buddhist. When Gasaba Thaera saw her faith and devotion, he collected all his powers of thought and concentration, for he was an Arahant, and bestowed blessings of good fortune and luck in salesmanship on Nang Supawadee and her family.\n\nAnother Thai legend presents Nang Kwak as the woman who defended a king from a demon in the epic Ramakian. She, thereafter gained the boon (merit) of fortune and prosperity wherever she was.\n\nNang Kwak was the daughter of \"Pu Chao Khao Khiao\", meaning 'Grandfather Lord of the Green Mountain' (\"Khao Khiao\"). Pu Chao Khao Khiao was a Lord of the Chatu Maha Rachika realm (one of the lower levels of Heaven – an Asura realm of giants and pretas). His other name is 'Pra Panasabodee', and he is the Lord of the forest and places where wild plants grow. In that time, there was an Asura demon called To Kok Khanak (also known as 'To Anurak'). To Kok Khanak was a good friend of Pu Chao Khao Khiao, who had been attacked by Phra Ram (the hero of Ramakien, Thai version of the Hindu epic Ramayana), who had thrown a Kok tree at him which pierced his chest and carried him through space to be pinned to the side of Pra Sumen. In addition, Pra Ram cursed him with the following magic spell: 'Until your descendants weave a Civara monks robe from lotus petals, and offer it to Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai (Maitreya the future Buddha) your curse will not be lifted.'\n\nAfter this, Nang Prachant, the daughter of Lord Kok Khanag had to serve her father, spending the days and nights trying to weave a Civara robe from lotus petals, in order to have it ready for offering to Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai who will descend to become enlightened in a future age. Meanwhile, To Kok Khanak had to remain cursed and pinned to Pra Sumen and his daughter was in a dire situation without her father to help run things. Since she had to spend all her time weaving the Civara, she had no time to sell things or make money, nor time to run a shop. When Chao Khao Khiaw heard this, he felt compassion and sent his daughter Nang Kwak to go stay with her. Because of her merit, Nang Kwak caused merchants and rich nobles to flock to Nang Prachant's home and bestow gifts of gold, silver and money on her. Nang Prachant became wealthy and led a comfortable life.\n\n\n"}

She was the fifth of six known daughters of Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti.\n\nNeferneferure (her name means \"Beauty of the Beauties of Re\" or \"Most Beautiful One of Re\") was born in or before the 8th regnal year of her father Akhenaten in the city of Akhetaten. She had four older sisters named Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit, as well as a younger sister named Setepenre.\n\nOne of the earliest depictions of Neferneferure is in a fresco from the King’s House in Amarna. She is depicted sitting on a pillow with her sister Neferneferuaten Tasherit. The fresco is dated to ca. year 9 of Akhenaten, and the entire family is depicted, including the baby Setepenre.\n\nNeferneferure is depicted at the Durbar in year 12 in the tomb of the Overseer of the royal quarters Meryre II in Amarna. Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown seated in a kiosk, receiving tribute from foreign lands. The daughters of the royal couple are shown standing behind their parents. Neferure is the middle daughter in the lower register. She is holding a gazelle in her right arm and a lotus flower in her left. She is standing right behind her sister Neferneferuaten Tasherit. Her sister Setepenre is standing behind her and is shown reaching over to pet the gazelle.\n\nNeferneferure probably died in the 13th or 14th regnal year, possibly in the plague that swept across Egypt during this time. She is absent from one scene and her name was plastered over in another scene in the Royal Tomb in Amarna. To be specific, on Wall C of the chamber formula_1 of the Royal Tomb her name was mentioned among the five princesses (the list excluded the youngest, Setepenre, who was possibly dead by this time), but was later covered by plaster. On Wall B of the chamber formula_2 she is missing from the scene which shows her parents and three elder sisters – Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit – mourning the dead second princess, Meketaten. This suggests that she is likely to have died shortly before the decoration of these chambers was finished. It is possible that Neferneferure was actually buried in chamber formula_1 of the royal tomb.\n\nAlternatively she may have been buried in Tomb 29 in Amarna. This theory is based on an amphora handle bearing an inscription mentioning the inner (burial) chamber of Neferneferure. If Neferneferure was buried in tomb 29, then this may mean the Royal Tomb was already sealed at the time of her burial and that she may have died after the death her father Akhenaten.\n\nA lid of a small box (JdE 61498) bearing her picture was found among the treasures of Tutankhamun. It shows the princess crouching, with a finger pressed to her mouth, as very young children were often depicted. On this box lid Re's name in her name was written phonetically instead of the usual circled dot.\n\n"}

It flourished in the North Island from about 1863 to 1874.\n\nPai Mārire incorporated biblical and Māori spiritual elements and promised its followers deliverance from 'pākehā' domination. Although founded with peaceful motives—its name means \"Good and Peaceful\"—Pai Mārire became better known for an extremist form of the religion known to the Europeans as \"Hauhau\". The rise and spread of the violent expression of Pai Mārire was largely a response to the New Zealand Government's military operations against North Island Māori, which were aimed at exerting European sovereignty and gaining more land for white settlement; historian B.J. Dalton claims that after 1865 Māori in arms were almost invariably termed Hauhau.\n\nGovernor George Grey launched a campaign of suppression against the religion in April 1865, culminating in the raiding of dozens of villages in Taranaki and on the East Coast and the arrest of more than 400 adherents, most of whom where incarcerated on the Chatham Islands. Elements of the religion were incorporated in the Ringatū or \"Raised hand\" religion formed in 1868 by Te Kooti, who escaped from the Chatham Islands after being incarcerated there.\n\nIn the 2006 New Zealand Census 609 people identified \"Hauhau\" as their religion.\n\nTe Ua Haumēne was born in Taranaki, New Zealand, in the early 1820s. He and his mother were captured and enslaved by a rival tribe in 1826. He learned to read and write in Māori while in captivity and began studying the New Testament. He was baptised by the Rev John Whiteley in the Wesleyan mission at Kawhia in 1834 and given the name of Horopapera Tuwhakararo, a transliteration of the name John Zerubbabel. He later returned to Taranaki.\n\nDuring the 1850s he became a supporter of the King Movement, which opposed further expansion of European sovereignty and the sale of land to European settlers, and in the 1860s fought against colonial forces in the First Taranaki War and Waikato War, in which he also acted as a chaplain to the Māori soldiers. By the early 1860s Te Ua was part of a \"runanga\" (local board of management), which administered local government and also ensured that the boundary of the land that was covered by the \"mana\" of the Māori King was undisturbed.\n\nBy then the cornerstones of Te Ua's religious teaching were set. He believed Māori had a right to defend the boundaries of their territory; believed in national salvation of the Māori from the white settlers; and suspected that missionaries were aiding and abetting the loss of Māori land.\n\nThe elevation of Te Ua to the role of prophet followed an incident in September 1862 in which the British steamer \"Lord Worsley\" was wrecked off the Taranaki coast and local Māori debated what action should be taken with the cargo and crew. Te Ua – then living at Wereroa Pă, near Waitotara – argued that goods salvaged from the vessel should be sent to New Plymouth untouched, but was ignored and the cargo was instead plundered. On 5 September, aggrieved over what had taken place, he claimed to have experienced a vision in which the Archangel Gabriel announced to him that the last days of the Bible were at hand and that God had chosen him as a prophet who would cast out the Pākehā and restore Israel (the Māori) to their birthright in the land of Canaan (Aotearoa/New Zealand) - adding a religious aspect to the issue of Māori independence, which had until then been a purely political movement.\n\nThere are conflicting reports over Te Ua's response to the vision: he is claimed to have killed his child, explaining in a letter circulated to tribes that it was as a redemption for his people, \"forgetful, desolate and in doubt\"., while there are also claims he broke the child's leg and healed it miraculously. As reports about Te Ua began to circulate, he quickly gained a reputation for having other miraculous powers. The view among settlers was less sympathetic: Bishop William Williams claimed Te Ua showed strong signs of insanity and colonial soldier and historian T.W. Gudgeon claimed he had been thus far regarded as a \"harmless lunatic\" of \"weak intellect, but yet of peaceful disposition\".\n\nTe Ua began to formulate his new religion, complete with a holy book, \"Ua Rongo Pai\" (the Gospel according to Ua) which combined elements of Old Testament morality, Christian doctrine and traditional Māori religion. Its goal was to create a peaceful society in which righteousness and justice prevailed. They believed they were a second Chosen People and that, with divine aid, they would regain control of their hereditary land when the Creator, Jehovah, fought for them and drove the English into the sea. To help him propagate the religion, Te Ua chose three men – Tahutaki, Hepenaia and Wi Parara.\n\nThe embracing of the religion by some Māori also signalled a rejection of Christianity and a distrust of missionaries over their involvement in land purchases.\n\nThe religion gained widespread support among North Island Māori and became closely associated with the Māori King Movement, but also became the cause of deep concern among European settlers as it welded tribes in opposition to the Pākehā and helped to inspire fierce military resistance to colonial forces, particularly during the Second Taranaki War underway at the time.\n\nAmong settlers, the existence of the new religion was brought into dramatic focus with a series of attacks in April and May 1864. On 6 April, a force led by Tahutaki and Hepenaia mounted an expedition to Ahuahu village, set amid dense bush south of Oakura, near New Plymouth, believing some \nPākehā would be delivered into their hands. The group surprised a combined force of 57th Regiment and the newly formed Taranaki Military Settlers, a total of 101 men, as they rested without their weapons during a mission to destroy native crops. The Māori force killed seven and wounded 12 of their enemy. The bodies of the seven dead, including their commander, Captain P.W.J. Lloyd, were stripped naked and decapitated. The leg of one of the soldiers was also removed.\n\nThe easy victory of the Māori over the numerically stronger British-led force gave a powerful impetus to the Pai Mārire movement and confirmed in the minds of many Māori the protection of the Archangel Gabriel, of whom Te Ua was now regarded as a prophet. The number of adherents swelled and Pai Mārire rites continued to develop, some incorporating the severed heads of the slain soldiers, through which Te Ua claimed to communicate with Jehovah.\n\nThree weeks later, on 30 April 1864, 200 warriors demonstrated their faith in divine protection when they marched on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9 km north-west of New Plymouth. The redoubt, on the crown of a hill, was defended by 75 imperial soldiers and two Coehorn mortars. Atiawa Māori viewed the construction of the outpost on their land as a challenge and formed a war party of the best fighting men from west coast iwi. When they came under fire at close range, they shielded themselves from the fusillade only by holding their right hands up and chanting. As many as a fifth of the Māori force were killed in the assault.\n\nIn a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter who took part in the attack, explained: \"The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet. He taught us the Pai-marire karakia (chant), and told us that if we repeated it as we went into battle the pakeha bullets would not strike us. This we all believed.\"\n\nLed by Hepanaia, the warriors participated in sacred ceremonies around a pole at the Manutahi pā, with all the principal Taranaki chiefs present: Wiremu Kīngi and Kingi Parengarenga, as well as Te Whiti and Tohu Kākahi, both of whom would later become prophets at Parihaka. The force, armed with muskets, shotguns, tomahawks and spears, marched to Sentry Hill and at 8 am launched their attack, ascending the slope that led to the redoubt. Te Kahu-Pukoro recalled:\n\nAbout 34 Māori and one imperial soldier were killed. Among those shot dead, at almost point-blank range, were chiefs Hepanaia, Kingi Parengarenga (Taranaki), Tupara Keina (Ngatiawa), Tamati Hone (Ngati Ruanui) and Hare Te Kokai, who had advocated the frontal attack on the redoubt. According to Cowan, the slaughter temporarily weakened the new confidence in Pai-marire, but Te Ua had a satisfying explanation: that those who fell were to blame because they did not repose absolute faith in the karakia, or incantation.\n\nTwo weeks later, on 14 May, a Pai Mārire war party from the upper Whanganui River advanced on the settlement of Wanganui, intent on raiding it. In what became known as the Battle of Moutoa, Lower Whanganui \"kupapa\" (Māori loyal to the Queen) routed the war party, killing 50 of them including the prophet Matene Rangitauira.\n\nRelieved settlers erected New Zealand's first war memorial at the site—today known as Moutoa Gardens—with an inscription that read: \"To the memory of those brave men who fell at Moutoa 14 May 1864 in defence of law and order against fanaticism and barbarism\".\n\nThe reverses at Sentry Hill and Moutoa Island reinforced Māori belief in Te Ua's movement, with the conviction that the defeats had been caused by disobedience to the leader by the prophets Hepanaia and Matene. More \"iwi\" attached themselves to Te Ua. In early 1865 emissaries carrying the smoke-dried severed heads were sent from Taranaki to chief Hirini Te Kani at Poverty Bay via Wanganui and Taupo in two parties – one via Rotorua, Whakatane, Opotiki, and East Cape, and the other through the centre of the island via Ruatahuna and Wairoa.\n\nThe emissaries were instructed to proceed peaceably and obtain the support of tribes they passed, delegating their spiritual powers to leading converts in each tribe, who each took up the duties of Pai Mārire priest. But on 23 February the group clashed at Pipiriki near Wanganui with Māori loyal to the New Zealand government and determined from then to murder missionaries they encountered.\n\nAmong European settlers unease grew at the spreading influence of Pai Mārire. In a letter to the Native Minister, the Resident Magistrate for Central Wanganui warned: \"The Hauhau fanaticism is spreading very rapidly in the Province, and I fear will be the cause of great mischief. It is now the mainstay of the King movement.\"\n\nThe warning came too late to save the life of one North Island missionary. At Taupo the Pai Mārire recruiting party ransacked the house of the Rev. Thomas Samuel Grace and at Opotiki on 2 March shot, hanged and decapitated the German-born Rev. Carl Sylvius Völkner. His head was taken to the local church, where his eyes were removed and eaten by the prophet Kereopa Te Rau. The killing was claimed to be in part revenge for Volkner's activities in spying on local Māori for the government, but may also have been motivated by Kereopa's wish to bring government retaliation on local Te Whakatōhea Māori as a payback for an earlier intertribal battle with his Te Arawa \"iwi\".\n\nRev Grace, who had fled from Taupo to Opotiki, was arrested and put on trial by the Pai Mārire party. He was rescued from captivity two weeks later by a British man-of-war, \"HMS Eclipse\", after an attempt by local Pai Mārire leaders to exchange him for Tauranga chief Hori Tupaea, who was in prison.\n\nOn 22 July, Taranaki prophet Horomona led the murder of the master and two of the three crew members of the schooner \"Kate\" at Whakatane.\n\nOn 29 April 1865 Governor George Grey issued a proclamation condemning the \"revolting acts ... repugnant to all humanity\" carried out by Pai Mārire followers and warned the government would \"resist and suppress by force of arms if necessary, and by every means in my power, fanatical doctrines, rites, and practices of the aforesaid character\".\n\nHoromona and Kirimangu were hanged for their 22 July killings on the schooner \"Kate\" and a coalition of government and loyal Māori forces led by Hawke's Bay Province Superintendent Donald McLean embarked on a mission to crush the religion on the East Coast. From June to October 1865 there was a virtual civil war on the East Coast culminating in the battle of Waerenga-a-Hika in Poverty Bay in November. Hundreds of followers were arrested in the campaign, while in Taranaki a separate campaign led by the increasingly reluctant British commander, General Duncan Cameron, raided dozens of villages to arrest hundreds more adherents.\n\nIn February 1866 Te Ua was captured near Opunake in Taranaki by Cameron's replacement, Major-General Trevor Chute. Chute claimed Te Ua was immediately abandoned by all those in his village, who swore an oath of allegiance to the Crown and were set free. He reported that \"kupapa\" (loyal) Māori urged his immediate execution. Te Ua was taken to Wanganui, writing en route to his North Island supporters, urging: \"Let evil be brought to an end ... in order that the General may cease operations against you.\"\n\nTe Ua and Patara were freed in Auckland and most other leaders were pardoned, but Grey transported 400 East Coast followers, including Te Kooti, to the Chatham Islands for incarceration. Elements of Pai Mārire were later incorporated into the Ringatu religion founded by Te Kooti.\n\nTe Ua died at Oeo in Taranaki in October 1866.\n\nTe Ua's followers identified themselves with the Jews, calling their ministers \"Teu\" (Jews) and accepted the Jewish seventh-day Sabbath. They believed they were a second Chosen People and that, with divine aid, they would return from the wilderness to freedom in their hereditary land. Te Ua taught that the Creator, Jehovah, would fight for them and drive the English into the sea.\n\nWhen the last of the enemy had perished, every Māori who had died since the beginning of the world would be resurrected and stand in the presence of Zerubbabel, healed of all of diseases and infirmities. Men would be sent from heaven to teach Māori all the arts and sciences known by Europeans. Their first great day of deliverance would be in December 1864. He urged men and women to abandon monogamy and live together communally to produce as many children as possible.\n\nServices were held at a \"niu\", a tall pole, often about 18 m high, with yard-arms from which hung ropes. The first of these \"niu\" was the mast of the \"Lord Worsley\". Members of the congregation circled the \"niu\" several times a day, chanting and touching a severed head mounted on a pole while priests conducted prayer services. Historian Babbage wrote: \"The worshippers worked themselves into a state bordering on frenzy during the procedure of the ritual, until catalepsy frequently prostrated them.\"\n\nThe chants as devotees circled the \"niu\" were described by one European commentator as \"a jumble of Christian and ancient concepts, of soldier and sailor terms, of English and Māori language with the barking watchword of the cult interspersed\". The \"angels of the wind\" were said to be present during the service, ascending and descending the ropes dangling from the mast's yard-arm. By the end of 1865 a \"niu\" stood in almost every large village from Taranaki to the Bay of Plenty and from the north of the Wellington district to the Waikato frontier.\n\nHistorian James Cowan described many of the chants as \"simply meaningless strings of English words rounded into the softer Māori; others were either transliterations or mispronunciations of parts of the Church of England services, with a sprinkling of Latin from the Roman Catholic ritual. Some phrases were military orders, picked up at the soldiers' camps. Some others showed a nautical origin; Te Ua boxed the compass like any pakeha sailor.\"\n\nThe chant began:\n\nTe Ua taught that the divine service and strict adherence to his instruction would make them impervious to bullets if, when under fire, they would raise their right hand and cry, \"Hapa! Hapa! Pai Mārire, hau! Hau! Hau!\" \"Hapa\" meant to pass over, or ward off, while the exclamation \"Hau!\" at the end of the choruses – said by one soldier to uttered in a way that sounded like the bark of a dog – had a literal meaning of \"wind\" but referred to the life principle or vital spark of man, while the wind angels were named \"Anahera hau\".\n\nA similar belief in the mystical power to avert bullets had earlier been reported among Islamic groups in Africa and Asia and America, such as the Ghost Shirt Movement.\n\n\n"}

The temple honors Adinath, the first Tirthankar of the present half-cycle (avasarpiṇī) according to Jain cosmology. The town of Ranakpur and the temple are named after the provincial ruler monarch, Rana Kumbha who supported the construction of the temple. The Ranakpur temple is one of the largest and most important temples of Jain culture. The temple is located in a village of Ranakpur near Sadri town in the Pali district of Rajasthan. The campus includes various temples such as Chaumukha temple, Surya temple, Parsavanth temple and Amba temple\n\nLight colored marble has been used for the construction of this grand temple which occupies an area of approximately 60 x 62 meters. The temple, with its distinctive domes, shikhara, turrets and cupolas rises majestically from the slope of a hill. 1444 marble pillars, carved in exquisite detail, support the temple. The pillars are all differently carved and no two pillars are the same. It is also said that it is impossible to count the pillars. Also all the statues face one or the other statue. There is one beautiful carving made out of a single marble rock where there 108 heads of snakes and numerous tails. One cannot find the end of the tails. The image faces all four cardinal directions. In the axis of the main entrance, on the western side, is the largest image. The moolnayak of this temple is a 6 feet tall white colored idol of Adinatha.\n\nThe temple is designed as chaumukha—with four faces. The construction of the temple and quadrupled image symbolize the Tirthankara's conquest of the four cardinal directions and hence the cosmos. The architecture and stone carvings\nof the temple is based on the Ancient Mirpur Jain Temple at Mirpur in Rajasthan.\n\nThe sun temple at Ranakpur dates back to the 13th century CE. After\nits destruction, it was rebuilt in the 15th century.\n\nA temple dedicated to Suparshvanatha is also present here. The temple has an intrinsic architecture and this temple is also famous for erotic arts on the wall.\n\nMāru-Gurjara Architecture show the deep understanding of structures and refined skills of Rajasthani craftmen of bygone era. Māru-Gurjara Architecture has two prominent styles: Maha-Maru and Maru-Gurjara. According to M. A. Dhaky, Maha-Maru style developed primarily in Marudesa, Sapadalaksha, Surasena and parts of Uparamala whereas Maru-Gurjara originated in Medapata, Gurjaradesa-Arbuda, Gurjaradesa-Anarta and some areas of Gujarat. Scholars such as George Michell, M.A. Dhaky, Michael W. Meister and U.S. Moorti believe that Māru-Gurjara Temple Architecture is entirely Western Indian architecture and is quite different from the \nNorth Indian Temple architecture. There is a connecting link between Māru-Gurjara Architecture and Hoysala Temple Architecture. In both of these styles architecture is treated sculpturally.\n\nThe construction is well documented in a 1437 CE copper-plate record, inscriptions in the temple and a Sanskrit text Soma-Saubhagya Kavya. Inspired by a dream of a celestial vehicle, Dharna Shah, a Porwal from Ghanerao, commenced its construction, under the patronage of Rana Kumbha, then ruler of Mewar. The architect who oversaw the project was named Deepaka. There is an inscription on a pillar near the main shrine stating that in 1439 Deepaka, an architect, constructed the temple at the direction of Dharanka, a devoted Jain. When the ground floor was completed, Acharya Soma Sundar Suri of Tapa Gachha supervised the ceremonies, which are described in \"Soma-Saubhagya Kavya\". The construction continued until 1458 CE. However, according to the audio guide provided to visitors to the site, construction lasted fifty years (and involved 2,500 workers). Another source reports that construction continued until 1496, fifty years from 1446.\n\nThe temple underwent periodic renovations. Several families supported the construction of devakulikas and mandaps. The descendants of Dharna Shah now mainly live in Ghanerao. The temple has been managed by the Anandji Kalyanji Pedhi trust for the past century.\n\nThe temple prohibits visits by women having their menstrual periods, on the grounds that this will defile the sacred nature of the temple grounds.\n"}

From July 1999 until her death she lived in Sweden.\n\nJoseph Brodsky called Derieva \"a great poet\", stressing that her poems are hers \"only by name, only by her craft\". \"The real authorship belongs here to poetry itself, to freedom itself. I have not met anything similar for a long time, neither among my fellow countrymen nor among English-speaking poets\". Tomas Venclova has stated that \" Regina Derieva was, first and foremost, a Christian poet, a worthy heir of a long line of metaphysical poets, be they English, French or Russian. Far from any inflated rhetoric or didactics, her poems reached the very core of the Christian experience, which meant serious and fearless attitude to life, suffering and death. The imagery and syntax of the Gospels and the Books of Prophets was, for her, a natural element just as apocalyptic presentiments and mystical hope formed the axis of her world-outlook\". Les Murray has a blurb on the back cover of Derieva's \"Alien Matter\" : ”Science teaches that eighty percent of the universe consists of dark matter, so called. Regina Derieva learned this same fact in a very hard school. She does not consent to it, though. She knows that the hurt truth in us points to a dimension where, for example, victory is cleansed of battle. Her strict, economical poems never waver from that orientation”.\n\nDerieva's work has been translated into several languages, including English, French, Swedish, Arabic, Italian, Chinese, Thai, Greek, and other languages. A compact disc with her readings in Russian of selected poems was issued in 1999. Derieva's work has appeared in the \"Poetry\" magazine, \"Evergreen Review,\" \"Modern Poetry in Translation,\" \"Poetry East,\" \"The Liberal,\" \"Ars Interpres,\" \"Salt Magazine,\" \"Quadrant,\" \"Notre Dame Review,\" \"Dublin Poetry Review,\" \"Quarterly Literary Review Singapore,\" \"Words Without Borders,\" \"St. Petersburg Review,\" \"Poetry International,\" \"Artful Dodge,\" \"Atlanta Review,\" \"POEM Magazine,\" \"The Hopkins Review,\" \"The American Poetry Review\" as well as in many Russian and Swedish magazines.\n\nShe translated poetry by Thomas Merton and contemporary American, Australian, British, Polish, and Swedish poets. Regina Derieva participated in a number of Swedish and international poetry festivals.\n\nDerieva's poetry is strongly affected by her Catholic faith. In 1996, a significant Italian composer and organist, Fra Armando Pierucci, composed a cantata for the series of Regina Derieva's poems. This cantata is titled \"Via Crucis.\" In 2003, she received the Shannon Fellowship of the International Thomas Merton Society. In 2009, the Catholic Church of Sweden awarded her the ORA ET LABORA medal for her literary work to benefit the Church.\n\nRegina Derieva's funeral took place on December 23, 2013, and she is buried at the Norra Begravningsplatsen (Katolska Kyrkogården) in Stockholm. The volume of poetry, memoirs, essays, fiction, and photographs in honor of Regina Derieva, \"Curator Aquarum\", was published in 2015. Her papers are at Stanford University.\n\n"}
{"id": "15954216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15954216", "title": "Religion in Georgia (country)", "text": "Religion in Georgia (country)\n\nThe wide variety of peoples inhabiting Georgia has meant a correspondingly rich array of active religions. Today most of the population in Georgia practices Orthodox Christianity, primarily in the Georgian Orthodox Church whose faithful make up 82.4% of the population. Around 1% belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, while about 3.9% of the population follow the Armenian Apostolic Church (Oriental Orthodoxy), almost all of which are ethnic Armenians. Adherents of Islam make up 10.7% of the population and are mainly found in the Adjara and Kvemo Kartli regions and as a sizeable minority in Tbilisi. Catholics of the Armenian and Latin churches make up around 0.8% of the population and are mainly found in the south of Georgia and a small number in Tbilisi. There is also a sizeable Jewish community in Tbilisi served by two synagogues.\n\nThe Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church is one of the world's most ancient Christian Churches, founded in the 1st century by the Apostle Andrew the First Called. In the first half of the 4th century Christianity was adopted as the state religion. This has provided a strong sense of national identity that has helped to preserve a national Georgian identity, despite repeated periods of foreign occupation and attempted assimilation.\n\nGeorgia has a long history of religious harmony within its borders despite the historical conflicts with the surrounding nations. Different religious minorities have lived in Georgia for thousands of years and religious discrimination is virtually unknown in the country. Jewish communities exist throughout the country, with major concentrations in the two largest cities, Tbilisi and Kutaisi. Azerbaijani groups have practiced Islam in Georgia for centuries, as have Adjarians and some of the Abkhazians concentrated in their respective autonomous republics. The Armenian Apostolic Church, whose doctrine differs in some ways from that of Georgian Orthodoxy, has autocephalous status.\n\nThe country has a total area of approximately 25,900 square miles (69,700 km²), and a population () of 3.7 million people.\n\nAccording to a 2014 census, 83.4% of the Georgian population identified themselves as Eastern Orthodox Christian, 10.7% Muslim, 3.9% Armenian Apostolic, and 0.5% Catholic. Orthodox churches serving other non-Georgian ethnic groups, such as Russians and Greeks, are subordinate to the Georgian Orthodox Church. Non-Georgian Orthodox Churches generally use the language of their communicants.\n\nIn addition, there are a small number of mostly ethnic Russian believers from two dissenter Christian movements: the ultra-Orthodox Old Believers, and the Spiritual Christians (the Molokans and the Doukhobors). The majority of these groups have left the country since the mid-1980s.\n\nUnder Soviet rule (1921-1990), the number of active churches and priests declined sharply and religious education became nearly nonexistent. Membership in the Georgian Orthodox Church has increased markedly since independence in 1991. The church maintains 4 theological seminaries, 2 academies, several schools, and 27 church dioceses; it has 700 priests, 250 monks, and 150 nuns. The Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, Ilia II, with his seat in Tbilisi, heads the Church.\n\nSeveral religions, including the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Catholic Church, Judaism, and Islam, traditionally have coexisted with Georgian Orthodoxy. A large number of Armenians live in the southern Javakheti region, in which they constitute a majority of the population. Islam is prevalent among Azerbaijani and north Caucasus ethnic communities in the eastern part of the country and also is found in the regions of Adjara and Abkhazia.\n\nJudaism, which has been present since ancient times, is practiced in a number of communities throughout the country, especially in the largest cities, Tbilisi and Kutaisi. Approximately 8,000 Jews remain in the country, following two large waves of emigration, the first in the early 1970s and the second in the period of perestroika during the late 1980s. Before then, Jewish officials estimate, Georgia had as many as 100,000 Jews. There also are small numbers of Lutheran worshippers, mostly among descendants of German communities that first settled in the country from 1817. A small number of the ethno-religious group of the Yezidis have lived in the country for centuries.\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), Protestant denominations have become more prominent. They include Baptists (composed of Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Ossetian, and Kurdish groups); Seventh-day Adventists; Pentecostals (both Georgian and Russian); the New Apostolic Church; and the Assemblies of God. There also are a few Bahá'ís, Hare Krishnas and Jehovah's Witnesses (local representatives state that the group has been in the country since 1953 and has about 15,000 adherents). There are no available membership numbers for these groups but, combined, their membership most likely totals fewer than 100,000 persons.\n\nAccording to Orthodox tradition, Christianity was first preached in Georgia by the Apostles Simon and Andrew in the 1st century. It became the state religion of Kartli (Iberia) in 337. The conversion of Kartli to Christianity is credited to St. Nino of Cappadocia. The Georgian Orthodox Church, originally part of the Church of Antioch, gained its autocephaly and developed its doctrinal specificity progressively between the 5th and 10th centuries. The Bible was also translated into Georgian in the 5th century, as the Georgian alphabet was developed for that purpose. As was true elsewhere, the Christian church in Georgia was crucial to the development of a written language, and most of the earliest written works were religious texts. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of Mithras, pagan beliefs, and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Georgia.\n\nChristianity gradually replaced all the former religions except Zoroastrianism, which became somewhat of a second established religion in Iberia after the Peace of Acilisene in 378, which placed Georgians permanently on the front line of conflict between the Islamic and Christian worlds. Georgians remained mostly Christian despite repeated invasions by Muslim powers, and long episodes of foreign domination. After Georgia was annexed by the Russian Empire, the Russian Orthodox Church took over the Georgian church in 1811.\n\nThe Georgian church regained its autocephaly only when Russian rule ended in 1917. The Soviet regime that ruled Georgia from 1921 did not consider revitalization of the Georgian church an important goal, however. Soviet rule brought severe purges of the Georgian church hierarchy and frequent repression of Orthodox worship. As elsewhere in the Soviet Union, many churches were destroyed or converted into secular buildings. This history of repression encouraged the incorporation of religious identity into the strong nationalist movement and the quest of Georgians for religious expression outside the official, government-controlled church. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, opposition leaders, especially Zviad Gamsakhurdia, criticized corruption in the church hierarchy. After Ilia II became the patriarch (catholicos) of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the late 1970s, Georgian Orthodoxy experienced a revival. In 1988 Moscow permitted the patriarch to begin consecrating and reopening closed churches, and a large-scale restoration process began. The Georgian Orthodox Church has regained much power and full independence from the state since the restoration of Georgia's independence in 1991. It is not a state religion, but its special status is recognized by the Concordat of 2002.\n\nApart from the Georgian Orthodox Church, Christianity in Georgia is represented by followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, and a Georgian Catholic Church which mostly follows either the Latin Rite or the Armenian rite.\n\nA 2015 study estimates some 1,300 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.\n\nIslam in Georgia was introduced in 645 AD during the reign of third Caliph of Islam, Uthman. During this period, Tbilisi (\"al-Tefelis\") grew into a center of trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe. Islam's history continued in Georgia throughout the late 14th and early 15th centuries with Timur's invasions of Georgia and during the 16th and early 19th centuries, the Iranians (Safavids, Afsharids, Qajars) and Ottomans commanded influence in the region until its annexation by Russia in 1801. In 1703, Vakhtang VI became the ruler of the kingdom of Kartli and he embraced Islam. Other notable Georgian Muslims from that era include David XI of Kartli, Jesse of Kakheti and Simon II of Kartli.\n\nMuslims constitute 9.9%, or 463,062 of the Georgian population. There are two major Muslim groups in Georgia. The ethnic Georgian Muslims are Sunni Hanafi and are concentrated in Autonomous Republic of Adjara of Georgia bordering Turkey. The ethnic Azerbaijani Muslims are predominantly Shia Ithna Ashariyah and are concentrated along the border with Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe Jews have a history in Georgia extending back over 2000 years. Today there is a small Jewish community in the country (3,541 according to the 2002 census), although the Jewish population was over 100,000 as recently as the 1970s. Especially following the collapse of the Soviet Union, almost all of the country's Jews have left, mainly to Israel. The majority of Georgia's remaining Jews today live in Tbilisi and are served by its two synagogues. Because the size of the community is now so small, and for economic reasons, the two congregations are now housed on two storeys of one of the formerly separate synagogues.\n\nThe history of the Bahá'í Faith in Georgia begins with its arrival in the region in 1850 through its association with the precursor religion the Bábí Faith during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. During the period of Soviet policy of religious oppression, the Bahá'ís in the Soviet Republics lost contact with the Bahá'ís elsewhere. However, in 1963 an individual was identified in Tbilisi. Following Perestroika the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Georgia formed in 1991 and Georgian Bahá'ís elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1995. The religion is noted as growing in Georgia.\n\nThe Georgian Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Citizens generally do not interfere with traditional religious groups; however, there have been reports of violence and discrimination against nontraditional religious groups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11935708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11935708", "title": "Res divina", "text": "Res divina\n\nIn ancient Rome, res divinae, singular res divina (Latin for \"divine matters,\" that is, the service of the gods), were the laws that pertained to the religious duties of the state and its officials. Roman law was divided into the \"res divina\" and \"res publica\", the divine and public or political spheres, the latter phrase being the origin of the English word \"republic.\" \"Res divina\" also means, as a technical term, ritual sacrifice.\n\nIn the Roman system of belief, \"religio\" was the acknowledgement of superiors through \"honores\" (honours). \"Caelestes honores\" (\"heavenly honours\") were offered to the gods, and very occasionally to mortals whose actions had earned great benefits for mankind. Earthly hierarchies reflected the celestial order.\n\nCicero, who was both a senator and augur, investigates the nature of \"res divinae\" and \"res humanae\" (human affairs) in his treatise \"De natura deorum\" (\"On the nature of the gods\"). He makes no attempt to develop an internally consistent system in which the rituals of \"res divinae\" might be modified by “higher truths” of doctrine or revelation. He concludes that even if the nature and existence of the gods cannot be proved beyond doubt, it is wise and pragmatic to honour them by piously offering the time-hallowed rites. Rome's continued success might depend on it. Cicero's reasoning offers a stark contrast to later Judaeo-Christian definitions of religion as spiritual and godly in contrast — or opposition — to those things regarded as material and temporal.\n\n\"Res divina\" is an example of ancient Roman religious terminology that was taken over and redefined for Christian purposes, in this case by Augustine. In Augustinian usage, \"res divina\" is a \"divine reality\" as represented by a \"sacrum signum\" (\"sacred sign\") such as a sacrament.\n\nThe multivolume \"Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum\" was one of the chief works of Varro (1st century BC), who was the major source on traditional Roman religion for the Church Fathers. It was a particular target of polemic for Augustine, who incidentally preserves much of what is known about its content and structure. Varro devoted 25 books of the \"Antiquitates\" to \"res humanae\" (\"human affairs\") and 16 to \"res divinae\". His emphasis is deliberate; he treats cult and ritual as human constructs, and divides \"res divinae\" into three kinds:\nThis schema is Stoic in origin, but Varro adapts it to the political and cultural concerns of his time.\n\nThe heart of Rome’s natural order was the city of Rome, home to the gods of state, their cults and their senior priest-officials, who in the Republic were the ruling consuls. Rome’s most powerful god, \"Jupiter Optimus Maximus\" (Jupiter greatest and best) favoured “his” city because his own power and status were constructed by the Roman law, rites and sacrifice which elevated and honoured him. The same principles constructed the various powers and honours of all other gods of the state pantheon. Public cults (\"sacra publica\") were state funded, at least in principle, and most priesthoods occupied by high-ranking citizens.\n\nArchaic Rome was part of a broader civilisation which included Latin, colonial Greek and possibly Carthaginian elements, dominated by the Etruscans - the rites of the \"haruspex\", for example, were almost certainly Etruscan. In its ascendancy from local to Imperial power, Rome pragmatically embraced the local cults of its neighbouring villages and towns, then of city-states and provinces. Local cult became an instrument of Roman administration, run by locally elected official-priests. Their \"foreign\" gods never became gods of the Roman state as a whole, but were an essential feature of reciprocal relations between Rome and its provinces. In approximately 155 CE, Aelius Aristides would remark that his own favourite gods, Asclepius, Isis and Serapis, were widely revered in the Empire \"because\" of the favour shown them by Rome.\n\n"}

They were brothers, sons of Remus, and thus Romulus was their uncle.\n\nTraditions developed in Siena, which can not be documented prior to the 16th century hold that after Romulus murdered their father during the Foundation of Rome, Senius (who gave name to the city) and his brother Aschius were forced to flee Rome on horseback, riding respectively on a black horse and a white one, giving rise to the colors on the Balzana, the coat of arms of Siena.\n\nSome tellings of the legend hold that the brothers were protected by the Gods with a white cloud during the day and a dark cloud at night. They also claim the brothers stole the statue of the Capitoline Wolf from the Temple of Apollo in Rome. However, since the brothers were descendants of Remus, Siena did have a claim to be descendants of one of the siblings nurtured by the she-wolf (lupa), which serves as a symbol of Rome.\n\nThe Porta Camollia, in the Walls of Siena, is putatively named after an emissary or soldier sent to lure the brothers back to Rome, but who elected to stay instead.\n\nOne role of the legend is to grant the Sienese a noble and ancient ancestry; Rome itself had sought such a pedigree with the story of the Aeneid of Virgil. Many cities in the Italian peninsula seeking pre-eminence, such as Venice and Florence, also looked for a foundation story to link their city to greatness. It is possible that the black and white colors and history were meant to try to maintain a common bond even among the fractious Sienese, especially when torn by Guelf and Ghibelline civil strife and factionalism.\n"}

The ancient Taoist texts of the \"Taiping Jing\" suggest that individuals who attained the state of complete ziran would not need food at all, but instead could sustain themselves by absorbing the cosmic qi.\n\nThe Chinese word for food or dishes, \"cai\" () originally means green vegetables. The invention of the vegetarian food tofu was credit to a Taoist. Taoist religious orders and literatures often encourage practitioners to be vegetarian to minimize harms, because all life forms are considered sentient. Taoist levels of dietary restriction, however, are varied.\n\n\n"}

There is evidence of an earlier Neolithic settlement at the site dating back to the seventh or sixth millennium BC. The site was identified as ancient Suksi, which was mentioned in the Ugarit tablets and was probably the southernmost port of the Kingdom of Ugarit. The Bronze Age settlement was probably destroyed along with the capital, Ugarit, during the Bronze Age collapse. The site was reused shortly thereafter and commercial activity at the Iron Age settlement can be traced again to at least the tenth century BC, when it became the port of Luhuti, A Phoenician settlement was established in the eighth century BC and the town thrived as a Greek trading outpost between c. 850 BC and c. 550 BC, when it was destroyed by the Babylonians. Recent excavations reveal that the site was inhabited again by the Phoenicians between 380 and 69 BC until it was destroyed again, possibly by an earthquake. It was later re-occupied for a short period by the Crusaders.\n\nThe site was excavated in 1958–1963 by the Danish Carlsberg Expedition to Phoenicia under P.J. Riis. Excavations uncovered an early Iron Age cemetery south of the tell which was dated to between the 13th and 10th century BC. Excavations also uncovered a large seventh-century Phoenician temple. The abundance of Greek pottery and the discovery of Greek burial grounds suggest that the city became a permanent Hellenic outpost by 600 BC.\n\n"}

The book sets a new standard of excellence for works on religion and psychology. Although it lacks any biological or psychiatric focus, I highly recommend it to colleagues who desire to organize their thoughts about religion.\" (p. 988).\n\nIn \"The Gerontologist\", George wrote that it was \n\nthe Best book that I have read on religion from a psychosocial perspective. As the title indicates, the primary focus of this volume is examination of the links between religion and coping. One of the important qualities of this book is that there is no effort to view religion as one form of coping or to view coping as a manifest function of religion. Each concept is treated in careful conceptual and empirical detail, and the links that emerge testify to the importance of each, separately and jointly. The scope of the book is encyclopedic. I could not identify a question that I had that was not addressed. (p. 508)\nIn the \"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\", McFadden wrote that \n\nThis book represents a major theoretical and empirical contribution not only to the psychology of religion and clinical/counseling psychology but to other fields as well. Along with psychologists, persons in religious professions can learn much from Pargament. Mental health professionals, who traditionally have shunned religion in their own lives and in the lived experience of their clients, might be persuaded by Pargament's broadband approach to investigate how religion operates in the tales of coping and crisis they hear on a daily basis. (p. 368)\n\nShe added that\n\nThis book is also appropriate for use in courses on the psychology of religion. My students have responded positively to Pargament's careful exposition of his theory, the support he offers in examples from his research and clinical practice, and his engaging use of metaphor. (pp. 368-369)\nIn the \"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\", McIntosh wrote that \n\nThe weaknesses of this book are a function of its strengths. By aiming for a wide audience the book must cover a lot of ground, some of which is elementary review for some of the readership. The book probes deeply into the complexities of the topic and is encyclopedic in its coverage of the research; it is therefore somewhat daunting in size. By not avoiding the theoretical controversies and empirical weaknesses in this area, the conclusions are sometimes uncertain and the implications more muddy than in less open-eyed, more partisan work... I highly recommend this book to scholars and practitioners of psychology and religion. It will likely be a long wait until another such impressive work in this area appears. (pp. 702-703)\n"}
