Since 2015, Warner has also fulfilled the diocesan-wide role of alternative episcopal oversight, following the decision by Mark Sowerby, Bishop of Horsham, to recognise the orders of priests and bishops who are women.\n\nThe episcopal see at Selsey was founded by Saint Wilfrid, formerly Bishop of the Northumbrians, for the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Sussex in the late 7th century. He was granted land by Æthelwealh of Sussex to build a cathedral at Selsey. However, shortly afterwards Cædwalla of Wessex conquered the Kingdom of Sussex, but he confirmed the grant to Wilfrid. The bishop's seat was located at Selsey Abbey. Nine years after the Norman conquest, in 1075, the Council of London enacted that episcopal sees should be removed to cities or larger towns. Accordingly, the see at Selsey was removed to Chichester. Some sources claim that Stigand, the last Bishop of Selsey, continued to use the title Bishop of Selsey until 1082, before adopting the new title Bishop of Chichester, indicating that the transfer took several years to complete.\n\n\n"}

The name was changed to Dresden-Meissen on 15 November 1979. \n\nThe diocese is vacant.\n\nLists of the Bishops of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen and its precursor offices\n\nThe Bishops resided until 1595 in Wurzen. In 1559 the diocesan temporalities within Saxony were seized by the Electorate of Saxony.\n\nIn the Meisen diocesan area located outside of then Saxony in Lower and Upper Lusatia there was no immediate overlord, since the then liege lord of the Two Lusatias, the Catholic king of Bohemia (in personal union Holy Roman Emperor) held the Lusatias as fief outright. The Kings of Bohemia did not effectively offend the spreading of the Protestant Reformation in the Two Lusatias. So it depended on the local vassals if Lutheranism prevailed or not, following the principle of Cuius regio, eius religio. The Two Lusatias thus became an area of regionally altering predominant denomination. In 1560 Meissen's last bishop John IX had appointed Johann Leisentrit as diocesan administrator for the Lusatian part of the diocese, seated in Bautzen. After the Holy See had recognised as a matter of fact the suppression of the Meissen diocese within Saxony it converted its Lusatian part into an apostolic prefecture (Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen) in 1567 with administrator Leisentrit elevated to prefect. In canon law an apostolic prefecture is a diocese on approval. \n\nAccording to its seat or its area comprised the prefecture was alternatively also called \"Apostolic Prefecture of Bautzen\" or \"Apostolic Prefecture of the Two Lusatias\", respectively. When in 1635 the Lutheran Electorate of Saxony annexed the Two Lusatias it guaranteed in the cession contract (\"Traditionsrezess\") with Bohemia to leave the existing religious relations untouched. As a signatory of the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 Saxony later agreed to maintain the religious status quo as given in the reference year of 1624 in all its territories acquired since. After the Prussian annexation of Lower Lusatia and easterly Upper Lusatia in 1815 the Holy See disentangled the newly Prussian diocesan area and incorporated it into the Prussian diocese of Breslau in 1821. The remaining diocese, officially always called Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen, was thus also called the \"Apostolic Prefecture of (Saxon) Upper Lusatia\". The office of the apostolic prefect was held in personal union by the cathedral dean of Bautzen Cathedral. In the 19th century the episcopal function of the apostolic prefects was further emphasised by appointing them simultaneously with titular sees. \n\n"}

{"id": "1434196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1434196", "title": "Christian liturgy", "text": "Christian liturgy\n\nChristian liturgy is a pattern for worship used (whether recommended or prescribed) by a Christian congregation or denomination on a regular basis. Although the term liturgy is used to mean public worship in general, the Byzantine Rite uses the term \"Divine Liturgy\" to denote the Eucharistic service.\n\nIt often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism. Liturgy is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the 'Word of God' (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. In most Christian traditions, liturgies are presided over by clergy wherever possible.\n\nDifferent Christian traditions have employed different rites:\n\n\nWhile some Protestant churches see no need for set liturgies, many of these churches have retained them.\n\nProtestant Reformation-era ministers of the Reformed tradition used set liturgies which emphasized preaching and the Bible. English Puritans and separatists moved away from set forms in the 17th-century, but many Reformed churches retained liturgies and continue to use them today.\n\n\nAt the time of English Reformation, The Sarum Rite was in use along with the Roman Rite. Reformers in England wanted the Latin mass translated into the English language. Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer authored the \"Exhortation and Litany\" in 1544. This was the earliest English-language service book of the Church of England, and the only English-language service to be finished within the lifetime of King Henry VIII. In 1549, Cranmer produced a complete English-language liturgy. Cranmer was largely responsible for the first two editions of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". The first edition was predominantly pre-Reformation in its outlook. The Communion Service, Lectionary, and collects in the liturgy were translations based on the Sarum Rite as practised in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nThe revised edition in 1552 sought to assert a more clearly Protestant liturgy after problems arose from conservative interpretation of the mass on the one hand, and a critique by Martin Bucer (Butzer) on the other. Successive revisions are based on this edition, though important alterations appeared in 1604 and 1662. The 1662 edition is still authoritative in the Church of England and has served as the basis for many of Books of Common Prayer of national Anglican churches around the world. Those deriving from Scottish Episcopal descent, like the Prayer Books of the American Episcopal Church, have a slightly different liturgical pedigree.\n\n\nThe United Methodist liturgical tradition is based on the Anglican heritage and was passed along to Methodists by John Wesley (an Anglican priest who led the early Methodist revival) who wrote that \nWhen the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England, John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The \"Book of Common Prayer\" called the \"Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America\". Wesley's \"Sunday Service\" has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since.\n\nThe United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick for healing, and daily office 'praise and prayer' services. Along with these, there are also special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. All of these liturgies and services are contained in \"The United Methodist Hymnal\" and \"The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)\". Many of these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition's \"Book of Common Prayer\". In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, vestments, paraments, banners, and liturgical art.\n\nThe liturgy of the Church of South India combines many traditions, including that of the Methodists and such smaller churches as the Church of the Brethren and the Disciples of Christ. After the formation of the Church of South India the first synod met at Madurai in March 1948 and appointed a liturgical committee. The first Synod in 1948 (where the Holy Communion service was that of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland) appointed a liturgy committee, composed mainly of Western theologians. The liturgy so prepared was first used at the Synod Session in 1950 and approved for use throughout the church \"wherever it is desired\" in 1954. The first version of the Confirmation Service for the new church was also released in 1950, translated into regional languages and was quickly adopted by the various dioceses.\n\nBy 1962 the Liturgy Committee was able to prepare a number of Orders. They were Eucharist, Morning and Evening Prayer, Marriage Service, Burial Service, Ordination Service and Covenant Service (1954), Holy Baptism (1955) and Almanac (1955–56). The \"Book of Common Worship\" of the CSI was published in 1963 with all the above orders of service. The orders of service consist of: Order for Morning and Evening Worship, Order of Service for the Baptized Persons, Order for Holy Baptism, Order for the Churching of Women, Order for Holy Matrimony, Order for the Burial Service, Order for the Covenant Service, Order for Ordination Services.\n\nThe CSI liturgy was again revised in the year 2004 and published as a hardback book in 2006.\n\nThe CSI Synod Liturgical Committee has developed several new orders for worship for different occasions. The order for the Communion Service, known as the CSI Liturgy, has been internationally acclaimed as an important model for new liturgies. The Committee has also produced three different cycles of lectionaries for daily Bible readings and \"propers\", and collects for Communion services. In addition, the Committee has also brought out a Supplement to the \"Book of Common Worship\".\n\n\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic \"Mass\" is the service in which the Eucharist is celebrated. In Latin, the corresponding word is \"Missa\", taken from the dismissal at the end of the liturgy - \"Ite, Missa est\", literally \"Go, it is the dismissal\", translated idiomatically in the current English Roman Missal as \"Go forth, the Mass is ended.\" Eastern Orthodox churches call this service the \"Divine Liturgy\". Oriental Orthodox call their Liturgy the Holy Qurbana - Holy Offering. Anglicans often use the Roman Catholic term \"mass\", or simply \"Holy Eucharist\". Mass is the common term used in the Lutheran Church in Europe but more often referred to as the Divine Service, Holy Communion, or the Holy Eucharist in North American Lutheranism.\n\nLutherans retained and utilized much of the Roman Catholic mass since the early modifications by Martin Luther. The general order of the mass and many of the various aspects remain similar between the two traditions. Latin titles for the sections, psalms, and days has been widely retained, but more recent reforms have omitted this. Recently, Lutherans have adapted much of their revised mass to coincide with the reforms and language changes brought about by post-Vatican II changes.\n\nProtestant traditions vary in their liturgies or \"orders of worship\" (as they are commonly called). Other traditions in the west often called \"Mainline\" have benefited from the Liturgical Movement which flowered in the mid/late 20th Century. Over the course of the past several decades, these Protestant traditions have developed remarkably similar patterns of liturgy, drawing from ancient sources as the paradigm for developing proper liturgical expressions. Of great importance to these traditions has been a recovery of a unified pattern of Word and Sacrament in Lord's Day liturgy.\n\nMany other Protestant Christian traditions (such as the Pentecostal/Charismatics, Assembly of God, and Non-denominational churches), while often following a fixed \"order of worship\", tend to have liturgical practices that vary from that of the broader Christian tradition.\n\n\"Matins\" is generally said in the morning, independently of the Eucharist. \"Vespers\" are prayers generally said in the evening, independently of the Eucharist. Matins and Vespers are the two main prayer times of Christian churches, and are also called Morning and Evening Prayer.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, these two offices are part of a series of prayer hours, called the Liturgy of the Hours, the Canonical Hours, the Divine Office, the Roman Breviary, and other names. There were eight such hours, corresponding to certain times of the day: Matins (sometimes called Vigils), Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. The Second Vatican Council ordered the suppression of Prime.\n\nIn monasteries, Matins was generally celebrated before dawn, or sometimes over the course of a night; Lauds at the end of Matins, generally at the break of day; Prime at 6 AM; Terce at 9AM; Sext at noon; None at 3PM; Vespers at the rising of the Vespers or Evening Star (usually about 6PM); and Compline was said at the end of the day, generally right before bed time.\n\nIn Anglican churches, the offices were combined into two offices: Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, the latter sometimes known as Evensong. In more recent years, the Anglicans have added the offices of Noonday and Compline to Morning and Evening Prayer as part of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". The Anglican Breviary, containing 8 full offices, is not the official liturgy of the Anglican Church.\n\nIn Lutheranism, like Anglicanism, the offices were also combined into the two offices of Matins and Vespers (both of which are still maintained in modern Lutheran prayer books and hymnals). A common practice among Lutherans in America is to pray these offices mid-week during Advent and Lent. The office of Compline is also found in some older Lutheran worship books and more typically used in monasteries and seminaries.\n\nThe Byzantine Rite maintains a daily cycle of seven non-sacramental services:\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday; for details, see Canonical hours — Aggregates.\n\n\"Great Vespers\" as it is termed in the Byzantine Rite, is an extended vespers service used on the eve of a major Feast day, or in conjunction with the divine liturgy, or certain other special occasions.\n\nThis section will describe the evolution of the liturgical celebration known as the Mass by Roman Catholics, which appears similar to Anglican mass or Holy Eucharist. It is called the Divine Liturgy by many groups of Orthodox Christians.\n\nGenerally it is theorized that the Apostles obeyed the command \"do this in memory of me\", said during the Last Supper, and performed the liturgy in the houses of Christians. Besides repeating the action of Jesus, using the bread and wine, and saying his words (known as the words of the institution), the rest of the ritual seems to have been rooted in the Jewish Passover Seder, and synagogue services, including singing of hymns (especially the Psalms, often responsively) and reading from the Scriptures (Bible).\n\nUntil the 4th century, when the church established a Biblical canon, a manner of things were read during the liturgy besides the Prophets, including papal encyclicals from Pope St. Clement. Many elements of these liturgies began to be fixed in several popular settings, and a book called the Apostolic Constitutions, from the fourth century, shows an outline for the liturgy which is incorporated in almost all Western and Eastern rites. This includes the use of the prayer known as the Sanctus, which is prefaced by a long introduction; it also includes a fairly fixed series of prayers leading up to the consecration.\n\nVestments worn by the Bishops and Priests at this point were academic robes of the educated class. Later, as fashions changed the styles for the clergy remained the same and were embellished. Following the custom of the synagogue, the liturgy was normally sung. Many places divided the congregation into male and female. At some point both Western and Eastern churches adopted the use of curtains to mask the clergy at the altar at certain points; this curtain became the rood screen and altar rails in western churches, and iconostasis in the Byzantine East, while still being used in Armenian and Syriac Churches.\n\nThe earliest church used Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek in the liturgy. Over time, however, the local vernacular languages became the liturgical languages of later centuries. The Greek-speaking empire retained the mainly Greek liturgy. The West used Latin, eventually dropping most Greek usage. Egypt and Armenia used Coptic and classical Armenian, respectively. As Christianity spread to different nations around the Mediterranean, several distinct traditions developed, each with a different liturgical language: the Alexandrine Tradition (Coptic), Syriac Tradition (Syriac), Byzantine Tradition (Greek), Armenian Tradition (Armenian), and the Latin Tradition (Latin).\n\nThese basic traditions gave rise to several distinct rites. The Coptic and Ethiopic rites came from the Alexandrine Tradition. The Chaldean, Malabar, Syriac, Malankar, and Maronite rites developed from the Syriac Tradition. The Greek and Slav variants of the Byzantine liturgy emerged from the Byzantine Tradition. The Armenian rite developed from the Armenian Tradition. The Roman, Ambrosian, and Mozarabic liturgical rites came from the Latin Tradition. These regional variations of the liturgy over time diverged into distinct branches of the Christian liturgical tradition, each retaining fundamental characteristics with external particulars influenced by local customs and traditions.\n\nIn the particular Latin Church of the Catholic Church throughout earlier centuries there was much regional variation in the liturgy due to the lack of centralisation that existed in the western church at the time due to the fall of the western empire. This resulted in regional variations of the Latin liturgical rite such as the Celtic rite and Gallican rite, of which today only the Mozarabic rite and Ambrosian rite remain in addition to the normative Roman rite. The liturgical rite was standardized throughout much of the Catholic Church.\n\nStandardization was enforced at the Council of Trent, which suppressed regional variations in favour of the Roman liturgical rite. Most of the particulars of the resulting Tridentine Mass were already in existence in the usage of Rome. Pope Pius V permitted rites in existence for at least 200 years to continue in use; however, in the following centuries almost all rites were abandoned except those of religious orders and the afore-mentioned Ambrosian and Mozarabic liturgical rites.\n\nThere are common elements found in most Western liturgical churches which predate the Protestant Reformation. These include:\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

Du'aat-دعاۃ. In the Fatimid era Ismā'īlī faith, the term \"dā'ī\" has been used to refer to important religious leaders other than the hereditary Imāms working under their commands known as ad-Da'i al-Bilaagh (Arabic: الداعي البلاغ), and the Da'wah or \"Mission\" is a spiritually guided clerical-style organisation. \"The Da'wah\" was a term for the Ismā'īlī faith itself from early on. They are also called Dā'ī Syednas.\nAccording to Ismā'īlī Musta'alavī Tayyabī tradition, before the 21st Fatimid Musta'alavi Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim went into state of occultation from Cairo in 528 AH/1134 AD, his father, the 20th Imām al-Amīr had instructed Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi/Al-Hurra Al-Malika in Yemen to anoint a vicegerent after the occultation - the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq, who as the Imām's vicegerent, has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal. It is the spiritual rank in Isma'ili Da'wah which became more explicit and operational after the seclusion of 21st Imam. After Prophet Mohammad this rank is on the 6th position and after this comes Mazoon-مأذون and Mukaasir-مکاسر who are in turn appointed by the Dā'ī al-Mutlaq. Before the seclusion, the Da’i or a missionary works under the direct orders of Imaam and his trusted associates in all the 12 islands-جزائر where faithful were present and living openly propounding their faith or secretly due to the fear of their lives.\n\nDuring the Imam's occultation, the Dā'ī al-Mutlaq is appointed by his predecessor in office. Da’i was given Itlaaq-إطلاق or a free conduct and absolute religious and social authority but under the governing principles of Isma’ili Taiyebi Faith. His command is regarded as a final decree guided by the divine support of Imam and this is the reason he is called Da’i al-Mutlaq. Unlike the case of Imam, where he appoints his successor only from his sons through divinely guided practice called Nass-نص, the Da’i can appoint anyone in his place who is most trusted, pious and capable of carrying Da’wah affairs with wisdom and proficiency. The first Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Taiyabi Ismaili sects was Syedna Zoeb bin Moosa.\n\nThe Dā'ī al-Mutlaq is recognised in English law as a corporation sole, by a private act of Parliament passed in 1993.\n\nNass-نص is a declaration and designation through Divine Indication and Spiritual Intervention-تأئید إلھي for the appointment of a successor-منصوص, be it an Imam or his deputy-داعي during Imam’s concealment by his predecessor-ناص amongst his subjects, publicly-نص جلي or privately-نص خفي and at times supported by written documentary orders-سجل شریف. This tradition and practice-سنۃ اللہ is related to the Isma’ili Taiyebi succession to the seat of Imaamat, whereby each Imam under hidden heavenly commands designates his successor, when he witnesses the Light of Imaamat-نور الإمامۃ has got transferred to one of his sons whom he selects for Nass. During the seclusion of Imam, his deputy-Da’i performs this act of succession whom he finds eligible for the status of Da’i. He might not be from his sons, unlike the succession of Imam where an Imam always appoints his successor from one of his sons. \n\nThe appointment according to Shi'a faith and sources is when Mohammad appointed his son-in-law, cousin and his heir 'Ali bin Abi Taalib as his Vicegerent, legatee and Wali of the Faithful. This Prophetic tradition is followed throughout the centuries be it the appointment of Imam or Da'i and as per Isma'ili-Taiyebi principles it is the belief that no Imam or Da'i dies without the appointment of his successor and this will continue till the Last Day of this World.\n\n\n\nالداعي المطلق، داعي المطلق - ad-Da'i ul-Mutlaq or Da'i al-Mutlaq: It is the spiritual rank in Isma'ili Da'wah which became more explicit and operational after the seclusion of 21st Fatimid Imam of Cairo, Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb in 528 AH/1134 AD.

In Yemen, after the seclusion, Da’i was given Itlaaq-إطلاق or a free conduct and absolute religious and social authority but under the governing principles of Isma’ili Taiyebi Faith. His command is regarded as a final decree guided by the divine support of Imam and this is the reason he is called Da'i al-Mutlaq. Unlike the case of Imam, where he appoints his successor only from his sons through divinely guided practice called Nass-نص, the Da’i can appoint anyone in his place who is most trusted, pious and capable of carrying Da’wah affairs with wisdom and proficiency. \n\nالمأذون المطلق - al-Mazoon al-Mutlaq, Mazoon e Mutlaq: The Licentiate, Authoritative Rank, the most trusted associate in Da’wah ranks who takes Bay’at-Pledge of Loyalty from his subjects by the orders of Da’i al-Mutlaq. He is on a Spiritual Rank in the Isma’ili Taiyebi Da’wah hierarchy immediately below the authority of Da’i who sits in his right side and who carries out the religious activities as per the regulations of Da’wah organization. At any cost he always assists and obeys his superior and his Master, the Da’i al-Mutlaq. His prime responsibility is to conduct teaching sessions and make them understand the basic things of Isma’ili Taiyebi faith. In the absence of Da’i he acts as his legatee. Da’i may appoint his Mazoon as his successor. And if not Da’i can appoint someone more learned and efficient for the post of Da’i after him and can never disqualifies Mazoon from his post. As the respectable post of Mazoon is necessary for the completeness of Spiritual Hierarchy. On the death of Mazoon, Da'i immediately appoints another trusted person on this rank.\n\nالمکاسر المطلق - al-Mukaasir al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir e Mutlaq - The Eight and the last rank in the Spiritual Hierarchy of the Isma’ili Taiyebism.[38] He sits left to the Da’i al-Mutlaq during the religious gathering-Majlis. He is lower to the rank of Mazoon. He is well versed and well informed about the baseless beliefs of other sects for which he thinks as a threat to the faith of believers. His responsibility is to train the beginner - مستجیب مؤمن and win over the neophyte who is little aware of the overall understanding of Islamic Faith and by proper grooming he enters him into the fold of Isma’ilism by taking Oath of Fealty in the name of the present Da’i al-Mutlaq. He is quite expert in putting Rational and Logical arguments with necessary ideological and doctrinal proofs and healthy debates. On the death of Mukaasir, Da'i entrusts this rank to one of his close associates. In some cases, on the death of Mazoon, Da'i elevates Mukaasir to the rank of Mazoon.\n\nThe Dawoodi Bohra follow Ismaili Shia Islam as propagated by the Fatimid Imamate in medieval Egypt. They pray 3 times a day joining both afternoon prayers Zuhr and Asr and both evening prayers Maghreb and Isha, fast in the month of Ramadan, perform Haj and Umrahand give Zakat.\n\nTaher Fakhruddin is a claimant to the title of 54th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras, a sect within Ismaili Shia Islam. He is the oldest son of Khuzaima Qutbuddin, the claimant to the position of 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq. After the death of the 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, due to the succession controversy two claimants emerged, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin and Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Khuzaima Qutbuddin died on 30 March 2016. On 31 March 2016 the family of Qutbuddin released a statement that \"Khuzaima Qutbuddin has conferred nass (announcement of successor) on his son Syedna Taher Fakhruddin\". Followers of Qutbuddin regard Taher Fakhruddin as a rightly appointed Da'i al-Mutlaq whereas followers of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin do not recognize him as the Da'i al-Mutlaq. \n\nThis title is also used in the Alavi Bohra community to refer to their leader (in the Persian form \"Da'i-e-Mutlaq\") for similar reasons. At present Saiyedna Haatim Zakiyuddin is the 45th Da’i al-Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras in the line of succession of these Da’is in which 24 are in Yemen, 7 are in Ahmedabad, 1 is in Surat and 12 are in Vadodara. The 44th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Abu Haatim Taiyeb Ziyauddin (d. 05-08-1436 AH/23-05-2015) appointed his eldest son Haatim Zakiyuddin as his successor.\n\nThe Sulaymani branch of Tayyibi Isma'ilism is an Islamic community, of which around 70 thousand members reside in Yemen, while a few thousands of Sulaymani Bohras can be found in India and Pakistan. The Sulaymanis are headed by a da'i al-mutlaq from the Makrami family. The Sulaymanis split off from the Tayyibi community, following a succession dispute upon the death of Da'ud bin Ajabshah in 1589. While most of the Tayyibis in India recognised Da'ud Burhan al-Din as his successor and thus forming the Da'udi Bohras, the Yemeni community followed Sulayman bin Hassan. Starting from 1677, Sulayman's successors almost always came from the Makrami family. The \"da'i\"s made Najran their headquarters and ruled the area, supported by the Banu Yam, until their power waned under the successive rules of the Ottomans and Saudis.\n\nThe Atba-i-Malak community are a branch of Musta'ali Isma'ili Shi'a Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq, under the leadership of Abdul Hussain Jivaji in 1840. They have further split into two more branches. The Atba-e-Malak Badar is a branch of Atba-i-Malak Mustaali Ismaili Shi'a Islam. They follow the preachings of both Abdul Hussain Jivaji and Badruddin Ghulam Hussain Miya Khan Saheb. The current leader or Dai al Mutlaq is Maulana Muhammad Amiruddin Malak Saheb. The Atba-i-Malak Badar community is based in Mahdibagh, Nagpur in India. The Mahdibagh Atba-i-Malak Badar community, is a unique community of peaceful and progressive Muslims, an elitist sect, known as Atba-e-Malak Badar (followers of Maulana Malak and Maulana Badar) named after the two founders of the religious order who founded it in 1891 AD in Nagpur, India. The Atba-i-Malak Vakil is a branch of Atba-i-Malak Mustaali Ismaili Shi'a Islam. They follow Abdul Qadir Ebrahimji, who they believe to be the true successor to Abdul Hussain Jivaji. Their current leader is Tayyebhai Razzak.\n\n\n"}

He and his wife Sheila joined Scientology in the early 1960s and Gaiman served as public relations director and was commonly in the media during the British controversies over Scientology in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nGaiman's family is of Polish Jewish origins; after emigrating from the Netherlands in 1916, his father eventually settled in the Hampshire city of Portsmouth on the south coast of England and established a chain of grocery stores. Born in 1933, Gaiman was educated at The Portsmouth Grammar School, though he did not excel academically. He subsequently joined the British Army where he rose to the rank of sergeant. He returned to Portsmouth on leaving the army to work for his father in the grocery stores, though he detested this job.\n\nHe married Sheila on 1 March 1959. He eventually decided to go into business for himself, much to his father's displeasure, and the family moved away from their home in Portchester in 1962.\n\nWhen the Gaimans discovered Scientology they moved to East Grinstead, West Sussex in 1965. David Gaiman joined the staff of the Church of Scientology at nearby Saint Hill Manor, eventually becoming the Church's chief UK media spokesman.\n\nHe joined the Guardian's Office (GO), the Church's public relations bureau/intelligence agency. In 1969, Gaiman was involved in an attempt by the Church to take over the National Association for Mental Health (now Mind), a British mental health charity. Some 300 Scientologists joined the group and nominated Gaiman, among others, for high office. Gaiman was nominated for the Chairmanship. Eventually, the Scientologists were asked to resign but contested that request in court. Scientologists also held demonstrations for, according to Gaiman, \"humane treatment and a bill of rights for mental patients and the protection of their bodies and their well-being. We want an independent inquiry into conditions in mental hospitals. We want no more whitewashing from certain mental health organisations like the one across the road. Our stand is not on being asked to resign but for humane psychiatry.\"\n\nIn the 1970s he became Deputy Guardian for Public Relations World Wide and Minister of Public Affairs for the Churches of Scientology Worldwide, as well as serving as public spokesman.\n\nAccording to documents in the US vs Kember and Budlong case, Gaiman issued an order in 1975 for an operation to put false information in US security agency computers using planted agents. It was known as 'Operation Cat'. Kember also credited Gaiman with the strategy to claim that CoS plants inside the American Medical Association were reporters for \"Freedom\" magazine.\n\nHe rose to become the head of GO Public Relations and was a member of the powerful Watchdog Committee. In 1981 he was promoted to the position of Guardian (i.e. head of the Guardian's Office), replacing Jane Kember following her criminal conviction for conspiracy against the US Government (she had been part of Scientology's Operation Snow White).\n\nIn 1965, David and Sheila Gaiman co-founded a vitamin shop, G&G Vitamins. In 1987 G&G moved to larger premises and began to manufacture its own label vitamins for the first time. With David’s leadership the demand for G&G’s own-brand label and manufacturing expertise grew dramatically and in 1997 they moved to a 31,000 square foot factory and built a customised clean-room for optimum high speed production lines. It was from here that G&G expanded its contract manufacturing arm, building up to the current capacity to manufacture 14,000,000 capsules per month for numerous companies across the UK and Europe under their own label. Today G&G is still a family-owned business under the leadership of Mauro Calcioli, David’s son-in-law. Mauro, who was appointed as Chairman in April 2009, is assisted by his wife Lizzy Calcioli and Sheila Gaiman. Sheila stands today as one of the longest serving members of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. In April 2009 they appointed Myles McEntyre as Managing Director to run G&G on a day-to-day basis. The Gaimans were prominent figures in the local community and well known for their sponsorship of the local arts scene. Gaiman was also a trustee of Greenfield's School from its formation in the 1980s.\nGaiman had three children, a son and two daughters: Neil Gaiman, the well-known fantasy author, Claire Edwards, head of Scientology Missions International, and Lizzy Calcioli.\n\nGaiman took part in the inaugural London Marathon, in 1981, and came joint last.\n\nGaiman, aged 75, had a heart attack during a business meeting and was dead by the time he reached hospital. A memorial service, attended by hundreds, was held for him at Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, and, on 12 March 2009, his Jewish funeral service was held in Brighton.\n\n"}

In 2007, it opened to young people from multi-denominational backgrounds in multiple sessions.\n\nThe main program is the Israel Trail Teen Adventure (ITTA), a month-long hiking program covering some 215 kilometers in northern and southern Israel. The program is divided into gender-segregated groups with each group operating independently.\n\nElements of the program include hiking and biking in areas mentioned in the Bible along with development of outdoor living and leadership skills. Participants are taught map-reading, setting up camp and preparing meals, combined with swimming, rock-climbing and other outdoor pursuits. The participants keep kosher and observe Shabbat, exploring Judaism through relevant biblical texts on topics relating to nature.\n\nOther programs include smaller trips and educational programming covering topics such as water conservation education and wilderness halacha (Jewish law). The Derech Hateva program goals are to integrate teaching of outdoor skills, ecology, Leave No Trace ethics and Jewish learning.\n\n"}
{"id": "25116037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25116037", "title": "Doren Robbins", "text": "Doren Robbins\n\nDoren Robbins (born August 20, 1949 in Los Angeles, California) is a contemporary American poet, prose poet, fiction writer, essayist, mixed media artist, and educator. As a cultural activist, he has organized and developed projects for Amnesty International, the Salvadoran Medical Relief Fund, the Romero Relief Fund, and poetsagainstthewar.org. Robbins has lived most of his life in California and Oregon.\n\nDoren Robbins has published poetry, prose poetry, short fiction, literary criticism and book reviews in over one hundred journals, including \"The American Poetry Review\", \"North Dakota Quarterly\", \"Cimarron Review\", \"Hawaii Review\", \"Indiana Review\", \"International Poetry\", \"Kayak\", \"Onthebus\", \"Paterson Literary Review\", \"Pemmican\", \"Sulfur\", \"New Letters\", \"5 AM\", \"Willow Springs\", and \"Hayden's Ferry Review\". In spring 2008, Eastern Washington University Press published a new book of poems, \"My Piece of the Puzzle\". His previous collection of poetry, \"Driving Face Down\", won the Blue Lynx Prize for Poetry. In 2004, Cedar Hill Publications published \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\". A mixed media artist as well as a writer, two of his works are currently on exhibit at the Crossing Boundaries: Visual Art by Writers exhibit, held at the Paterson Museum in New Jersey. His collage-portrait of Kenneth Rexroth, \"Angles with Fissures\", appeared in the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center documentary film, \"Kenneth Rexroth Centennial\".\n\nRobbins has been a teacher of Creative Writing, Poetry, English Composition, Shakespeare, and Multicultural Literature since 1991 at the University of Iowa, UCLA, East Los Angeles Community College, and California State University (Dominguez Hills). He has been awarded three times by the Foothill College Honors Institute for his teaching. Currently he is Professor of Creative Writing and Literature at Foothill College. Robbins was director of the Foothill College Writers' Conference 2003, 2006–2008.\n\nUnion Institute, BA, 1990. The University of Iowa, MFA, 1993. Two years post-graduate studies in literature, multiculturalism, and criticism at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, 1994–96.\n\nDoren Robbins began actively publishing poetry in the 1970s. In 1969, while reading Henry Miller's \"The Time of the Assassins\", his study of Arthur Rimbaud, Robbins became aware of Kenneth Rexroth's poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable \"Memorial\" for Dylan Thomas, \"Thou Shalt Not Kill,\" about which Miller stated, \"If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this \"'Memorial.'\" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with \"The Diary of Najinsky\", Van Gogh's \"Letters\", Kenneth Patchen's \"The Journal of Albion Moonlight\", Jack Hirschman's \"Artaud Anthology\", and Wilhelm Reich's \"The Murder of Christ\", making the connection to Rexroth's elegy for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted alienation of society with the vulnerability and ensuing martyrdom of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue \"My Dylan Thomas,\" the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' \"Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By John Malcolm Brinnin and Leftover Life To Kill By Caitlin Thomas\". The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and prosody in general.\nAfter a five-year period of studying many of the key books of Western literature, philosophy and politics, Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become—through his essays in \"Bird in the Bush\", \"Classics Revisited\", and \"Assays\"; along with his \"Collected Shorter Poems\", \"Collected Longer Poems\", and his many books of translations—his initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in Montecito. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solt who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker.\n\nClearly, as explored in his essay \"The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community\", and his prose poem, \"Sympathetic Manifesto\", honoring the anarchist organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation. It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as \"For Pablo Neruda,\" \"Hooker with a Lily\", \"They're Honking at a Woman\", \"The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream\", \"Collecting Myself\", or the later poems \"My Pico Boulevard\", \"Gregor Samsa's Face\", \"Her Friday\", and his more recent poems \"Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood\", \"Latina Worker\", \"My Piece of the Puzzle\", and \"Before and After Tampico\" display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter \"Alienated Labor\" from the \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\", but the underlying thematics in Robbins' political poems are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the\"...Rabelais...Whitman\" essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people—aside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace—shows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed.\"\n\nAgain, as in his \"Neruda\" poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against—de Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that \"we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are—their work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane\".\n\nUltimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem \"Sympathetic Manifesto\" with these final lines: \"I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance\" (60). And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that \"To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture—is the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans.\"\n\nFinally, there does not appear to be a consistent \"reductive\" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that \"Complex seeing must be practiced.\" Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are \"Predators' Hour2, Open All Night\" and \"Ash Lands.\" Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com. Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that\nArt supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other than our own resilient skepticism.\nOn his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: \"Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty. But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing.\"\n\nInfluenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as George Hitchcock's \"Kayak\", Clayton Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\", and Robert Bly's \"The Seventies\" with its emphases on \"wild association\", political poetry, and critical book reviews, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, \"Third Rail\" (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982.\nThe avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\", William Carlos Williams's \"Paterson\", Louis Zukofsky's \"A\", and Charles Olsen's \"The Maximus Poems\". The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of Gertrude Stein's \"Tender Buttons\", the French \"cubist\" poetry of Pierre Reverdy, and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets George Oppen, the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and the Beat Generation poet Philip Whalen. On the other hand, Beat poets Allen Ginsberg, Harold Norse, and Charles Bukowski carried on the Whitman tradition of the authentic voice, \"I was the man, I suffered, I was there.\" Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\" combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's \"Kayak\" and Eshleman's \"Caterpillar\", Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to surrealism, but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of \"automatic writing\" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of language poets. To this end Bly emphasized the works of Georg Trakl, Federico García Lorca, César Vallejo and Pablo Neruda in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive depth psychology fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and bathos; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated.\nFor Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of \"Third Rail\" was basically connected to the paths \"Kayak\", \"Caterpillar\", and \"The Seventies\" were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as \"the international idiom\". From 1975–1982, \"Third Rail\" published works by Henry Miller, Walter Lowenfels, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Bly, Jack Micheline, Christopher Buckley, Douglas Blazek, Andrea Hollander Budy, Naomi Shihab Nye, Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, Paul Eluard, Blaise Cendrars, Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Natalia Gorbanevskaia, Anna Akhmatova and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as \"Poets on Chile, Neruda, Allende\" (1976) and \"Poets Against Nuclear Power\" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of \"Kayak Press\", George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker.\n\nIn 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, \"Electric Rexroth\". His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, Gerald Stern, Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, Ingrid Wendt, Clayton Eshlemen, Marvin Bell, and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for \"Electric Rexroth\" were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative lyrical poetry: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of cliché. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, \"Someone waiting for me among the violins,\" Philip Levine's, \"The Simple Truth,\" Tania Pryputneiwicz's \"Labor,\" and Gerald Stern's \"Ducks Are for Our Happiness,\" are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for \"Electric Rexroth\", Robert Bly's \"An Open Rose,\" and \"Grandma's Myth\" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\" (Cedar Hill Press).\n\nEthnic and working-class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter. Whether they be family members that escaped pogroms in Ukraine, deserted the Russian Revolution, survived WWI, WWII, the American-Korean War, or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the American-Vietnam War or the violent conflicts in Latin America, many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence. The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of persecution, exploitation, rape, and murder are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems \"Before and After Tampico\", \"Four Family\", and \"My Pico Boulevard\". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and manifesto, \"Poetry is in the Streets\" (\"Le Poesy es en la rue\"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and censorship underlying and undermining the subject. These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of injustice and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament. One of his more noted poems, \"For Neruda\", his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, dissidence, and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to Joseph Stalin.\n\nRobbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, carpenters and war veterans making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a concentration camp working the delicatessen counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor coffee shops and department stores. His poems \"Anna\", and \"Dvayda\", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to Chaucer's \"Wife of Bath\" with her exceptional forthrightness or Shakespeare's Emilia with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of B. Traven's \"The Death Ship\" can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, \"Before and After Tampico.\"\n\nFor Robbins, the Ars Poetica of \"Poetry is in the Streets\" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex narrative poems that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression. Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or Pavese, one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, \"Name a Dish After Me\", written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure.\n\nRobbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books \"Sympathetic Manifesto\" and \"Seduction of the Groom\". The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are \"In-terminal Rose\", \"Seduction of the Groom\", \"Dreaming of a Daughter\", and \"In the Middle of a Fight\". Examples from his more recent collections \"Double Muse\", \"The Donkey's Tale\" \"Driving Face Down\", and \"My Piece of the Puzzle, include \"You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I\", \"Marc Chagall and the Male Soul\", \"I Went Through a Box of Emily's Shell Jewelry\", \"The Eighties\"; and from current published poems: \"Pulled Over\", \"The Fire Petal\", \"The Weaving\", \"The Sexiest Part\", \"My Boat, My Waves\", and \"Badlands and Outlands\".\n\nWhile the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, \"Badlands and Outlands\" (\"Double Muse\" 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, \"Badlands and Outlands\" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment. The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self-destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces \"not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops […]\" And yet, there is \"…the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov\" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is \"crested, empathic, vulgar.\" The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: \"momentary undermined attentions, in Florence—/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence.\"\n\nMany poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem. In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, \"I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[…]\" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning. Arguably, the collage technique of monologue, short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and vaudeville-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in \"House of Fame\", Bottom's dream from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", as well Shakespeare's other \"clowns\" in \"Othello\" and particularly the \"philosophizing\" clown in \"King Lear\".\n\nRobbins' first prose collection, \"Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry\", certainly displays an affinity with Sterne's enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in \"Tristram Shandy\". His prose poem essay in \"Bear Flag Republic\" notes with appreciation the writings of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Young, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Thomas Bernhard, Stephen Dixon, and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted \"Journal of Albion Moonlight\". Such works as \"Chaucer's Quill, Sappho's Libido, Frida Kahlo's Eye Brows\", \"Dealing With the Insomnia Surf\", \"Pantagruel Antigruel\", \"As Much Sex as Elvis\", \"Green Torso\", and \"Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation\", from \"Parking Lot Mood Swing\" appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry. Whether these \"omissions\" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output. Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after \"Parking Lot Mood Swing\", such as \"Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct\", \"Nothing but an Ear\", \"Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir\", from the forthcoming novella, \"Twin Extra\" (Highmoonoon 2010); and \"Just My Luck\", \"My Defects Call Me Back\", and \"Night Song\" from the \"Bear Flag Republic\" prose poem anthology.\n\nPoetry\nPrize in Poetry 2001.\nPress, 1996)\nShort Fiction\n\nCriticism\nDoren Robbins has published critical essays and articles on Kenneth Rexroth, George Oppen, Phillip Levine, Deborah Eisenberg, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Charles Bukowski, Thomas McGrath, Larry Levis, Bob Dylan, Carol Tinker, Katerina Gogou, Ellen Bass and Kazuko Shiraishi among others in \"The Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies\", \"The Daily Iowan\", \"Third Rail\", \"Onthebus\", \"Caliban\" and others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13568947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13568947", "title": "Dualistic cosmology", "text": "Dualistic cosmology\n\nDualism in cosmology is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.\n\nMoral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be \"moral\" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In theology, dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism. Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of yin and yang is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of Taoism. It is also discussed in Confucianism.\n\nMany myths and creation motifs with dualistic cosmologies have been described in ethnographic and anthropological literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two demiurges, culture heroes, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the Chukchi, the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil. They may be often believed to be twins or at least brothers. Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by diffusion or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society (moieties); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.\n\nMoral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of monist or monotheistic principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be \"moral\" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.\n\nFor example, Mazdaism (Mazdean Zoroastrianism) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the antithesis—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), Manichaeism, and Mandaeism are representative of dualistic \"and\" monist philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian gnostic religions, such as Bogomils, Catharism, and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in Hermeticism, where \"Nous\" \"thought\"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with pluralism is considered a logical fallacy.\n\nMoral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods Set (disorder, death) and Osiris (order, life). The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that Ahura Mazda is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from \"druj\", which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give \"druj\" power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the beliefs of later religions.\n\nThe religious dualism of Christianity between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy Satan (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: Neoplatonism and Christianity). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian soul.\n\nWhen used with regards to multiple gods, \"dualism\" may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply \"theism\" (theos = god) at all.\n\nBoth bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. theodicy). In the original conception of Zoroastrianism, for example, Ahura Mazda was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) was the spirit of ultimate evil.\n\nIn a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the neopagan religion of Wicca. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a divine couple, the Moon Goddess and the Horned God, who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of \"good\" and \"evil\" but are aspects of the natural world, much like yin and yang in Taoism.)\n\n\nHowever, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of Persephone). Marcionism, an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.\n\nIn theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.\n\nThe dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including Marcionism, Catharism, Paulicianism, and Gnostic Christianity. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond. In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good. The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that free will separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism. The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the Samkhya tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.\n\nThe tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception. The 1912 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" describes that, in the Catholic Church, \"the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected\" by the thirteenth century, but mind–body dualism was not. The problem of evil is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity. The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the Paulicians, were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by Constantine-Silvanus, argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.\n\nThe Cathars, a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The Albigensian Crusade was initiated by Pope Innocent III in 1208 to remove the Cathars from Languedoc in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The Inquisition, which began in 1233 under Pope Gregory IX, also targeted the Cathars.\n\nGnosticism is a diverse, syncretistic religious movement consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, who is frequently identified with the Abrahamic God. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable supreme being that embodies good.\n\nBogomils, Paulicans and Cathars are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (\"gnosis\") as an effective salvific force.\n\nThe Dvaita Vedanta school of Indian philosophy espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the more important reality is that of Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu or Brahman. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme Self, God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul (Jiva), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.\n\nAlternatively, \"dualism\" can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching categories. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of yin and yang. In traditions such as classical Hinduism, Zen Buddhism or Islamic Sufism, a key to enlightenment is \"transcending\" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with monism or pluralism.\n\nThe opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of yin and yang is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of Taoism, both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively. As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in Confucianism, but to a lesser extent.\n\nSome of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, light and dark, active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun. The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.\n\nThe complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a feedback loop, where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to homeostasis. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.\n\nIn a Nenets myth, Num and Nga collaborate and compete with each other, creating land, there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.\n\nAmong others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared the mythology of Ket people with those of Uralic peoples, assuming in the studies, that there are modelling semiotic systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons. Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of Ob-Ugric peoples and Samoyedic peoples are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples. It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society nor cosmological dualism has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties, folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land: the diving of the water fowl. If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.\n\nA Chukchi myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings (birds, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the raven, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).\n\nAll three Fuegian tribes had dualistic myths about culture heros. The Yámana have dualistic myths about the two brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the Selk'nam. In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or diffusion necessarily.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23231909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23231909", "title": "Ekal Vidyalaya", "text": "Ekal Vidyalaya\n\nThe Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation (literally \"Foundation of Solo Schools\") is a non-profit organization involved in education and village development in rural areas and tribal villages of India. It is the largest grassroots, non-government education initiative in India with presence in 51,717 villages providing free education to more than one million children.As the name suggests, the model of operation of the Foundation is a single-teacher based school, with the provision of \"Ek Shikshak, Ek Vidyalaya\" that means \"one teacher for every school.\" The individual schools, known as Ekal Vidyalayas, have local teachers who teach in the regional language in various interesting ways using different modes like story-telling, folk dramas, and folk songs. The schools also impart moral education, health care education and organic farming techniques.\n\nTata Dhan Academy with Professor Seshadri of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore recently performed social impact study praised EKAL schools for providing holistic education to children in remote villages.\nEVF is actively involved in fund-raising activities in several countries outside India, most notably the United States. The foundation's mission is to open 100,000 schools and eradicate illiteracy from rural and tribal India by 2015. \nA March 2003 report named \"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\" states that several authors, state governments and social organisations have praised EVF's role in bringing literacy and empowerment to millions of children in rural and tribal areas of India.\nEVF is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\n\nThe Ekal Vidyalaya schools were assisted by the NDA Government from 1999–2000 onwards. This was stopped in 2005 by the UPA Government when one of its committees reported irregularities and pursuit of anti-minority agenda in some schools. Critics of EVF have said that the schools pursue a Hindu-nationalist agenda and generate hatred towards minorities. \nAccording to \"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\", supporters of EVF have stated that the schools do not teach hate, and that they themselves have been the target of a campaign by media and academic networks.\n\nThe Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation (EVF) was established in 1986 by Rakesh Popli, a US-returned Indian nuclear scientist, and his wife Rama Popli, a child education specialist. The couple established the foundation's first single-teacher school in Gumla in Jharkhand (then a part of Bihar). The movement was successful within two years and, in 1989, 60 single-teacher schools were started simultaneously in Dhanbad. By 1995–1996, the foundation was running 1,200 schools in Jharkhand. In the 1990s, global support networks were established. The Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of India was officially registered in 2000 and the EVF-USA was registered soon after.\n\nAs of April 2008, there were more than 23,000 schools run by EVF, including 2,100 schools in the North Eastern states. The number of schools grew to 27,000 in 2010, 34,000 in 2011 and 51,717 in 2013. EVF's goal is to reach 100,000 villages in the India's tribal belt by 2015.\n\nEVF is associated with the Hindu nationalist organisations Vishva Hindu Parishad, which is in turn a member of the Sangh Parivar, the family of organisations run by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\n\"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\" points out that some who have been on the board of trustees of the foundation include B. K. Modi, the founder of ModiCorp, Justice P. N. Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India; L. M. Singhvi, former High Commissioner for India in the United Kingdom; Abid Hussain, former Indian ambassador to the United States.\nThe foundation was headed in the past by Subhash Chandra, the Chairman of Essel Group and the founder of Zee TV. Hema Malini, Indian actress and danseuse, has served as the global brand ambassador for the Ekal Vidyalaya movement.\n\nThe Ekal Vidyalayas provide five years of free, non-formal education to children from the age group 6–14 years. A typical school has 30–40 students taught by a local youth who has passed grades 8 or 9 and has been specifically trained. A local organizer looks after a unit of 10 schools, called a \"subcluster\". Local people are also involved in higher organization levels like a \"cluster\" (unit of 30 schools), subarea (unit of 90 schools), and area (unit of 270 schools). The classes take place under a tree or in a hut and use informal modes like storytelling, folk dramas, folk songs and religious discourses. \nIn \"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\" this non-didactic approach has been described by Dr. Ramesh Rao and others as \"assimilative and respectful of local cultural norms and belief systems\".\nAround half of the students and teachers are females, and about a fifth of the students go on to pursue higher education, some of which return to serve the foundation.\n\nEVF's philosophy is to take a holistic approach to social and economic development, providing primary school education for children, as well as healthcare, livelihoods and empowerment education for the entire village.\nThe schools are primarily organized in small villages among India's tribal groups. The local youth who are trained to operate the schools are social workers and teachers, teaching sanitation and health care, literacy and Hindu nationalism.\nEach school is run on an annual budget of around 20,000 Indian rupees. At the national level, the schools are organized by Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of India. Regionally, Ekal Vidyalayas are run by the Friends of Tribals Society (FTS) and Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad (BLSP) NGOs and by state-level groups such as Janahitha in Andhra Pradesh and Bharatiya Janseva Sansthan in Gujarat. In addition to teaching children, the schools hold weekly sessions for the village populace to discuss issues like rural development, health and awakening.\n\nAlong with literacy, Ekal Vidyalaya schools also impart moral education. EVF works in tribal areas on health care education with the emphasis on hygiene, treatment of general diseases, maternal and child care. The foundation operates 11,450 health centers in India for people living in rural and tribal India. The foundation distributes medicines to children for the treatment of various diseases. The schools also run a rural development scheme under which use of organic fertilizers is promoted in place of chemical fertilizers. Professional training in agriculture and vermiculture is provided. In May 2011, EVF launched the Vermicompost Project, a pilot project with an aim to introduce self-sustaining practices in 100 poor villages of Orissa and Maharashtra. In December 2011, the Ekal Vidyalaya staff resolved to raise voice against addiction in rural areas.\n\nThe Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of USA (EVF USA) is active in fundraising. In June 2008, the Atlanta chapter entertained guests with a music program at a fundraising event.\nIn May 2009, the Southern California chapter launched its annual fundraising drive.\nA benefit concert in Chicago in July 2009 raised $160,000.\nIn September 2009, the San Diego chapter raised about $14,000 at a cultural event featuring music and dance.\nThe organisation announced that a similar event in Dallas in November 2009 had been very successful.\nIn May 2010, a fundraising concert in Chicago was attended by over 600 people and raised pledges of $82,525.\nThe same month, Ekal Vidyalaya raised almost $500,000 from five charity shows in the mid-Atlantic region. As of 2010, EVF USA had 34 active chapters and supported 9,500 out of the 34,343 Ekal Vidyalayas in India. The foundation raised US$3.5 million in 2010. EVF USA organises fundraising programs in 45 cities in the United States, which feature Indian singers or marathons.\n\nEVF Australia was set up in 2004.\nIt received the Tax exemption for donation in 2007. As of June 2015 EVF Australia has sponsored 850 Ekal schools.\nIn 2006, the National Hindu Students' Forum (UK) selected Ekal Vidyalaya as the main recipient of fundraising during its annual Sewa Week drive. EVF has around 1,000 donors in Hong Kong.\n\nEVF's single-teacher school concept and their contribution towards literacy and empowerment in the rural and tribal areas have been praised by several state governments and social organisations in India. Avinash Kaushik, American entrepreneur and author, wrote that foundations like the Smile Train, Doctors Without Borders and Ekal Vidyalaya have done \"incredible work\" and \"they make the world a better place\".\nDigital Learning, a magazine on education, described the non-formal education experiment by EVF in Jharkhand from 1986 to 1995–96 as \"extraordinary\", noting that literacy rate in Jharkhand doubled in this period, and diseases caused by unhygienic practices, witchcraft and alcoholism declined sharply. The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), a program for health care in rural India run by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, approached EVF for imparting healthcare training to women. EVF developed the women-centric \"Asha\" programme for NRHM in response.\n\nAccording to \"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\", Yvette Rosser, American author and scholar, wrote that the Ekal Vidyalaya program has done \"incredible work\" and \"brought literacy to millions of India's children who otherwise would not know how to read and write\". \nRaman Singh, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, praised the work done by Ekal Vidyalayas run by the FTS in 2500 tribal villages of the state in spreading education. In 2009, Yoga guru Swami Ramdev said at the Ekal International Conference in Delhi that the Ekal Vidyalayas are a medium for definite service to God.\n\n\nIn 2005, a report prepared by an enquiry committee of the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development found that in some Ekal Vidyalaya schools the names of enrolled students had been copied from registers of government-run schools. The schools did not provide reading and learning material, and used funds to \"generate hatred toward minorities, and condition the minds of children\". The report said the FTS was \"misusing these funds, and using the grants for creating disharmony amongst religious groups and creating a political cadre\". In May 2005 the Indian government stopped grants to the schools based on this report.\nQuoting from the report in \"The Milli Gazette\", Mukundan C. Menon noted that the English booklet used to teach second year students in Jharkhand omitted six letters of the alphabet. Menon said the reason was names of Hindu Gods beginning with these letters are not common.\n\nIn 2002, Sabrang Communications and South Asia Citizens Web published a report named \"The Foreign Exchange of Hate – IDRF and the American Funding of Hindutva\" on utilisation of funds by India Development and Relief Fund. The report alleged the VHP-run Ekal Vidyalaya schools had the goal of \"Hinduizing\" tribals and spreading hatred against Indian minorities. \nIn 2005 John Dayal, then president of the All India Catholic Union (AICU) and a member of the National Integration Council expressed concern that the schools were spreading hatred towards members of the Christian minority, in order to \"prevent conversions of tribals to Christianity by missionaries.\"\nIn a 2008 article Angana Chatterji, associate professor of anthropology at California Institute of Integral Studies, identified Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of USA as one of the charities in the US that had allocated money \"disproportionately directed to Hindutva-affiliated groups\". \nIn an article in the \"Daily Times\" of Pakistan, Khalid Hasan described the Ekal Vidyalayas as having a \"curriculum steeped in instilling hatred against non-Hindu religious minorities\".\nRights activists have claimed that the schools pursue a Hindu-nationalist agenda and generate hatred towards non-Hindu minorities such as Christians.\n\nIn response to the 2002 report published by Sabrang Communications, in March 2003 Ramesh Rao, professor of Communication at Truman State University, and others wrote a report named \"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\".\nIn this report, they wrote that \"there has been a concerted campaign against the Ekal Vidyalayas by a combination of media and academic networks ... try as they might, they really cannot find anything wrong with the schools\".\nAccording to Prakash Sharma, media convener of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, \"The Ekal vidyalayas are our effort to reach the most deprived areas of the country. Christian missionaries get funds from all over the world: the entire Christian empire backs them. Ours is a completely indigenous effort\". \nFrançois Gautier, French author and journalist, described the Ekal Vidyalayas as \"a harmless programme doing wonderful job for tribal children\", and questioned why organisations raising funds for them were attacked. \n\"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\" quotes Yvette Rosser as saying that \"the ladies and gentlemen in the villages who teach in Ekal Vidyalaya schools are not teaching hate\".\n\"A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)\" notes that several other authors have praised the schools' role in providing literacy to millions of children, and stated that the schools do not teach hate but have themselves been the target of a campaign by media and academic networks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39870", "title": "Horoscope", "text": "Horoscope\n\nA horoscope is an astrological chart or diagram representing the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, astrological aspects and sensitive angles at the time of an event, such as the moment of a person's birth. The word \"horoscope\" is derived from Greek words hõra and scopos meaning \"time\" and \"observer\" (\"horoskopos\", pl. \"horoskopoi\", or \"marker(s) of the hour\"). Other commonly used names for the horoscope in English include natal chart, astrological chart, astro-chart, celestial map, sky-map, star-chart, cosmogram, vitasphere, radical chart, radix, chart wheel or simply chart. It is used as a method of divination regarding events relating to the point in time it represents, and it forms the basis of the horoscopic traditions of astrology.\n\nIn common usage, \"horoscope\" often refers to an astrologer's interpretation, usually based on a system of solar Sun sign astrology; based strictly on the position of the Sun at the time of birth, or on the calendar significance of an event, as in Chinese astrology. In particular, many newspapers and magazines carry predictive columns, written in prose that may be written more for increasing readership than tied directly to the Sun or other aspects of the solar system, allegedly based on celestial influences in relation to the zodiacal placement of the Sun on the month of birth, cusp (2 days before or after any particular sign, an overlap), or decante (the month divided into 3 ten-day periods) of the person's month of birth, identifying the individual's Sun sign or \"star sign\" based on the tropical zodiac.\n\nNo scientific studies have shown support for the accuracy of horoscopes, and the methods used to make interpretations are pseudo-scientific. In modern scientific framework no known interaction exists that could be responsible for the transmission of the alleged influence between a person and the position of stars in the sky at the moment of birth. In all tests completed, keeping strict methods to include a control group and proper blinding between experimenters and subjects, horoscopes have shown no effect beyond pure chance. Furthermore, some psychological tests have shown that it is possible to construct personality descriptions and foretelling generic enough to satisfy most members of a large audience simultaneously, referred to as the Forer or Barnum effect.\n\nThe horoscope serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific location at a particular moment in time. In most applications the perspective is geocentric (heliocentric astrology being one exception). The positions of the actual planets (including Sun and Moon) are placed in the chart, along with those of purely calculated factors such as the lunar nodes, the house cusps including the midheaven and the ascendant, zodiac signs, fixed stars and the lots. Angular relationships between the planets themselves and other points, called aspects, are typically determined. The emphasis and interpretation of these factors varies with tradition.\n\nThe Latin word \"horoscopus\", ultimately from Greek \"nativity, horoscope\", literally \"observer of the hour [of birth]\", from \"time, hour\" and \"observer, watcher\".\nIn Middle English texts from the 11th century, the word appears in the Latin form and is anglicized to \"horoscope\" in Early Modern English. The noun \"horoscopy\" for \"casting of horoscopes\" has been in use since the 17th century (OED).\nIn Greek, in the sense of \"ascendant\" and \"observation of the ascendant\" is in use since Ptolemy (\"Tetrabiblos\" 33, 75).\n\n\nThere are [[Angle (astrology)|four primary angles]] in the horoscope. These are, in order of power:\n\n\nThe [[ascendant]] is the easternmost or sunrise point where the ecliptic and horizon intersect; the ascendant and the [[midheaven]] are considered the most important angles in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. In most systems of house division, the ascendant is the cusp of the 1st house and the midheaven is the cusp of the 10th house. The placement of the planetary ruler of the ascendant, called the \"[[Chart Ruler|chart ruler]]\" is also considered to be significant. The point in the west diametrically opposing the ascendant is called the [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]], normally the cusp of the 7th house; and the point opposing the M.C. is the cusp of the 4th house, the northernmost point of the chart, called the [[Imum Coeli|imum coeli]] or I.C.\n\nIn creating a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally placed at the \"nine o'clock\" position on the left-hand side of the chart wheel (though traditional rectangular chart formats need not follow this convention). During the course of a day, because of the Earth's rotation, the entire circle of the ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This movement provides us with the term rising sign, which is the sign of the zodiac rising over the eastern horizon at the moment of birth. The point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon at the time is called the Midheaven, or \"medium coeli\" (M.C.), placed at the \"twelve o'clock position\" effectively where the Sun would be if the birth time was midday.\n\n[[Image:Astro signs.svg|thumb|right|The [[astrological symbols]]/[[glyphs]] used in Western astrology to represent the [[astrological signs]] ([[Zodiac]])]]\n\nThe tropical zodiac defines the vernal point (the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere) as the first degree of Aries, but the sidereal zodiac allows it to precess. Many people are confused regarding the difference between the sidereal zodiac and the tropical zodiac signs. Because of a \"wobble\" in the Earth's axis of rotation over a period of about 26,000 years (often called a \"[[great year]]\"), the rate at which the vernal equinox precesses in the heavens is approximately 0 deg, 0 min, 50.23 seconds a year, drifting by one degree every 72 years. [[Precession of the equinoxes]] thus occurs at a rate of roughly 5 arc minutes of a degree every 6 years. The tropical signs relate to the seasons and not the stars. Here is an example: a person born on, say August 28, 2002 would come to understand that his/her Sun sign was in Virgo according to [[Western astrology]] (conventional Sun sign dates August 23, to September 22, of every year), but Sun on that same calendar date of the year 2002 was in the [[Leo (constellation)|constellation Leo]] (where it had been since August 10, 2002 and would remain until September 15, when it would then finally cross into Virgo).\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the sidereal signs and the tropical signs are both geometrical conventions of 30° each, whereas the zodiacal constellations are pictorial representations of mythological figures projected onto the celestial sphere based on patterns of visible star groupings, none of which occupy precisely 30° of the ecliptic. So constellations and signs are not the same, although for historical reasons they might have the same names.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some astrologers don't use the signs of the zodiac at all, focusing more instead on the [[astrological aspects]] and other features of the horoscope.\n\n\nTo create a horoscope, an astrologer first has to ascertain the exact time and place of the subject's birth, or the initiation of an event. The local [[standard time]] (adjusting for any [[daylight saving time]] or [[History of time in the United States#War Time 1918 and 1942|war time]]) is then converted into [[Greenwich Mean Time]] or [[Universal Time]] at that same instant. The astrologer then has to convert this into the local [[sidereal time]] at birth in order to be able to calculate the [[ascendant]] and [[midheaven]]. The astrologer will next consult a set of tables called an ephemeris, which lists the location of the Sun, Moon and [[Planets in astrology|planets]] for a particular year, date and sidereal time, with respect to the [[vernal equinox|northern hemisphere vernal equinox]] or the [[fixed star]]s (depending on which astrological system is being used). The astrologer then adds or subtracts the difference between the longitude of Greenwich and the longitude of the place in question to determine the true local mean time (LMT) at the place of birth to show where planets would be visible above the horizon at the precise time and place in question. Planets hidden from view beneath the earth are also shown in the horoscope.\n\nThe horoscope features 12 sectors around the circle of the [[ecliptic]], starting from the eastern horizon with the [[ascendant]] or rising sign. These 12 sectors are called the [[House (astrology)|houses]] and numerous systems for calculating these divisions exist. Tables of houses have been published since the 19th Century to make this otherwise demanding task easier.\n\n[[Image:AstrologicalGlyphs-AsteroidsChaldean.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astrological symbols]]/[[glyphs]] used in Western astrology to represent the [[planets in astrology]]]]\n\nThe chart thus begins with a framework of 12 houses. Upon this the signs of the zodiac are superimposed. In the equal house system the cusp between any two houses will fall at the same degree for each of the at 12° of Leo, the second house will begin at 12° of Virgo, the third at 12° Libra, and so on. In house systems that take into consideration the effects of the angle of intersection between the planes of the horizon and the ecliptic, the calculations are more complicated. For these calculations it is essential to know the latitude of the event. Tables are available for these calculations, but they are now commonly calculated by computer. Most astrology computer programs allow the user to choose from a variety of house systems.\n\nHaving established the relative positions of the signs in the houses, the astrologer positions the sun, moon, and planets at their proper celestial longitudes. Some astrologers also take note of minor planetary bodies, fixed stars, [[asteroid]]s (for example, [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]]) and other mathematically calculated points and angles such as the [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]], equatorial ascendant, etc. Many astrologers also use what are commonly referred to as [[Arabic parts]] (or [[Greece|Greek]] Lots), the most common of which is the [[Part of Fortune]] (Pars Fortunae).\n\nTo complete the horoscope the astrologer will consider the aspects or relative angles between pairs of planets. More exact aspects are considered more important. The difference between the exact aspect and the actual aspect is called the [[Orb (astrology)|orb]]. Those generally recognized by the astrological community are [[Astrological aspect#Conjunction|Conjunction]] (0°), [[Astrological aspect#Opposition|Opposition]] (180°), [[Astrological aspect#Square|Square]] (90°), [[Astrological aspect#Trine|Trine]] (120°), [[Astrological aspect#Sextile .E2.80.94 intermediate major.2Fminor aspect|Sextile]] (60°), [[Astrological aspect#Semi-square|Semi-Square]] (45°), [[Astrological aspect#Sesquiquadrate|Sesquisquare]] (135°), and [[Astrological aspect#Quincunx .E2.80.94 intermediate major.2Fminor aspect|Quincunx]] (150°). Understandably these aspects are more significant when they are exact, but they are considered to function within an orb of influence, the size of which varies according to the importance of each aspect. Thus conjunctions are believed to operate with a larger orb than sextiles. Most modern astrologers use an orb of 8° or less for aspects involving the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter and smaller orbs for the other points. Some astrologers, such as practitioners of [[Cosmobiology]], and Uranian astrology, use minor aspects (15°, 22.5°, 67.5°, 72°, 75°, 105°, 112.5°, 157.5°, 165°) with much narrower orbs.\n\nThe major astrological system regarded universally is Vedic Hindu Astrology. As per this, all planets see just opposite i.e. 180 degree aspect. But Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have special aspects. Mars sees the houses 4th and 8 too from its place in the horoscope, Saturn sees the houses 3 and 10 too from its place, and Jupiter sees 5 and 9 from its place in the horoscope i.e. the house in which they are posited in the lagna chart.\n\nThe ascendant (ASC) is a point on the ecliptic that rises on the eastern horizon at sunrise and changes as the earth rotates on its axis.\nThe ascendant is very important in astrological chart interpretation. It exerts more power than the sun, moon and planets because it infiltrates everything in the natal chart.\nThe ascendant is the first point of energy in the natal chart and it represents the way we view life. The sign on the ascendant characterises our expression of “who we are” when dealing with others, and our initial action when dealing with day-to-day concerns. [[Longitude]] is necessary in order to determine the position of the [[Ascendant]] because horoscopes use local time.\nHaving constructed the horoscope, the astrologer can begin the task of interpreting the chart. This interpretation depends upon which branch of horoscopic astrology is being used.\n\nIn [[Chinese astrology]], horoscopes are based on the symbolism of the [[Chinese zodiac]], a system of [[Chinese astrology#Wu Xing|elements]] and [[Chinese calendar#12 animals|animals]] associated with each year according to a [[Sexagenary cycle]]. Chinese horoscopes often appear in [[Sun sign astrology|horoscope sections]] in newspapers and magazine alongside Western horoscopes.\n\n\n[[Category:Horoscopic astrology]]\n[[Category:Technical factors of astrology]]\n[[Category:Astrology]]"}

The independent production premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on , 2014. It is distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, and opened in limited release on , 2014. It won the Best Feature Length Film Award at the Festival Internacional de Cinema Fantàstic de Catalunya on October 11, 2014.\n\nA Ph.D. student, Ian Gray, is researching the evolution of human eyes with Karen, his first year lab assistant, and Kenny. He has a particular hostility to superstition, religion and \"intelligent design\", which he hopes to discredit by filling in the steps of the evolution of the eye. At a Halloween party he has an encounter with Sofi, who is wearing a black face mask, where only her magnetic hazel-speckled, ash-blue eyes are visible. Fascinated, he photographs her eyes and then up at the warehouse party she later leads him into the washroom to have sex. However, soon after, she abruptly leaves without saying goodbye.\n\nIan can't stop thinking about her. One day, synchronicities around the number eleven, amongst others, seem to mysteriously guide him to a billboard displaying what he recognizes to be Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train and approaches her, letting her listen to the music on his earphones. They begin a relationship, although his rationalism often clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry. They are told they need to wait a day for a license, and as they disappointedly walk out of the registry office, Ian gets a call from Karen at the lab. There has been an exciting breakthrough in their research. She has found a blind worm—\"Eisenia fetida\"—with the DNA necessary to develop an eye, just what they'd been looking for. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him, though she's less pleased he's willing to do so on their supposed 'wedding day'. He attempts to appease her by exchanging their wedding rings, to which she's reluctant as it possibly being bad luck. He states he doesn't believe in such, then places her ring on her finger anyway, whilst whispering that he's loved her forever.\n\nBack at the lab, Sofi is upset by the research they're doing and an uncomfortable Karen leaves. After a short argument, Sofi kisses Ian and knocks over a bottle of formaldehyde, accidentally splashing Ian's eyes. They call Karen, who helps him to the eyewash station and bandages his eyes, and Sofi takes him home. On the way up, the elevator in Sofi's apartment building stops between floors. Ian wishes to hoist up Sofi but she refuses. Frustrated by her childish fears, he rips off his bandages and attempts to climb out himself. As he's pulling up Sofi, the elevator suddenly starts to move again. With blurry eyes, Ian thought he had pulled her out in time, but it was too late - Sofi's bottom half being chopped off, she dies instantly in his arms. Ian goes into a deep depression, and Karen continues their research. One night Karen brings him a meal at his home. He begins to cry and she comforts him. They begin to kiss.\n\nThe film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written a book on the evolution of the eye that he claims further debunks creationism. Ian and Karen are now married and Karen is pregnant. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an iris scan of baby Tobias' eyes. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results, thinking it a glitch, and the problem disappears.\n\nA few months later, a Doctor Simmons calls, claiming that a test of the baby's urine may indicate an elevated risk of autism and recommending a further test. But Ian and Karen become suspicious during this unconventional test and decide to investigate Doctor Simmons. They find that she is in fact one of a very few people with full access to the iris scan database. Ian tracks some pictures from this test to Idaho where he stumbles on the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who apparently died just before their baby was conceived.\n\nIan's former research partner, Kenny, is the creator of the iris database. He helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased family members, plus various other people's eyes through the database to see if there are any other recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi, whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior, years after Sofi's death.\n\nIan goes to India to find the subject of this scan. There he finds Priya, the head of the community centre where the iris scan was made. Priya recognizes Sofi's eyes as those of a girl she knows, named Salomina, and agrees to help. Ian and Priya begin searching for Salomina, who is an orphan and seems to have disappeared into the crowds of the city. Ian tries putting up a billboard showing Sofi's eyes and offering a cash reward. He is besieged with calls but none are credible. Weeks later he comes across a little girl staring at the billboard. It is Salomina. He takes her back to his hotel and contacts Karen over Skype. The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi. At first Salomina is uncannily accurate, but in the end her results are within the probable range of random chance. Karen asks him how he feels about this and he says he feels rather foolish. Feeling somewhat disheartened, Ian then leaves the hotel room with Salomina to take her to Priya but when they reach the elevator, the moment the doors open Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms, too frightened to enter. Staring into each other's eyes with a certain recognition, they then cling to each other, tears streaming down both's faces. He picks her up and takes her down the stairs instead, with Salomina tightly gripped around his neck, till they walk out the dark interior and step out into the light.\n\nA post-credits scene shows Dr. Simmons scanning the irises of famous deceased figures, apparently finding many such matches.\n\n\n\"I Origins\" was the second feature film by writer-director Mike Cahill after his earlier independent science fiction-drama, \"Another Earth\" (2011), also with actress Brit Marling. Cahill sold the film rights to \"Another Earth\" to Fox Searchlight Pictures at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. At that time he also sold a screenplay to what would be his next feature film titled \"I\". Though during the development of \"I\", after failing to \"crack\" some aspects of the story, Cahill instead decided to make an origin story for the film, in which he had a \"rich back story for\".\n\nAlthough Fox Searchlight owned the rights to any prequels or sequels to the \"I\" script, Cahill decided to make \"I Origins\" independently. He intended to sell the film at the Sundance Film Festival, like he did for \"Another Earth\". Fox Searchlight agreed and the film was produced by Verisimilitude and WeWork Studios in association with Bersin Pictures and Penny Jane Films. After the premiere of \"I Origins\" at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, Fox Searchlight ended up buying the rights to the film.\n\n\"I Origins\" premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on , 2014. After its premiere, Fox Searchlight Pictures bought rights to worldwide distribution of the film. The film won the festival's Alfred P. Sloan Prize, which recognizes films that depict science and technology. The win was Cahill's second; his film \"Another Earth\" also won the prize in 2011. \"I Origins\" also screened at the Brooklyn-based BAMcinemaFest and at the Nantucket Film Festival, both in late June 2014.\n\n\"I Origins\" began its limited theatrical release on , 2014 in just four theaters. The following week, it expanded to 76 theaters.\n\n\"I Origins\" received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 53%, based on 100 reviews, with a weighted average score of 6/10. The site's consensus states: \"Writer-director Mike Cahill remains an intriguingly ambitious talent, but with the uneven sci-fi drama \"I Origins\", his reach exceeds his grasp\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Jordan Zakarin, of entertainment and media news website TheWrap, said that \"The movie starts as a love story and then morphs into a thriller, propelled always by the push and pull of faith and logic, with tragedy shifting world views over time\". He continued, saying that \"The message is both micro and macro, aimed at the renewed war in the United States over issues like science education and contraception, as well as Cahill's way of working out his own mixed emotions\".\n\n\"I Origins\" was developed as a prequel of \"I\", a screenplay which Cahill sold to Fox Searchlight Pictures in 2011. Cahill intended for \"I\" to take place twenty years after the event of \"I Origins\", after the repercussions of Dr. Ian Gray’s discoveries take hold, as teased in the post-credits of the film.\n\nDuring press interviews for the film, Cahill spoke of plans to go ahead with a sequel to \"I Origins\", saying \"There's a sequel in the works. It's not scripted. We're not in production yet, but we set up at Fox Searchlight\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "854611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854611", "title": "Jacques Gaillot", "text": "Jacques Gaillot\n\nJacques Jean Edmond Georges Gaillot (born 11 September 1935; ; generally known in French as Monseigneur Gaillot) is a French Catholic clergyman and social activist. He was Bishop of Évreux in France from 1982 to 1995. In 1995, by decision of Pope John Paul II, he was demoted to be Titular Bishop of Partenia, an extinct diocese, for having expressed too controversial and heterodox positions on religious, political and social matters.\n\nIn reason of these views he earned the popular nickname of \"The Red Cleric\".\n\nJacques Gaillot was born in Saint-Dizier, Haute-Marne. As a teenager, he already desired to become a priest. After his secondary studies, he entered the seminary in Langres.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959, he carried out his compulsory military service in Algeria during the war of independence.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1962 he was sent to Rome to complete his studies in theology and get his bachelor's degree. He was ordained a priest in 1961. From 1962 to 1964, he was sent to the Higher Institute for Liturgy in Paris, while teaching at the major seminary in Châlons-en-Champagne.\n\nFrom 1965, he was a Professor at the regional seminary of Reims. He chaired many sessions to implement the orientations of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn 1973, he was appointed to the parish of St Dizier, his hometown, while becoming co-manager of the institute for the training of the educators of the clergy (IFEC) in Paris.\n\nIn 1977, he was appointed vicar general of the diocese of Langres. In 1981, he was elected vicar capitular. In May 1982, he was appointed bishop of Évreux, being consecrated into the position on 20 June.\n\nAs soon as Bishop Gaillot had taken his place in Évreux he began to engage in activities that may be said to have cost him his position. During his first Easter message he wrote: \"Christ died outside the walls as he was born outside the walls. If we are to see the light, the sun, of Easter, we ourselves must go outside the walls.\" Following this he then stated that: \"I'm not here to convince the convinced or take care of the well. I'm here to support the ill and offer a hand to the lost. Does a bishop remain in his cathedral or does he go into the street?. . .I made my choice.\" Within months Gaillot had begun to act on his word.\n\nIn 1983, he supported a conscientious objector before the court in Évreux. During the yearly assembly of the episcopate, he was one of the two bishops (of a total of 110) voting against the episcopate's text on nuclear deterrence, which supported having nuclear arms as a legitimate deterrent.\n\nIn 1984 he angered numerous Catholic authorities by refusing to support the movement in defence of French parochial schools.\n\nIn 1985, he supported the First Intifada in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and met Yasser Arafat in Tunis, being embraced by the future Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in a private audience. Perhaps the most notable event he performed in 1987 was attending, by invitation, a special session of the United Nations in New York to speak out for disarmament. The first amount of considerable media attention paid to Gaillot came in January 1985 when he signed an appeal on behalf of underpaid Catholic school teachers; also signing the appeal was Georges Marchais, the head of the French Communist Party. This proved to be highly controversial, bringing about the start of a right-wing campaign against Bishop Gaillot. Within his own diocese, \"Le Figaro\" spearheaded the campaign. At this point Bishop Gaillot was described as being \"a tool of the church's worst enemies\".\n\nIn 1987, he went to South Africa to meet a young anti-apartheid militant from Évreux sentenced to 4 years in prison by the South African régime. There he also appeared at a demonstration where some Communist militants were also demonstrating. In order to accomplish this trip, he had to renounce going with the diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes, a move that attracted criticism. Further, in the same year he also announced that the French Bishops \"remain too preoccupied by the correct functioning of the church and its structures.\" This only ensured that the responses to Gaillot when he later attacked the right wing French political party, the National Front, were even stronger. Also in 1987 Gaillot traveled to Athens to show solidarity with a boatload of Palestinian refugees.\n\nIn 1988, during a closed-door session of the assembly in Lourdes, he advocated the ordination of married men to the priesthood. After the proceedings had finished Gaillot spoke to the press about the discussions held and also promoted his own viewpoints. By promoting a revision of clerical celibacy and the use of condoms, he caused considerable tension with the French bishops' conference, the situation being exacerbated by the fact that in speaking to the media about the session, Gaillot had violated convention regarding assembly conclaves. He later defended his previous actions, remarking that \"I never broke the vow of celibacy ... I only questioned it. But that's worse.\" Also that year, Gaillot took the unprecedented step for a Roman Catholic bishop of blessing a homosexual union in a \"service of welcoming\", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS.\n\nIn 1989, he participated in a trip to French Polynesia organized by the peace movement, asking for the end to French nuclear testing. He also participated in the ceremony of the transfer of the ashes of the late bishop Baptiste-Henri Grégoire (1750–1831) to the Panthéon, a necropolis for the great men of France. Grégoire had been instrumental in the first abolition of slavery, and the end of discrimination against the Blacks and the Jews during the French Revolution. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had refused to give him the last sacraments because of Grégoire's acceptance of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Gaillot was the only French bishop participating in this ceremony. By this stage in his career, Bishop Gaillot had earned an impressive reputation, both positive and negative. The French journalist wrote in \"Le Monde\" that Gaillot] has the merit of saying out loud what many people in authority in the church think down deep.\"\n\nThroughout 1989, Gaillot continued to cause considerable tension within the French Bishops' Conference, to the extent that the members of the episcopate voted to censure him. This disciplinary action came after Gaillot gave an interview to the publication \"Lui\", the French equivalent of \"Playboy\". Furthermore, he also gave interviews to leading gay magazines and lambasted the incompetence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to judge the circumstances of homosexuality. At this point, the bishop offered his resignation to the Pope, should he feel it necessary to remove him; no such action was taken however.\n\nToward late 1989, he attempted concilatory movements, signing an agreement in which he promised \"loyalty\" and \"docility\" to the pope. This agreement did not last long however; within a week, Gaillot had distanced himself from the majority of other bishops by appearing on television to criticise the \"feeble state of internal debate in the church\" and express his feelings of grief that progress had not been made since the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn 1991, he opposed the Gulf War, publishing a book called \"Open letter to those who preach war, but let it be waged by others\". He also condemned the embargo on Iraq. By the end of 1991, the French Bishops' Conference had censured Gaillot three times, most recently for his intervention in Haiti, rousing support for Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n\nBishop Gaillot also caused controversy with a number of other actions. He was frequently condemned by others for his numerous television appearances, but justified them by claiming that if people still found a Bishop interesting, then they clearly still found the church interesting. \n\nAs well as this, Bishop Gaillot also took a lenient stance with regard women who have had abortions, claiming he was not qualified to judge a woman who found herself in such a scenario.\n\nThe last drop that made the cup run over was a conversation Bishop Gaillot had with the prolific dissident Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann in the show \"Transit\" on the French channel ARTE on April 12, 1994. Two days after this widely seen show, archbishop Joseph Duval, the President of the French Bishops' Conference, wrote to Gaillot: \"For all to see you are in solidarity with Drewermann. But how do you show your solidarity with us, your fellow episcopal brothers and the Pope? Are you aware that your position is unsustainable? The distance from your brothers in the episcopate that you emphasize makes us suffer and has become a scandal for many Catholics\".\n\nBy 1994, Archbishop Joseph Duval of Rouen, the President of the French Bishops' Conference was attempting to convince Gaillot to cease in his actions; Gaillot however responded by withdrawing his offer of resignation, desiring that the scenario not be reduced to the same response given by the Vatican in the case of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen.\n\nAt the height of the controversy that Bishop Gaillot caused during his tenure as Ordinary of Évreux, he was the target of a bitter campaign to disparage his name. Unsubstantiated allegations of homosexuality, racism, anti-Semitism, and psychosis and neurosis were all made by highly placed authorities in the French clergy. Bishop Gaillot countered in kind. He branded Archbishop Duval an \"ayatollah\" seeking to impose \"ideological uniformity\" within the French Bishops' Conference. Further, he also compared the leadership style of Cardinal Gantin to those of the East German political police the Stasi.\n\nTestament to Gaillot's strong yearning to reach out to the 'exiled' is the fact that by the time he left office at the Diocese of Évreux he had visited more prisons than any bishop in France's history.\n\nOn 13 January 1995, Jacques Gaillot was summoned to a meeting with Bernardin Cardinal Gantin, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops at the Vatican City. He was offered the choice of resigning his see and becoming bishop emeritus of Évreux, or being removed from the see. In the latter case, he would be assigned to the titular see of Parthenia. Gaillot chose not to resign; instead, he left the Vatican and returned to France to give a press conference, providing one short press release to explain the events:\n\nThe See of Parthenia, now located in the desert of Algeria, has not existed in reality since the 5th century when it was in the Roman province of Mauritania. This function is a kind of sinecure with no pastoral responsibilities. Gaillot still continues to reach out however, this time on the internet, as a \"virtual bishop\".\n\nGaillot made no coat of arms or episcopal decide for himself either in Évreux or after his removal from that see. He found that to be more in the realm of heraldry and nobility. Asked whether he could yet name a suitable device, he quoted a verse from the Quran (2, 256): \"En religion pas de contrainte\", In religion no coercion.\n\nThis removal sparked an emotional response from thousands of people across France and the rest of the world. Twenty thousand people, including Gaillot's own mother, attended Bishop Gaillot's last mass at the Cathedral in Évreux and stayed on the streets protesting the Vatican's decision. Protestors united under the leadership of the Communist mayor of the region and marched on the streets during the rain. With the Cathedral full, many people stayed outside for the bishop's last mass. Still being a bishop he left his cross, mitre and staff behind in Évreux.\n\nThe choice to remove Bishop Gaillot as ordinary of Évreux was widely seen as a mistake by both lay people and clergy, and also by many non-religious people who had come to view Gaillot favorably. After his removal, a reported forty thousand people wrote letters to the Cathedral office at Évreux, with more being sent to the Vatican and eminent prelates. He was perceived favorably by a significant number of people, particularly due to his ministry to all people without distinction. In addition, he had become a national figure after the sanctions taken against him.\n\nOfficial polls taken at the time consistently revealed the French public to be against the punishment brought upon Gaillot. One CSA survey showed that total of 64 percent of the public were against the firing of Jacques Gaillot as bishop of Évreux, with only 11 percent approving of his firing and a remaining 25 percent being undecided. Some later polls showed that support for Gaillot might even have been as high as 75 percent.\n\nReaction from the French clergy varied. While no French bishop expressed public support for Bishop Gaillot, Monsignor Jean-Michel Di Falco, the official spokesperson for the clergy hierarchy, reported that both Cardinal Coffy of Marseille and Archbishop Duval were \"visibly troubled\" by the actions taken against Gaillot. Duval later released an official statement saying that \"I pleaded for patience in Rome\". Only weeks later, Duval was on record as saying that he \"regretted\" the manner in which Rome had dealt with Gaillot. Duval later came to summarise the actions as being \"an authoritarian act which cannot be accepted by society, even if it is carried out by the Church\".\n\nAs well as this the Archbishop of Cambrai, , defended Gaillot saying that \"This is a wound for our church... It is a source of misunderstanding for the poor and for all those who seek the truth and who put their trust in the church.\"\n\nAfter being removed from his position as prelate of Évreux, Bishop Gaillot wrote the following comment:\n\nAfter leaving the Bishop's Palace, Gaillot immediately moved in with illegal squatters in Paris' infamous Rue de Dragon street. Since then he has shown similar solidarity with the homeless. Bishop Gaillot continues to defend human rights and engage in activism, regularly publishing information about his activities on the website of Partenia.\n\nHe remains active as a pastor to the excluded. He also travels throughout France and also internationally, spreading the word of the Christian Gospel and defending those who are considered \"outcasts\" (namely immigrants). He is an avid anti-war protester and is considered by many to be a strong socialist. Jacques Gaillot had a strong friendship with Abbé Pierre.\n\nIn 1995, after his removal as Bishop of Évreux, Gaillot attended a Call to Action conference in Detroit as one of the keynote speakers. He held three sessions, proving to be very popular despite speaking through a translator. He hosted the conference alongside other controversial Catholic Theologians including Professor Hans Küng and Bishop Thomas Gumbleton.\n\nThe removal of his responsibility over a specific geographical diocese permitted Gaillot to be even more daring in his activism. Indeed, in 1995 following his removal, Bishop Gaillot engaged in protests regarding the policy of French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. Gaillot went with a fleet of protest ships, being on the Greenpeace vessel \"Rainbow Warrior\" himself, he was subsequently removed from the ship by French commandos, given that \"Rainbow Warrior\" had sailed within the exclusion zone, and escorted back to the atoll.\n\nGaillot has been so active in his beliefs that he has had to be stopped by the Vatican on numerous occasions, including one time when he was given a direct order by Pope John Paul II to avoid a conference in Italy about homosexuality.\n\nOn World Youth Day, in Bonn, 2004, Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Cologne invoked Canon 763, which allows a bishop for some grave reason to prevent another bishop speaking in his diocese, to ban Gaillot from addressing a session of the event on the topic of \"Being a Christian in the Third Millennium: A Faith which has Hope\".\n\nAlso in 2004 Bishop Gaillot met with Maryam Rajavi, a controversial Iranian political activist. Gaillot strongly criticised the actions of some extremist religious leaders in Iran, going on to comment that “One must not forget that the strength of truth will make it [the Iranian resistance] triumphant. Darkness will give way and truth will prevail despite all the lies and ruses”. Rajavi publicly thanked the bishop and expressed that his support had been very effective in promoting the cause of the Iran resistance.\n\nFurthermore, Gaillot has also taken position as a well-known public figure in France, fighting for a number of causes; Gaillot serves as the co-chairman of one of France's foremost Human Rights activist groups, \" (Rights First), among other groups.\n\nIn 2007 Gaillot expanded his use of the internet by posting a video interview on the website \"Google Video\", attempting to bring attention to the escalating violence occurring in Darfur.\n\nBishop Gaillot has written over a dozen books; one of them, \"A cry on Exclusion\" (\"Coup de gueule contre l'exclusion\") got much media attention. The book criticized the French laws on immigration proposed by the then-minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua. This book was the justification for his demotion by the Catholic hierarchy. Another book released shortly after his demotion was \"Voice From the Desert: A Bishop's Cry for a New Church\". This book was mainly an autobiographical text discussing events surrounding his demotion.\n\nHe has expressed his publical support for euthanasia and same-sex marriage, when it was legalized in France.\n\nIn September 2015, Pope Francis welcomed French Bishop Jacques Gaillot to his Vatican residence. They talked for 45 minutes. Gaillot said the pontiff encouraged him to continue his activism on behalf of migrants and refugees. After the meeting, Gaillot said he was “in love” with Francis.\n\n\n\n"}

Heinrich Himmler, commander of the SS, who placed great interest in Ariosophy,\ngave the \"SS Julleuchter\" as a presentation piece for SS soldiers to celebrate the winter solstice, from approximately 1936 until 1944. Heinrich Himmler originally had the intention to make the Julleuchter a standard gift to all SS members and there were no criteria attached to its presentation. For reasons which are not entirely clear, by the start of World War II, the Julleuchter had begun to be viewed as an SS decoration, and was entered as such in SS service records once the Julleuchter had been presented. However, as the SS-Julleuchter was considered \"non-portable\" (much like the Luftwaffe Honor Goblet), there was no outward display on an SS uniform indicating its presentation.\n\nThe design of the \"Julleuchter\" was based on an early modern (late 18th century or early 19th century) unburnt clay candle-holder from Halland, Sweden. \nThis particular specimen is kept in the Nordic Museum in Stockholm (inv. nr. 32.477). It has a height of 15 cm and a base of 8.2 cm squared. \nThe candle-holder has an incised heart shape and below a six-spoked opening.\nThis artefact was described in 1888 in the magazine of the Swedish literary club Runa (founded by Johan August Strindberg), which compared the six-spoked window in its base with the shape of the medieval \"h\"-rune; the 1888 article attributed a 16th-century date to the object (the earliest date of the introduction of candles to Scandinavian households).\n\nThere are several surviving specimens of this type of early modern candle-holder from Sweden. There is nothing to suggest that it was in any way connected to Yule in particular. The artefact type was also called \"Turmleuchter\" (\"tower lantern\") in some 1920s to 1930s German sources.\nA comparable specimen was on display in the open-air museum of Skansen, based on a photograph kept in the Detmold state archive.\n\nThe \"Runa\" article came to the attention of Herman Wirth because of its supposed \"Hagal rune\" (the six-spoked window at its base) who mentioned it in his Ura Linda Chronik, whence it passed into Nazi-era Germanic mysticism.\nIn a 1936 memorandum, Heinrich Himmler set forth a list of approved holidays, in part supposedly based on \"pagan\" traditions, including a \"Julfest\" intended to replace Christian rites.\nThe Julleuchter and other symbols were also meant to serve as a consolation to women who, by having married into the SS, had to renounce the spiritual shelter and service of their church.\nThe SS soldier was instructed to set up a shrine that included a \"Julleuchter\" in the corner of one room of his household.\n\nAn article about the \"Julleuchter\" was published in the German magazine \"Germanien\" in December 1936. The author argued that this \"millennia old\" lantern was to be used as \"a memento of the \"Year of the Great Migrations of the people of the north\"\". Another article was published in the SS periodical \"SS-Leitheft\" Jahrgang 7 Folge 8a. In 1939 the \"Julleuchter\" was also mentioned in \"Die Gestaltung der Feste im Jahres und Lebenslauf in der SS-Familie\"(Celebrations of the SS Family) by Fritz Weitzel.\n\nThe information about the 1936 issue of \"Germanien\" magazine about the Julleuchter is actually from the later magazine \"Der Freiwillige.\" The article in \"Der Freiwillige\" reports \"Germanien\" magazine being, …\"the official organ of the German ancestor inheritance registered association, Berlin.\" The information given in that latter article is from \"Germanien\" magazine.\n\nA 1936 issue of \"Germanien\" magazine claimed that the \"millennium old\" lantern had been used as a memento of the \"Year of the Great Migrations\" of the people of the north and as the small light of humanity under the stars of the night sky. When used during the 2 Solstice periods of the year, this is a symbol of the victory of Light over the Darkness, and also as a token of Eternal Circulation. The Julleuchter stands for an inseparable community, its conscience and attitude, and that it was used as a symbol of never ending sunlight. Further, the magazine stated that when the \"Julleuchter\" was used during the holiday of Yule (what is now known as The 12 Days of Christmas), twelve candles are used. One is used each night symbolizing the twelve months, until the 31 of December when the \"July Moon shines.\" On that night a thirteenth candle is used for the new coming month of January. The candles always burn below but on the last night, the candle is again transferred upward- this is the sun, which is spilled in order to return to the earth from the gloom of another peace.\n\nThe SS-Julleuchter was considered both an award and trophy of the German Schutzstaffel that was presented to members of the SS from approximately 1936 until 1944 as a service decoration. Manufactured by the Allach porcelain company, the SS Julleuchter was presented to any SS member who participated in a \"Julfest\".\n\nHeinrich Himmler originally had the intention to make the Julleuchter a standard gift to all SS members and there were no criteria attached to its presentation. For reasons which are not entirely clear, by the start of World War II, the Julleuchter had begun to be viewed as an SS decoration, and was entered as such in SS service records once the Julleuchter had been presented. However, as the SS-Julleuchter was considered \"non-portable\" (much like the Luftwaffe Honor Goblet), there was no outward display on an SS uniform indicating its presentation.\n\nApparently even as the Red Army was advancing and the fall of Berlin was in the foreseeable future, The \"Julleuchter\" was used during the decoration French volunteers in the Waffen-SS. One surviving soldier said, \"In the light of a candle burning on a \"Julleuchter\", a Jule Candlestick, symbolizing the never dying sunlight, Fenet decorated a number of comrades with the Iron Cross. Although simple, the ceremony that evening seemed all the more extraordinary.\"\n\nIn January 1936, the SS Porzellan Manufaktur Allach was created in Munich under the control of Heinrich Himmler. Well known artists were forced to participate. The output of the factory included over 240 porcelain and ceramic models. Due to a rapid expansion, the factory was not able to meet production targets, and so in October 1937 a part of production was shifted to the SS-operated Allach sub camp of the Dachau concentration camp. Originally the Allach factory manufactured only art ceramic, like plates, jugs and vases, but in the war years they also produced simple utensils like ointment containers and cafeteria table-ware.\n\nSpecial occasion gift items for SS supporters were also made and given away at dinner parties and other events. Starting from 1941 German civilians and about 50 prisoners of the Allach sub camp of the Dachau concentration camp were forced to produce art and porcelain. The Allach sub camp of Dachau remained the main location for porcelain manufacture even after the original factory in the town of Allach was modernized and reopened. The factory in the town of Allach was retrofitted for the production of ceramic products such as household pottery. The fall of the Third Reich brought an end to the Allach factory. The Allach factories were shut down in 1945 and never reopened.\n\nAllach porcelain made a variety of candle holders ranging from elaborate gilded baroque candelabras, to the most basic plain white porcelain single candle holder. More candleholders were made than for other Allach items, indicating popularity and interest among the German people. The varying styles and low cost (due to slave labor) of the candleholders produced at Allach allowed most Germans of every class to own them.\n\nThe Allach factory deposited the \"Julleuchter\" design with the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin on 16 January 1936.\nThe Allach \"Julleuchter\" was unique in that it was made as presentation piece for SS officers to celebrate the winter solstice. It was later given to all SS members on the same occasion, 21 December. Made of unglazed stoneware, the \"Julleuchter\" was decorated with early pagan Germanic symbols.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "86364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86364", "title": "Liturgy", "text": "Liturgy\n\nLiturgy is the customary public worship performed by a religious group, according to its beliefs, customs and traditions. As a religious phenomenon, liturgy is a communal response to and participation in, the sacred through activity reflecting praise, thanksgiving, supplication or repentance. Ritualization may be associated with life events such as birth, coming of age, marriage, sex and death. It thus forms the basis for establishing a relationship with a divine agency, as well as with other participants in the liturgy. Methods of dress, preparation of food, application of cosmetics or other hygienic practices are all considered liturgical activities.\n\nTechnically speaking, liturgy is a subset of ritual. When ritual is undertaken to participate in a divine act or assist a divine action, it is liturgy. If the ritual does not have this purpose it is not liturgy but only ritual. Thus, the word, sometimes rendered by its English translation \"Service or Divine Service\", refers to a formal ritual, which may or may not be elaborate, enacted by those who understand themselves to be participating in a divine action, such as the Eastern Orthodox Divine Liturgy (), Catholic Mass, the Eucharist or Mass (Anglican Communion). A daily activity such as the Muslim salah and Jewish synagogue services would be ritual but not liturgy. If the Temple were re-established, the ritual undertaken by the Judaic priesthood within the Temple would be liturgy.\n\nThe word \"liturgy\", derived from the technical term in ancient Greek (), \"leitourgia\", which literally means \"work of the people\" is a literal translation of the two words \"litos ergos\" or \"public service\". In origin it signified the often expensive offerings wealthy Greeks made in service to the people, and thus to the \"polis\" and the state. Through the \"leitourgia\", the rich carried a financial burden and were correspondingly rewarded with honours and prestige. The \"leitourgia\" were assigned by the polis, the State and Roman Empire and became obligatory in the course of the 3rd century A.D. The performance of such supported the patron's standing among the elite and the popular at large. The holder of a Hellenic \"leitourgia\" was not taxed a specific sum, but was entrusted with a particular ritual, which could be performed with greater or lesser magnificence. The chief sphere remained that of civic religion, embodied in the festivals: M.I. Finley notes \"in Demosthenes' day there were at least 97 liturgical appointments in Athens for the festivals, rising to 118 in a (quadrennial) Panathenaic year.\" However groups of rich citizens were assigned to pay for expenses such as civic amenities and even payment of warships. Eventually, under the Roman Empire, such obligations, known as munera, devolved into a competitive and ruinously expensive burden that was avoided when possible. These included a wide range of expenses having to do with civic infrastructure and amenities; and imperial obligations such as highway, bridge and aqueduct repair, supply of various raw materials, bread-baking for troops in transit, just to name a few.\n\nBuddhist liturgy is a formalized service of veneration and worship performed within a Buddhist Sangha community in nearly every traditional denomination and sect in the Buddhist world. It is often done once or more times a day and can vary among the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana sects.\n\nThe liturgy mainly consists of chanting or reciting a \"sutra\" or passages from a sutras, a \"mantra\" (especially in Vajrayana), and several \"gathas\". Depending on what practice the practitioner wishes to undertake, it can be done at a temple or at home. The liturgy is almost always performed in front of an object or objects of veneration and accompanied by offerings of light, incense, water and food.\n\nJewish liturgy are the prayer recitations that form part of the observance of Rabbinic Judaism. These prayers, often with instructions and commentary, are found in the \"siddur\", the traditional Jewish prayer book. In general, Jewish men are obligated to pray three times a day within specific time ranges (zmanim). while, according to the Talmud, women are only \"required\" to pray once daily, as they are generally exempted from obligations that are time dependent.\n\nTraditionally, three prayer services are recited daily:\nAdditional prayers:\n\nFrequently in Christianity, a distinction is made between \"liturgical\" and \"non-liturgical\" churches based on how elaborate or antiquated the worship; in this usage, churches whose services are unscripted or improvised are called \"non-liturgical\". Others object to this usage, arguing that this terminology obscures the universality of public worship as a religious phenomenon. Thus, even the \"open\" or \"waiting\" worship of Quakers is liturgical, since the waiting itself until the Holy Spirit moves individuals to speak is a prescribed form of Quaker worship, sometimes referred to as \"the liturgy of silence\". Typically in Christianity, however, the term \"the liturgy\" normally refers to a standardised order of events observed during a religious service, be it a sacramental service or a service of public prayer. In the Catholic tradition, liturgy is the participation of the people in the work of God, which is primarily the saving work of Jesus Christ. In the liturgy, Christ continues the work of redemption.\n\nThe term \"liturgy\" literally in Greek means \"work for the people\", but a better translation is \"public service\" or \"public work\", as made clear from the origin of the term as described above. The early Christians adopted the word to describe their principal act of worship, the Sunday service (Holy Eucharist, Holy Communion, Mass or Divine Liturgy). This service, liturgy, or ministry (from the Latin \"ministerium\") is a duty for Christians as a priestly people by their baptism into Christ and participation in His high priestly ministry. It is also God's ministry or service to the worshippers. It is a reciprocal service. As such, many Christian churches designate one person who participates in the worship service as the liturgist. The liturgist may read announcements, scriptures, and calls to worship, while the minister preaches the sermon, offers prayers, and blesses sacraments. The liturgist may be either an ordained minister or a layman. The entire congregation participates in and offers the liturgy to God.\n\n\"Salāt\" (\"prayer\", ' or : '; pl. \"\") is the practice of physical and compulsory prayer in Islam as opposed to dua, which is the Arabic word for supplication. Its importance for Muslims is indicated by its status as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\nSalat is preceded by ritual ablution and usually performed five times a day. It consists of the repetition of a unit called a \"rakʿah\" (pl. \"rakaʿāt\") consisting of prescribed actions and words. The number of obligatory (\"fard\") \"rakaʿāt\" varies from two to four according to the time of day or other circumstances (such as Friday congregational worship, which has two rakats). Prayer is obligatory for all Muslims except those who are prepubescent, menstruating, or in puerperium stage after childbirth.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18221066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18221066", "title": "Luqman", "text": "Luqman\n\nLuqman (also known as Luqman the Wise, Luqmaan, Lukman, and Luqman al-Hakeem; ) was a wise man for whom Surah Luqman (), the thirty-first surah (chapter) of the Quran, was named. While the Quran does not state many personal details about Luqman's life, including when or where Luqman lived, later Islamic traditions have elaborated upon his story. Some tales portray him as a man of Nubian descent, while others state that he was of South Arabian origin. There are many stories about Luqman in Persian, Arabic and Turkish literature, and various tafsir collections comment upon these stories. The Quran does not state whether or not Luqman was a prophet, and Islamic scholars have differing views of the matter. The Bahá'í holy writings also make reference to Luqman.\n\nThe Quranic account of Luqman's life involves him offering his son religious and moral advice. He urges his son to avoid polytheism and worship Allah alone. He also instructs his son to be modest in attitude and to avoid arrogance. While the text states that Allah gave Luqman \"wisdom\", it does not explicitly state that he is a prophet.\n\nThe tafsir written by the scholar Ibn Kathir places Luqman in Nubia or Ethiopia and portrays him as a carpenter and a slave. He states that while Luqman was a \"righteous servant\" of Allah, he was not a prophet. One tale recounted in Ibn Kathir's writings involves Luqman's master ordering him to slaughter a sheep and to bring its worst parts to him. Luqman slaughtered the sheep and took its heart and tongue to his master. The master was confused upon receiving them, but Luqman stated that \"There is nothing better than these if they are good, and there is nothing worse than these if they are bad\", demonstrating his perception and wisdom.\n\nOther Islamic traditions portray Luqman as an Arab poet and wise man from the people of ʿĀd who lived in Al-Ahqaf, near modern-day Yemen. A large number of stories demonstrating Luqman's sharp mind have made their way into Islamic tradition, including his attempts to gain a woman's love. Over time, a large number of proverbs have been attributed to him, rendering him a sort of Arabic Aesop figure. One saying attributed to Luqman has him crediting his success in life to \"truthful speech, fulfilling the trust, and leaving what does not concern me.\"\n\nA number of scholars speculate that he was a mythical figure known in pre-Islamic times, though there has been much debate about the relationship of the pre-Islamic and Islamic Luqmans. Some maintain that the two are the same person; others that they simply share the same name.

{"id": "19423394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19423394", "title": "Maya priesthood", "text": "Maya priesthood\n\nUntil the discovery that Maya stelae depicted kings instead of high priests, the Maya priesthood and their preoccupations had been a main scholarly concern. In the course of the 1960s and over the following decades, however, dynastic research came to dominate interest in the subject. A concept of royal 'shamanism', chiefly propounded by Linda Schele and Freidel, came to occupy the forefront instead. Yet, Classic Maya civilization, being highly ritualistic, would have been unthinkable without a developed priesthood. Like other Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican priesthoods, the early Maya priesthood consisted of a hierarchy of professional priests serving as intermediaries between the population and the deities. Their basic skill was the art of reading and writing. The priesthood as a whole was the keeper of knowledge concerning the deities and their cult, including calendrics, astrology, divination, and prophecy. In addition, they were experts in historiography and genealogy. Priests were usually male and could marry. Most of our knowledge concerns Yucatán in the Late Postclassic, with additional data stemming from the contemporaneous Guatemalan Highlands..\n\nThe Maya class of the priests is sometimes thought to have emerged from a pre-existing network of shamans as social complexity grew. The classic Siberian shaman is characterised by his intimate relationship with one or several helper spirits, ʻecstatic’ voyages into non-human realms, and often operates individually, on behalf of his clients. In 20th-century Maya communities, diviners, and also curers, may show some features of true shamans, particularly vocation through illness or dreams, trance, and communication with a spirit. In reference to these features, they are often loosely called ʻshamans’ by ethnographers. On the other hand, priests are chiefly cultic functionaries operating within a well-defined hierarchy and offering food, sacrifices and prayers to the deities on behalf of social groups situated on different levels. In 20th-century Maya communities of the north-western Guatemalan highlands, the hierarchies of 'Prayermakers' offer examples of such priests. The Prehispanic religious functionaries described by men like Diego de Landa, Tomás de Torquemada and Bartolomé de las Casas were also priests, not shamans.\n\nAmong the Mayas, priestly functions were often fulfilled by dignitaries who were not professional priests, but this fact cannot be used to argue the nonexistence of a separate priesthood. The \"Popol Vuh\" stereotypically describes the first ancestors as \"bloodletters and sacrificers\" and as the carriers of their deities, a priestly function. To the Kʻicheʻ kings and highest dignitaries coming after them, the kingship was a sacred institution and the temple service a duty: during certain intervals, they abstained from intercourse, fasted, prayed, and burnt offerings, \"pleading for the light and the life of their vassals and servants.\" Although the text describes the three temples dedicated to the first ancestors' patron deities and names what appear to be the two high priests of the main deities (the Lords Ah Tohil and Ah Cucumatz), it does not discuss, or even mention, local priests.\n\nAccording to some Yucatec sources, too, the rulers and the high nobility carried out priestly tasks. The highest Mayapan nobility, for example, is stated to have served continually in the temples; for the early Choles, no regular priesthood is mentioned, so that one might assume that the chiefs performed the priestly functions themselves. The Yucatec king (or \"head chief of a province\"), known as the \"halach uinic\" (‘true man’), is defined both as a ‘governor’ and a ‘bishop’. Without a grounding in esoteric and ritual knowledge, a ruler could apparently not function.\n\nFor the Classic period, the king should probably be considered a sacred, priestly king, perhaps subsuming in his person the priesthood as a whole. The latter idea has been used as an explanation for the seeming lack of references to priests in Classic period texts. The idea of the king representing the priesthood should not be pushed to its limits, however, since due to our lack of knowledge of priestly titles and imperfect understanding of the script, textual references to priests may easily pass unnoticed. The existence of a separate Classic priesthood, at the kingdom's court as well as in its towns and villages, is hardly doubtful; its absence would constitute an anomaly among early civilizations.\n\nThe main description of a priestly hierarchy as it functioned in the first decades of the 16th century stems from Landa's account of Yucatec society, but isolated terms for priestly offices have also been transmitted from other Maya groups.\n\nIn Yucatán, priests were sons of priests or second sons of nobles. The priesthood provided high status positions for those children of the Maya nobility who could not obtain political office. They were trained through an apprentice system, with young adults being selected according to their descent and individual abilities.\n\nThe high priest of the kingdom ('province') was called \"ahau can mai\" or \"ah kin mai\", with \"mai\" being either a family name or a functional designation. The position was hereditary, usually passed on to sons or close relatives. The high priest lived from the contributions of his town priests and the gifts of the lords. The responsibilities of the \"ahau can mai\" included the writing of books; the teaching of the Maya script and the Maya calendar to the novices; examining and appointing new priests and providing them with books; performing the more important rituals; and advising the other lords.\n\nThe town priest was called \"ah k’in\", a word with a basic meaning of 'diviner' (\"k’in\" by itself meaning 'sun' or 'day'). The \"ah k’inob\" had the responsibility of conducting public and private rituals within individual towns throughout the province. They \"preached and published the festival days,\" determined the appropriate steps in case of need, made sacrifices, and administered the \"sacraments\", acts connected to life cycle rituals. The town priests were assisted by four old men called \"chac\".\n\nThe priests carrying out human sacrifice were called \"ah nakom\"; their status was relatively low. Priests giving oracles were known as \"chilan\" or \"chilam\", ‘oracular priest’ (often translated as ‘prophet’; an influential role, with the \"Chilam Balam\" as a prime example). The \"chilan\" may have used mind-altering substances.\n\nThe last independent Maya state, the 17th-century Itzá kingdom of Nojpetén, was ruled by the king, Kan Ek’ and the high priest, \"Ajk’ín\" Kan Ek’. Their priesthood seems to have consisted of 12 priests: In the hall of the dwelling of the petty king, Ajau Kan Ek’, was a stone table with twelve seats for the priests. This priestly college is reminiscent of the twelve head priests of the kingdom of Mayapan. The Itzá high priest should perhaps be counted its 13th member. Thirteen priests are also mentioned as part of a classificatory system shared by the Yucatec and the Itzá states, and further comprising 13 \"katuns\", 13 provinces and 13 ambassadors.\n\nIn Chichen Itza (Temple of the Chac Mool under the Temple of the Warriors), long-robed, aged and ascetic-looking characters with broad-rimmed feather hats have been depicted that are carrying offerings. They are seated in a row with rain deity impersonators (perhaps rainmakers) directly behind them, and have been interpreted as Itzá priests.\n\nIn dictionaries concerning the 16th-century Pokom Mayas of the Verapaz, one finds terms like \"ah mai\" and \"ah zi\" ʻthose who make offerings'; \"ah zacumvach\", ‘white countenance’ and \"ah quih\" for diviner; and \"ihcamcavil\", ‘carrier of the idol’, a function like that fulfilled by the first ancestors of the Kʻicheʻ and probably referring to priests serving in processions. Black sorcerers (\"ah itz\", \"ah var\", \"ah kakzik\") were consulted by lords and princes for witchcraft against enemies and for defensive magic.\n\nAt least seven centuries separate the early Spanish missionary descriptions of the Maya priesthood from Classic Maya society. Although archaic religions tend to be very conservative, it can not be assumed beforehand that these descriptions are valid for the Classic priesthood as well. It has been suggested that the priestly function of the king completely overshadowed that of the priests (see above). Nonetheless, Classic iconography appears to show various sorts of priests, and some hieroglyphic titles have been suggested to be priestly ones. Amongst these are \"ajk'uhuun\" ('worshipper'), \"yajaw k'ahk\" ('master of fire'), \"ti'sakhuun\" ('prophet'), and \"yajaw te\"' ('master of the tree/woods'). Priestly duties included sacrifice and the propitiation of deities, inauguration of kings, writing and interpretation of codices, and of course maintenance of ritual spaces and paraphernalia. Without being permanent ministers, the kings of the Classic Period (\"k'uhul ajaw\" or \"holy lord\") regularly officiated \"ex officio\" as high priests.\n\nClassic art, particularly scenes on vases, depicts characters writing and reading books, aspersing and inaugurating kings, overseeing or performing human sacrifice, and presiding over burial rites, all activities suggestive of priests. These characters, sometimes aged and ascetic, can show some of the attributes of Late-Postclassic priesthood mentioned in Yucatec sources. Among these Postclassic attributes are long, heavy vestments and 'chasubles'; feather jackets; 'miters'; aspergillums; and tail-like ribbons hanging down from the jacket.\n\nChief among the patron deities of the Classic priests was the upper god, Itzamna, first priest and first writer, still shown officiating in one of the pictures of the Late-Postclassic Madrid Codex. Patron deities of writing and calendrical reckoning were of obvious importance to the priesthood, especially the writers among them, and included a Maya maize god and the Howler Monkey Gods. The Howler Monkey God also personified the day sign, suggesting that he may more specifically have been a patron of diviners.\n\nThe priestly hierarchy disappeared in the wake of the Spanish Conquest. Following the disastrous epidemics of the first colonial decades, the Mesoamerican priestly functions were restructured to fit within the incipient new order. In Yucatán, the village herbalists and curers seem to have become responsible for the rituals of the forest and the fields as well, and thus to have become a sort of village priests. Their name, \"ahmen\", already occurs in the earliest colonial dictionaries, yet only with the restricted meaning of ‘craftsman’. Originally only a maker of all sorts of poultices, the curer-\"ahmen\" gradually appears to have become a maker of prayers and sacrifices as well. Naturally, then, priestly \"ahmenob\" are not yet mentioned in Landa’s account. The literate aspects of the Prehispanic priesthood were partly assumed by local school masters and church singers (\"maestros cantores\"), who may also have been among the writers and compilers of the \"Chilam Balam\" books.\n\nIn the Guatemalan Highlands, the colonial and modern development was different and eventually resulted in thoroughly organized, indigenous priestly hierarchies, such as that of Momostenango. In this town, a hierarchy of ‘mother-fathers’ is charged with the priestly tasks of prayer and sacrifice: two of them on behalf of the town as a whole, fourteen for the wards, and three hundred for the patrilineages. Besides this hierarchy, a large part of the population (about 10000) has been initiated as diviner (\"ajk’ij\").\n\n"}
{"id": "23883848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23883848", "title": "Mormonism and Christianity", "text": "Mormonism and Christianity\n\nMormonism and Christianity have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of Mormonism using standard biblical terminology and have similar views about the nature of Jesus' atonement, bodily resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the Trinitarian views of orthodox Nicene Christianity, codified in the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creeds of 325 and 381; Mormonism is the largest nontrinitarian denomination within Christianity. Though Mormons consider the Bible as scripture, they do not believe in biblical inerrancy. They have also adopted additional scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Mormons practice baptism and celebrate the Eucharist, but they also participate in religious rituals not practiced by traditional Christianity.\n\nFocusing on differences, some Christians consider Mormonism \"non-Christian\"; but Mormons, focusing on similarities, are sometimes offended at being so characterized. Mormons do not accept non-Mormon baptism nor do non-Mormon Christians usually accept Mormon baptism. Mormons regularly proselytize individuals actually or nominally within the Christian tradition, and some Christians, especially evangelicals, proselytize Mormons. Some view Mormonism a form of Christianity, but distinct enough from traditional Christianity so as to form a new religious tradition, much as Christianity is more than just a sect of Judaism.\n\nThe Mormonism that originated with Joseph Smith in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of nineteenth-century Protestant Christianity. Mormons believe that God, through Smith and his successors, restored various doctrines and practices that were lost from the original Christianity taught by Jesus. For example, Smith, as a result of his \"First Vision\", primarily rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity and instead taught that God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct \"personages\". While the largest Mormon denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), acknowledges its differences with mainstream Christianity, it also focuses on its commonalities such as its focus on faith in Christ, following the teachings of Jesus Christ, the miracle of the atonement, and many other doctrines.\n\nWith roots within radical Protestantism of the 1820s and 1830s, Mormonism soon diverged dramatically from traditional Christianity.\n\nMormonism arose in the 1820s during a period of radical reform and experimentation within American Protestantism, and Mormonism is integrally connected to that religious environment. As a form of Christian primitivism, the new faith was one among several contemporary religious movements that claimed to restore Christianity to its condition at the time of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe Book of Mormon (1830), which codifies the earliest Mormon doctrine, was intended, in part, to settle ongoing doctrinal disputes among contemporary Christian denominations and to create a single shared theology. Joseph Smith believed in the Bible and shared the Protestant tradition that the Bible (excluding the Apocrypha) was originally revealed by God to humanity and had contained the \"fulness of the gospel.\" Nevertheless, Smith believed the Bible of his era had degenerated from its original form. Smith blamed the Catholic Church for the loss of biblical books and for introducing corruptions and obfuscations in the biblical text. Smith said that the Book of Mormon revealed \"plain and precious things that had been taken away\" from the Bible. Smith also completed an unpublished revision of the Bible in 1833, which he said corrected many of these errors, and added inspired commentary. Smith endowed the Book of Mormon with status equal to the Bible.\n\nViews on the Nature of God in early Mormonism has been a matter of debate. Thomas G. Alexander argues that early Mormon theology was \"essentially trinitarian,\" A statement in the Lectures on Faith is used to defend this belief:\n\nThere are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme power over all things, by whom all things were created and made, that are created and made..They are the Father and the Son-the Father being a personage of spirit, glory, and power possessing all perfection and fullness, the Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle.\nRobert L. Millet suggests that Smith simply had not had God's physical nature revealed to him when he gave the lecture:\n\nIt is possible that Joseph Smith simply did not understand the corporeal or physical nature of God at the time the Lectures on Faith were delivered. His knowledge of things-like that of all men and women-was often incremental, and his development in understanding was therefore a \"line upon line\" development. As a result of the First Vision, the boy prophet knew that the heavens were no longer sealed; that satan was more than myth or metaphor; and that the Father and Son were separate and distinct personages.\nMillet also argues that a statement by Truman Coe in 1836 reinforces the idea that early Mormon doctrine differed from the orthodox Protestantism of the day:\n\nThey (The Mormons) believe that the true God is a material being, composed of body and parts; and that when the Creator formed Adam in his own image, he made him about the size and shape of God himself.\nKurt Widmer stated that \"early Mormons were reacting against a heavily intellectualized and theologized Trinitarian concept of God\" and the nature of God was not at first of central importance to Smith.\n\nEarly Mormon soteriology, although not following a preexisting tradition, was generally Arminian in tendency. Early Mormonism agreed with Methodists and the Disciples of Christ in rejecting Calvinistic doctrines in favor of Christian perfection and free will (called free agency).Also, while the Book of Mormon affirmed the doctrine of original sin, it also agrees with other Arminian denominations that children are incapable of sin and in a state of grace.\n\nLike other Christian primitivists, Smith located the authority of Christianity in correct interpretation of the Bible—although he also maintained (as did the Shakers) that interpretation of the Bible should be guided by new and continuing revelation. Initially, the authority of Smith's faith was based on correct doctrine and his own claim of prophethood. Then during the early 1830s, Smith added to this authority apostolic succession, represented by angelic apostles and prophets who Smith said had ordained him.\n\nFrom the mid-1830s to his death in 1844, Smith continued to introduce ideas and practices which differed significantly from traditional Protestantism. First, Smith pressed Christian perfection beyond Protestant orthodoxy. He followed non-Protestant Christians in rejecting the doctrine of justification by faith alone and moved toward universalism by introducing a hierarchy of three glorious heavens, in which even the wicked had a place. In the late 1830s, Smith introduced baptism for the dead by proxy as a means for unredeemed souls to accept salvation in the afterlife, and he also taught that the ordinance of marriage was required to reach the highest level of salvation. Smith also introduced a second anointing ritual, after which a participant was guaranteed virtually unconditional salvation. This has been seen as an attempt to retain the Calvinistic ideas of assured salvation.\n\nIn his later years Smith also differed from traditional Protestantism in his views on the nature of God and humanity. Eventually Smith reduced the difference between God and man to one of degree. Both God and man are coeternal and uncreated. He taught that humans could progress to an exalted state in which they became coequal with a God who was material, plural, and himself a glorified man existing within time. Smith taught that both God the Father and Jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies, and that the Holy Spirit was a personage of Spirit. Because God had once been a man who had risen to a high position in heaven, humans too could progress to godhood. Such a teaching implied a vast hierarchy of gods who would rule kingdoms of inferior intelligences, and so forth in an eternal hierarchy. Unlike the god of traditional Christianity, the god envisioned by Smith did not create the eternal spirits of humanity—he only organized them and provided them with a plan to follow in his footsteps. God was God not because he was an \"ex nihilo\" creator, but because he had the greatest intelligence.\n\nAfter Smith's death, his successor Brigham Young and others built upon Smith's late teachings and introduced more significant doctrinal innovations. The resulting religious tradition defined the Mormonism of the Mormon pioneer era in the 19th century. An important part of this pioneer Mormonism is the Adam–God doctrine, which became the most prominent (but not exclusive) theology of 19th-century Mormonism. Young taught that God the Father was Adam, a mortal man resurrected and exalted to godhood. Proponents of this doctrine believed that Father Adam, as the subordinate member of a three-god council, created the earth. Adam was both the common ancestor and the father of all spirits born on the earth. After ascending again to his heavenly throne, Adam returned to physically father Jesus by Mary.\n\nSome elements of Mormonism from the pioneer era, including polygamy and the Adam–God doctrine, were renounced around the turn of the 20th century by the LDS Church. However, these elements have been retained within the small branch of Mormonism known as Mormon fundamentalism.\n\nNear the turn of the 20th century there was a movement to codify LDS theology with official statements of Church leaders — which served to quash speculative ideas that persisted as sub rosa concepts among some Mormons. This coincided with an effort to stop new plural marriages — mostly forbidden in 1890 and completely forbidden after 1904. Prominent Mormons such as Joseph F. Smith, John A. Widstoe, and James E. Talmage formulated the outlines of Mormon orthodoxy with publications that significantly narrowed the realm of acceptable speculative Mormon theology. \n\nIn traditional Christianity, as expressed in the Athanasian Creed, God is conceived both as a unity and a Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are described as three persons of one uncreated divine being, equally infinite, eternal, and unchangeable. Though modern Mormons share with traditional Christianity a belief that the object of their worship comprises three distinct persons, Mormon theology disagrees with the idea that the three persons are the same being. \n\nMormons are constrained by the language of the Book of Mormon to regard the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as \"one\", but consider this a social unity rather than ontological. Mormons since the time of Joseph Smith have regarded God as plural. They regard God the Father as the biblical god Elohim, and they believe that the Son, a distinct being, is both Jesus and the biblical God Jehovah. The two of them, together with the Holy Spirit, are believed to form a heavenly council which Mormons call the \"Godhead\". They are \"one\" in the sense of being lovingly united in purpose or will, a view sometimes called social trinitarianism. Unlike traditional Christians, modern Mormons generally regard the Son as subordinate to the Father.\n\nMormons since the 1840s have believed that God is changeable. They believe that the Father (like the Son) was twice \"born\"—once as a spirit, and again as a mortal man. After he lived a mortal life, Mormons believe that the Father died, was resurrected, and achieved his godhood along with at least one wife whom Mormons refer to as the Heavenly Mother. Some believe that the Heavenly Father and Mother gave birth to the spirits of humanity through a sexual union. Modern Mormons believe that Jesus, the Son, was the first born of these spirits.\n\nWhile Mormons might agree with the statement that the Father and the Son are \"uncreated\", their understanding of \"creation\" differs from that of traditional Christianity. Mormons do not believe, as do traditional Christians, that God created the universe \"ex nihilo\" (from nothing). Rather, to Mormons the act of creation is to organize or reorganize pre-existing matter or intelligence. Traditional Christians consider God to be a \"necessary being\", meaning that he cannot \"not\" exist, while all other creations are \"contingent beings\". In Mormonism, by contrast, every god and human is equally a necessary being.\n\nThe Mormon sense of \"eternal\" differs from that of traditional Christians, who believe that God's eternal nature exists outside of space and time. Some situate the Mormon God within space and time. However, Mormon scripture states that \"time is measured only unto man.\" They believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-eternal, but they also believe that all of humanity is co-eternal with the Father in the sense that the underlying spark of all intelligence has always existed (in space and time) and never was created.\n\nMormons believe that God is scrutable through revelation, and anthropomorphic, in that he has a physical body of flesh and bone. Although Mormons do believe in traditional Christian notions that God is omnipotent and omniscient, modern Mormons also believe that \"[e]ven God's omnipotence must conform to the attributes of truth and wisdom and justice and mercy\".\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has never officially adopted a doctrine of soteriology, most Mormons accept the doctrine of salvation formulated by B. H. Roberts, John A. Widstoe, and James E. Talmage in the early 20th century. In contrast to early Mormons, modern Mormons generally reject the idea of original sin. The Fall of Man is viewed not as a curse but as part of God's Plan of Salvation.\n\nMormons believe they must not only have faith and repent but also be baptized (by immersion and by a Mormon priesthood holder) and bring forth good works. Mormons consider their weekly Eucharist (\"the Sacrament\") as a means of renewing their baptismal covenant and being repeatedly cleansed from sin. Although the grace of Jesus plays a role in salvation, each Mormon must \"work out his own salvation\". Mormons believe that people not baptized during their lifetime may accept salvation in the afterlife through the Mormon practice of baptism for the dead. Although the Book of Mormon rejected the doctrine of universal reconciliation, Smith later taught that damnation was a temporary state from which the wicked would ultimately escape after they had paid for their sins, to be resurrected into one of the two lesser kingdoms of glory.\n\nMormonism takes an extended view of Christian perfection, asserting that through the grace of Jesus, Mormons may become perfectly sanctified and thereby literally become gods or achieve a state known as exaltation. To achieve exaltation, Mormons must remain obedient to the teachings of Jesus, receive all the ordinances (or sacraments), which includes baptism, confirmation, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood (for males), the temple endowment, and being sealed to a spouse. To \"make sure\" the election of believers, Smith introduced a second anointing ritual, whose participants, upon continued obedience, were sealed to exaltation.\n\nLike Catholicism and Orthodoxy, Mormonism assigns considerable authoritative status to church tradition and ecclesiastical leadership. Mormons emphasize the authority of an institutional church, which in all Mormon denominations derives from the Church of Christ established by Joseph Smith in 1830. Mormons believe this church to be the \"only true and living church.\" Below Jesus as the head of the church is a single man chosen as the \"Prophet\" who holds the position of President of the Church. The Prophet has been compared to the Pope in Catholicism because both, within their respective faiths, are regarded as the leading authority.\n\nMormons also believe in apostolic succession. However, Mormons believe the Catholic line of succession is invalid because of a Great Apostasy that occurred soon after era of the apostles. The line of succession was restored through Joseph Smith when biblical prophets and apostles appeared to him and ordained him through the laying on of hands with lost priesthood authority. Thus, Mormons believe that non-Mormon clergy have no heavenly authority and that sacraments performed by clergy of other faiths are of no effect in the eyes of God. Mormons reject the Protestant doctrine of the \"priesthood of all believers\", but they consider all confirmed Mormons to have the \"Gift of the Holy Ghost\" (also conveyed by the laying on of hands), which entitles believers to spiritual gifts but to no ecclesiastical authority.\n\nSome claim that in the late-20th century, a conservative movement within the LDS Church (called \"Mormon neo-orthodoxy\" on the analogy of an earlier Protestant neo-orthodoxy) emphasized the Book of Mormon over later revelations and embraced original sin, an absolute, eternal, and unchanging God, a pessimistic assessment of human nature, and a doctrine of salvation by grace rather than by works.\n\nDespite the book's importance to early Mormonism, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings. Joseph Smith's later teachings and writings focused on the Bible, including his own revision and commentary of the Authorized King James Version. The book was not regularly cited in Mormon conferences until the 1980s. Within the LDS Church, a movement to re-emphasize the Jesus-based elements of Mormonism in the 1980s included a rediscovery of the Book of Mormon. In 1982, the church subtitled the book \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\", to emphasize that Jesus was a central focus of the book and that the book is intended to be a complement to the Bible.\n\nAlthough Mormon neo-orthodox scholars say they have faced \"resistance\" from Mormon orthodoxy, some perceive the direction of the movement to be consistent with a broader trend among the LDS hierarchy to present Mormonism in terms more acceptable to mainline Christianity. Critics argue that because Mormonism is not based on an authoritative systematic theology, and much of Mormon scripture was written when Mormonism was \"essentially trinitarian\", Mormon leaders and apologists have been able to deny that at least some of 20th-century orthodox Mormonism represents official Mormon doctrine. It is also claimed that LDS Church publications and a few Mormon scholars have increasingly used the language of Nicene Christianity to describe the nature of God.\n\nThe existence and implications of the movement continues to be debated. Theologian Richard Mouw asserts that Mormons have downplayed some of its more \"heretical\" doctrines in order to obtain more effective dialogue with other Christians. Terryl Givens, a Mormon theologian, has rejected such claims, asserting instead that many Mormon \"heresies\" eventually become more accepted by much of Christianity. He consequently contends that \"Christian consensus is fluid and, in some cases, has lagged behind the Mormon model.\"\n\nIn the past, most mainstream Christian denominations rejected Mormonism outright, frequently calling it a cult and characterizing it as \"non-Christian.\" Although mainstream Christian denominations still reject Mormons as being non-Christian, the image of Mormonism has metamorphosed during the 20th century in large part due to an evolution of Mormon theology and partly due to a deliberate effort on the part of the leadership of the LDS Church. According to Jan Shipps, during the 1950s the attitude of mainstream Christians towards Mormonism changed from \"vilification\" to \"veneration,\" with emphasis on positive Mormon traits such as \"family orientation, clean-cut optimism, honesty and pleasant aggressiveness.\"\n\nRichard Abanes attributes an \"increasing lack of delineation between (Mormonism and mainstream Christianity)\" to three primary causes:\nRichard Bushman asserts that, for many people, Mormonism \"conjures up an assortment of contradictory images\". One set of images suggests that Mormons are \"happy, uncomplicated, kindly and innocent—if perhaps naive\". In contrast to this set of images, Bushman describes a set of associations that focuses on \"a powerful religious hierarchy controlling the church from the top\". This perspective views Mormons as \"secretive, clannish and perhaps dangerous\", often labeling the movement as a \"cult rather than a church\".\n\nStephen E. Robinson has argued that Mormons are labeled heretics \"for opinions and practices that are freely tolerated in other mainstream denominations.\"\n\nMormonism has a particularly rocky relationship with American Evangelical Christianity. However, the view of Mormonism being non-Christian or a cult is not a uniformly held belief among Evangelicals, especially with those that have personal experience with Mormons in their community. Richard J. Mouw, President of Fuller Theological Seminary, an evangelical school in Pasadena, California, stated in a recent opinion piece for CNN, \"[t]hose of us who have made the effort to engage Mormons in friendly and sustained give-and-take conversations have come to see them as good citizens whose life of faith often exhibits qualities that are worthy of the Christian label, even as we continue to engage in friendly arguments with them about crucial theological issues.\" William Saletan has been more blunt about this, stating \"[w]hy don’t we challenge anti-Mormonism? Because it’s the prejudice of our age.\" Joe Scarborough has drawn analogies between the Pharisees in the New Testament and prominent evangelical religious leader Robert Jeffress calling Mormonism a cult.\n\nLatter Day Saint history comes from the position that other churches were the product of the apostasy, as referenced in the Bible. Mormons view other Christian churches as teaching some truth, doing good works, and acknowledge their strong faith in Christ. However, Mormons also maintain that all other churches lack the divine authority to perform the ordinances of the gospel because of the Great Apostasy. The LDS Church and most other Latter Day Saint factions do not accept the baptisms of other Christian denominations as valid.\n\nThe Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity reject Mormon claims of additional scriptures, and of the prophetic office of Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders; they disagree with Mormon charges that they have committed apostasy. Doctrines such as the beliefs about the existence of prophets in early American civilizations, which are unique to Mormon theology and not found in the teachings of other Christian churches are also causes of disagreement. Nonetheless, many Christian denominations treat Mormons with respect, while not minimizing the differences in belief.\n\nIn 2001, in the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican's Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith decided not to accept Latter-day Saint baptisms as valid. The Catholic Church generally recognizes baptisms from other Christian faiths in the name of the Trinity, provided the person baptizing intends to do as the Church intends. However, because of differences in Mormon and Catholic beliefs concerning the Trinity, the Catholic Church stated that Mormon baptism was \"not the baptism that Christ instituted.\" The Catholic Bishop of Salt Lake City, George Hugh Niederauer, stated that this ruling should not be a statement of the LDS relationship with Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church USA, the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, publishes a brochure describing the LDS Church as follows:\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran body in the US, notes that Lutherans have been among those Christians who do not re-baptize other baptized Christians; however, it publishes the following statement on the recognition of Mormon baptisms:\n\nIn its 2000 General Conference, the United Methodist Church decided not to recognize Latter-day Saint baptisms, stating:\n\nThe Episcopal Church (USA), part of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion, does not have an official position on the validity of Mormon baptism; however, most traditional clergy would not accept Mormon baptism and require the baptism of Mormons entering into the Episcopal Church. Retired bishop Carolyn Tanner Irish of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of 8, her baptism was deemed valid upon her entering into the Episcopal Church in 1977, where she was confirmed by bishop of Washington, Rev. John T. Walker. As with the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church does not recognize Mormons as historic Apostolic Christians, but rather as a new and unique religious movement that is an offshoot of Christianity.\n\nMany other Christian churches also seek to teach or convert Mormons when the opportunity arises. Traditional Christian leaders often encourage their followers to follow the admonition of and witness to others using gentleness and respect. Like their Mormon counterparts, those from the traditional Christian religions assert that these proselytizing efforts arise out of love and genuine concern for others and not a desire to cause contention. Consequently, though the feelings may be strong, there is often a feeling of mutual appreciation and respect that accompanies missionary efforts on both sides (though this is not always the case). Some traditional Christian denominations have ministries focused on Mormons, just as they also have ministries toward Jews, Native Americans, or other demographic groups. For example, the 1998 convention of the Southern Baptist Convention held in Salt Lake City had the stated aim to \"bring Christianity to the Mormons.\"\n\nThere are also many independent ministries and organizations focused on Mormons.\n\nA 2007 Pew Poll showed that 31% of the general public in the United States believe that Mormons are not Christians. Similar polls have concluded that over two-thirds of the general public view Mormons as members of the larger Christian community, including many independent evangelical ministries and prominent evangelical leaders. \n\nHowever, in an October 2010 poll conducted by LifeWay Research, three out of four American Protestant pastors did not believe that Mormons were Christians.\n\nIn the 1960s, the LDS Church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as temple dedications. It also would work to get stories covering Family Home Evening, the church's welfare plan and the church's youth activities in various publications.\n\nAs part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier anti-Catholic rhetoric. In Bruce R. McConkie's 1958 edition of \"Mormon Doctrine\", he had stated his opinion that the Catholic Church was part of \"the church of the devil\" and \"the great and abominable church\" because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.\n\nIn 1973, the LDS Church recast its missionary lessons, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new lessons, named \"A Uniform System for Teaching Families\", de-emphasized the Great Apostasy, which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the First Vision. After a further revision in the early 1980s, the lessons dealt with the apostasy even less conspicuously by moving its discussion from the first lesson to later lessons. The lessons also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.\n\nIn 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words \"JESUS CHRIST\" in large capital letters. According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, \"The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nIn 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the \"Church of Jesus Christ\". The release discouraged the use of the term \"Mormon Church\".\n\nRiess and Tickle assert that, starting in the late twentieth century, Mormons have focused their attention on Jesus Christ more than at any other time since the inception of their faith. Some critics of the LDS Church have accused church leaders of attempting to disingenuously portray the church as \"just another Christian denomination\" when, in fact, there are significant differences. Riess and Tickle argue that these critics are failing to grasp that this recent emphasis on Jesus Christ is part of a genuine theological evolution that concurrently involves a renewed interest in the Book of Mormon.\n\nRoss Anderson asserts that, \"(i)n public, LDS spokesmen downplay their Church's distinctive doctrines.\"\n\nPatricia Limerick suggests that future historians may conclude that, in the last four decades of the 20th, the general authorities of the LDS Church \"undertook to standardize Mormon thought and practice\". According to Limerick, this campaign of standardization has led to a retreat from the distinctive elements of Mormonism and an accentuation of the church's similarity to conventional Christianity.\n\nAccording to Claudia Bushman, \"[t]he renewed emphasis on scripture study, especially the Book of Mormon, led the Church away from speculative theology. The freewheeling General Conference addresses of earlier years, elaborating unique LDS doctrines, were gradually replaced with a basic Christian message downplaying denominational differences.\"\n\nRecent church presidents have tended to downplay those doctrines that served to distinguish Mormonism from mainline churches. Richard Abanes asserts that President Gordon B. Hinckley \"on numerous occasions demonstrated his willingness to seriously downplay any issues that might be construed as controversial.\"\n\nIn 2001, Hinckley stated that message of the LDS Church was \"Christ-centered. [Christ is] our leader. He's our head. His name is the name of our church.\"\n\nWhen speaking about other faiths, modern LDS leaders have adopted a policy of avoiding the use of critical and judgmental language in official church publications, and encouraged members of the church to be respectful of the beliefs of others as they witness in their personal lives. When speaking about other faiths, church magazines are often complimentary and focus on providing factual information rather than on sensationalizing or otherwise seeking to undermine the creeds and practices of others.\n\nSeveral presidents of the LDS Church over the years have emphasized the need for Mormons to recognize the good contributions those of other faiths make to the world.\nRon Rhodes asserts that, \"The Mormon church has in recent years sought to downplay its exclusivism as the 'restored' church. Indeed, the Mormon church has increasingly become involved with the Interfaith movement, joining with various Christian denominations in various charities.\"\n\nTraditional Christian denominations and the LDS Church share work in providing welfare or humanitarian aid. In recent years, the LDS Church has opened its broadcasting facilities (Bonneville International) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network.\n\nThere have been independent activities among individuals from both traditions who attempt to discuss openly about issues of faith. In November 2004, Fuller Theological Seminary President Richard Mouw, and Ravi Zacharias, a well known Christian philosophical apologist, addressed a congregation of Mormons and Evangelicals gathered in the Salt Lake Tabernacle for an event sponsored by Standing Together Ministries that was well received despite the differences they acknowledged between Mormonism and the Christian Evangelical perspectives.\n\nMormons proselytize to all people, including members of other Christian churches, holding to the belief that God told Joseph Smith \"that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt; that: 'they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.'\" Because ministering to those of other Christian faiths can be a sensitive task when feelings on both sides are strong, leaders of the LDS Church have counseled members to be sensitive, to exercise caution, and to avoid contentions in their preaching. Despite the criticisms of other creeds, a tone of respect has consistently been encouraged by Mormon leaders. For example, Wilford Woodruff, an early president of the church and a contemporary of Joseph Smith taught:\n\nWhen you go into a neighborhood to preach the Gospel, never attempt to tear down a man’s house, so to speak, before you build him a better one; never, in fact, attack any one’s religion, wherever you go. Be willing to let every man enjoy his own religion. It is his right to do that. If he does not accept your testimony with regard to the Gospel of Christ, that is his affair, and not yours. Do not spend your time in pulling down other sects and parties. We haven’t time to do that. It is never right to do that.\n\nWhile the LDS Church has been clear about its disagreements with many of the theologies and practices of other religions and seeks actively to convert all people to its own teachings, it has also always adopted a policy of toleration for others and defended the rights of all people to worship God freely. Article 11 of the church's Articles of Faith written by Joseph Smith states, \"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.\" Smith spoke often of the need for Mormons to be civil and courteous in their treatment of others, particularly those who were not of their faith, and to be willing to defend the right of anyone to religious freedom. He said:\nIf we would secure and cultivate the love of others, we must love others, even our enemies as well as friends... I possess the principle of love. All I can offer the world is a good heart and a good hand. The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a \"Mormon\", I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination. ... It is a love of liberty which inspires my soul.\n\nBecause Mormon missionaries proselytize to all, including other Christians, some Christian organizations have published tracts, brochures and books designed to counter these missionary efforts.\n\nConciliar Press, a department of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, has published a brochure designed to inform Orthodox Christians of the proselytizing efforts of what it describes as \"cultists\" (Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses).\n\nIn 2006, the Catholic bishops in Slovakia urged all Catholics in the country not to sign a petition allowing the LDS Church to be legally recognized in that country.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The town consists of (of which 0.1 km² is of water), and several building complexes, homes, apartment buildings, and businesses including the Sri Sri Radha Vrindaban Chandra Temple (RVC Temple) and Prabhupada's Palace of Gold. New Vrindaban was founded in 1968 under the direct guidance of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of ISKCON. It is named for the Indian city of Vrindavan.\n\nAccording to the 2010 US Census, the six census blocks that make up New Vrindaban had a population of 352 and had the West Virginia status of unincorporated town. It is bordered on the north and northwest by Big Wheeling Creek, on the East by Stull Run, and on the southwest by the village of Limestone. The town's water and sewage utilities are provided by the New Vrindaban Public Service District, and following the Marshall County Commission's road naming project all streets in New Vrindaban have been fully named. In addition to ISKCON, the town is the location of McCreary Cemetery, resting place of West Virginia pioneer Lewis Wetzel; various locally owned businesses; and other ISKCON-affiliated organizations. The chief components in New Vrindaban's economy are tourism, agriculture, and cottage industries.\n\nThe religious organization ISKCON New Vrindaban is the largest holder of land in New Vrindaban with 38% of the land. The nonprofit organization ECO-Vrindaban, Inc. holds 14%, and all other organizations and individuals own 48% of the land encompassing New Vrindaban. In addition to the previously mentioned organizations, as of 2010 jewellery manufacturer Lone Ones Inc., organic commercial bakery World's Best Cookie, Vaishnava Performing Arts Inc., and Vedic Heritage Trust Inc. had facilities in New Vrindaban.\n\nThe community was founded in 1968 by Kirtanananda Swami and Hayagriva Das, two early disciples of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. New Vrindaban developed under the guidance of Kirtanananda Swami (honored as \"Srila Bhaktipada\" after March 1979), and by the mid-1970s the live-in population had grown to over 100. By the 1980s the population was more than 500.\n\nISKCON New Vrindaban is strictly vegetarian and believes that meat consumption creates negative karma. Alcoholic beverages and illegal substances (such as drugs) are prohibited in the main holy sites around the Temple of Understanding Circle Drive.\n\nAccording to ISKCON News, on 4 July 1983 Vedavyasa Priya Swami installed the statue of Sri Nathji at the RVC Temple. Conversely, according to Gargarishi Das, the deity was not installed by Vedavyasa Priya, but was installed instead by Kirtanananda Swami.\n\nIn October, 1986, a census report showed 377 adults living at the community.\n\nOn March 16, 1987, during their annual meeting at Mayapur, India, the ISKCON Governing Body Commission expelled Kirtanananda from the society for \"moral and theological deviations.\" The community of New Vrindaban was expelled from ISKCON a year later.\n\nAfter Kirtanananda Swami left New Vrindaban, and new leadership stabilized, the community was readmitted to ISKCON in 1998. The \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" reported in 2006 the population stood at about 100. However, this number only indicated how many people were members listed in the community directory rather than official census numbers.\n\nOriginally intended in 1972 to be a residence for A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), the plans evolved after Prabhupada's death in November 1977 for an ornate palace of marble, gold and carved teakwood, which was dedicated as a memorial shrine on September 2, 1979. Kirtanananda Swami, the leader of the New Vrindaban community, and Bhagavatananda das, the community's principal architect and sculptor, were the two primary forces behind its design and construction.\n\nIt reportedly cost $600,000 in materials, and the labor was donated by the devotees. The unpaid workers were often untrained and learned on the job.\n\nKirtanananda explained, \"In the beginning, we didn't even know how to lay blocks. As our Krishna consciousness developed, our building skills developed, then our creativity developed, and the scope of the project developed.\"\n\nPrabhupada's Palace of Gold opened in 1979 to positive reviews. CBS PM Magazine reported, \"the magnificence of the Palace of Gold would be hard to exaggerate.\" Life magazine called the Palace \"a place where tourists can come and be amazed.\" The New York Times proclaimed \"Welcome to Heaven.\" The Washington Post called the palace \"Almost Heaven.\" The Courier-Journal of Louisville stated, \"It's hard to believe that Prabhupada's Palace is in West Virginia.

{"id": "43079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43079", "title": "One Thousand and One Nights", "text": "One Thousand and One Nights\n\nOne Thousand and One Nights () is a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition (c. 1706 – c. 1721), which rendered the title as \"The Arabian Nights' Entertainment\".\n\nThe work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central, and South Asia and North Africa. Some tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Greek, Indian, Jewish and Turkish folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras, while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work \"Hezār Afsān\" (, lit. \"A Thousand Tales\"), which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.\n\nWhat is common throughout all the editions of the \"Nights\" is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryār and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.\n\nSome of the stories commonly associated with \"The Nights\", in particular \"Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp\", \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\", and \"The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor\", were not part of \"The Nights\" in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by Antoine Galland and other European translators.\n\nThe main frame story concerns Shahryār (, from Middle Persian \"šahr-dār\", lit. \"holder of realm\"), whom the narrator calls a \"Sasanian king\" ruling in \"India and China\". He is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonour him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade (, from Middle Persian \"čehr\", \"lineage\" + \"āzād\", \"noble\"), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.\n\nThe tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of erotica. Numerous stories depict jinns, ghouls, apes, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.\nThe different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.\n\nThe narrator's standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.\n\nThe history of the \"Nights\" is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin summarises their findings:\n\nDevices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the \"Nights\". The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the \"Nights\" by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the \"Panchatantra\" and \"Baital Pachisi\" is particularly notable. \"The Jataka Tales\" are a collection of 547 Buddhist stories, which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. \"The Tale of the Bull and the Ass\" and the linked \"Tale of the Merchant and his Wife\" are found in the frame stories of both the \"Jataka\" and the \"Nights\".\n\nIt is possible that the influence of the \"Panchatantra\" is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the \"Tantropakhyana\". Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of this work exist, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil, Lao, Thai and Old Javanese. The frame story is particularly interesting, as it follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the \"Panchatantra\"—with its original Indian setting.\n\nThe \"Panchatantra\" and various tales from \"Jatakas\" were first translated into Persian by Borzūya in 570 CE, they were later translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in 750 CE. The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.\n\nThe earliest mentions of the \"Nights\" refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, \"Hezār Afsān\" (or \"Afsaneh\" or \"Afsana\"), meaning \"The Thousand Stories\". In the 10th century Ibn al-Nadim compiled a catalogue of books (the \"Fihrist\") in Baghdad. He noted that the Sassanid kings of Iran enjoyed \"evening tales and fables\". Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian \"Hezār Afsān\", explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night; finally one concubine had the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king would delay her execution. However, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection's literary quality, observing that \"it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling\". In the same century Al-Masudi also refers to the \"Hezār Afsān\", saying the Arabic translation is called \"Alf Khurafa\" (\"A Thousand Entertaining Tales\") but is generally known as \"Alf Layla\" (\"A Thousand Nights\"). He mentions the characters Shirāzd (Scheherazade) and Dināzād.\n\nNo physical evidence of the \"Hezār Afsān\" has survived, so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery. Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection. These stories include the cycle of \"King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas\" and \"The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son\" (derived from the 7th-century Persian \"Bakhtiyārnāma\").\n\nIn the 1950s, the Iraqi scholar Safa Khulusi suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer Ibn al-Muqaffa' may have been responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the 8th century.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the scholar Nabia Abbott found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title \"The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights\", dating from the 9th century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the \"Nights\". The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title \"The One Thousand and One Nights\" appears in Cairo in the 12th century. Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:\n\nTwo main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition includes the oldest manuscripts; these versions are also much shorter and include fewer tales. It is represented in print by the so-called \"Calcutta I\" (1814–1818) and most notably by the \"Leiden edition\" (1984), which is based above all on the \"Galland manuscript\". It is believed to be the purest expression of the style of the mediaeval \"Arabian Nights\".\n\nTexts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written, and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps in order to attain the eponymous number of 1001 nights. The final product of this tradition, the so-called Zotenberg Egyptian Recension, does contain 1001 nights and is reflected in print, with slight variations, by the editions known as the \"Bulaq\" (1835) and the \"Macnaghten\" or \"Calcutta II\" (1839–1842).\n\nAll extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:\n\n\nThe texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more \"authentic\" and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as Muhsin Mahdi have suspected that this may have been caused in part by European demand for a \"complete version\"; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.\n\nThe first European version (1704–1717) was translated into French by Antoine Galland from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, \"Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français\" (\"The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French\"), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. \"Aladdin's Lamp\", and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from a Syrian Christian storyteller from Aleppo, a Maronite scholar whom he called \"Hanna Diab.\" Galland's version of the \"Nights\" was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.\n\nAs scholars were looking for the presumed \"complete\" and \"original\" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the \"standard version\". The first translations of this kind, such as that of Edward Lane (1840, 1859), were bowdlerized. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by John Payne, under the title \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night\" (1882, nine volumes), and then by Sir Richard Francis Burton, entitled \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night\" (1885, ten volumes) – the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of plagiarism. In view of the sexual imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores) and the strict Victorian laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled \"The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night\", which were printed between 1886 and 1888. It has, however, been criticized for its \"archaic language and extravagant idiom\" and \"obsessive focus on sexuality\" (and has even been called an \"eccentric ego-trip\" and a \"highly personal reworking of the text\").\n\nLater versions of the \"Nights\" include that of the French doctor J. C. Mardrus, issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by Powys Mathers, and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.\n\nA notable recent version, which reverts to the Syrian recension, is a critical edition based on the 14th- or 15th-century Syrian manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale, originally used by Galland. This version, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by Muhsin Mahdi (1984) and rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a \"definitive\" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the Mamluk period (a view that remains contentious). Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of \"the only \"real\" Arabian Nights\" recognize it as being the best source on the original \"style\" and linguistic form of the mediaeval work and praise the Haddawy translation as \"very readable\" and \"strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic flavour of those tales\". An additional second volume of \"Arabian nights\" translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales \"not\" present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995.\n\nIn 2008 a new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in three volumes. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton's. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called \"orphan stories\" of \"Aladdin\" and \"Ali Baba\" as well as an alternative ending to \"The seventh journey of Sindbad\" from Antoine Galland's original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, \"[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text,\" and the work is a \"representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye\". The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation.\n\nScholars have assembled a timeline concerning the publication history of \"The Nights\":\n\n\n\n\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and various tales within it make use of many innovative literary techniques, which the storytellers of the tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions. Some of these date back to earlier Persian, Indian and Arabic literature, while others were original to the \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\nAn early example of the frame story, or framing device, is employed in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", in which the character Scheherazade narrates a set of tales (most often fairy tales) to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales are also frame stories, such as the \"Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman\" being a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.\n\nAn early example of the \"story within a story\" technique can be found in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the \"Panchatantra\" of ancient Sanskrit literature. The \"Nights\", however, improved on the \"Panchatantra\" in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the \"Panchatantra\", stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase \"If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you.\" In the \"Nights\", this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.\n\nThe general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. This is particularly the case for the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story narrated by Scheherazade in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Within the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as \"The Three Apples\" and \"The Seven Viziers\". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, \"The Fisherman and the Jinni\", the \"Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban\" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.\n\nDramatic visualization is \"the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience\". This technique dates back to the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". An example of this is the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\n\nA common theme in many \"Arabian Nights\" tales is fate and destiny. The Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini observed:\n\nThough invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". The plot devices often used to present this theme are coincidence, reverse causation and the self-fulfilling prophecy (see Foreshadowing below). \n\nEarly examples of the foreshadowing technique of repetitive designation, now known as \"Chekhov's gun\", occur in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", which contains \"repeated references to some character or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative\". A notable example is in the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\n\nAnother early foreshadowing technique is \"formal patterning\", \"the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds\". This technique is also found in \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\nAnother form of foreshadowing is the self-fulfilling prophecy, which dates back to the story of Krishna in ancient Sanskrit literature, and Oedipus or the death of Heracles in the plays of Sophocles. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in Arabic literature (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the Hebrew Bible). Several tales in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary prolepsis. A notable example is \"The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in English folklore as the \"Pedlar of Swaffham\" and Paulo Coelho's \"The Alchemist\"; Jorge Luis Borges' collection of short stories \"A Universal History of Infamy\" featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as \"The Story Of The Two Dreamers.\"\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"The Tale of Attaf\", where Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the House of Wisdom), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful \"vizier\" Ja'far ibn Yahya from sight. Ja'afar, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of reverse causation. Near the end of the tale, Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he didn't commit but Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century, this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included in his \"Disciplina Clericalis\", alongside the \"Sindibad\" story cycle. In the 14th century, a version of \"The Tale of Attaf\" also appears in the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\".\n\n\"Leitwortstil\" is 'the purposeful repetition of words' in a given literary piece that \"usually expresses a motif or theme important to the given story\". This device occurs in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", which binds several tales in a story cycle. The storytellers of the tales relied on this technique \"to shape the constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole.\"\n\nThematic patterning is \"the distribution of recurrent thematic concepts and moralistic motifs among the various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in common\". This technique also dates back to the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (and earlier).\n\nSeveral different variants of the \"Cinderella\" story, which has its origins in the Egyptian story of Rhodopis, appear in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", including \"The Second Shaykh's Story\", \"The Eldest Lady's Tale\" and \"Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers\", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, \"Judar and His Brethren\", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.\n\nThe \"Nights\" contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this borders on satire, as in the tale called \"Ali with the Large Member\" which pokes fun at obsession with human penis size.\n\nThe literary device of the unreliable narrator was used in several fictional medieval Arabic tales of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". In one tale, \"The Seven Viziers\" (also known as \"Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs\"), a courtesan accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the Qur'anic/Biblical story of Yusuf/Joseph). Seven viziers attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds back by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers. The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in \"The Three Apples\" and humor in \"The Hunchback's Tale\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\n\nAn example of the murder mystery and suspense thriller genres in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements was \"The Three Apples\", also known as \"Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula\" (\"The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman\"), one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\nIn this tale, Harun al-Rashid comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, Ja'far, three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.\nHarun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.\n\nAnother \"Nights\" tale with crime fiction elements was \"The Hunchback's Tale\" story cycle which, unlike \"The Three Apples\", was more of a suspenseful comedy and courtroom drama rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite comedian, being invited to dinner by a tailor couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a Jewish doctor's clinic and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the \"Tale of the Jewish Doctor\", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a courtroom, all making different claims over how the hunchback had died. Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of \"The Tale of Attaf\" (see Foreshadowing above).\n\nHaunting is used as a plot device in gothic fiction and horror fiction, as well as modern paranormal fiction. Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. In particular, the \"Arabian Nights\" tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by jinns. The \"Nights\" is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls, and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story \"The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib\" (from \"Nights\" vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to Islam.\n\nHorror fiction elements are also found in \"The City of Brass\" tale, which revolves around a ghost town.\n\nThe horrific nature of Scheherazade's situation is magnified in Stephen King's \"Misery\", in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the \"Nights\" on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. As a child, he was fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he attributes some of his creations to his love of the \"1001 Nights\".\n\n Several stories within the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" feature early science fiction elements. One example is \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of djinn, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In \"Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud\", the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets.\n\nIn another \"1001 Nights\" tale, \"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other \"Arabian Nights\" tales also depict Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. \"The City of Brass\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city, which has now become a ghost town. The \"Third Qalandar's Tale\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman.\n\nThere is an abundance of Arabic poetry in \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Characters occasionally provide poetry in certain settings, covering many uses. However, pleading, beseeching and praising the powerful is the most significant.\n\nThe uses would include but are not limited to:\n\nIn a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman, standing outside the castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival. He wraps his ring in a paper and hands it to the servant who delivers it to the Queen. When she opens it and sees the ring, joy conquers her, and out of happiness she chants this poem (Arabic):\n\nوَلَقـدْ نَدِمْـتُ عَلى تَفَرُّقِ شَمْــلِنا :: دَهْـرَاً وّفاضَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْ أَجْفـاني<br>\nوَنَـذَرْتُ إِنْ عـادَ الزَّمـانُ يَلُمـُّـنا :: لا عُــدْتُ أَذْكُــرُ فُرْقًــةً بِلِســاني<br>\nهَجَــمَ السُّــرورُ عَلَــيَّ حَتَّـى أَنَّهُ :: مِـنْ فَــرَطِ مـا سَــرَّني أَبْكــــاني<br>\nيا عَيْـنُ صـارَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْكِ سِجْيَةً :: تَبْكيــنَ مِـنْ فَـــرَحٍ وَأَحْزانـــــي\nTransliteration:\nLiteral translation:\nBurton's verse translation:<br>\n\nThe influence of the versions of \"The Nights\" on world literature is immense. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib Mahfouz have alluded to the collection by name in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the \"Nights\" include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk, Goethe, Walter Scott, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Nodier, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal, Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, Gobineau, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W. B. Yeats, H. G. Wells, Cavafy, Calvino, Georges Perec, H. P. Lovecraft, Marcel Proust, A. S. Byatt and Angela Carter.\n\nVarious characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further \"long ago\" or farther \"far away\"; this process culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.\n\nIn 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began naming features on Saturn's moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton's translation because \"its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the \"Arabian Nights\" as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy\".\n\nThere is little evidence that the \"Nights\" was particularly treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist. Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as \"khurafa\" (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children). According to Robert Irwin, \"Even today, with the exception of certain writers and academics, the \"Nights\" is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written.\" Nevertheless, the \"Nights\" have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as Tawfiq al-Hakim (author of the Symbolist play \"Shahrazad\", 1934), Taha Hussein (\"Scheherazade's Dreams\", 1943) and Naguib Mahfouz (\"Arabian Nights and Days\", 1981).\n\nAlthough the first known translation into a European language only appeared in 1704, it is possible that the \"Nights\" began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by Juan Manuel's story collection \"El Conde Lucanor\" and Ramón Llull's \"The Book of Beasts\". Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the \"Nights\" are found in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in \"The Squire's Tale\" the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". Echoes in Giovanni Sercambi's \"Novelle\" and Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known. Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the Balkans and a translation of the \"Nights\" into Romanian existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.\n\nThe modern fame of the \"Nights\" derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to Robert Irwin, Galland \"played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the \"Nights\".\" The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for \"contes de fées\" (\"fairy stories\"). This fashion began with the publication of Madame d'Aulnoy's \"Histoire d'Hypolite\" in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the \"Nights\", with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the \"Nights\" spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish. Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include Anthony Hamilton's \"Les quatre Facardins\" (1730), Crébillon's \"\" (1742) and Diderot's \"Les bijoux indiscrets\" (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is Voltaire's \"Zadig\" (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background. The English versions of the \"Oriental Tale\" generally contained a heavy moralising element, with the notable exception of William Beckford's fantasy \"Vathek\" (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki's novel \"Saragossa Manuscript\" (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the \"Nights\" with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.\n\nThe work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar (when an apprentice) to a Presbyterian minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.\n\nThe \"Nights\" continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to A. S. Byatt, \"In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.\" In their autobiographical writings, both Coleridge and de Quincey refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. Wordsworth and Tennyson also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry. Charles Dickens was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the \"Nights\" pervades the opening of his last novel \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" (1870).\n\nSeveral writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale, including Théophile Gautier (\"La mille deuxième nuit\", 1842) and Joseph Roth (\"Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht\", 1939). Edgar Allan Poe wrote \"The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade\" (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of Sinbad the Sailor, along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.\n\nAnother important literary figure, the Irish poet W. B. Yeats was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, A Vision an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid, in relation to his joint experiments with his wife Georgie Hyde-Lees, with Automatic writing. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as \"a gift\" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher Qusta Ibn Luqa, who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.\n\nModern authors influenced by the \"Nights\" include James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges and John Barth.\n\nStories from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" have been popular subjects for films, beginning with Georges Méliès' \"Le Palais des Mille et une nuits\" (1905).\n\nThe critic Robert Irwin singles out the two versions of \"The Thief of Baghdad\" (1924 version directed by Raoul Walsh; 1940 version produced by Alexander Korda) and Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Il fiore delle Mille e una notte\", 1974) as ranking \"high among the masterpieces of world cinema.\" Michael James Lundell calls \"Il fiore\" \"the most faithful adaptation, in its emphasis on sexuality, of \"The 1001 Nights\" in its oldest form.\"\n\nUPA, an American animation studio, produced an animated feature version of \"1001 Arabian Nights\" (1959), featuring the cartoon character Mr. Magoo.\n\nThe 1949 animated film \"The Singing Princess\", another movie produced in Italy, is inspired by The Arabian Nights. The animated feature film, \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\" (1969), produced in Japan and directed by Osamu Tezuka and Eichii Yamamoto, featured psychedelic imagery and sounds, and erotic material intended for adults.\n\n\"Alif Laila\" (\"The Arabian Nights\"), a 1997–2002 Indian TV series based on the stories from \"One Thousand and One Nights\" produced by Sagar Entertainment Ltd, starts with Scheherazade telling her stories to Shahryār, and contains both the well-known and the lesser-known stories from \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\n\"Arabian Nights\" (2000), a two-part television mini-series adopted for BBC and ABC studios, starring Mili Avital, Dougray Scott, and John Leguizamo, and directed by Steve Barron, is based on the translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton.\n\nShabnam Rezaei and Aly Jetha created, and the Vancouver-based Big Bad Boo Studios produced \"1001 Nights\" (2012), an animated television series for children, which launched on Teletoon and airs in 80 countries around the world, including Discovery Kids Asia.\n\n\"Arabian Nights\" (2015, in Portuguese: \"As Mil e uma Noites\"), a three-part film directed by Miguel Gomes, is based on \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\nThe \"Nights\" has inspired many pieces of music, including:\n\n\n\nPopular modern video games with an \"Arabian Nights\" theme include \"Nadirim\", a game placed in a fantasy world inspired by the tales of the 1001 Nights, \"Disney's Aladdin\", \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Sonic and the Secret Rings\", and \"Bookworm Adventures\"\n\nMany artists have illustrated the \"Arabian nights\", including: Pierre-Clément Marillier for \"Le Cabinet des Fées\" (1785–1789), Gustave Doré, Léon Carré (Granville, 1878 – Alger, 1942), Roger Blachon, Françoise Boudignon, André Dahan, Amato Soro, Albert Robida, Alcide Théophile Robaudi and Marcelino Truong; Vittorio Zecchin (Murano, 1878 – Murano, 1947) and Emanuele Luzzati; The German Morgan; Mohammed Racim (Algiers, 1896 – Algiers 1975), Sani ol-Molk (1849–1856), Anton Pieck and Emre Orhun.\n\nFamous illustrators for British editions include: Arthur Boyd Houghton, John Tenniel, John Everett Millais and George John Pinwell for Dalziel's Illustrated Arabian Nights Entertainments, published in 1865; Walter Crane for Aladdin's Picture Book (1876); Frank Brangwyn for the 1896 edition of Lane's translation; Albert Letchford for the 1897 edition of Burton's translation; Edmund Dulac for Stories from the Arabian Nights (1907), Princess Badoura (1913) and Sindbad the Sailor & Other Tales from the Arabian Nights (1914).

{"id": "33813650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33813650", "title": "Persecution of minority Muslim groups", "text": "Persecution of minority Muslim groups\n\nThe Ahmadiyya regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and \"heretics\" since they are accused of not believing in the finality of prophethood since the death of Muhammad. Armed groups, led by the umbrella organization Khatme Nabuwwat (\"Finality of Prophethood\"), have launched violent attacks against their mosques in Bangladesh.\n\nThey committed massacres against them which resulted in 2,000 Ahmadiyya deaths in Pakistani Punjab. Eventually, martial law had to be established and Governor general Ghulam Mohamed dismissed the federal cabinet. This anti-Ahmadiyya movement led Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to declare that the Ahmadiyyas were \"non-Muslims\".\n\nIn 1984, the Government of Pakistan, under General Zia-ul-Haq, passed Ordinance XX, which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as Muslims. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, Mirza Tahir Ahmad migrated to London, UK.\n\nDespite Islam's egalitarian tenets, units of social stratification, termed as \"castes\" by many, have developed among Muslims in some parts of South Asia. Various theories have been put forward regarding the development of castes among Indian Muslims. Majority of sources state that the castes among Muslims developed as the result of close contact with Hindu culture and Hindu converts to Islam, while few others feel that these developed based on claims of descent from Muhammad.\n\nSections of the ulema (scholars of Islamic jurisprudence) have declared the religious legitimacy of the caste system with the help of the concept of kafa'a. A classic example of scholarly literature supporting the Muslim caste system is the \"Fatawa-i Jahandari\", written by the 14th century Turkish scholar, Ziauddin Barani, a member of the court of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, of the Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Barani was known for his intensely casteist views, and he regarded the Ashraf Muslims as racially superior to the Ajlaf Muslims.\n\nHe divided the Muslims into grades and sub-grades. In his scheme, all high positions and privileges were to be a monopoly of the high born Turks, not the Indian Muslims. Even in his interpretation of the Koranic verse \"Indeed, the pious amongst you are most honored by Allah\", he considered piety to be associated with noble birth. Barrani was specific in his recommendation that the \"sons of Mohamed\" [i.e. Ashrafs] \"be given a higher social status than the low-born [i.e. Ajlaf]. His most significant contribution in the fatwa was his analysis of the castes with respect to Islam. His assertion was that castes would be mandated through state laws or \"Zawabi\" which would carry precedence over Sharia law whenever they were in conflict.\n\nIn the Fatwa-i-Jahandari (advice XXI), he wrote about the \"qualities of the high-born\" as being \"virtuous\" and the \"low-born\" as being the \"custodians of vices\". Every act which is \"contaminated with meanness and based on ignominy, comes elegantly [from the Ajlaf]\". Barani had a clear disdain for the Ajlaf and strongly recommended that they be denied education, lest they usurp the Ashraf masters. He sought appropriate religious sanction to that effect. Barrani also developed an elaborate system of promotion and demotion of Imperial officers (\"Wazirs\") that was conducted primarily on the basis of caste.\n\nIn addition to the Ashraf/Ajlaf divide, there is also the \"Arzal\" caste among Muslims, whose members were regarded by anti-Caste activists like Babasaheb Ambedkar as the equivalent of untouchables. The term \"Arzal\" stands for \"degraded\" and the Arzal castes are further subdivided into Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, Mehtar etc. The Arzal group was recorded in the 1901 census in India and its members are also called Dalit Muslims \"with whom no other Muhammadan would associate, and who are forbidden to enter the mosque or to use the public burial ground\".They are relegated to \"menial\" professions such as scavenging and carrying night soil.\n\nThe Alawites are a secretive group that believe in the divine nature of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad. They have been persecuted in the past and survive in the remote and more mountainous parts of Syria. The ruling Ba'ath party is dominated by Alawis (President Bashar al-Assad is Alawi himself) and they have sought fatwas from Shiite clergy in Lebanon declaring that they are, in fact, Muslims.\n\nIn medieval Iraq, the Mu'tazili theological movement was made a state doctrine in 832, igniting the Mihna (ordeal) a struggle over the application of Greek logical proof of the Qu'ran; people who would not accept Mu'tazili claims that the Qur'an was created rather than eternal were sometimes persecuted. The most famous victims of the Mihna were Ahmad Ibn Hanbal who was imprisoned and tortured, and the judge Ahmad Ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i who was crucified. Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was dragged before the inquisition, known as the Mihna, ordered by the caliph al-Maʾmūn.\n\nHowever, it lost official support soon afterwards. This coincided with the rise to prominence of the Ash'ari approach to Islam, of which Al-Ghazali was a staunch defender. Sunni and Shi'a Islam became the mainstream schools of Islam.\nAs a consequence, the tables turned and some Mutazili scholars were victims of persecution themselves in the centuries to follow. Some Islamic philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna also faced persecution from fellow Muslims in their time. Mu'tazilite doctrine - by now regarded as heretical by Sunnis - continued to be influential amongst some Shia in Persia and Zaydis in Yemen.\n\nAt various times many Shi'a groups have faced persecution. All of the Twelve Imams of Shia Islam have been martyred and their followers persecuted by either Kharijites, the Umayyads, or Abassids. In 1513, Ottoman Sultan Selim I (\"The Grim\") ordered the massacre of 40,000 Shia Muslim \"heretics\" in Anatolia during the Safavid-Ottoman struggles.\n\nWhile the dominant strand in modern Sunni dogma regards Shiism as a valid \"madhhab\", following Al Azhar, some Sunnis both now and in the past have regarded it as beyond the pale, and have attacked its adherents. In modern times, notable examples include the bombing campaigns by the Sunni Sipah-e-Sahaba and the Shia Tehrik-e-Jafria, two small extremist groups, against Shia or Sunni mosques in Pakistan, the persecution of Hazara under the Taliban, and the bloody attacks linked with Zarqawi and his followers against Shia in Iraq.\n\nSome of the worst Shia-Sunni sectarian strife has occurred after the American invasion of Iraq, steadily building up to present. According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq. Sunni suicide bombers have targeted not only thousands of civilians, but mosques, shrines, wedding and funeral processions, markets, hospitals, offices, and streets. On the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly \"tortur[ing] to death or summarily\" executing \"hundreds\" of Sunnis \"every month in Baghdad alone,\" many arrested at random.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian government has been viewed as repressive against Shias living in Saudi Arabia, mainly because it encourages the Salafi faith, which denounces Shia Islam as heretical. Shias are mainly persecuted due to the belief that they are Iranian \"puppets\" and traitors. In several Saudi Arabian cities, Shia azans and Ashura demonstrations are banned.\n\nYaqub Beg's Uyghur forces declared a Jihad against Chinese Muslims under T'o Ming during the Dungan revolt. The Uyghurs thought that the Chinese Muslims were Shafi`i, and since the Uyghurs were Hanafi that they should wage war against them. Yaqub Beg enlisted non Muslim Han Chinese militia under Hsu Hsuehkung in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub, who planned to conquer Dzungharia. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory.\n\nCertain small groups - the Kharijites of early medieval times, and Takfir wal Hijra- follow \"takfirist\" doctrines, regarding almost all other Muslims as infidels whose blood may legitimately be shed.\n\nThe Kuomintang Sufi Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang, who backed the Yihewani (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafi/Wahhabis. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be \"Heterodox\" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28366", "title": "Sidon", "text": "Sidon\n\nSidon, known locally as Sayda (), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located in the South Governorate of Lebanon, on the Mediterranean coast, about north of Tyre and south of the capital, Beirut. In the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, thereby making Sidon a great grandson of Noah.\nThe Phoenician name \"Ṣīdūn\" (, ) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It appears in Biblical Hebrew as \"Ṣīḏōn\" () and in Syriac as \"Ṣidon\" (). This was hellenized as \"Sidṓn\" (), which was Latinized as \"\". The name appears in Classical Arabic as \"Saydoon\" () and in Modern Arabic as \"Ṣaydā\" ().\n\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name \"\" to honor its imperial sponsor.\n\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery. It was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia. Glass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the Murex trunculus was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.\n\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\"\nIn this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled \"‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al\" '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\n\nIn the years before Christianity, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see \"Biblical Sidon\", below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the Persian era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor Artaxerxes III and then by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, when the Hellenistic era of Sidon began. Under the successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organized games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus, the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\n\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The Romans also built a theater and other major monuments in the city. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. During the Byzantine period, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, Beirut's School of Law took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until it was conquered by the Arabs in AD 636.\nOn 4 December 1110 Sidon was captured, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the centre of the Lordship of Sidon, an important lordship in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It would remain an important Crusader stronghold until it was finally destroyed by the Saracens in 1249. In 1260 it was again destroyed by the Mongols. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\n\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance.\n\nDuring the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon - like much of Ottoman Syria - was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on September 26, 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named \"HMS Sidon\". \n\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon.\n\nFollowing the Palestinian exodus in 1948, a considerable number of Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\n\nSidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900, but studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of some wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels. (Refer to the \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and Landscape\" sections below).\nSaida International Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\n\nAccording to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\"\n\nIn another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital-city outgrew Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\n\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centred around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the \"Makab\"; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\n\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the \"Makab\" crisis—which has endangered residents health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the City's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established IBC Enviro, privately funded, and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\n\nThe city of Sidon is administrated by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administrated by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\n\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\n\nSidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seats of the Sunni Mufti and the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\n\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, with 3,060 in Beirut.\n\n\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\n\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\n\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\n\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\n\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (3200 BC -) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theatre.\n\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: \"Mission de Phénicie\" (1864–1874; \"Phoenician Expedition\").\n\nThe St. Louis land-castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\n\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognise the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\n\nThe Bible describes Sidon in several passages:\n\n\nSidon is twinned with:\n\n\n\nAdel Osseiran played a significant role at various points in the history of modern Lebanon, such as the struggle for independence (1943), the mini-civil war of 1958, and the Lausanne Conference for Peace(1984)\n\n\n\n\n"}

After their human host dies, they are freed from the body and become malevolent ghosts.\n\nThe pernicious Three Corpses/Worms work to harm their host's health and fate by initiating sicknesses, inviting other disease-causing agents into the body, and reporting their host's transgressions to the gods. The Three Corpses are supposed to keep records of their host's misdeeds, ascend to tian \"heaven\" bimonthly on the night of Chinese sexagenary \"gengshen\" 庚申 \"57th of the 60-day cycle\" while the host is sleeping, and file reports to the Siming 司命 \"Director of Destinies\" who deducts a certain number of days from the person's life for each misdeed.

Since these evil spirits feed upon decaying matter produced by grains being digested in the intestines, the practice of \"bigu\" \"abstinence from grains and cereals\" is the first step towards expelling them. \"Bigu\" alone will not eliminate the Three Corpses, but weakens them to the point where they can be killed with \"waidan\" alchemical drugs such as cinnabar, and ultimately eliminated through \"neidan\" meditation techniques.\n\nThe Chinese terms \"sānshī\" and \"sānchóng\" compound \"sān\" 三 meaning \"three, 3; several, many\" with \"shī\" 尸 or 屍 \"corpse, dead body; ritual personator representing a dead relative during Chinese ancestral sacrifices\" and \"chóng\" 蟲 or 虫 \"insect; worm; bug\".\n\nThe usual English translation of \"sanshi\" is \"three corpses\" or \"Three Corpses\". However, this Daoist term does not literally refer to \"corpses; dead bodies\" within the human body, but is linguistically causative meaning the eventual \"death; mortality\" produced by these demonic agents (Arthur 2013). Compare the English slang verb \"corpse\" meaning \"to make a corpse of, to kill\" (\"Oxford English Dictionary\" 2009). More accurate translations of \"sanshi\" are \"Three Deathbringers\" (Kohn 1993), \"Three Death-bringers\" (Komjathy 2007) [cf. the video game Death Bringer], \"three corpse-demons\" (Strickmann 2002), or \"three corpse [evils]\" (Zhang & Unschuld 2014).\n\nSynonyms for \"sanshi\" include \"fúshī\" 伏尸 \"hidden corpse\", \"shīchóng\" 尸虫 \"corpse worms\", \"shīguǐ\" 尸鬼 \"corpse ghosts\", and in reference to the three corpses named Peng (see \"Baoshengjing\" below), \"shīpéng\" 尸彭 \"corpse Pengs\" or \"sānpéng\" 三彭 \"three Pengs\". \"Sānshīshén\" 三尸神 \"Lord Three Corpses\" is an honorific alternate with \"shen\" \"spirit; god; deity\"\n\n\"Sanchong\", which the \"Lunheng\" (see below) used to mean \"intestinal parasites\", is normally translated as \"three worms\" or \"Three Worms\"; \"Three Cadavers\" is another version (Schipper 1993). Owing to the semantic polysemy of \"chong\", the term is also translatable as \"three pests\" (Needham and Lu 1986) or \"three bugs\" (Zhang and Unschuld 2014).\n\nThe expressions Three Corpses and Three Worms are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Zhang and Unschuld (2014: 414) translate \"sanchong\" 三蟲 as \"three bugs; three worms\" and define two meanings: \"Etiological Agent of all microorganisms in the body that bring forth disease\", citing Li Shizhen's (1578) \"Bencao Gangmu\" (\"chongbu\" 蟲部 \"bugs/worms section\") that, \"Bugs/worms are small organisms. There are very many types. This is the meaning of 'three bugs/worms'\"; and \"Combined Designation of \"huichong\" 蛔蟲, roundworms, \"chichong\" 赤蟲, red worms, and \"naochong\" 蟯蟲, pinworms\", citing the (c. 610) \"Zhubing yuanhou zonglun\" 諸病源候總論 \"General Treatise of Causes and Symptoms of Illnesses\", \"The three worms include long worms, red worms, and pinworms\". They give \"sanshi\" 三尸 \"three corpse [bugs/worms]\" as an Alternative Name for \"shichong\" 屍蟲 \"corpse bugs/worms\", and define it as the \"Etiological Agent of microorganisms that can bring forth all types of \"shibing\" 屍病 \"corpse [qi] disease\", citing the \"Zhubing yuanhou zonglun\" again that, \"Inside the human body there are from the beginning all the three corpse [bugs/worms]. They come to life together with man, but they are most malicious. They are able to communicate with demons and the numinous, and they regularly invite evil [qi] from outside, thereby causing human suffering\".\n\nDemonic possession and demonic medicine are ancient Chinese beliefs (Unschuld 1986: 29-46). For example, the \"Bencao gangmu\" chapter (52) on medicines derived from the human body says \"bregma; skull bone\" is good for treating tuberculosis-like consumptive diseases that are supposedly caused by evil spirits, such as \"chuánshī\" 傳尸, which is translated as \"cadaver vector disease\" (Cooper & Sivin 1973), \"consumptive and infectious disease\" (Luo 2003), and \"corpse [evil] transmission\" (Zhang & Unschuld 2014).\n\nSince the Chinese notion of \"Three Corpses\" within the human body is unfamiliar to most Westerners, meaningful English descriptions are problematic. Scholars have termed them as gods (\"transcendental beings\" Fischer-Schreiber 1996, \"supernatural beings with physical and ephemeral spirit components\" Arthur 2013, \"internal gods\" Benn 2001); demons (\"a sort of demon\" Pas 1988, \"maleficent demons\" Maspero 1981, \"malevolent beings in the body\" Eskildsen 1998, \"demonic supernatural creatures\" Kohn 1993); or both (\"semi-divine, semi-demonic agents\" Campany 2005); parasites (\"biospiritual parasites\" Campany 2002, \"body parasites\" Yamada 1989, \"parasites said to live inside the human body\" Cook 2008); and other terms (\"factors in the human body\" Needham and Lu 1986).\n\nIn Daoist physiology, the human body contains many indwellers besides the Three Corpses. \"Nèishén\" 内神 \"internal spirits/gods\" and \"shēnshén\" 身神 \"body spirits/gods\" are Daoist terms for deities inhabiting various parts of the body, including the \"wǔzàng\" 五臟 \"the five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys\", \"liùfǔ\" 六腑 \"the six receptacles: gall bladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, triple burner, and bladder\", and \"qīqiào\" 七竅 \"the seven apertures in the human head: eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth\".\n\nThese \"body residents\" (Huang 2011: 57) were either health threats or health protectors, and said to engage in constant struggles with one another. The upper, middle, and lower \"dantian\" energy-centers contained both the Three Corpses/Worms and the counterpart guardian gods called the \"sanyi\" 三一 \"Three Ones\" (Maspero 1981: 356). When the Three Corpses approach spirits within the body, they can shapeshift, sometimes appearing as evil demons and sometimes taking human form (Maspero 1981: 331).\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed in soul dualism between the \"hun\" and \"po\" souls: heavenly \"hún\" 魂 \"spiritual, ethereal, yang soul\" that leaves the body after death and the earthly \"pò\" 魄 \"corporeal, substantive, yin soul\" that remains with the corpse of the deceased. In some Daoist traditions, the body was thought to contain three \"hun\" and seven \"po\" souls. The good \"hun\"-souls are clad in red and carry a red seal in their hands, the bad \"po\"-souls, \"who long for the body to die and therefore perform mischief to try to hasten the adept's demise\", are clad in black and carry black seals (Eskildsen 1998: 49). Strickmann says the Three Corpses/Worms represent a specialized development of the \"po\"-souls' destructive propensities.\nBut unlike the \"hun\", whose nature (though flighty and inconstant) is entirely benign and whose tendencies are all heavenward, the seven \"p'o\" yearn for the earth. Their strongest wish is to rejoin the damp, dank underground springs whose moist, heavy nature they share, and so they seek to undermine and rid themselves of the constraining human body they inhabit. Thus at night, while their host is sleeping (and the airborne \"hun\"-souls are sporting and gambling with the \"hun\" of other sleepers, thereby causing dreams), the \"p'o\" beckon to passing phantoms and disease-demons and invite them in to take possession of the sleeper’s body and work toward his destruction. The very names of the seven \"p'o\"-souls suggest their harmful function, and one early list significantly begins with a corpse: corpse-dog, hidden dung, sparrow-sex, greedy-guts, flying venom, filth-for-removal, and rot-lung. (2002: 77) \n\nDaoists were fascinated with correlations between the human body and the cosmos. Maspero (1981: 339) says, \"Man and world, for the Chinese, are absolutely identical, not only as a whole but also in every detail.\" For examples, the human head is round like heaven, the feet are square like the earth; the Five Viscera correspond to the Five Phases, the 24 vertebra to the 24 solar terms, the 365 acupoints to the 365 days of the year; and the veins and arteries compare to rivers and streams.\n\nLater texts like the \"Neijing Tu\" and \"Xiuzhen Tu\" depict the \"inner landscape\" of the human body as a microcosm of the universe, which helps \"neidan\" mediators visualize their personal internal spirits. While body gods travel in and out of the body, their prolonged exit may result in sickness or death. Hence, detailed visualizations of the corpse-worms within the meditator's body is a powerful means of keeping them in place and thus promoting health and longevity (Robinet 1993: 64‑65, Huang 2010: 61).\n\nThe received canon of Chinese classics first mentioned the Three Corpses and Three Worms in the Han dynasty period (206 BCE-220 CE). Beginning in the Jin dynasty (265-420 CE), Daoist texts portrayed them in both zoomorphic and bureaucratic metaphors (Campany 2005:43). According to Isabelle Robinet (1993: 139), the Three Worms or Corpses are well known by all of the Daoist schools; for instance, they are mentioned in early Shangqing School texts such as the \"Huangting jing\" 黃庭經 \"Scripture of the Yellow Court\" and \"Dadong zhenjing\" 大洞真經 \"Authentic Scripture of the Great Cavern\". The Three Corpses are among the most widely‑documented body parasites in early and medieval Chinese literature (Huang 2011: 36).\n\nLiu Xiang's (c. late 1st century BCE) Daoist hagiography \"Liexian Zhuan\" \"Biographies of Exemplary Immortals\" (tr. Kaltenmark 1953: 177-78) first records the Three Corpses in the biography of Zhu Huang 朱璜. His Daoist master Ruan Qiu 阮丘 expelled the Three Corpses from Zhu Huang by means of a prescription combining seven drugs, administered nine times daily, over a period of a hundred days. It also quotes the \"Huangtingjing\" (tr. Schipper 1978:372) that for \"genghsen\" days, \"Do not sleep either day or night, and you shall become immortal.\"\n\nWang Chong's (c. 80 CE) \"Lunheng\" (tr. Forke 1907 2: 316) compares the \"sanchong\" 三蟲 \"Three Worms\" to \"zhì\" 蛭 \"leeches\" (also written with insect radical 虫 generally used for characters naming insects, worms, spiders, and smaller reptiles). Wang censures critics who metaphorically describe corrupt officials as worms or parasites, \"Man has three worms in his intestines [人腹中有三蟲]. The worms living in low marshes are called leeches. They eat man’s feet, as the three worms eat his bowels [蛭食人足，三蟲食腸]. To whom will these critics, so fond of similarities, compare the three worms?\" In another \"Lunheng\" section (tr. Forke 1907 1: 534), Wang Chong mentions ancient exorcisms of \"flying corpses and floating goblins\" [飛尸流凶].\n\nThe \"Inner Chapters\" of the (c. 320 CE) \"Baopuzi\", written by the Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong, is the earliest source of detailed information about the Three Corpses. This text describes the \"sanshi\" parasites causing illnesses during unlucky times in the Chinese calendar and reporting sins on \"gengshen\" days, as well as gives several methods for preparing poisonous \"waidan\" alchemical elixirs to eliminate the Three Corpses.\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" records how the Three Corpses and \"Zaoshen\" 竈神 \"God of the Stove\" make regular reports to \"Siming\" 司命 \"Director of Destinies\", who shortens the host's lifespan accordingly. Answering a question about the importance of \"jìnjì\" 禁忌 \"taboo\", Ge Hong cites three apocryphal Han texts, the \"Yineijie\" 易內戒 \"Inner Commands of the \"Book of Changes\"\", \"Chisongzijing\" 赤鬆子經 \"Classic of Master Redpine\", and \"Hetu jimingfu\" 河圖記命符 \"River Chart Life Talisman\", which is attributed to the Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長.\nTaboos are most urgent for avoiding harm and losses. \"Inner Commands of the Book of Changes\", \"Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic\", and \"The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi\" are unanimous in saying that the gods of heaven and earth who are in charge of misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of things that may give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [三尸] in our bodies, which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [魂靈鬼神之屬也]. They want us to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of the last day of the month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an oral report of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [\"ji\" 紀 \"12 year period; discipline; mark\"] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning [\"suan\" 算 \"calculate; count\"], a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) \nCompare Campany's (2002: 49) translation, \"As for the sort of beings they are, they have no physical forms but are nevertheless real, of a type with our cloud-souls and numina, ghosts and spirits (\"hunling guishen\" 魂靈鬼神)\". Among present-day Quanzhen School Daoists in Chengdu, Arthur (2013: 85) says they remain awake in meditation all night on each new moon to effectively hinder the Three Worms' damning travels. \"The idea here is that if adepts successfully hinder the Deathbringers' travels for seven consecutive \"gengshen\" nights, the Director of Destiny will fire these supernatural entities from their appointed positions, and they will die.\"\n\nAnother germane \"Baopuzi\" passage explains how the Three Corpses take advantage of \"shuaiyue weiri\" 衰月危日 \"months of weakness and days of peril\", which is a technical term for cyclical times of special vulnerability (Campany 2002: 51). Ge Hong says even someone with \"xindao zhi xin\" 信道之心 \"a heart believing in the Dao\" must expel the Three Corpses.\nIf all you have is a heart faithful to God and yet do nothing for your own benefit – your predestined life span being defective and your body threatened with harm – the Three Corpses will take advantage of your weak months and perilous days [三尸因其衰月危日], the hours when your longevity could be interrupted or sickness incurred, to summon vicious breaths and bring in any demons they might be able to find to do you injury. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 252-253) \n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" uses \"sanchong\" 三蟲 \"Three Worms\" to mean \"sanshi\" 三尸 \"Three Corpses\", and mentions both \"jiuchong\" 九蟲 \"Nine Worms\" (or \"Nine Vermin\", Benn 2001) internal parasites, and the all-encompassing \"sanshi jiuchong\" \"Three Corpses and Nine Worms\".\n\n\"Sanchong\" \"Three Worms\" synonymously means \"Three Corpses\", and the \"Baopuzi\" says both can be expelled through cinnabar-based alchemical elixirs. The first method of Xianmenzi 羡門子 expels the corpse-worms, provides immortality, and exorcises ghosts.\n... mixes three quarts of wine with a pound of cinnabar and exposes it to the sun for forty days. After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient [三蟲百病立下]. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen. This elixir can exorcize ghosts. When the unburied dead everywhere are possessing people and harming them, inflicting injuries upon our homes, and throwing up earthworks to obstruct people, no harm will come to us if this elixir is hung pointed toward the sources of disaster. (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84) \nThe second method of Wu Chengzi 務成子 expels the Three Worms, works miracles, and provides virtual immortality. The complex instructions involve melting mercury and lead in a special crucible – made from heating realgar, earthworm excreta, and cinnabar inside iron and copper tubes – in order to produce 1500 pounds of gold.\nAfter soaking for a hundred days in Vitex or red panicled millet wine, this gold softens sufficiently to be miscible with other things. If one pill of it the size of a gram is taken three times daily until one pound has been consumed, the Three Worms will cry for mercy and all illnesses will quit the body [三蟲伏尸百病皆去]. The blind will see; the deaf, hear; the aged will become like thirty; those entering fire will not be burned; all evils, all poisons, cold, wind, heat, and dampness—none of these will be able to attack such a man. If he continues the dosage until three pounds have been consumed, he will be able to walk on rivers and all the gods of the mountains and streams will come to serve and protect him. His lot of longevity will last as long as all nature. (16, tr. Ware 1966: 275-6) \n\n\"Jiuchong\" \"Nine Worms\" broadly means \"internal worms and parasites\" in the \"Baopuzi\", for instance, (5, tr. Ware 1966: 103), \"Eulalia and male fern are vermifuges\" [萑蘆貫衆之煞九蟲]. Ge Hong says that medicinal lacquer, instead of mercury, will eliminate the Nine Worms.\nIf pure, unadulterated lacquer is taken, it will put a man in communication with the gods and let him enjoy Fullness of Life. Directions: Mix it with ten pieces of crab. Take it with mica water, or mixed with jade water. The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds [九蟲悉下惡血從鼻去]. After a year, the six-\"chia\" gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you. (11, tr. Ware 1966:190) \n\n\"Sanshi jiuchong\" \"Three Corpses and Nine Worms\" is a generic name for \"bodily parasites\". They can be eliminated with an elixir called \"shendan\" 神丹 \"Divine Cinnabar\" or \"shenfu\" 神符 \"Divine Amulet\".\nTake it for one hundred days and you will be a genie. To cross streams or pass through fire, smear the soles of your feet with it and you will be able to walk on water. After taking only three spatulas of it you will see that the Three Corpses and the Nine Worms in your body will disappear, and all your illnesses will be cured [三尸九虫皆即消壞百病皆愈也]. (4, tr. Ware 1966: 77) \n\nCinnabar, the reddish ore of mercury, is the essential ingredient in many Daoist magical elixirs that expel corpse-worms, most of which (including those above attributed to Xianmenzi, Wu Chengzi, and Shendan) are also said to cure \"bǎibìng\" 百病 \"100 sicknesses; all kinds of diseases and ailments\". Ge Hong gives the Recipe for Nibbling Melted Gold attributed to Liangyizi 兩儀子 (4, tr. Ware 1966: 96), which involves alternately dipping gold 100 times into boiling hog fat and vinegar, and concludes, \"If you wish to take medicine that will banish [the Three Corpses] from your body, you must take cinnabar.\" For example, the \"xiaodan\" 小丹 \"Lesser Elixir\",\nTake one pound of cinnabar, pestled and sifted, three quarts of strong vinegar, and two quarts of lacquer. Mix these three thoroughly, and cook over a slow fire until the compound can be shaped into pills. Take three, the size of a hempseed, twice daily for thirty days, and all abdominal illnesses will be cured, and the Three Corpses that are in your body will depart [腹中百病愈三尸去]. Take for one hundred days, and your flesh and bones will become strong and sturdy. Take for one thousand days, and the Governor of Fates will strike your name from the Book of Death; you will last as long as all nature, and the sun and moon will always shine on you. You can change shape continuously. You will cast no shadow in the sun, for you will radiate your own light. (4, tr. Ware 1966: 95) \n\nLastly, a \"Baopuzi\" discussion about avoiding illnesses uses what commentators gloss as a variant name for the \"sanshi\" Three Corpses: \"sānshǐ\" 三使 \"Three Envoys [of Death]\", with \"shǐ\" \"send (an envoy); make; cause\".\nThe minor elixirs for recalling a man's ethereal breaths, the pills for countering the three Messenger-corpses [召魂小丹三使之丸], and lesser medicines made from the Five Brilliances and the Eight Minerals will sometimes melt hard ice instantly or keep one afloat in water. They can intercept ghosts and gods, lay tigers and leopards, and disperse accumulations in the digestive system and our organs. They dislodge the two lackeys of illness from the heart region and the diaphragm (Tso, Ch'eng 10.5); they raise those who have just died; return frightened ethereal breaths to the body they had quit. All these are common, everyday medicines. And, if they can still restore the dead to life, why should the superior medicines not be able to make the living immortal? (5, tr. Ware 1966: 102) \nThis refers to the \"Zuozhuan\" (tr. Legge 1872: 374) recording that after Duke Jing of Jin dreamed about being cursed with two boyish disease-demons hiding in his body, he fell into a latrine and died in 581 BCE.\n\nGe Hong's (c. 3rd-4th century) \"Shenxian zhuan\" Daoist hagiography of Liu Gen 劉根 quotes instructions passed from legendary Qin dynasty \"xian\" Han Zhong 韓眾, which explain how the Three Corpses can cause nightmares.\nIf you desire long life, the first thing you must do is to expel the three corpses. Once the three corpses are expelled, you must fix your aim and your thought, eliminating sensual desires. I [Liu Gen] then received [from Han Zhong the scripture] \"Divine Methods in Five Sections\" (\"Shenfang wupian\" 神方五篇) [for this purpose]. It says: \"The ambushing corpses always ascend to Heaven to report on people's sins on the first, fifteenth, and last days of each month. The Director of Allotted Life Spans (\"Siming\" 司命) deducts from people's accounts and shortens their life spans accordingly. The gods within people's bodies want to make people live, but the corpses want to make them die. When people die, their gods disperse; the corpses, once in this bodiless state, become ghosts, and when people sacrifice to [the dead] these ghosts obtain the offering foods. This is why the corpses want people to die. When you dream of fighting with an evil person, this is [caused by] the corpses and the gods at war [inside you].\" So I followed his [or the scripture's?] instructions, synthesized [the elixir] and ingested it, and thereby attained transcendence. (tr. Campany 2002: 51, 245-6) \n\nThe (c. 1029) \"Yunji Qiqian\" Daoist anthology (tr. Maspero 1981: 333) also describes internal gods and the Three Corpses fighting within the human body, \"When in dreams one finds oneself fighting with wicked men, this is the Corpses struggling with the Spirits.\"\n\nNightmares were also a significant side-effect of expelling the Three Corpses through \"bigu\" fasting and poisonous elixirs. \nThe corpse-demons may manifest themselves in the ascetic’s dreams in the guise of three men garbed in rather old-fashioned costumes. As the program of anti-corpse treatment gets underway and the drugs begin to take effect, the adept will dream that his father or mother has died, or that his wife and children have been murdered. Or else the victims will be his sisters or brothers, or a woman, or he will dream that a grave has been destroyed and the coffin has vanished, or else that he is undergoing the five types of mutilating punishment. All these are said to be indications that the corpse-demons are about to be destroyed. (Strickmann 2002: 78) \n\nThe \"Zhouhou beiji fang\" 肘后备急方 \"Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies\", which is also attributed to Ge Hong but contains later emendations, lists the \"wǔshī\" 五尸 \"Five Corpses\"—external corpse-demons that enter the body at the invitation of the Three Corpses.\n\nThe (4th century CE) \"Ziyang zhenren neizhuan\" 紫陽真人內傳 \"Inner Biography of the True Person of Purple Yang\" described the appearance of the Three Corpses and how to eliminate them. Ziyang zhenren is the honorific name of the legendary Daoist \"xian\" Zhou Yishan 周義山 (b. 80 BCE), who supposedly bestowed the Shangqing revelations on Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-c. 386). According to Zhou's biography, he learned alchemical and dietetic recipes to expel the Three Corpses from his master Su Lin 素林, who had learned them from his masters Qin Gao 琴高 and Qiusheng 生仇. \nThis Shangqing text records a widely quoted recipe, attributed to Zhou Yishan, for killing the Three Worms/Corpses. It combines 7 drugs: 7/10 of a bushel of hemp-seeds, 7 ounces of \"Smilax\", 6 ounces of \"Rehmannia glutinosa\", 5 ounces of aconite, 5 ounces of cloud-shaped agaric mushrooms, 4 ounces of cinnamon, and a 7-inch long \"Zanthoxylum\" root. Then, one boils a root of \"Acorus calamus\" in 1 1/2 bushels of wine to produce pure essential liquor. \nSoak the seven drugs in this, then decant the mixture into a vase; but that will still not do. After leaving the drugs to macerate for three nights, take them out and put them in the sun to dry out. (Then) again take the aforesaid liquor and steep (the seven drugs) in it for three nights. Once more draw off (the wine) from them and put them in the sun (and continue this alternative steeping in the wine and drying them) until the wine is exhausted; then stop putting them out to dry. Pound them in an iron mortar and put them through a fine sieve to reduce them to powder. Then take white honey and mix the powder with it for making pills. In the morning, facing East, roll two pills the size of a small pea; then increase this by one pill (each day) to ten or more. This regimen cures third-degree fever within the belly, it truly makes the breath rise up in such a way that the heart and breast are freed of all obstruction, coagulates the flesh and skin, makes the body light and produces a halo around it. When a whole dose has been taken, the cereal Worms die; when the Worms are dead the Corpses dry out; when they are dry, they drop down by themselves. This has to be done several times, not restricting oneself to a single dose. (tr. Maspero 1981: 336)\n\nThe (c. 400 CE) \"Taishang Lingbao wufuxu\" 太上靈寶五符序 \"Explanations of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans\" or \"Wufuxu\", compiled by the Lingbao School founder Ge Chaofu, describes various techniques for expelling the Three Corpses/Worms.\n\nThe \"Wufuxu\" uses both \"sanchong\" \"Three Worms\" and \"fushi\" \"Concealed Corpses\" as interchangeable names for the malevolent beings residing in the human body, interpreted as either the reconciliation of regional varieties of Chinese names or the conflation of common names with religious terms. Among the 11 \"Wufuxu\" recipes for expelling corpse-worms, 6 mention \"sanchong fushi\" 三蟲伏尸 integrating two previously separate names for similar ideas, which allows the text to address both readers familiar with the Three Worms concept as well as those who knew of the Concealed, or Three, Corpses (Campany 2005, 43). \"The Immortal's Method for Expelling the Three Worms and Concealed Corpses\" (tr. Arthur 2013: 80) explicates the worm/corpse synonymy: \"[T]he Concealed Corpses which live in people's abdomens limit the powers of medicines. [ ... ] This is all caused by the Three Worms. [ ... ] Simple commoners laugh at these things; therefore after people die they become 'Corpse' bones. This is the nickname of the Three Worms.\"\n\nAmong \"Wufuxu\" prescriptions for eliminating the Three Worms/Corpses, the primary anthelmintic herbs (Eskildsen 1998: 60, Arthur 2013: 87) are: \"shānglù\" 商陸 \"\"Phytolacca rivinoides\", pokeweed\" root, \"tiānméndōng\" 天門冬 \"\"Asparagus cochinchinensis\", asparagus\" root, \"huángjīng\" 黄精 \"\"Polygonatum sibiricum\", Solomon's seal\", and \"fúlíng\" 茯苓 \"\"Wolfiporia extensa\", China-root fungus\" (often misidentified as \"\"Smilax glabra\", sarsaparilla\"). Pokeweed—which the \"Wufuxu\" says is effective alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs—is poisonous for humans, with the highest toxicity in the roots, yet it has been used in folk medicine as a purgative, emetic, diuretic, and hunger suppressant. Pokeweed root, asparagus root, and Solomon's seal all contain chemical compounds called saponins, which are poisons that irritate the gastric mucosa and thus can dislodge any intestinal parasites (Arthur 2013: 87).\n\n\"The Immortal's Method for Expelling the Three Worms and Concealed Corpses\" (mentioned above) claims taking pokeweed root pills will make the Three Worms decompose and come out in the host's feces. The instructions say to mix pokeweed, China-root fungus, alcohol, wheat flour, and yeast, and to seal this in an earthenware jar for 20 days. Once fermented, the adept mixes this with boiled beans in order to make large pills the size of chicken egg yolks.\nDaily ingest three pills for thirty days in order to expel [the Three Worms] and to gain a few benefits. The Upper Deathbringer [takes] one hundred days. The Middle Deathbringer [takes] sixty days. The Lower Deathbringer [takes] thirty days. [As they leave,] rotten smells will emerge: the Upper Deathbringer will smell like animal hair, the Middle Deathbringer will smell like feet, and the Lower Deathbringer will smell like a [rotten] chicken egg. The Upper Deathbringer will be black, the Middle Deathbringer will be dark blue-green (\"qing\" 青), and the Lower Deathbringer will be white. (tr. Arthur 2013: 89) \nThe context (tr. Eskildsen 1998: 61) concludes that once the Three Worms are removed, the adept \"never again feels hungry nor thirsty, and his heart is calm and free of thoughts\".\n\nThe \"Taishang Lingbao wufuxu\" (tr. Arthur 2013: 78) cites Ge Hong that his great-uncle Ge Xuan transmitted a recipe containing Solomon's-seal, and said that \"all the various ways to cultivate long life must begin with expelling the Three Worms and flushing out the Concealed Corpses\".\n\nWhile most \"Wufuxu\" methods for expelling the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe attributed to the Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, \"Pluck peach leaves on the third day of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out.\" One anomalous \"Wufuxu\" method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. \"The Recipe of Master Redpine\" (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, \"When you cut the nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines.\" Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.\n\nThe (c. 445) \"Hou Hanshu\" \"Book of the Later Han\" (6-189 CE) mentions removing the Three Worms twice in the Biographies of \"Fangshi\" section (82B). The biography of the acupuncturist A Shan 阿善 says he lived to an age of over 100 years using the method of Hua Tuo 華佗, a famous physician who introduced surgical anesthesia, to remove the Three Worms. This prescription uses green leaves from a lacquer tree, which taken continuously will remove the Three Worms, benefit the internal organs, lighten the body, and prevent hair from turning white [言久服去三蟲利五藏輕體使人頭不白].\n\nThe biography of Fei Changfang 費長房 tells how he met the Daoist \"xian\" Xie Yuanyi 謝元一 who offered to teach him the Way.\n\nThe (c. 499) \"Zhen'gao\" 真誥 \"Declarations of the Perfected\" is a collection of Shangqing materials edited by Tao Hongjing (456-536) as part of the Shangqing canon, based upon the notes of Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-386) and his patrons Xu Mai 許邁 (300-348) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376).\n\n\"Nü xianren Liu Gang qi koujue\" 女仙人劉綱妻口訣 \"The Oral Lesson of the Female Immortal, the wife of Liu Gang\" explains how the Three Corpses in the bodies of men and women lust and mingle with each other, regardless of their conscious intentions. \nThose who seek immortality must not associate with women. On the ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month, [they] should remain in their rooms and make sure not to look at women. If the Six Corpses (the Three Corpses of the adept himself and of the woman that he looks at?) cause chaos, the blood in your viscera will be disturbed and aroused, your three \"hun\" souls will be unguarded. Your spirit will weaken and your \"qi\" will leave. All of these [factors] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why you avoid [women] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [also] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the \"shen\" and the male palaces are in the \"yin\". \"Yin\" and \"shen\" punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and women come out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the \"Niwan\" (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, you absolutely must not look them face to face. My predecessor and teacher became an Immortal by simply practicing this method. The [prescription] does not apply to [your] closest of relatives to whom you have no thoughts [of sexual attraction]. (tr. Eskildsen 1998: 76) \n\nThe (c. 9th century) \"Chu sanshi jiuchong baoshengjing\" 除三尸九蟲保生經 \"Scripture on Expelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to Protect Life\" contains illustrations and comprehensive discussions of the various corpse-worms, and gives methods for expelling them from the body. The text likely originated in the Sichuan region, and its original illustrations were attributed to a student of the famous Tang doctor Sun Simiao (581-682 CE) (Arthur 2013: 81).\n\nThe \"Baoshengjing\" gives the Chinese names of the death-hastening Three Corpse brothers, who share the Peng (surname) 彭 \"sound of a drum; strength\"—compare the God of Longevity named Peng Zu 彭祖.\nThis text's woodblock illustrations depict the Upper Corpse as a male scholar or corrupt court official, the Middle as a short quadruped resembling a Chinese guardian lion, and the Lower Corpse as \"a monster that looks like a horse's leg with a horned human head\" (tr. Maspero 1981: 333, Campany 2005: 43-44).\n\nThe text differentiates the mythological Three Corpses from the intestinal \"jiǔchóng\" 九蟲 \"Nine Worms\", which seem to be based on observations of harmful parasites such as roundworms or tapeworms (Cook 2008: 844). The text explains that the Nine Worms are the physical counterparts of and acting agents for the Three Corpses (Arthur 2013: 82). They are:\n\nThe \"Baoshengjing\" describes the \"sanhun\" 三魂 \"Three \"hun\"-souls\" in the human body and how to meditate on them. \nThe three spirit souls are located beneath the liver. They look like human beings and wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go wandering about. At this time, lie down with your feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart about the size of an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: \"Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\" (1, 7, tr. Kohn 2009: 168) \n\nThe text also describes countless \"weichong\" 微蟲 \"micro organic worms\", which resemble \"caizi\" 菜子 \"vegetable seeds\", residing on the surface of the body (Huang 2011: 40).\n\nThe (9th century) Quanzhen School text \"Zhonghuang jing\" 中皇經 \"Classic of the Yellow Center\" describes how an arduous \"bigu\" fasting regimen can result in weakness, loss of weight, yellowish complexion, and problems with the Three Worms.\nWhen the adept first begins to fast, the air he swallows does not penetrate sufficiently, and he is constantly subjected to the mischief of the Three Worms. This causes frequent moods of depression and anxiety. He also becomes easily tempted to indulge in sensual or culinary pleasures. He must therefore make a constant effort to resist and overcome these woes and temptations. Quoting a certain \"Taishang shengxuan jing\", the commentary explains that the fast is a process during which the Three Worms are successively exterminated; the Upper Worm dies after thirty days, the Middle Worm dies after sixty days, and the Lower Worm dies after ninety days. After 100 days, the adept's body becomes healthy and strong, and his mind becomes \"pure.\" He is no longer in danger of falling prey to his desires. When this stage is reached, the adept can see the \"Five Sprouts,\" or the \"qi\" of his five viscera, which also are described as the \"proper \"qi\" of the five agents.\" (Eskildsen 1998: 46) \n\nScholars are unclear as to when the Three Corpse-Worms concept was first developed, and the best estimates are during the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE).\n\nArthur (2013: 80) outlines the historical changes from the Three Worms as intestinal parasites to the Three Corpses as sin-reporting officials in the celestial bureaucracy. In one of the earliest discussions, the (1st century CE) \"Lunheng\" envisioned the Three Worms as actual parasites that gnaw through the human intestines in the way that leeches gnaw through the feet. Later 3rd and 4th century Daoist texts such as the \"Baopuzi\" renamed the Three Worms as the Three Corpses, developed ideas about religious characteristics of these parasites, and retooled them into \"supernatural beings with physical and ephemeral spirit components that are capable of exerting directed efforts to hasten the body's death.\"\n\nConverging evidence from textual records and parasite physiology support the hypothesis that the Three Worms/Corpses concept originated over 2000 years ago.\n\nToshiaki Yamada (1989: 107; cited by Campany 2005: 44 and Arthur 2013: 81) suggests that the Three Worms originated during the 1st-2nd century BCE early Han period. Both the \"Baopuzi\" and \"Wufuxu\" cite worm-expelling techniques from apocryphal Han texts associated with Chisongzi \"Master Redpine\" and Lezichang. These two semi-historical Daoist masters are frequently mentioned in connection with Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE), who wanted to become a Daoist immortal and employed numerous Taoist priests 道士 \"Daoist priest; fortune teller; diviner\" and \"fangshi\" 方士 \"alchemist; exorcist; doctor; magician\".\n\nSome scholars hypothesize that the Three Worms may have originated from the observation of parasites in human excrement. Campany (2002: 166) interprets the \"Hou Hanshu\" story about Master Xie Yuanyi telling Fei Changfang that he would never become a \"xian\"-immortal because he refused to eat \"terribly foul-smelling excrement full of the three worms\", figuratively denoting the prerequisite of expelling the Three Worms from his body. Arthur (2013: 79) observes that, \"Likely evidence for these worms was plentiful in people's feces, especially those of starving people, because many intestinal worms will evacuate the digestive system if they are not able to ingest enough sustenance. Otherwise, when intestinal parasites grow large, portions of them will break off and be evacuated with the feces, thus providing additional tangible evidence of their existence.\"\n\nThe Japanese folk tradition of Kōshin (namely, the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of \"gengshen\" 庚申 \"57th of the 60-day cycle\") combines the Daoist Three Corpses with Shintō and Buddhist beliefs, including the Three Wise Monkeys. People attend \"Kōshin-Machi\" 庚申待 \"57th Day Waiting\" events to stay awake all night and prevent the \"Sanshi\" 三尸 \"Three Corpses\" from leaving the body and reporting misdeeds to heaven.\n\n\n\n"}

Usually described as a lion-dragon demon, it has been somewhat speculatively identified with the four-legged, winged dragon of the late 3rd millennium BC.\n\nTiamat is said to have \"clothed the raging lion-dragons with fearsomeness\" in the Epic of Creation, Enuma Elish. The god Nabû was described as \"he who tramples the lion-dragon\" in the hymn to Nabû. The late neo-Assyrian text \"Myth of the Seven Sages\" recalls: \"The fourth (of the seven apkallu's, \"sages\", is) Lu-Nanna, (only) two-thirds Apkallu, who drove the \"ušumgallu\"-dragon from É-ninkarnunna, the temple of Ištar of Šulgi.\"\n\nAššur-nāṣir-apli II placed golden icons of ušumgallu at the pedestal of Ninurta.

Born and raised in Punjab, he was initiated as Sthanakvasi monk who later joined Murtipujaka tradition. He travelled extensively in Gujarat, Rajputana and Punjab; and organised and reformed Jain community, ascetic orders and literature. He wrote several books in Hindi and was invited to the first World Parliament of Religions in 1893 which was attended by Virchand Gandhi later.\n\nHe was born on 6 April 1837 CE (Chaitra Shukla 1 Vikram Samvat 1893) in Lehara, Punjab to Ganeshchandra and Rupdevi. He was born in a Brahmakshatriya Hindu family. His father was an army official of Ranjit Singh. His father died in his early childhood and he was raised by his mother. He was given to Sheth Jodhmal of Jira, Punjab for education in VS 1903. He studied Hindi and arithmetic. He came into contact with Sthanakvasi monks during his school life. A couple of influential Sthanakavasi monks initiated him in 1853 (VS 1910) at the age of sixteen and was given the name of Atmaram.\n\nAtmaram began the study of Jain scriptures along with his fellow ascetics. He was later joined by a \"Yati\" of Tapa Gaccha lineage. After several years of study, he was convinced that the Sthanakavasi position of opposition of Idol-worshiping contradicted the scriptures. Later in 1876 (VS 1943), he was initiated again as a Murtipujaka monk in Ahmedabad by Muni Buddhivijay, also known as Buterayji of Tapa Gaccha who himself was Sthanakvasi monk before. He was given a new name, Anandvijay.\n\nIn 1886, he was conferred the title of Acharya by the congregation of Palitana during his Chaturmas (four months stay during rainy season) there. This was a notable event because since four centuries, there wasn't an ascetic who was conferred with the title of Acharya. He was the first Acharya of contemporary Jain history as till then only \"Yati\"s were conferred with the title. As a result of reforms advocated by him, the influence of yatis declined, although the yatis still survive in some locations.\n\nHe travelled extensively in Gujarat and Punjab. He convinced to open Jain Bhandaras (libraries) with Jain literature kept closed for people since years and had texts copied and examined by scholars. He brought these literature to light and instilled sense of identity among Jains. In 1893, he was invited to participate in the first ever World Parliament of Religions at Chicago and since Jain monks do not travel overseas he sent Virchand Gandhi to United States to participate in the World Parliament of Religions. He won silver medal in 1893 at Chicago and was covered by many USA periodicals. Based on questions that he had received from the organizers of the Parliament, he wrote a book for the occasion entitled \"The Chicago-Prashnottar\" or \"Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893\". He was instrumental in reviving the tradition of fully initiated monks (\"Samvegi sadhu\"). He also convinced many Sthankvasis in the Punjab to join the Murtipujaka tradition. About 15000 people converted to Jainism due to his efforts. He also encouraged the construction and renovation of Jain temples. He had helped orientalist Rudolf Hoernlé in his studies on Jainism.\n\nHe died in Gujranwala (now in Pakistan) on 20 May 1896 (Jayeshtha Shukla 13 VS 1953). A memorial shrine dedicated to him was built there, which is now used as a police station of Sabzi Mandi area. His footprints along with the \"chhatri\" (cenotaph) over them, are moved to Lahore Fort Museum.\n\nHe wrote a number of books in Hindi, including \"The Chicago-Prashnottar\" or \"Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893\" which was translated into English and published in 1918. His other important works are \"Jain Tattvadarsh\", \"Agyana Timira Bhaskara\", \"Samyaktva-shalyadwara\" and \"Tattva Nirnaya Prāsād\".\n\nHe used to give more importance to education and established several libraries and \"Pathshala\" (religious schools) in Punjab. Later Vallabhsuri, his disciple, built many schools, hospitals and educational institutes. He was given the title of \"Navyug Nirmata\" (builder of a new era) by Vallabhsuri.\n\nHis monkhood lineage has large number of ascetics which roughly covers of all current ascetics of Tapa Gaccha. Major ascetic groupings are Atma-Vallabh Samuday, Prem-Ramchandra Suri and Prem-Bhuvanbhanu Suri Samuday.\n\n\n \n"}

He and his brother Zhao Yingdou, also a mandarin, held important government posts in the 1660s.\n\nProficient in both Hebrew and Chinese, Zhao, from the province of Henan, obtained the \"jinshi\" degree in 1646. He was named director of the Ministry of Justice. Four years later he was sent to Fujian and Huguang as an official. He was remembered as an efficient administrator and excellent Confucian scholar who exterminated local bandits and founded schools.\n\nIn 1642, near the end of the Ming Dynasty, Kaifeng was flooded by the Ming army with water from the Yellow River to prevent the peasant rebel Li Zicheng from taking over. After this disaster, the city was abandoned. The synagogue of the Kaifeng Jewish community (reportedly dating from 1163) was destroyed, and the Jews took refuge on the north side of the Yellow River. They took with them the Torah scrolls, which had been saved after having been thrown into the river, though they had grown moldy and illegible.\n\nTen years later, Zhao was detailed to restore the city. With the aid of his brother, Zhao Yingdou (赵映斗), he induced the Jews to recross the river and take up their old quarters. The temple was rebuilt in 1653, with the personal financial support of Zhao, who had grown rich from land speculation and prostitution. One complete scroll of the Law was made up out of the fragments which had been saved from the river, and other copies were made from this. A stone stele dated 1663 was afterward erected, giving the details of Zhao Yingcheng's action.\n\nZhao wrote an account of the saving of the scrolls and the rebuilding of the temple, \"Record of the Vicissitudes of the Holy Scriptures\". His brother wrote \"Preface to the Illustrious Way\", believed to be an exposition of the tenets of Judaism. Both works are now lost, although in recent years Chinese scholars have begun a search for them in the libraries of Kaifeng, Beijing, and elsewhere.\n\nAll known descendants of Zhao are recorded to have perished from dysentery by the 17th century.\n\n\n\n"}
