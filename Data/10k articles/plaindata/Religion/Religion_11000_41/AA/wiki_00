{"id": "13904202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13904202", "title": "Anahita", "text": "Anahita\n\nAnahita is the Old Persian form of the name of an Iranian goddess and appears in complete and earlier form as ('), the Avestan name of an Indo-Iranian cosmological figure venerated as the divinity of \"the Waters\" (Aban) and hence associated with fertility, healing and wisdom. Aredvi Sura Anahita is \"Ardwisur Anahid\" or Nahid\"' in Middle and Modern Persian, and \"Anahit\" in Armenian. An iconic shrine cult of Aredvi Sura Anahita was – together with other shrine cults – \"introduced apparently in the 4th century BCE and lasted until it was suppressed in the wake of an iconoclastic movement under the Sassanids.\"\n\nThe Greek and Roman historians of classical antiquity refer to her either as Anaïtis or identified her with one of the divinities from their own pantheons. 270 Anahita, a silicaceous S-type asteroid, is named after her. Based on the development of her cult, she was described as a syncretistic goddess, which was composed of two independent elements. The first is a manifestation of the Indo-Iranian idea of the Heavenly River who provides the waters to the rivers and streams flowing in the earth while the second is that of a goddess with an uncertain origin, though maintaining her own unique characteristics, became associated with the cult of the ancient Mesopotamian goddess Inanna-Ishtar. According to a theory, this is attributed partly to a desire to make Anahita part of Zoroastrianism after diffusing from the extreme northwest to the rest of Persia.\n\nOnly \"\" (a word otherwise unknown, perhaps with an original meaning \"moist\") is specific to the divinity.\nThe words ' and ' are generic Avestan language adjectives, and respectively mean \"mighty\" and \"pure\". Both adjectives also appear as epithets of other divinities or divine concepts such as and the Fravashis. Both adjectives are also attested in Vedic Sanskrit.\n\nAs a divinity of the waters ('), the yazata is of Indo-Iranian origin, according to Lommel related to Sanskrit \"\" that, like its Proto-Iranian equivalent ', derives from Indo-Iranian '. In its old Iranian form ', \"her name was given to the region, rich in rivers, whose modern capital is Delhi (Avestan ', Old Persian ', Greek \"\").\" \"Like the Devi Saraswati, [Aredvi Sura Anahita] nurtures crops and herds; and is hailed both as a divinity and the mythical river that she personifies, 'as great in bigness as all these waters which flow forth upon the earth'.\" Some historians note that that despite Anahita's Aryan roots and the way she represented the commonly shared concept of the Heavenly River, which in the Vedas was represented by the goddess \"\" (the later heavenly Ganga), she had no counterpart in the ancient text who bear the same name or one that remotely resembled hers.\n\nIn the (Middle-)Persian texts of the Sassanid and later eras, appears as \"\". The evidence suggests a western Iranian origin of \"Anāhīta\". (see borrowing from Babylonia, below).\n\nAnahita also shares characteristics with Mat Zemlya (Damp Mother Earth) in Slavic mythology.\n\nAt some point prior to the 4th century BCE, this yazata was conflated with (an analogue of) Semitic , likewise a divinity of \"maiden\" fertility and from whom Aredvi Sura Anahita then inherited additional features of a divinity of war and of the planet Venus or \"Zohreh\" in Arabic. It was moreover the association with the planet Venus, \"it seems, which led Herodotus to record that the <nowiki>[</nowiki>Persis<nowiki>]</nowiki> learnt 'to sacrifice to \"the heavenly goddess\"' from the Assyrians and Arabians.\" There are sources who based their theory on this aspect. For instance, it was proposed that the ancient Persians worshiped the planet Venus as *\"Anahiti\", the \"pure one\", and that, as these people settled in Eastern Iran, *\"Anahiti\" began to absorb elements of the cult of Ishtar. Indeed, according to Boyce, it is \"probable\" that there was once a Perso–Elamite divinity by the name of ' (as reconstructed from the Greek '). It is then likely (so Boyce) that it was this divinity that was an analogue of Ishtar, and that it is this divinity with which Aredvi Sura Anahita was conflated.\n\nThe link between Anahita and Ishtar is part of the wider theory that Iranian kingship had Mesopotamian roots and that the Persian gods were natural extensions of the Babylonian deities, where Ahuramazda is considered an aspect of Marduk, Mithra for Shamash, and, finally, Anahita was Ishtar. This is supported by how Ishtar \"apparently\" gave Aredvi Sura Anahita the epithet \"Banu\", 'the Lady', a typically Mesopotamian construct that is not attested as an epithet for a divinity in Iran before the common era. It is completely unknown in the texts of the Avesta, but evident in Sassanid-era middle Persian inscriptions (see the cult, below) and in a middle Persian \"Zend\" translation of \"Yasna\" 68.13. Also in Zoroastrian texts from the post-conquest epoch (651 CE onwards), the divinity is referred to as 'Anahid the Lady', 'Ardwisur the Lady' and 'Ardwisur the Lady of the waters'.\n\nBecause the divinity is unattested in any old Western Iranian language, establishing characteristics prior to the introduction of Zoroastrianism in Western Iran (\"c.\" 5th century BCE) is very much in the realm of speculation. Boyce concludes that \"the Achaemenids' devotion to this goddess evidently survived their conversion to Zoroastrianism, and they appear to have used royal influence to have her adopted into the Zoroastrian pantheon.\" According to an alternate theory, Anahita was perhaps \"a \"daeva\" of the early and pure Zoroastrian faith, incorporated into the Zoroastrian religion and its revised canon\" during the reign of \"Artaxerxes I, the Constantine of that faith.\"\n\nThe cosmological qualities of the world river are alluded to in \"Yasht\" 5 (see in the Avesta, below), but properly developed only in the \"Bundahishn\", a Zoroastrian account of creation finished in the 11th or 12th century CE. In both texts, Aredvi Sura Anahita is not only a divinity, but also the source of the world river and the (name of the) world river itself. The cosmological legend runs as follows:\n\nAll the waters of the world created by Ahura Mazda originate from the source Aredvi Sura Anahita, the life-increasing, herd-increasing, fold-increasing, who makes prosperity for all countries. This source is at the top of the world mountain Hara Berezaiti, \"High Hara\", around which the sky revolves and that is at the center of Airyanem Vaejah, the first of the lands created by Mazda.\n\nThe water, warm and clear, flows through a hundred thousand golden channels towards Mount Hugar, \"the Lofty\", one of the daughter-peaks of Hara Berezaiti. On the summit of that mountain is Lake Urvis, \"the Turmoil\", into which the waters flow, becoming quite purified and exiting through another golden channel. Through that channel, which is at the height of a thousand men, one portion of the great spring Aredvi Sura Anahita drizzles in moisture upon the whole earth, where it dispels the dryness of the air and all the creatures of Mazda acquire health from it. Another portion runs down to Vourukasha, the great sea upon which the earth rests, and from which it flows to the seas and oceans of the world and purifies them.\n\nIn the Bundahishn, the two halves of the name \"Ardwisur Anahid\" are occasionally treated independently of one another, that is, with Ardwisur as the representative of waters, and Anahid identified with the planet Venus: The water of the all lakes and seas have their origin with Ardwisur (10.2, 10.5), and in contrast, in a section dealing with the creation of the stars and planets (5.4), the \"Bundahishn\" speaks of 'Anahid i Abaxtari', that is, the planet Venus. In yet other chapters, the text equates the two, as in \"Ardwisur who is Anahid, the father and mother of the Waters\" (3.17).\n\nThis legend of the river that descends from Mount Hara appears to have remained a part of living observance for many generations. A Greek inscription from Roman times found in Asia Minor reads \"the great goddess Anaïtis of high Hara\". On Greek coins of the imperial epoch, she is spoken of as \"Anaïtis of the sacred water.\"\n\nAredvi Sura Anahita is principally addressed in \"Yasht\" 5 (\"Yasna\" 65), also known as the Aban \"Yasht\", a hymn to the waters in Avestan and one of the longer and better preserved of the devotional hymns. \"Yasna\" 65 is the third of the hymns recited at the Ab-Zohr, the \"offering to the waters\" that accompanies the culminating rites of the Yasna service. Verses from \"Yasht\" 5 also form the greater part of the \"Aban Nyashes\", the liturgy to the waters that are a part of the \"Khordeh Avesta\".\n\nAccording to Nyberg and supported by Lommel and Widengren, the older portions of the \"Aban Yasht\" were originally composed at a very early date, perhaps not long after the Gathas themselves. \"Yasna\" 38, which is dedicated \"to the earth and the sacred waters\" and is part of seven-chapter \"Yasna Haptanghāiti\", is linguistically as old as the Gathas.\n\nIn the \"Aban Yasht\", the river \"yazata\" is described as \"the great spring Ardvi Sura Anahita is the life-increasing, the herd-increasing, the fold-increasing who makes prosperity for all countries\" (5.1). She is \"wide flowing and healing\", \"efficacious against the \"daeva\"s\", \"devoted to Ahura's lore\" (5.1). She is associated with fertility, purifying the seed of men (5.1), purifying the wombs of women (5.1), encouraging the flow of milk for newborns (5.2). As a river divinity, she is responsible for the fertility of the soil and for the growth of crops that nurture both man and beast (5.3). She is a beautiful, strong maiden, wearing beaver skins (5.3,7,20,129).\n\nThe association between water and wisdom that is common to many ancient cultures is also evident in the Aban \"Yasht\", for here Aredvi Sura is the divinity to whom priests and pupils should pray for insight and knowledge (5.86). In verse 5.120 she is seen to ride a chariot drawn by four horses named \"wind\", \"rain\", \"clouds\" and \"sleet\". In newer passages she is described as standing in \"statuesque stillness\", \"ever observed\", royally attired with a golden embroidered robe, wearing a golden crown, necklace and earrings, golden breast-ornament, and gold-laced ankle-boots (5.123, 5.126-8). Aredvi Sura Anahita is bountiful to those who please her, stern to those who do not, and she resides in 'stately places' (5.101).\n\nThe concept of Aredvi Sura Anahita is to a degree blurred with that of Ashi, the Gathic figure of Good Fortune, and many of the verses of the \"Aban Yasht\" also appear in \"Yasht\" 17 (\"Ard Yasht\"), which is dedicated to Ashi. So also a description of the weapons bestowed upon worshippers (5.130), and the superiority in battle (5.34 et al.). These functions appears out of place in a hymn to the waters, and may have originally been from \"Yasht\" 17.\n\nOther verses in \"Yasht\" 5 have masculine instead of feminine pronouns, and thus again appear to be verses that were originally dedicated to other divinities. Boyce also suggests that the new compound divinity of waters with martial characteristics gradually usurped the position of Apam Napat, the great warlike water divinity of the Ahuric triad, finally causing the latter's place to be lost and his veneration to become limited to the obligatory verses recited at the \"Ab-Zohr\".\n\nThere are also parts in the Yasht that show discrepancies in the description of Anahita. There was the case, for instance, of her beaver coat, which was described to an audience for whom the Yasht was redacted. It was clear that these do not know the animal given the fact that the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) were found in the Caucasus but did not range south of the Caspian Sea nor the rivers and lakes of the Aral-Caspian steppe.\n\nThe earliest dateable and unambiguous reference to the iconic cult of Anahita is from the Babylonian scholar-priest Berosus, who – although writing over 70 years after the reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon – records that the emperor had been the first to make cult statues of Aphrodite Anaitis and place them in the temples of many of the empire's major cities, including Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Bactria, Persepolis, Damascus and Sardis. Also according to Berosus, the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. This is substantiated by Herodotus, whose mid-5th-century-BCE general remarks on the usages of the Perses, Herodotus notes that \"it is not their custom to make and set up statues and images and altars, and those that make such they deem foolish, as I suppose, because they never believed the gods, as do the Greeks, to be the likeness of men.\" As the cult was institutionalized, it began to spread widely, reaching beyond the borders of Persia taking root in Armenia and Asia Minor.\n\nThe extraordinary innovation of the shrine cults can thus be dated to the late 5th century BCE (or very early 4th century BCE), even if this evidence is \"not of the most satisfactory kind.\" Nonetheless, by 330 BCE and under Achaemenid royal patronage, these cults had been disseminated throughout Asia Minor and the Levant, and from there to Armenia. The temples also served as an important source of income. From the Babylonian kings, the Achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income. A share of this income called the \"quppu ša šarri\" or \"kings chest\" – an ingenious institution originally introduced by Nabonidus – was then turned over to the ruler.\n\nNonetheless, Artaxerxes' close connection with the Anahita temples is \"almost certainly the chief cause of this king's long-lasting fame among Zoroastrians, a fame which made it useful propaganda for the succeeding Arsacids to claim him (quite spuriously) for their ancestor.\"\n\nArtaxerxes II's devotion to Anahita is most apparent in his inscriptions, where her name appears directly after that of Ahura Mazda and before that of Mithra. Artaxerxes' inscription at Susa reads: \"By the will of Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra I built this palace. May Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra protect me from all evil\" (A²Hc 15–10). This is a remarkable break with tradition; no Achaemenid king before him had invoked any but Ahura Mazda alone by name although the Behistun inscription of Darius invokes Ahuramazda and \"The other gods who are\".\n\nThe temple(s) of Anahita at Ecbatana (Hamadan) in Media must have once been the most glorious sanctuaries in the known world. Although the palace had been stripped by Alexander and the following Seleucid kings, when Antiochus III raided Ecbatana in 209 BCE, the temple \"had the columns round it still gilded and a number of silver tiles were piled up in it, while a few gold bricks and a considerable quantity of silver ones remained.\" \n\nPolybius' reference to Alexander is supported by Arrian, who in 324 BCE wrote of a temple in Ecbatana dedicated to \"Asclepius\" (by inference presumed to be Anahita, likewise a divinity of healing), destroyed by Alexander because she had allowed his friend Hephaestion to die. The massive stone lion on the hill there (said to be part of a sepulcral monument to Hephaestion) is today a symbol that visitors touch in hope of fertility.\n\nPlutarch records that Artaxerxes II had his concubine Aspasia consecrated as priestess at the temple \"to Diana of Ecbatana, whom they name Anaitis, that she might spend the remainder of her days in strict chastity.\" This does not however necessarily imply that chastity was a requirement of Anaitis priestesses. \n\nIsidore of Charax, in addition to a reference to the temple at Ecbatana (\"a temple, sacred to Anaitis, they sacrifice there always\") also notes a \"temple of Artemis\" at Concobar (Lower Media, today Kangavar). Despite archaeological findings that refute a connection with Anahita, remains of a 2nd-century BCE Hellenic-style edifice at Kangavar continue to be a popular tourist attraction.\n\nIsidore also records another \"royal place, a temple of Artemis, founded by Darius\" at Basileia (Apadana), on the royal highway along the left bank of the Euphrates.\nDuring the Hellenistic Parthian period, Susa had its \"Dianae templum augustissimum\" far from Elymais where another temple, known to Strabo as the \"Ta Azara\", was dedicated to Athena/Artemis and where tame lions roamed the grounds. This may be a reference to the temple above the Tang-a Sarvak ravine in present-day Khuzestan Province. Other than this, no evidence of the cult in Western Iran from the Parthian period survives, but \"it is reasonable to assume that the martial features of Anāhita (Ishtar) assured her popularity in the subsequent centuries among the warrior classes of Parthian feudalism.\"\n\nIn the 2nd century CE, the center of the cult in Parsa (Persia proper) was at Staxr (Istakhr). There, Anahita continued to be venerated in her martial role and it was at Istakhr that Sassan, after whom the Sassanid dynasty is named, served as high priest. Sassan's son, Papak, likewise a priest of that temple, overthrew the King of Istakhr (a vassal of the Arsacids), and had himself crowned in his stead. \"By this time (the beginning of the 3rd century), Anāhita's headgear (\"kolāh\") was worn as a mark of nobility\", which in turn \"suggests that she was goddess of the feudal warrior estate.\" Ardashir (\"r.\" 226-241 CE) \"would send the heads of the petty kings he defeated for display at her temple.\"\nDuring the reign of Bahram I (\"r.\" 272-273 CE), in the wake of an iconoclastic movement that had begun at about the same time as the shrine cult movement, the sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity were - by law - disassociated from that divinity by removal of the statuary and then either abandoned or converted into fire altars. So also the popular shrines to Mehr/Mithra which retained the name \"Darb-e Mehr\" - Mithra's Gate - that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple. The temple at Istakhr was likewise converted and, according to the Kartir inscription, henceforth known as the \"Fire of Anahid the Lady.\" Sassanid iconoclasm, though administratively from the reign of Bahram I, may already have been supported by Bahram's father, Shapur I (\"r.\" 241-272 CE). In an inscription in Middle Persian, Parthian and Greek at Ka'ba of Zoroaster, the \"Mazdean lord, ..., king of kings, ..., grandson of lord Papak\" (ShKZ 1, Naqsh-e Rustam) records that he instituted fires for his daughter and three of his sons. His daughter's name: Anahid. The name of that fire: Adur-Anahid.\nNotwithstanding the dissolution of the temple cults, the triad Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra (as Artaxerxes II had invoked them) would continue to be prominent throughout the Sassanid age, \"and were indeed (with Tiri and Verethragna) to remain the most popular of all divine beings in Western Iran.\" Moreover, the iconoclasm of Bahram I and later kings apparently did not extend to images where they themselves are represented. At an investiture scene at Naqsh-e Rustam, Narseh (\"r.\" 293-302 CE) is seen receiving his crown from a female divinity identified as Anahita. Narseh, like Artaxerxes II, was apparently also very devoted to Anahita, for in the investure inscription at Paikuli (near Khaniqin, in present-day Iraq), Narseh invokes \"Ormuzd and all the yazatas, and Anahid who is called the Lady.\"\n\nAnahita has also been identified as a figure in the investiture scene of Khusrow Parvez (\"r.\" 590-628 CE) at Taq-e Bostan, but in this case not quite as convincingly as for the one of Narseh. But, aside from the two rock carvings at Naqsh-e Rustam and Taq-e Bostan, \"few figures unquestionably representing the goddess are known.\" The figure of a female on an Achaemenid cylinder seal has been identified as that of Anahita, as have a few reliefs from the Parthian era (250 BCE-226 CE), two of which are from ossuaries.\n\nIn addition, Sassanid silverware depictions of nude or scantily dressed women seen holding a flower or fruit or bird or child are identified as images of Anahita. Additionally, \"it has been suggested that the colonnaded or serrated crowns [depicted] on Sasanian coins belong to Anahid.\"\n\nThe cult flourished in Lydia even as late as end of the Hellenistic Parthian epoch. The Lydians had temples to the divinity at Sardis, Philadelphia, Hieroaesarea, Hypaipa (where she was still revered as Artemis Anaitis or Persian Artemis in Classical and Roman times), Maeonia and elsewhere; the temple at Hieroaesarea reportedly having been founded by \"Cyrus\" (presumably Cyrus the Younger, brother of Artaxerxes II, who was satrap of Lydia between 407 and 401 BCE).\n\nIn the 2nd century CE, the geographer Pausanias reports having personally witnessed (apparently Mazdean) ceremonies at Hypaipa and Hierocaesarea. According to Strabo, Anahita was revered together with Omanos at Zela in Pontus. At Castabala, she is referred to as 'Artemis Perasia'. Anahita and Omanos had common altars in Cappadocia.\n\n\"Hellenic influence [gave] a new impetus to the cult of images [and] positive evidence for this comes from Armenia, then a Zoroastrian land.\"\nAccording to Strabo, the \"Armenians shared in the religion of the Perses and the Medes and particularly honored Anaitis\". The kings of Armenia were \"steadfast supporters of the cult\" and Tiridates III, before his conversion to Christianity, \"prayed officially to the triad Aramazd-Anahit-Vahagn but is said to have shown a special devotion to 'the great lady Anahit, ... the benefactress of the whole human race, mother of all knowledge, daughter of the great Aramazd'\" According to Agathangelos, tradition required the Kings of Armenia to travel once a year to the temple at Eriza (Erez) in Acilisene in order to celebrate the festival of the divinity; Tiridates made this journey in the first year of his reign where he offered sacrifice and wreaths and boughs. The temple at Eriza appears to have been particularly famous, \"the wealthiest and most venerable in Armenia\", staffed with priests and priestesses, the latter from eminent families who would serve at the temple before marrying. This practice may again reveal Semitic syncretic influences, and is not otherwise attested in other areas. Pliny reports that Mark Antony's soldiers smashed an enormous statue of the divinity made of solid gold and then divided the pieces amongst themselves. Also according to Pliny, supported by Dio Cassius, Acilisene eventually came to be known as Anaetica. Dio Cassius also mentions that another region along the Cyrus River, on the borders of Albania and Iberia, was also called \"the land of Anaitis.\"\n\nAnahit was also venerated at Artashat (Artaxata), the capital of the Armenian Kingdom, where her temple was close to that of Tiur, the divinity of oracles. At Astishat, center of the cult of Vahagn, she was revered as \"voskimayr\", the 'golden mother'. In 69 BCE, the soldiers of Lucullus saw cows consecrated to 'Persian Artemis' roaming freely at Tomisa in Sophene (on the Euphrates in South-West Armenia), where the animals bore the brand of a torch on their heads. Following Tiridates' conversion to Christianity, the cult of Anahit was condemned and iconic representations of the divinity were destroyed.\nAttempts have been made to identify Anahita as one of the prime three divinities in Albania, but these are questionable. However, in the territories of the Moschi in Colchis, Strabo mentions a cult of Leucothea, which Wesendonck and others have identified as an analogue of Anahita. The cult of Anahita may have also influenced Ainina and Danina, a paired deities of the Caucasian Iberians mentioned by the medieval Georgian chronicles.\n\nAs a divinity Aredvi Sura Anahita is of enormous significance to the Zoroastrian religion, for as a representative of Aban (\"the waters\"), she is in effect the divinity towards whom the \"Yasna\" service – the primary act of worship – is directed. (see Ab-Zohr). \"To this day reverence for water is deeply ingrained in Zoroastrians, and in orthodox communities offerings are regularly made to the household well or nearby stream.\"\n\nIt is \"very probable\" that the shrine of Bibi Shahrbanu at royal Ray (Rhagae, central Media) was once dedicated to Anahita. Similarly, one of the \"most beloved mountain shrines of the Zoroastrians of Yazd, set beside a living spring and a great confluence of water-courses, is devoted to Banu-Pars, \"the Lady of Persia\".\"\n\nHowever, and notwithstanding the widespread popularity of Anahita, \"it is doubtful whether the current tendency is justified whereby almost every isolated figure in Sassanid art, whether sitting, standing, dancing, clothed, or semi-naked, is hailed as her representation.\"\n\nThe Armenian cult of Anahit, as well as the pre-Christian Armenian religion in general, was very closely connected to Persian Zoroastrianism, but it also had significant distinct features deriving from local pagan traditions as well as from non-Zoroastrian foreign cults. In present-day Armenia, it is remembered as part of the historical mythological heritage of the nation, and the name Anahid is a popular female given name. In 1997, the Central Bank of Armenia issued a commemorative gold coin with an image of the divinity Anahit on the obverse.\n\nIn James Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\" the story is told of Donald McQueen who believed a building near to Dunvegan Castle to be the ruins of a temple to Anahita. Samuel Johnson rubbished the theory, which was based purely on phonological similarities of names.\n\n\n\n"}

The Roman Emperor Alexander Severus was born there. It is significant for the Tell Arqa, an archaeological site that goes back to Neolithic times, and during the Crusades there was a strategically significant castle.\n\nIt is mentioned in Antiquity in the Amarna letters of Egypt-(as \"Irqata\"), as well as in Assyrian documents.\n\nThe Roman town was named Caesarea (of Lebanon/Phoenicia) or Arca Caesarea.\n\nArqa has the distinction of being a city-state that wrote one of the 382 Amarna letters to the Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe city-state Irqata was the 3rd city of the Rib-Hadda letters, (68 letters), that were the last hold-outs against the (H)Apiru invasion.

When the Romans gained control over this part of western Asia, they entrusted Arca as a client tetrarchy or vassal principality to a certain Sohaimos, who died in AD 48 or 49. It was then incorporated in the Roman province of Syria, but was soon entrusted to Herod Agrippa II. Pliny the Elder counts it among the tetrarchies of Syria. It was at this time that its name was changed to Caesarea, distinguished from other cities of that name by being called Caesarea ad Libanum or Arca Caesarea. Under Septimius Severus (193–211) it was made part of the province of Syria Phoenicia and so became known as Arca in Phoenicia. Under his son Caracalla (198–217) it became a \"colonia\" and in 208 Alexander Severus was born at Arca during a stay of his parents there.\n\nAt the time of the First Crusade, Arca became an important strategic point of control over the roads from Tripoli to Tartus and Homs. Raymond of Toulouse unsuccessfully besieged it for three months in 1099. In 1108, his nephew William II Jordan conquered it and it became part of the County of Tripoli. It resisted an attack by Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo in 1167 and another in 1171.\nIt finally fell to Muslim forces of the Sultan Baibars in 1265 or 1266. When Tripoli itself fell in 1289 to the army of Sultan Qalawun and was razed to the ground, Arca lost its strategic importance and thereafter is mentioned only in ecclesiastical chronicles.\n\nArca in Phoenicia became the seat of a Christian bishop in the Roman province of Phoenicia Prima, a suffragan of the capital's metropolitan see of Tyre.\nOf its bishops, Lucianus professed the faith of the First Council of Nicaea at a synod held in Antioch in 363, Alexander was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Reverentius became archibishop of Tyre, Marcellinus was a participant at the Council of Ephesus in 431, Epiphanius took part in a synod at Antioch in 448, and Heraclitus participated in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Phoenicia sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian to protest about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria.\n\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Arca in Phoenicia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see, in two traditions: Latin and Maronite (Eastern Catholic, Antiochian Rite in Syriac).\n\nThe nominally restored diocese has had non-consecutive titular bishops as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric since the 18th century.\n\nIt is vacant, having had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank :\n\nEstablished as Titular Episcopal See of Arca (Arca dei Maroniti in Curiate Italian); promoted in 1933 as Titular Archiepiscopal See of Arca in Armenia, in 1941 suppressed, but restored in 1950 as Titular Episcopal See of Arca in Phoenicia.\n\nIt has had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank :\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4560387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4560387", "title": "Baal Cycle", "text": "Baal Cycle\n\nThe Baal Cycle is a Ugaritic cycle of stories about the Canaanite god Baʿal ( \"Owner\", \"Lord\"), a storm god associated with fertility. It is one of the Ugarit texts.\n\nThe text identifies Baal as the god Hadad, the Northwest Semitic form of Adad. The stories are written in Ugaritic, a Northwest Semitic language written in a cuneiform consonantal alphabet, on a series of clay tablets found in the 1920s in the Tell of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), situated on the Mediterranean coast of northern Syria, a few kilometers north of the modern city of Latakia, far ahead of the now known coast. The stories include \"The Myth of Baʿal Aliyan\" and \"The Death of Baʿal\".\n\nThe Baʿal Cycle series of stories are summarized thus:\nThe beginning of the story of the battle between Baʿal and Yam is lost, but we first hear of Kothar-wa-Khasis, the craftsman of the gods being summoned to El, who resides at the confluence of the rivers and the two oceans. El tells him to build a palace for Yam, and to do so quickly in case Yam should take hostile action. When Athtar hears of this, she takes a torch down, the purpose of which is not known due to the damaged text, but she is confronted by Shapash, who tells her that El is to bestow royal power on Yam, and so opposition is useless. Athtar then complains that he has no place or court, and that he now fears defeat at the hands of Yam. Shapash suggests the reason to be that he has no wife, perhaps meaning he is too young. The text following is lost and resumes with El sitting in his banquet hall. Here he is addressed by the other deities, who complain that Yam is being put to shame, though the damaged text makes the reason unclear, though it is clear the reason is connected to his palace. The gods threaten that unless this situation is resolved they will wreak destruction. El gives them curdled milk, apparently a mark of esteem. El calls that his son's name hitherto has been Yaw, a personal name. El then proclaims that his name should be 'darling of El'. However, he informs Yam that he would have to drive his rival Baʿal from his throne and the seat of his dominion. Following this there is a banquet. When the story resumes, Kothar-wa-Khasis has arrived under the sea and tells Yam that he has risen presumptuously to his position, and that Baʿal cannot stand idly by. He threatens that Yam will be destroyed by a magic weapon. Yam then sends word to El, on the mount of Lel, El's abode, demanding the surrender of Baʿal and his henchmen. However, Baʿal, upon hearing this on the mount of Lel attacks the envoys, though Anat and Athtart hold him back. When the story resumes, Baʿal has already started to battle Yam, but is in despair due to the power of Yam, and the fierce sea-creatures. Kothar-wa-Khasis assures Baʿal that he will be victorious and will win a kingdom without end, and fetches two divine clubs for Baʿal's use. He gives them magic names, and strikes Yam the first two times himself. Baʿal then drags out Yam and finishes him off. Then Athtart tells Baʿal to scatter his rival, which he does, and then he cries out that Yam is dead, and that he shall be King.\nA description of the palace of Baʿal follows. It begins with a description of a banquet thrown in honour of Baʿal on Mount Zephon (modern-day Jebel Aqra). When the text resumes, we see Anat closing the door of her mansion and meeting her servants in a valley where there are two cities, which possibly represent Ugarit and its port. She kills the guards and warriors, and then drives away the townspeople. She then slaughters the guards and warriors in her palace, ending with a peace-offering. When the text resumes again, Baʿal is addressing his messengers, picturing his sister Anat sitting with her lyre and singing of her affection for him and his daughters. The messengers are told to perform a specific rite, and she will give them an important communication for Baʿal, the secret of the lightning. Together, Anat and Baʿal will search for the secret on the hill of Zephon. She replies that she would only perform the rite if Baʿal should set his thunderbolt in the sky and flash his lightning. She then joins Baʿal at Zephon.\n\nWhen the text resumes Baʿal complains to Anat that he hasn't a house, nor a court like other gods, meaning that he has to live in the dwelling of his father El and Athirat. Anat thus makes a threat against El, threatening to make his grey hair run with blood unless he allows Baʿal to have a palace. The earthquakes at her feet cause El to be exposed from his chamber. Though the text following is lost, it is clear this attempt was unsuccessful, so Baʿal dispatches Qodesh-wa-Amrur, the attendant of Athirat, to deliver a message to Kothar-wa-Khasis, whose home is in Egypt. When the text continues, Qodesh-wa-Amrur delivers Baʿal's message, which is that Kothar-wa-Khasis should fashion gifts for Athirat, presumably so she will support Baʿal's bid for a palace. He enters his forge, and produces magnificent pieces of furniture, a pair of sandals, and a decorated table and bowl.\n\nWhen the text continues we see Athirat performing her woman's work by the seashore, when she then sees Baʿal and Anat approaching. She wonders whether he has come to kill all her sons and kinsfolk, perhaps a reference to the Hittite myth of Elkunirsa where the storm-god boasts of having killed the many sons of Athirat. However, her anger subsides when she sees the gifts, and so supports Baʿal in his bid, and she calls upon Qodesh-wa-Amrur to cast a net into the sea so she may have provisions to entertain the guests with. He does so, and when the text continues we see Anat encouraging Baʿal as they come closer to Athirat, reminding that he will have an eternal kingdom. However, Baʿal is still anxious. They persuade Athirat of their case.\n\nShe proceeds to El's abode, and makes her case. Reluctantly, he gives his assent for a house to be built for Baʿal. Baʿal is then instructed to collect cedar-wood, bricks and precious metals in order to build his house. Kothar-wa-Khasis builds him a palace, but Baʿal insists that it is built without windows, in case that his daughters may escape, or that Yam may come again and trouble him. The work is completed and Baʿal rejoices. When the text resumes, Baʿal recalls his triumph over Yam, and then marches out taking many cities his own. He then consents to having windows to his Palace, and does so by thundering them out. While sitting in his palace he asks himself whether anybody would resist his power, and if anybody should, he should send word to Mot, god of death, to deal with them. He sends two messengers to Mot inviting him to a feast and to acknowledge his sovereignty. In the ending, which is lost, Mot makes his reply.\nThe final part of the Baʿal cycle is concerned with Baʿal's battle against Mot, a personification of Death. Continuing from the preceding section, Mot concludes his reply to Baʿal. His reply is that he, like a lion in the desert, hungers constantly for human flesh and blood. By inviting Mot to a meal of bread and wine, Mot is offended, and threatens to cause the heavens to wilt and collapse, breaking Baʿal into pieces. Mot then will eat him piece by piece. When the text continues, Baʿal, or a speaker on his behalf admits his fear and dread of Mot. The speaker then tells Gupn and Ugar to go back to Mot and tell him that Baʿal will be eternally his slave, news to which Mot rejoices. When the text continues Baʿal complains to El that his dominion is in danger of passing to Mot. He then sends messengers to Sheger and Ithm, who are responsible for Cattle and Sheep, and asks them to provide animals for a feast, to which he will invite Mot. When the texts continue, a messenger from Mot arrives in the divine assembly, demanding to know where Baʿal is. They both go up to El's house where El asks what has been happening. When the text continues, a speaker who is probably Shapash the sun-goddess addresses Baʿal. She is advising him to find a substitute in his image, which will be sought out and slain by Mot. She then promises to bury his body, and advises him to go to the two mountains which mark the entrance of the underworld, and to move them aside. Then he is to go down into the earth and hide. He finds a heifer in the fields, and with it a human child, whom he dresses in his robes and offers as a gift to Mot.\n\nWhen the text continues, two deities, presumably Gupn and Ugar arrive at El's abode, and they announce to him that they have been searching for Baʿal, but found him dead by the bank of the river of the dead. El then descends from his throne and sits on the ground, and mourns, strewing dust on his head, wears clothes of sackcloth, shaves off his beard and beats his chest in grief. Anat too wears sackcloth when she finds the fake dead body. Shapash aids Anat in burying Baʿal upon Mount Zephon, and Anat slaughters large numbers of oxen, sheep, goats, and asses as a memorial. Anat returns to El, and tells Athirat and her family (many of whom were on the side of Mot) that they can rejoice since Baʿal was dead. El asks Athirat who can he appoint in Baʿal's place, and she suggests Athtar. Athtar seats himself on Baʿal's throne but is not tall enough, confirming El's suspicion that he is too weak for the position.\n\nWhen the text recontinues, Anat is searching in the netherworld for the shade of her brother. She demands that Mot restores him to her. However, Mot answers that he had searched for him over the earth, where he found him at the entrance of his domain, and then he simply ate him. Anat continues her search, until she loses patience, and she seizes Mot, and attacks him, attacking him with a sword, shaking him, burning him, crushing him, then throwing his remains to the birds. When the text continues, Anat returns to El and announces that Mot is dead. El then has a dream which tells him that Baʿal lives. Shortly after that, Baʿal returns. However, soon Mot comes back to life and complains to Baʿal of the treatment he has received. He demands that Baʿal surrender one of Mot's brothers. When Mot has returned, Baʿal sends messengers telling him that he will banish him, and that if he is hungry, he may eat the servants of Baʿal. However, this fails to please Mot, and so the two gods fight on Mount Zephon until exhausted. Shapash arrives and warns Mot that fighting Baʿal is useless, and that El is now on Baʿal's side and will overturn Mot's throne. Mot is afraid, and so declares that Baʿal is king.\n\nThe death of Baʿal and the reign of Mot has been regarded as a seasonal myth, marking Baʿal as a vegetation god whose death and rebirth is responsible for the Levant's summer drought and autumn rains. However, Oldenburg argues against this, saying it instead represents \"a special catastrophe of drought and infertility when the rain does not come in its season\".\n\nThe contest between Baʿal and Yam is now seen as the prototype for the vision recorded in the 7th chapter of the Biblical Book of Daniel.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17982925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17982925", "title": "Bahá'í Faith in American Samoa and Samoa", "text": "Bahá'í Faith in American Samoa and Samoa\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Samoa and American Samoa begins with the then head of the religion, `Abdu'l-Bahá, mentioning the islands in 1916. This inspired Bahá'ís on their way to Australia in 1920 to stop in Samoa. Thirty four years later another Bahá'í from Australia pioneered to Samoa in 1954. With the first converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1961, and the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1970. Following the conversion of the then Head of State of Samoa, King Malietoa Tanumafili II, the first Bahá'í House of Worship of the Pacific Islands was finished in 1984 and the Bahá'í community reached a population of over 3,000 in about the year 2000.\n\nThe first mention of the Samoan Islands in Bahá'í literature is in a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917 by `Abdu'l–Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Written on 11 April 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 – after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919.\n\n\"A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean—Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and the islands attached to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, Friendly Islands, Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, Marshall Islands, Timor and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people.\"\n\nFollowing this call to pioneer in 1919, Clara and Hyde Dunn moved from the United Kingdom to the United States where they met and married and then decided to pioneer to Australia in 1920 and stopped briefly in Samoa on their way. Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l–Bahá, launched the Ten Year Crusade and during this plan, 34 years after the first Bahá'ís of Australia had stopped at Samoa, a woman named Lilian Wyss pioneered to Western Samoa from Australia in January 1954 leaving behind a position on the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia at the age of 24 while her brother, Frank Wyss, introduced the religion that year to the Cocos Island. For their service, Shoghi Effendi awarded both of them the accolade of Knight of Bahá'u'lláh. Later she married and took the name Suhayl 'Alá'í. About this time Emmanuel Rock, one of the earliest Samoans to join the religion, did so prior to the beginning of the Ten Year Crusade. Simple Bahá'í literature was translated into the Samoan language about 1955 and into the language of Niue Island in 1956. At this time Bahá'í sources claim there were five Bahá'ís known among the Samoa Islands. The first native believer Mrs. Lotoa Rock, Emmanuel Rock's wife, joined the religion in 1956. In late 1956 Saialala Tamasese was the second native to join the religion and the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957 in Western Samoa with another five smaller groups of Bahá'ís, followed by an assembly election in Samoa in 1961. Many of the early Bahá'ís were well educated and some had Christian theological training and after conversion sometimes held positions of high office in the religion.\n\nFrom then events have multiplied involving the growing community. Starting on 29 October 1958 the first visit of a Hand of the Cause in the person of Enoch Olinga began an extended tour of the islands during which Olinga was honored with a Kava based ceremony. In 1959 the Bahá'ís gathered in the first summer school with some 30 attendees and hosted by a local chief, purchased the first Bahá'í cemetery, and gathered with Samoans from both islands to consult on the growth of the religion on the islands. In 1962 the religion had reached the island of Savai'i and the first public talk on the religion was given in Apia – which was extended to three additional talks and Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone visited Bahá'ís and civic leaders. In 1963 the assembly of Pago Pago arranged the first observance of United Nations Day which had the acting governor and other leading figures giving talks. Coverage of the event was carried by print, radio and television media leading up to the event in general and of the Bahá'ís hosting. In 1964 a conference on Fiji which included Bahá'ís from Tonga, Samoa, New Guinea and Fiji. Immediately following the first convention was held to elect the regional national assembly of South Pacific Ocean. Bahá'ís continued to come and began to leave from Samoa. Also in 1965 the first Samoan pioneer returned to the island of his birth – the Tokelau Islands. It was three years before authorities allowed him to promulgate his religion. Samoan Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga toured Australia giving talks to Bahá'ís and Australian society on the religion in 1967. Russell Garcia and Gina, his wife, visited many islands among Samoa in 1967 and others giving concerts and classes in schools for several years before ultimately moving to New Zealand. In 1969 Samoan Bahá'í women stretched social norms by personally taking trips to attempt to spread the religion. From December 1969 into January 1970 the first international youth conference of the south pacific took place in Apia drawing attendees from Samoa. Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Tonga, United States, and Western Samoa. Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Qásim Faizi attended and gave talks both to the attendees and to the public afterwards. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Samoa was elected at a convention hosting Hand of the Cause of God Collis Featherstone, Continental Board of Counsellors member Suhayl Ala'i, Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga, the nine delegates and over fifty members of the religion from both Western and American Samoa. The elected members of the national assembly were from both Western and American Samoa.\n\nIn an event that would have long range effects on the community in 1965 Tamasese, one of the first native Bahá'ís of Samoa, died and at the funeral members of a royal family of Samoa were present at the Bahá'í funeral. According to tradition, a fine mat is presented to the presiding officer of the funeral which in this case was an Auxiliary Board member. This mat was presented to the Universal House of Justice in 1968. This same mat was gifted to the King at the dedication of the temple in 1979. Meanwhile, cooperation with the government of Samoa expanded. In 1967 Bahá'ís presented Bahá'í literature to the kings of Tonga and Samoa with more planned for leaders of government. In 1967 the government of Samoa sponsored the observance of United Nations Day. In years past it had been the Baha'i community of American Samoa that had sponsored the observance, with the aid of the government of American Samoa. This year Governor Aspinall appointed a United Nations Day Committee which included the chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific Ocean, Suhayl Ala'i, as member of the Committee for Iran. Mr. Ala'i made suggestions resulting in the inclusion of the Baha'i prayer for unity in the program and the committee secured the services of Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery as guest speaker. By 1968 King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa privately converted to the religion and announced it publicly in 1973 when he wrote a letter to the convention to elect the Universal House of Justice. The Universal House of Justice asked Bahá'ís individually to not seek publicity of the issue at the time. In 1974 King Malietoa Tanumafili II attended the national convention and congratulated work on construction of a Bahá'í center and KVZK-2 recorded a series of three 15-minute programs to be broadcast as part of its daily show \"Talosaga\". In 1976 the national assembly was registered with the United States, the first Bahá'í center on Tutuila was raised, and King Tanumafili visited the grave of Shoghi Effendi. In 1986 as part of a series of events (see below) highlighting the importance of peace the Bahá'ís had meetings with the American Samoan Speaker of the House and the prime minister of Western Samoa attended including a presentation of the statement by the Universal House of Justice called \"The Promise of World Peace\". In 1987 the Bahá'ís helped celebrate the 25th anniversary of the independence of Western Samoa with a commemoration at the Bahá'í House of Worship which included a surprise unveiling of a large portrait of king Tanumafili, and at a parade for the anniversary Bahá'ís won third place in a contest of floats. At the 27th anniversary Bahá'ís double purposed the celebration with a service dedicated to World Environment Day which was followed by talks by Bahá'ís and head of the Forestry Division of the federal Environmental Program and Tafaese Lautua, a member of Parliament, also thanked the Bahá'ís on behalf of the minister of Lands and Survey/Park Preservation. At the 50th anniversary of the reign of king Tanumafili II a parade in which 40 Baha'is marched for the review of the Malietoa and his guest, the king of Tonga as well as entered a float in a parade depicting the oneness of mankind, which placed second in the judging. The float held the grandson of the king who is also a Bahá'í.\n\nIn 1977 three summer schools were held in Samoa, one in each of the major islands of Savai'i, Tutuila and Upolu, replacing the usual central summer school held in Lelata, Apia, and the same year the first national children's conference took place. At that time eight of ten planned local centers had been built and there were at least 24 local assemblies. In 1978 the annual convention had 30 delegates to elect the national assembly – and the elected members of that year were Sam Ale Ale, Moli Chang, Reuben Busby, Lilian Ala'i, Fuiono Aniseto, Lina Kava, Khosrow Moghelpour, Fili Pe'epe'e and Leala Tasi. In 1978 an award was given to Bahá'í youth and children who took part in the Samoan Arts Festival; following Bahá'í laws the money award was donated to a humanitarian agency. In 1979 the Bahá'ís of Samoa in cooperation with Russ and Gina Garcia produced a film commemorating the International Year of the Child that was shown on television several times in Samoa. In 1981 one hundred fifty people from Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, New Zealand and the United States attended a women's conference in Samoa that was planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Bahiyyih Khánum. Speakers included the wife and sister of the king of Samoa, and the wife of the prime minister of the Cook Islands and a Maori woman from New Zealand.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio–economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World–wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio–economic development projects. In 1983 the national assembly sponsored a conference on rural development for one hundred–ten people from Upolu, Savaii and Tutuila, at Lelata. In 1986, in addition to an observance held at the Bahá'í House of Worship, (see below), the Bahá'ís sponsored a peace essay contest where Certificates of recognition were given to each of 36 finalists and monetary prizes awarded to seven winners. At the ceremony, Lt. Governor Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin and Counsellor Suhayl Ala'i spoke about peace. The Bahá'ís also held a conference on Family Welfare and Management with a talk by Western Samoa's assistant secretary for the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture, and other talks with 200 Baha'is in attendance. By 1987 worldwide the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Samoan Bahá'í youth began to be noticed in the development of the community – three youth were sponsored in 1985 for the International Youth Year and participated in United Nations and international projects. By the 1990s there were Samoan youth workshops (see Oscar DeGruy) performing internationally.\n\nThe site of the future temple was celebrated in 1976 with a gathering of over one hundred Bahá'ís and children who sang songs and said prayers for four days. Twenty five years after the first Bahá'í settled in the islands of Samoa the Bahá'í House of Worship in Tiapapata, 8 km from Apia, Samoa, had its cornerstone set in 1979 and was completed in 1984 and serves as the Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands. After three days of celebrations and talks the cornerstone was laid and the Temple later dedicated by King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa who was the first reigning Bahá'í monarch. Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum was also present at the laying of the cornerstone and its dedication. More than 500 Bahá'ís attended at the laying of the cornerstone and guests included members of the family of the king; representatives of 16 national assemblies; heads of several departments of the Samoan government and representatives of the churches of Samoa. At the dedication more than 1,000 Bahá'ís from 45 countries and islands with civic leaders including the king and prime minister and other officials. The structure is completely open to the island breezes. The lands of the Temple are also the resting place of Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery. Perhaps the first large event held at the temple was a special service in 1985 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the United Nations and to launch the UN International Year of Peace. Among the guests at the service were the king and members of his family including Princess Tooa Salamasina Malietoa; the New Zealand High Commissioner; the Chinese ambassador; consuls from France, the Netherlands, and the United States; and other diplomatic dignitaries. The UN's resident Representative was present, as was the UNESCO Representative and most of the UN personnel in Samoa. Some of the dependencies of a Bahá'í House of Worship have also been developed — – a cemetery and school have been set.\n\nAcross Samoa and American Samoa there are Bahá'í communities in Puleia, Papa–i–Palauli–le–Falefa, Sasina, Pu'apu'a, Faleasi'u–Uta, Faeasi'u–Tai, Laleta, Lepea, Pago Pago, Iliili, Tafuna, and Leone. The Bahá'ís of Samoa numbered too few to show up in the 2001 national census. The shared estimate of the Bahá'í population in Samoa circa 2000 according to a profile by the World Council of Churches and the online encyclopedia Encarta was 2% of the nation – some 3600 people – and the only non–Christian community of any number. There are, however, some reports of oppression of the community.\n\nThe Samoan Bahá'í Charitable Trust for Social and Economic Development was established in 1990 and produced Samoa's first television series dedicated to a healthy diet, \"O le Kuka Samoa,\" on 16 October 2000 with Samoan comedian Sumeo, alias \"O le King Kuka,\" and was aimed at rejuvenating Samoan cultural food practices to help provide better nutrition as well as reliance on local resources. The Bahá'í community also maintains five Bahá'í pre–schools across all the islands of Samoa, gains converts, attracts skilled professionals, and a national youth committee is coordinating volunteer youth to come and serve in the Samoan Bahá'í community.\n\nRepresentatives of the National Assemblies of Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, New Zealand, and Tonga as well as other dignitaries of the religion and Bahá'ís from the islands of Savai'i and Upolu and Bahá'í members of the royal family – King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa and daughter Susuga To'oa Tosi Malietoa – attended the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'ís Faith in Samoa in 2004 along with various members of the government of Samoa who highlighted many of the services the Bahá'ís have given to the general community.\n\nOn the passing of Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa in 2007, the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, the Universal House of Justice wrote: \"His service to the people of Samoa as Head of State was distinguished by the high principles, genuine compassion and personal humility that characterized the constancy of his concern for the welfare of all. As the first reigning sovereign to accept the Message of Bahá'u'lláh, he set a record that will forever illumine the annals of our Faith, one that future generations will increasingly extol. His great interest for well–nigh four decades in the Faith's progress was reflected in the enthusiastic affirmation of his belief whenever the opportunity presented itself and in the abiding joy with which he regarded the construction in 1984 of the Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands in Samoa...\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "189203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189203", "title": "Camulodunum", "text": "Camulodunum\n\nCamulodunum (; ), the Ancient Roman name for what is now Colchester in Essex, was an important town in Roman Britain, and the first capital of the province. It is claimed to be the oldest town in Britain. Originally the site of the Brythonic-Celtic oppidum of Camulodunon (meaning \"stronghold of Camulos\"), capital of the Trinovantes and later the Catuvellauni tribes, it was first mentioned by name on coinage minted by the chieftain Tasciovanus sometime between 20 and 10 BC. The Roman town began life as a Roman Legionary base constructed in the AD 40s on the site of the Brythonic-Celtic fortress following its conquest by the Emperor Claudius. After the early town was destroyed during the Iceni rebellion in 60/1 AD, it was rebuilt, reaching its zenith in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. During this time it was known by its official name Colonia Claudia Victricensis ('), often shortened to Colonia Victricensis\"', and as \"Camulodunum\", a Latinised version of its original Brythonic name. The town was home to a large classical Temple, two theatres (including Britain's largest), several Romano-British temples, Britain's only known chariot circus, Britain's first town walls, several large cemeteries and over 50 known mosaics and tessellated pavements. It may have reached a population of 30,000 at its height. It was not until the late 18th century that historians realised that Colchester's physical Brythonic (British Celtic) and Roman remains were the city mentioned in ancient literature as \"Camulodunum\".\n\nThe earliest Iron Age defensive site at Colchester is the Pitchbury Ramparts earthwork north of the town between West Bergholt and Great Horkesley. The main earthwork defences of the Brythonic Celtic oppidum of \"Camulodunon\" were built later, beginning in the 1st century BC but most date from the 1st century AD. They are considered the most extensive of their kind in Britain. The defences consist of lines of ditches and ramparts, possibly palisaded with gateways, that mostly run parallel to each other in a north-south direction. The Iron Age settlement was protected by rivers on three sides, with the River Colne bounding the site to the north and east, and the Roman River valley forming the southern boundary; the earthworks were mostly designed to close off the western gap between these two river valleys. Other earthworks close off eastern parts of the settlement. These earthworks gave the oppidum its Brythonic Celtic name - \"Camulodunon\" meant \"The Stronghold of Camulus\", the British God of War. Together they enclose an area of 1,000ha, much larger than the area enclosed by the Iron Age defences at Wheathampstead (35ha).\n\nThe main sites within the bounds of these defences are the Gosbecks farmstead, the Sheepen industrial area and the Lexden burials. The Gosbecks site consists of a large, high-status farmstead, believed to be the home of the tribal chieftains of Camulodunon. Part of the Gosbecks complex is a large, square enclosure surrounded by a deep, wide ditch. This has been interpreted as part of a possible religious site, as during the Roman period a large temple was built in the middle of this enclosure. The Sheepen site, located around what is now St Helena School on the banks of the River Colne, was a large industrial and port zone, where extensive iron and leather working activity was carried out, as well as an important coin mint. Two coins minted at Sheepen, one found in Colchester in 1980 and another found at Canturbury in 1978, depict boats, and are the only known depictions of sailing vessels from Iron Age Britain. Amphorae containing imported goods from the continent have been found at Sheepen, as have pieces of imported Samian pottery.\n\nJust inside the earthworks, at Lexden, are located the burial mounds of the rulers of Camulodunon, which contain large amounts of grave goods including imported Roman material from Europe; the largest of these mounds is the Lexden tumulus. The Lexden area around the mounds contains several Iron Age cremation burial groups, including one containing the \"Mirror burial\", with other burials located around the Camulodunon site. A large cluster of cremations from St. Clares road and Fitzwalter Road close to the Lexden Tumulus date to 50-10 BC.\n\nAside from these main activity areas, the 1,000ha area enclosed by the defensive earthworks and rivers mainly consisted of a network of droveways, hollow ways, pastures and fields associated with cattle herding. Scattered Roundhouses and burials have been discovered amongst these droveways. The defences were designed to protect the high status and industrial areas as well as prevent cattle rustling of valuable herds. Camulodunon was surrounded by farmsteads like those at Abbotstone near Colchester Zoo and at Birch Quarry, many of which continued to exist on into the Roman period until at least the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\nIron Age salt works (known as Red hills) have been found in large numbers around the Essex coast, including several large concentrations located in the salt marshes close to Camulodunon in the Colne Estuary, on the Roman River near Fingringhoe, in Alresford Creek, on Mersea Island, the Pyefleet Channel, the Blackwater River and around the Tendring Peninsula. Two large groups existed at Peldon and Tolleshunt D'Arcy. Camulodunon may have been an at the centre of the local trade in this important preservative.\nAddedomarus, a king of the Trinovantes tribe (originally centred at Braughing), is the first identifiable ruler of Camulodunon, known from his inscribed coins dating to around 25-10 BC. For a brief period around 10 BC Tasciovanus, a king of the Catuvellauni already issuing coins from Verlamion, also issued coins from Camulodunon, suggesting that the Trinovantes' capital had been conquered by the Catuvellauni, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of Roman pressure – his later coins are no longer marked with the Latin \"REX\" (for \"king\"), but with the Brythonic \"RICON\" – and Addedomarus was restored. His son Dubnovellaunus succeeded him, but was soon supplanted by Tasciovanus' son Cunobelinus. Cunobelinus then succeeded his father at Verlamion, beginning the dominance of the Catuvellauni over the south-east. Cunobelinus was friendly with Rome, marking his coins with the word \"REX\" and classical motifs rather than the traditional Gallo-Belgic designs. Archaeology shows an increase in imported luxury goods, probably through the Sheepen site port of Camulodunon, during his reign. He was probably one of the British kings that Strabo says sent embassies to Augustus. Strabo reports Rome's lucrative trade with Britain; the island's exports included grain, gold, silver, iron, hides, slaves and hunting dogs. Iron ingots, slave chains and storage vessels discovered at the Sheepen site appear to confirm this trade with the Empire.\n\nThe Catuvellauni king Cunobelinus, ruling from his capital at Camulodunon, had subjugated a large area of southern and eastern Britain, and was called by the Roman historian Suetonius \"King of the Britons\". Under his rule Camulodunon had replaced Verlamion as the most important settlement in pre-Roman Britain. Around 40 AD he had fallen out with his son Adminius (acting as proxy ruler of the Cantiaci tribe in his father’s name), who had fled to Rome for support. There he was received by the Emperor Gaius, who may have attempted an invasion of Britain to put Adminius on his father’s throne. After Cunobelinus’ death (c. 40 AD) his sons took power, with Togodumnus the eldest ruling the Catuvellauni homeland around Verlamion, and Caratacus ruling from Camulodunon. Together these brothers began expanding their influence over other British tribes, including the Atrebates of the south coast. Verica, king of the Atrebates, which had branches on both sides of the English Channel and had been friends of Rome since Caesar’s conquest, appealed to the Emperor Claudius for aid. At the time of this appeal in 43 AD the newly enthroned Emperor Claudius was in need of a military victory in order to secure his shaky position with the military, and saw this call for help as the perfect pretext. Aulus Plautius led the four Roman legions across to Britain with Camulodunon being their main target, defeating and killing Togodumnus near the Thames and then waiting for Claudius to cross the Channel. Claudius arrived with reinforcements, including artillery and elephants, leading the attack on Camulodunon. Caratacus fled the storming of the town, taking refuge with the Ordovices and Silures tribes in Wales and becoming a Welsh folk hero for his resistance to Rome. The Roman historian Suetonius and Claudius' triumphal arch state that after this battle the British kings who had been under Cunobelinus’ sons’ control surrendered without further bloodshed, Claudius accepting their submission in Camulodunon.\n\nAs the stronghold of a major tribe in the south-east, Camulodunum held strategic importance. A Roman legionary fortress or \"castrum\", the first permanent legionary fortress to be built in Britain, was established within the confines of Camulodunon (which was latinised as \"Camulodunum\") following the successful invasion in 43, and was home to the Twentieth Legion. A smaller fort was built against the Iron Age earthworks close to the Gosbecks high-status farmstead, and was home to the Ala Primae Thracum (\"First Wing of Thracians\", a cavalry regiment) and the Cohors Primae Vangionum (\"First Cohort of Vangiones\", a mixed cavalry-infantry unit from Gaul).\n\nAfter the legion was withdrawn in c. 49, the legionary defences were dismantled and the fortress converted into a town, with many of the barrack blocks converted into housing. Its official name became \"Colonia Victricensis\", with discharged Roman soldiers making up the population; a bronze military \"diplomata\" (document formalising a soldier's retirement, citizen rights and land rights) for a legionary soldier called \"Saturninus\" has been found at the Sheepen site. As a colonia (the only one in Britain at the time) its citizens held equal rights to Romans, and it was the principal city of Roman Britain. Tacitus wrote that the town was \"a strong \"colonia\" of ex-soldiers established on conquered territory, to provide a protection against rebels and a centre for instructing the provincials in the procedures of the law\". The Temple of Claudius, the largest classical style temple in Britain, was built there in the 50s and was dedicated to Emperor Claudius on his death in 54. The podium, or foundation of the temple, was incorporated into the Norman castle, and represents \"the earliest substantial stone building of Roman date visible in the country\". A monumental arch was built from tufa and Purbeck Marble at the western gate out of the town. Tombs lined the roads out of the town, with several belonging to military veterans giving insights into the military units stationed in Britain during the post-Conquest period, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 60-61 the population may have been as high as 30,000.\n\nThe city was the capital of the Roman province of Britannia, and its temple (the only classical-style temple in Britain) was the centre of the Imperial Cult in the province. The Roman philosopher Seneca mentioned the temple when he mocked the province for its piety towards the Deified Claudius. The colonia was also initially home to the provincial Procurator of Britain. Aside from the Roman population, the city and surrounding territorium was also home to a large native population. Examples of cooperation between the two groups include the Romano-British Stanway Burials mounds and the warrior graves of native elites from the 50s. These graves represent members of the native aristocracy who have been Romanised.\n\nHowever tensions arose in 60/61 when the Roman authorities used the death of Prasutagus as a pretext for seizing the Iceni client state from his widow Boudica. The Iceni rebels were joined by the Trinovantes around Colonia Victricensis, who held several grudges against the Roman population of the town. These included the seizure of land for the colonia’s veteran population, the use of labour to build the Temple of Claudius, and the sudden recall of loans given to the local elites by leading Romans (including Seneca and the Emperor), which had been needed to allow the locals to qualify for a position on the city council. The Procurator Catus Decianus was especially despised.\n\nTacitus recorded that certain ominous portents occurred in the town prior to the rebellion:\n\nAs the symbol of Roman rule in Britain the city was the first target of the rebels, with its Temple seen in British eyes as the \"arx aeternae dominationis\" (\"stronghold of everlasting domination\") according to Tacitus. He wrote that it was undefended by fortifications when it was attacked with a garrison of only 200 members of the procurator's guard. He wrote of a last stand at the Temple of Claudius:\n\nThe rebels destroyed the city and slaughtered its population. Archaeologists have found layers of ash in the site of the city, suggesting that Boudica ordered her rebel army to burn the city to the ground. A relief army consisting of the Legio IX Hispana led by Quintus Petillius Cerialis attempted to rescue the besieged citizens, but was destroyed outside of the town. After the Romans under governor Gaius Suetonius Paullinus finally defeated the uprising, the Procurator of the province moved his seat to the newly established commercial settlement of Londinium (London).\n\nThe destruction of the early town by the rebels has left a thick layer of ash, destroyed buildings and smashed pottery and glasswork across the town centre and at the Sheepen river port site outside the NW corner of the town. The destruction layer, also found at Verulamium (St Albans) and Londinium (London), is famous for the charred preservation of artefacts and furniture, including a samian store, a glass store, beds and matresses, wall plaster, tessalated floors, a few human bones with wounds and even dates and plums. During excavations in 2014 at Williams and Griffin on the High Street a collection of gold and silver jewellery was discovered buried in the floor of a Roman building destroyed during the revolt. Known as the \"Fenwick Treasure\", it appears to have been buried just prior to the buildings destruction by a victim of the Boudican attack. The layer is important to historians as it is one of the first archaeological contexts in Britain that can be given a definitive date, as well as to archaeologists as it provides a snapshot of artifacts from 60, allowing typologies of finds to be tied into a historical timeline, for example in Samian production. The rubble from the destruction was landscaped during the rebuilding of the town that took place in the years after the revolt.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Colonia and Suetonius Paulinus’ crushing of the revolt the town was rebuilt on a larger scale and flourished, growing larger in size than its pre-Boudican levels (to 108 acres/45 ha) despite its loss of status to Londinium, reaching its peak in the Second and 3rd centuries. The town's official name was \"Colonia Claudia Victricensis\" (City of Claudius’ Victory), but it was known colloquially by contemporaries (such as on the monument of Gnaeus Munatius Aurelius Bassus in Rome - \"see below\") as \"Camulodunum\" or simply \"Colonia\".\nThe colonia became a large industrial centre, and was the largest, and for a short time the only, place in the province of Britannia where samian ware was produced, along with glasswork and metalwork, and a coin mint. Roman brick making and wine growing also took place in the area. Colonia Victricensis contained many large townhouses, with dozens of mosaics and tessellated pavements found, along with hypocausts and sophisticated waterpipes and drains.\n\nThe colonia is mentioned by name several times by contemporaries, including in Pliny's Natural History, Ptolemy's Geography, Tacitus' Annales, The Antonine Itinerary and the Ravenna Cosmography. The 2nd century tomb inscription for Gn. Munatius Bassus in Rome, which describes the name of the town and its Roman citizenship, reads:\n\nThe city was one of the few Roman settlements in Britain designated as a \"Colonia\" rather than a \"Municipia\", meaning that in legal terms it was an extension of the city of Rome, not a provincial town. Its inhabitants therefore had Roman citizenship. Of the two provincial administrators the senatorial military governor was always located in areas of conflict, whilst the civilian Procurator’s office had moved from Camulodunum to the new port of Londinium sometime around the Boudican Revolt. However the Colonia did retain the Imperial cult centre and priesthood at the Temple of Claudius. The colonia was at the centre of a large territorium containing many villa sites, including an important cluster around the Colne estuary.\n\nFollowing the rebuilding of the town after 60/1 new walls and a large defensive ditch were built around the colonia (the first town walls in Britain, predating other such walls in the province by at least 150 years). They were completed by 80, twenty years after the revolt. They were built with two external faces of alternating layers of tile and septaria mudstone containing a core of septaria boulders, with a 10 ft wide and 4 ft deep foundation trench, the whole structure taking up 45,000 cubic metres of stone, tile and mortar. They were 2,800m long and 2.4m thick, and survive up to a height of over 6m in the 21st Century. Later, in around 175-200 a large earth bank was built up against the inner face of the walls. The walls had between 12 and 24 towers and six large gates. Balkerne Gate, in the centre of the Western section of the walls, was the main gate out of the town. It has a large fortified barbican that still stands as Britain’s largest Roman gateway, which incorporated the earlier monumental arch built before the Iceni rebellion and was flanked by two possible temples, one of which may have contained the Venus statuette found during the 1973-76 excavations. Skulls showing signs of decapitation were found in the town ditch in front of the gate, interpreted as executions on public display. The North wall contained two gates, the modern North Gate and Duncan’s Gate, the East wall had the modern East Gate, and the Southern wall had the modern South Gate and Head Gate. Drains were constructed in the wall to allow sewerage out of the colonia.\n\nThe Cardo maximus, the main North-South street, ran between North Gate and Head Gate, whilst the Decumanus Maximus, the main East-West street, ran between Balkerne Gate and East Gate, and have their origins in the Legionary fortresses two main axial streets. They were well paved, had drainage channels and were fronted with houses and shops. Many included footways, a feature that is rare in other Roman British towns. The rest of the colonia was gridded into around forty blocks known as insula, with paved streets and colonnaded paths between. As well as a system of local roads leading to settlements around the colony, Camulodunum was linked to the rest of the Province by several major roads, including Stane Street, Camlet Way, Pye Road and the Via Devana.\n\nWithin the town walls was located the Temple of Claudius in its large temple precinct with a monumental columned arcade. Parts of the temple precinct wall are still visible to the NW of the present castle, jutting out from beneath the Norman bailey rampart. The front of the precinct wall consisted of a large columned arcade screen extending the full width of the frontage. At the centre of this arcade stood the entranceway to the temple precinct, which took the form of a tufa-faced monumental arch that at 8 m wide was about 2 m wider than the one at the Eastern entrance to the town, which had been incorporated into Balkerne Gate.\n\nTo the west of the temple on the modern Maidenburgh Street was a 3,000 seat capacity Roman theatre, which now has the Norman chapel of St Helena built into the corner of it, currently open to public viewing. Opposite the Temple, on the south side of the Decumanus Maximus, the remains of a possible Basilica have been identified. At least seven Romano-Celtic temples have been identified at Camulodunum, with the largest located at the Gosbecks area to the south of the town, built within the site of a former Iron-Age enclosure.\n\nA large portico with an eastern entrance ran all the way around the outside of the site, with a solid outer wall, a row of columns down the centre of the portico and a second row of columns around the inner side. In all there were about 260 columns placed 2 m apart, and reaching a height of at least 5 m. The portico ran around the outside of a deep, Iron-Age enclosure ditch, which separated the portico from the central space in the middle of the site. This central space contained a large Romano-Celtic temple, which stood off-centre, leading to suggestions that something else stood at the heart of the religious complex.\n\nNext to the Gosbecks temple stood a second 5,000 seat theatre, Britain’s largest at 82 m in diameter. A group of four Romano-Celtic temples stood at the Sheepen industrial site, one of which was dedicated to Jupiter. \"Temple I\" at the Sheepen site was found to be enclosed by a large, buttressed precinct wall during excavations in 1935 and 2014.\n\nIn 2005, the only known Roman circus in Britain was discovered on the southern outskirts of the colonia. It is about 450 metres long, with eight starting-gates, and it was built in the early 2nd century. It could accommodate at least 8,000 spectators and maybe up to as many as double that. The structure’s gates are being opened to the public.\n\nSeveral temples and religious monuments in and around the colonia have evidence for the deity honoured by them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarble from many of these public structures has been found, including Purbeck Marble and \"giallo antico\" (a rare yellow marble from Tunisia), as well as statutes, inscriptions and plaques.\n\nSeveral other public buildings have been postulated for which evidence is so far lacking, for example:\n\nThe town's streets and walls feature many brick built drains, including several large examples in Castle Park and near St Botolph's Priory. As well as drains the colonia also possessed pipes for bringing pressurised water into the settlement. At the excavations at Balkerne Lane four lines of hollow wooden pipes, joined with iron collars were found bringing water from nearby springs, as well as evidence of a possible raised wooden aqueduct which may have been briefly in existence next to Balkerne Gate. Further pipes have been discovered across the town. The water would have been pressurised in reservoirs; it has been argued by archaeologist Philip Crummy that the pipes would have been fed by a \"castellum divisiorum\", a water tower with multiple outlets, and that in order to get water to where the pipes at Balkerne Lane were found some form of aqueduct or water-lifting wheel would have been need to bring it from springs West of the town. Within the town, a complicated system of chambers, water pipes and slots for possible water-wheels was found in Castle Park that were once described as a Mithraeum but that has now been reinterpreted as a reservoir system. A large overflow drain ran from the structure down to a culvert near Duncan's Gate where the excess water exited the town into the River Colne. Timber framed wells have also been discovered, and there are at least nine springs located within the walls of Camulodunum. Private baths have been found at some sites, but as yet no public baths have been positively identified.\n\nMany houses have been found in the colonia during archaeological excavations. Stone founded buildings largely replaced timber ones in the course of the 2nd century, while average house size tended to increase in size up to a peak at around 250. They have painted plaster walls and tiled roofs, many with tessellated mosaic floors, hypocaust systems, private baths and courtyards. Latrine pits, with examples well over a metre deep, have been discovered next to some of the houses. Large houses were also found in the extramural suburbs outside of the town walls, with the Middleborough House beneath the old Cattle Market being the largest, containing many rooms, mosaics and basements. The Beryfield mosaic (of 180/200) from the SE corner of the colonia is the best preserved of the more than 50 mosaics found in the town.\n\nIn keeping with Roman burial customs the cemeteries for adults of the colonia in the First, Second and Third centuries are all located outside of the walls along the main roads out of the town, with infants and neo-natals buried within the walls. The cemeteries, some of which are walled, initially contained cremation burials, with ashes placed within jars and urns depicting human faces or glass vessels; these jars were sometimes buried in \"boxes\" made from ceramic tiles and hypocaust flue blocks to protect the vessel. Some cremation pots have graffito on them, with PVERORVA (\"remains of the boys\") scratched on one, as do some glass vessels, such as one found with CN.A.ING.A.V.M. scratched on it (presumably the initials of the interred ashes). Later (post-c. 260) burials are inhumations, some in lead coffins decorated with patterns and images of scallop shells, and some with wooden superstructures above and around them. Examples of \"bustum\" burials (funerary pyre that is then covered with a mound) have been found, which are rare outside of Italy. Elaborate grave goods accompanied some of the burials. Many fragments of carved tombstones have been found in the cemeteries outside of the town, with several being near complete such as the \"Colchester Sphinx\". Some of the inscriptions on the tombs are almost fully intact, including:\n\n\nOther funerary monuments include the large tower-like ossuary containing the remains of cremated individuals and birds of prey, which was found at the junction between the road to London and the road to Gosbecks beneath the modern Colchester Royal Grammar School.\n\nCamulodunum was a centre for pottery production, peaking at around 200, and over 40 kilns have been in the town, including those found in the northern suburbs of the colonia around Middleborough and a large group at Warren Fields and Oak Drive on the southern outskirts of the Sheepen site. Many of the kilns are of the oval \"Colchester type\", whilst tile kilns have larger rectangular chambers. Camulodunum produced many types of pottery, including decorated Samian pottery, mortaria, buff wares, single-handled ring-necked flagons, and, until c. 250, colour-coated wares. In the late 1st century amphorae, called \"Camulodunum Carrots\" for their shape and colour, were made in the colonia, and are found in thin numbers across Britain. The Samian industry, copying the East Gaullish style, was active for a time in Camulodunum from 160 to about 200, with the names of several individual Samian potters identified as working in the colonia. Over 400 fragments of Samian moulds for producing the decorated pottery have been uncovered in the town, including 37 complete examples. A well-preserved Samian kiln was excavated by archaeologist M.R. Hull near Middleborough, just outside North Gate. It was 8 ft wide, with a 5m flue under a large circular kiln chamber, and had a complex system of ceramic pipes and tubes for regulating the oxidisation of the pottery to produce its distinctive red colour. Several of the potters operating in Camulodunum in the First, Second and Third centuries are identified as immigrants from the Rhine Valley and East Gaul, including the Samian potter \"Minuso\" from Trier who also operated in other British towns, \"Miccio\", the mortaria potter \"G. Attius Marinus\" and several men called \"Sextus Valerius\". Pottery made in Camulodunum can be found across the East of England, and as far away as Eboracum. One of the most famous examples of locally made pottery is the \"Colchester Vase\" (c. 200), which depicts combat between gladiators called Memnon and Valentinus.\n\nAs well as pottery, ceramics produced in Camulodunum also include a large tile industry, oil lamps and figurines. The colonia was also a major centre of glass production, and glass moulds (including a complete example) have been discovered in the town. Glass was produced throughout the Roman period of Camulodunum, including in the late 4th century, and glass-making waste was discovered at Culver Street from the mid-1st century. Bone carving for ornamentation, metal working and jewellery making were also practiced, and a coin mint operated in the colonia. Archaeological excavations suggest that the period between 150 and 250 saw the largest number of active workshops in the colonia. The town was at the centre of a largely rural economy, with archaeological evidence of agricultural buildings in the colonia including the large buttressed tower granary found in the Southern part of the town, in use for much of the 2nd century, with a nearby corn-drying oven. Many ovens have been located in excavations around the town. A system of watermills appears to have operated along Salary Brook near Ardleigh to the north of the settlement, and other watermills may have operated on the Colne at the modern site of Middle Mill in Castle Park. Oysters from the Colne Estuary and Mersea Island have been an important food source throughout much of Colchester's history, and large dumps (some 0.5m thick) of oyster shells have been found at Balkerne Hill from the Roman period, along with mussels, whelks, cockles, carpet shells, winkle and scallop; fish imported from the River Colne and coast are represented by herring, plaice, flounder, eel, smelt, cod, haddock, gurnard, mullet, dragonet, dab, and sole. As well as the Sheepen river port, Roman roads lead to Mistley on the Essex bank of the River Stour and to a cluster of Roman-era buildings at West Mersea, both of which may also have possessed ports for the colonia. Imports of dates, wine (including Falernian wine), olive oil, jet, marble and other goods from across the Roman Empire have been found in Colchester, including a locally made amphora with an inscription suggesting that it held North African palm-tree fruit products. The trade in salt from local Red Hills also appears to have continued on from the Iron Age in the Roman period, but with more sophisticated evaporation kilns. Small numbers of tiles were imported from Eccles in Kent by Roman settlements in South-East Britain, including Camulodunum, for a brief time in the First Century, as was Kentish Ragstone for building.\n\nThe late 3rd century and 4th centuries saw a series of crises in the Empire, including the breakaway Gallic Empire (of which Britain was a part), and raids by Saxon pirates, both of which lead to the creation of the Saxon Shore forts along the East coast of Britain. The fort at Othona overlooking the confluence of the Blackwater and Colne estuaries, and two more at the mouth of the river into the colonia were built to protect the town. Balkerne Gate and Duncan’s Gate were both blocked up in this period, with the later showing signs of being attacked. The extramural suburbs outside of Balkerne Gate had gone by 300 and were replaced by cultivation beds. The re-cutting of the town ditch in front of the newly blocked Balkerne Gate in 275-300 involved destroying the water pipes which entered the colonia through the gate. However a small portal in the gateway may have been opened up later. The town ditch began to silt up from c. 400 onwards. The troubles of the late 3rd century saw the burial of several coin hoards around the town, including a hoard of 1,247 coins found in a grey-ware pot at Hyderabad Barracks.\n\nAs with many towns in the Empire, the colonia shrunk in size in the 4th century but continued to function as an important town. Although houses tended to shrink in size, with 75% of the large townhouses being replaced by smaller buildings by c. 350, in the period 275 to 325 a weak \"building boom\" (the \"Constantinian renaissance\") occurred in the town, with new houses being built and old ones reshaped. Many of the towns mosaics date from this period, including the famous Lion Walk mosaic. Late Roman robber trenches have been found at some sites for removing and salvaging tessalated floors and tiles for reuse in later houses. The pottery industry in the town had declined significantly by 300, but the 4th century did see an increase in the bone-working industry for making furniture and jewellery, and evidence of blown glass making has also been found. Large areas of the Southern part of the town were given over to agriculture.\n\nDespite the scaling down of private buildings an increase in the size and grandeur of public buildings occurs in the period 275-400. The Temple of Claudius and its associated \"temenos\" buildings were reconstructed in the early-4th century, along with the possible forum-basilica building to the south of it. The Temple appears to have had a large apsidal hall built across the front of the podium steps, with numismatic dating evidence taking the date of the building up to at least 395. A large hall at the Culver Street site, dated 275-325 to c. 400, may have been a large centralised storage barn for taxes paid in kind with grain.\n\nAlthough the Gosbecks Theatre had been demolished by the 3rd century, the theatre at Maidenburgh Street may still have been in use throughout the 4th century. The sunken chambers of the water reservoir system found in Castle Park appear to have become blocked up with debris and dumped rubbish in the 4th century and had gone out of use. The Roman chariot circus was also demolished during the late 4th century.\nIncreases in the number of clipped coins from the 4th century have been interpreted as a breakdown in the Roman monetary economy, with most new Bronze coins ceasing to be introduced in the town c. 395 and silver coins in 402 (however these coins may have remained in circulation long after being minted). For example, the coin sequence at the Butt Road church goes up to around 425, 14 years after Roman rule ended in the province.\n\nLate Roman military equipment has been discovered in the town, including an official \"cingulum militare\" belt buckle made in Pannonia for Roman frontier units. Alongside Roman military equipment 4th and early 5th century Germanic weaponry has been found alongside Germanic domestic objects in the Late Roman town, which has been interpreted by archaeologist Philip Crummy as perhaps representing Saxon \"foederati\" mercenaries living and settling in the town during this period, several decades before the Saxon migrations of the mid to late 5th century.\n\nDuring this period the late Roman church at Butt Road just outside the town walls was built with its associated cemetery containing over 650 graves (some containing fragments of Chinese silk), and may be one of the earliest churches in Britain. A strong numismatic chronology has been obtained from the over 500 coins found at the site, and puts its date from 320 to c.425. Five of the extramural pagan Romano-British Temples were abandoned in c.300, whilst \"Temple II\" at Sheepen was rebuilt in 350 and continued in existence until c. 375. \"Temple X\" outside of the Balkerne Gate had its ambulatory demolished in 325-50 leaving just its Cella, perhaps repurposed as a Christian temple. A nearby shrine may also have survived into the late 4th century. Several other possible churches or Christian buildings have been postulated, such as \"Building 127\" at Culver Street and possible Roman remains beneath St Helena’s Chapel, St Nicholas Church and Roman \"vaults\" beneath St Botolph's Priory which might be a late-Roman Martyrium, although over interpretations include a bath-house. The Temple of Claudius, which underwent large-scale structural additions in the 4th century, may also have been repurposed as a Christian church, as a Chi Rho symbol carved on a piece of Roman pottery found in the vicinity of the \"temenos\". Further Roman Christian objects found in the town include a candlestick from Balkerne Lane inscribed with an Iota Chi symbol and a bronze spoon with AETERNVS VITA written on it. Three British Bishops attended the Council of Arles (314), one from London, one from York and a third from a place whose first word is \"Colonia\" but whose second word is too corrupted to make out with any certainty, but has been interpreted as something like \"Camulodensium\" (although Lincoln and Gloucester are other possible candidates).\n\nThe formal collapse of Roman administration in the province occurred in the years 409-411. Activity in the 5th century continued in Camulodunum at a much reduced level, with evidence of at the Butt Road site showing that it briefly carrying on into the early 5th century. Several burials within the towns walls have been dated to the 5th century. These include two burials discovered at East Hill House in 1983, which have been surgically decapitated (in a fashion found in both Pre-Roman and some early pagan-Saxon burial practices), and other burials cut into the 4th century barn at Culver Street. A skeleton of a young woman found stretched out on a Roman mosaic floor at Beryfield, within the SE corner of the walled town, was initially interpreted as a victim of a Saxon attack on the Sub-Roman town; however, it is now believed that the burial is a post-Roman grave cut down to the hard floor surface (the name \"Beryfield\" means \"burial field\", a reference to the Medieval graveyards in the area). Burials of men armed with Germanic weaponry have also been found outside of the town walls, and might be the graves of Saxon \"foederati\" or Saxon settlers. Post-Roman/early Saxon burials from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, some buried with weapons, have been found outside of the walls in the areas of former Roman cemeteries, suggesting a continuity of practice. A study by archaeologist Henry Laver concluded that all of the Roman cemeteries around Colchester contain later burials dating to the early Saxon period. Excavations of the former Goojerat and Hyderabad Barracks in 2004 and 2010 saw the discovery of other pagan 5th century burials with Germanic weapons, nine of which were located in burial mounds surrounded by circular ditches. As well as burials, coin hoards from the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries have been found, including a hoard minted in the reign of Constantine III (reigned 407-411) from Artillery Folly, that are heavily clipped; this clipping must have occurred in the years after they were minted and so would have happened in the 400s (decade). Scattered structures have also been excavated by archaeologists, such as a mid-5th century dwelling at Lion Walk, as well as 5th century loam weights and cruciform-broaches found across the town. At the Culver Street site a thin layer of early Saxon pottery was discovered along with two dwellings. Other circumstantial evidence of activity includes large post-Roman rubbish dumps, which suggest nearby occupation. Excavations at Guildford Road Estate have uncovered a Germanic-style brooch, dated to around the 420s, associated with a group of beads from a necklace, also dated to sometime between 400 and 440. The presence of Late Roman and Germanic military and domestic finds within the Late Roman and Pre-Saxon Early-Fifth Century town has been interpreted by archaeologist Philip Crummy as either the result of Saxon \"foederati\" and their families living within Camulodunum, and/or cultural influences from the continent on the local population. The existence of a post-Roman entity centred on the town, sometimes linked to the legend of Camelot, has been argued and was first proposed by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler.\n\nLater dwellings at Culver Street and artifacts from the 7th and 8th centuries are seen as evidence that the shell of the Roman town was still in use into the Saxon period. The \"History of the Britons\" traditionally ascribed to Nennius includes a list of the 28 cities of Britain, including a Cair Colun that has been thought to indicate Colchester. Archaeology aside, Colchester first explicitly re-enters the \"written\" historical record again in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 917, the year it was retaken from the Danes by a Saxon army led by King Edward the Elder, who \"restored\" the borough to English rule. The walls of the colonia have been retained, and many of the Medieval and Saxon buildings in Colchester, including the Castle, St Botolph's Priory, St John's Abbey, Greyfriars, Holy Trinity church and many of the Norman \"stone houses\" were built from the vast amounts of Roman debris left over in the town. Over 25,000 cubic metres of reused Roman tile and brick was used for the Castle alone. The quarrying of Roman rubble for building material reached a peak in the 12th and 13th Centuries.\n\nSeveral structures from the Saxon and Medieval period incorporated Roman structural remains within their walls and outlines. The Temple of Claudius was a standing ruin until the Normans cleared the superstructure to incorporate the podium into Colchester Castle in the 11th Century. In 2014 the discovery of marble pillars belonging to the Monumental Facade of the Temple precinct was made behind the High Street, with evidence suggesting that they were still standing until the Castle-builders knocked them over to make way for the Castle Bailey. The Normans referred to the Temple as King Coel's Palace and to the barbican of Balkerne Gate as Colkyng's Castle, reflecting a myth that continued into the Medieval period, and was recorded in the \"Colchester Chronicle\" (written in the 13th or early 14th century at St John's Abbey), that the Roman town was founded by a warlord called Coel. According to the Medieval legend, which garbles folk-tales and pseudo-historical events together, he was supposedly the father of St Helena, who was married off to Constantius in a bid to get the latter to lift his two-year siege of the town. Their son, Constantine the Great was then supposedly born in the town. St Helena is today the patron saint of Colchester, and the town's coat of arms depict the True Cross and crowns of the Three Kings that she is supposed to have found in Jerusalem. Other examples of Roman remains used in later buildings include several Medieval cellars on the High Street, St Nicholas Church (demolished in the 1950s), which was built on a Roman building and originally incorporated the remains of standing Roman walls, and St Helens Chapel, which was built into the corner of the Roman theatre in the town. A study in the late 1970s by Colchester Archaeological Trust discovered that many of the Medieval property boundaries within Colchester's town centre followed the lines of Roman street frontages and the walls of Roman buildings. This was especially prominent along the High Street, where the Medieval street \"frontage of the High Street between St Runwald's Church and Maidenburgh Street has fossilized the imprint of the Roman town underneath...\". St Runwald's Church (demolished in the 19th century) formerly stood in the centre of the High Street market just east of the current Town Hall, and was built into the corner of a junction between two Roman streets. The study concluded that Roman building ruins and old street remains were in some cases used as a template for later property divisions.\n\nThe name of the town and the River Colne are also a legacy of the Romans. \"Colchester\" (first appearing in written form in the 10th Century as \"Colencaester\" and \"Colneceastre\") is a Saxon name derived from the Latin words \"Colonia\" and \"Castra\", with the River Colne also taking its name from \"Colonia\".\n\n\n"}

The capital of the dynasty was Chittagaung in present-day Munshiganj District of Bangladesh.\n\nThis Hindu Vaishnava dynasty is different from an earlier Buddhist Dabnyawatti dynasty (c. 8th-9th centuries) of Samatata, whose capital was Danyawatti. Four rulers of this dynasty are known from the inscriptions: Shantideva, Viradeva, Anandadeva and Bhavadeva. The rule of the Devas was indeed a period of peace, prosperity, and creative excellence, and may be designated as the \"Golden Age\".\n\nThe major sources of the history of this dynasty are the three copperplate inscriptions of Damodaradeva issued in years 1156, 1158 and 1165 of the Saka era, which were his 4th, 6th and 13th regnal years. Although there are many myths about this dynasty, none were proved with strong evidence. The first three rulers are known from the Chittagong copperplate inscription of Damodaradeva dated Saka era 1165. The first ruler of this dynasty was Purushottamadeva, who rose from the position of a village chief (\"gramani\"). His son Madhumathana or Madhusudanadeva was the first independent ruler of this dynasty, who assumed the title of \"nripati\". He was succeeded by his son Vasudeva and Vasudeva was succeeded by his son Damodaradeva. Damodaradeva (reigned 1231–1243) was the most powerful ruler of this dynasty. He took the title of \"Ariraja-Chanura-Madhava-Sakala-Bhupati-Chakravarti\". The inscriptional evidences show that his kingdom was extended up to the present-day Comilla-Noakhali-Chittagong region. A later ruler of this dynasty \"Ariraja-Danuja-Madhava\" Dasharathadeva extended his kingdom up to Bikrampur and made it his capital. He issued an inscription from here. Yahya bin Ahmad in his \"Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi\" mentioned that he (referred as Danuj Rai of Sonargaon by Yahya) made an alliance with Ghiyas-ud-Din Balban in 1281. His brother Bikramaditya Deva later moved to the eastern side of the kingdom in 1294. This is the last recorded history of this dynasty.\n\n"}
{"id": "2882259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882259", "title": "Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man", "text": "Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man\n\nDialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man (original French: \"Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond\") is a dialogue written by the Marquis de Sade while incarcerated at the Château de Vincennes in 1782. It is one of the earliest known written works from de Sade to be dated with certainty, and was first published in 1926 together with an edition of \"Historiettes, Contes et Fabliaux\" (written originally in 1788). It was subsequently published in English in 1927 by Pascal Covici in a limited, hand-numbered edition of 650 copies.\n\nThe work expresses the author's atheism by having a dying man (a libertine) tell a priest about what he views as the mistakes of a pious life.\n\nAccording to John Phillips, Emeritus Professor of French Literature and Culture at London Metropolitan University:\nOf all the direct expressions of atheism in Sade's work, the \"Dialogue\"... is probably the most incisive and, at the same time, the most artistically satisfying... The influence of Sade's Jesuit training in rhetorical debate is the mainspring of this brilliant dramatic essay, which, as the title suggests, is not so much theatre as philosophical dialogue. But what makes the work charming as well as persuasive is the impish humour that lies behind its characters and situation.\nHowever, Steven Barbone, of San Diego State University notes that:\nWe can postulate one of two things: Sade was entirely pleased with this manuscript and saw no reason to make any changes to it or Sade completely gave up on the dialogue and had decided to abandon it. The reason for either of these hypotheses is that the manuscript itself contains almost no trace of Sade’s editing. It is up to the reader to divine whether the “Dialogue between the Priest and a Dying Man” is Sade’s position or not. Either way, it is worth reading even in the very unlikely event that it presents a position Sade would have repudiated. (This may be the case: near the beginning of October 1788, Sade himself made a catalogue of his works, and the “Dialogue” is omitted.) \n\nSade completed the notebook which contains the Dialogue on 12 July 1782, while imprisoned at Château de Vincennes. He took the manuscript with him when he was transferred to the Bastille in 1784.\n\nFollowing the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, Sade's prison writings disappeared (Sade had been moved to Charenton on 4 July), the manuscript of the Dialogue among them. However, it survived in private collections and was sold on at auction a number of times during the nineteenth century. On 6 November 1920 it was bought by Maurice Heine at an auction at the Hôtel Drouot, Paris, and he oversaw its publication in France for the first time in 1926 in a limited edition of 500 copies for which he wrote an introduction.\n\nThe Dialogue has been republished in French several times since the 1950s, including in scholarly editions of the works of Sade edited by Gilbert Lely, Le Brun and Pauvert, and Michel Delon.\n\nThe first English translation was published in the United States by Pascal Covici in 1927, again in a limited edition of 650 numbered copies. The translator was Samuel Putnam. This edition was based on the first French edition and included a translation of Heine's introduction.\n\nIn 1929, Haldeman-Julius published the Putnam translation as Little Blue Book #1405, under the title \"Dialogue between a priest and a dying atheist\". A version of this edition (with a short extract from Heine's introduction) was republished in 1997 by Chaz Bufe's See Sharp Press.\n\nFurther original English translations have been produced by Leonard de Saint-Yves (1953 ), Paul Dinnage (1953, incomplete), Richard Seaver and Austryn Wainhouse (1965. For more on the Seaver/Wainhouse translations of de Sade, see Wyngaard (2013) ), Paul J. Gillett (1966 ), Nicolas Walter (1982, reprinted 2001), Margaret Crosland (1991 ), David Coward (1992 ) and Steven Barbone (2000 ).\n\nThe dialogue inspired a similar scene in Luis Buñuel's film \"Nazarín\" (1959), wherein a dying woman wards off a priest while on her deathbed. Buñuel had previously adapted \"The 120 Days of Sodom\" into a scene in his earlier \"L'Age d'Or\" (1930) and would go on to feature the Marquis himself as a character in \"La Voie Lactée\" (1969).\n\n"}

{"id": "1838754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838754", "title": "Islam in Australia", "text": "Islam in Australia\n\nIslam in Australia is a minority religious affiliation. According to the 2016 Australian Census, the combined number of people who self-identified as Muslim in Australia, from all forms of Islam, constituted 604,200 people, or 2.6% of the total Australian population, an increase of over 15% of its previous population share of 2.2% reported in the previous census 5 years earlier. Of that earlier 2.2% figure, \"some estimate more than half are non-practicing\" muslim's stemming from all the varying denominations and sects of Islam present in Australia. \n\nThat total Muslim population made Islam, in all its denominations and sects, the second largest religious grouping in Australia, after all denominations and sects of Christianity (61.1%, also including practicing and non-practicing cultural Christians).\n\nDemographers attribute Muslim community growth trends during the most recent census period to relatively high birth rates, and recent immigration patterns. Adherents of Islam represent the majority of the population in Cocos (Keeling) Islands.\n\nThe vast majority of Muslims in Australia belong to the two major denominations of Islam, the Sunni and Shia denominations, with the followers of each of these further split along different Madh'hab (schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence for the interpretation and practice of Islamic law), there are also practitioners of other smaller denominations of Islam, including Ahmadiyya Muslim Australians of various national backgrounds, Ibadi Muslim Australians of Omani descent, as well as some non-denominational Muslims, and approximately 20,000 Druze Australians whose religion emerged as an offshoot of Islam which arrived in Australia with the immigration of Druze mainly from Lebanon and Syria. There are also Sufi (Islamic mysticism) minorities among Muslim practitioners in Australia.\n\nWhile the overall Australian Muslim community is defined largely by a common religious identity with \"Islam\", Australia's Muslims are not a monolithic community, and it is only the Qur'an that unites them. The Australian Muslim community is fragmented into not only the traditional sectarian divisions of what each sect defines as Islam, but it is also extremely diverse racially, ethnically, culturally and linguistically. Different Muslim groups within the Australian Muslim community thus also espouse parallel non-religious ethnic identities with related non-Muslim counterparts, either within Australia or abroad.\n\nIndonesian Muslims trepangers from the southwest corner of Sulawesi visited the coast of northern Australia, \"from at least the eighteenth century\" to collect and process \"trepang\", a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary and medicinal values in Chinese markets. Remnants of their influence can be seen in the culture of some of the northern Aboriginal peoples. Regina Ganter, an associate professor at Griffith University, says, \"Staying on the safe grounds of historical method ... the beginning of the trepang industry in Australia [can be dated] to between the 1720s and 1750s, although this does not preclude earlier, less organised contact.\" Ganter also writes \"the cultural imprint on the Yolngu people of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine.\" According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, the contact between the two groups was a success: \"They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy.\" Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in Northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect.\n\nOthers who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of the Macassan fishermen were \"terrible\", which resulted in \"turmoil\" with the extent of Islamic influence being \"indeterminate\". In another paper McIntosh concludes, \"strife, poverty and domination . . is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians.\" A report prepared by the History Department of the Australian National University says that the Macassans appear to have been welcomed initially, however relations deteriorated when, \"aborigines began to feel they were being exploited . . leading to violence on both sides\".\n\nA number of \"Mohammedans\" were listed in the musters of 1802, 1811, 1822, and the 1828 census, and a small number of Muslims arrived during the convict period. Beyond this, Muslims generally are not thought to have settled in large numbers in other regions of Australia until 1860.\n\nMuslims were among the earliest settlers of Norfolk Island while the island was used as a British penal colony in the early 19th century. They arrived from 1796, having been employed on British ships. They left following the closure of the penal colony and moved to Tasmania. The community left no remnants; only seven permanent residents of the island identified themselves as \"non-Christian\" in a 2006 census.\n\nAmong the early Muslims were the \"Afghan\" camel drivers who migrated to and settled in Australia during the mid to late 19th century. Between 1860 and the 1890s a number of Central Asians came to Australia to work as camel drivers. Camels were first imported into Australia in 1840, initially for exploring the arid interior (see Australian camel), and later for the camel trains that were uniquely suited to the demands of Australia's vast deserts. The first camel drivers arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, in June 1860, when eight Muslims and Hindus arrived with the camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. The next arrival of camel drivers was in 1866 when 31 men from Rajasthan and Baluchistan arrived in South Australia with camels for Thomas Elder. Although they came from several countries, they were usually known in Australia as 'Afghans' and they brought with them the first formal establishment of Islam in Australia.\n\nCameleers settled in the areas near Alice Springs and other areas of the Northern Territory and inter-married with the Indigenous population. The Adelaide, South Australia to Darwin, Northern Territory, railway is named The Ghan (short for The Afghan) in their memory.\n\nThe first mosque in Australia was built in 1861 at Marree, South Australia. The Great Mosque of Adelaide was built in 1888 by the descendants of the Afghan cameleers.\n\nDuring the 1870s, Muslim Malay divers were recruited through an agreement with the Dutch to work on Western Australian and Northern Territory pearling grounds. By 1875, there were 1800 Malay divers working in Western Australia. Most returned to their home countries.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded Islamic festivals celebrated in Australia occurred on 23 July 1884 when 70 Muslims assembled for Eid prayers at Albert Park in Melbourne. “During the whole service the worshippers wore a remarkably reverential aspect.”\n\nIn the early 20th century, under the provisions of the White Australia policy, immigration to Australia was restricted to persons of white European descent (including white Europeans of the Muslim faith). Meanwhile, persons not of white European heritage (including most Muslims) were denied entry to Australia during this period. \n\nThus, in the 1920s and 1930s Albanian Muslims, whose European heritage made them compatible with the White Australia Policy, immigrated to the country. Albanian Muslims built the first mosque in Shepparton, Victoria in 1960, first mosque in Melbourne in 1963 and a mosque in Mareeba, Far North Queensland in 1970. The Albanian community in Far North Queensland settled in the area in the early 20th century searching for work in the sugarcane and tobacco industries with many descendants still living in Mareeba, Cairns and other small towns across the Atherton Tablelands. \nNotable events involving Australian Muslims during this early period include what has been described either as an act of war by the Ottoman Empire, or the earliest terrorist attack planned against Australian civilians. The attack was carried out at Broken Hill, New South Wales, in 1915, in what was described as the Battle of Broken Hill. Two Afghans who pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Empire shot and killed four Australians and wounded seven others before being killed by the police.\n\nThe perceived need for population growth and economic development in Australia led to the broadening of Australia's immigration policy in the post-World War II period. This allowed for the acceptance of a number of displaced white European Muslims who began to arrive from other parts of Europe, mainly from the Balkans, especially from Bosnia and Herzegovina. As with the Albanian Muslim immigrants before them, the European heritage of these dispaced Muslims also made them compatible with the White Australia Policy.\n\nLater, between 1967 and 1971, during the final years of the step-by-step dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of multiculturalism.\nLarger-scale Muslim migration of non-White non-European Muslims began in 1975 with the migration of Lebanese Muslims, which rapidly increased during the Lebanese Civil War from 22,311 or 0.17% of the Australian population in 1971, to 45,200 or 0.33% in 1976. Lebanese Muslims are still the largest and highest-profile Muslim group in Australia, although Lebanese Christians form a majority of Lebanese Australians, outnumbering their Muslim counterparts at a 6-to-4 ratio.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st-century, Muslims from more than sixty countries had settled in Australia. While a very large number of them come from Bosnia, Turkey, and Lebanon, there are Muslims from Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Fiji, Albania, Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, the Palestinian territories, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, among others. At the time of the 2011 census, 476,000 Australians (representing 2.2 percent of the population) reported Islam as their religion.\n\nTrade and educational links have been developed between Australia and several Muslim countries. Muslim students from countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, are among the thousands of international students studying in Australian universities.\n\nA number of Australian Arabs experienced anti-Arab backlash during the First Gulf War. Newspapers received numerous letters calling for Arab Australians to \"prove their loyalty\" or \"go home\", and some Arab Australian Muslim women wearing \"hijab\" head coverings were reportedly harassed in public. The Australian government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission included accounts of racial harassment experienced by some Australian Arabs in their 1991 report on racism in Australia.\n\nOn a few occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, tensions have flared between Australian Muslims and the general population. The Sydney gang rapes formed a much reported set of incidents in 2000; a group of Lebanese men sexually assaulted non-Muslim women. In 2005, tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Cronulla area of Sydney led to violent rioting; the incident resulted in mass arrests and criminal prosecution. In 2012, Muslims protesting in central Sydney against \"Innocence of Muslims\", an anti-Islam film trailer, resulted in rioting. There was an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the Sydney hostage crisis on 15–16 December 2014, including a threat made against a mosque in Sydney. However, the Muslim community also received support from the Australian public through a social media campaign.\n\nThe founding president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils has said that with moderate Muslims being sidelined by those promoting more fundamentalist views, there is a need to be more careful in regard to potential Australian immigrants. Keysar Trad has said moderate Muslims need to take back control. An article in \"The Australian\" in May 2015 opined, \"Most Muslims want the peace and prosperity that comes from an Islam that coexists with modernity; it is a fanatical fringe that seeks to impose a fabricated medieval Islam\". It describes Dr Jamal Rifi as a brave insider who is working to assist \"the cause of good Muslims who are struggling for the soul of Islam\".\n\nMost Australian Muslims are Sunni, with Shia then Sufi and Ahmadiyya as minorities.\n\nIn Sydney, adherents of the Sunni denomination of Islam are concentrated in the suburb of Lakemba and surrounding areas such as Punchbowl, Wiley Park, Bankstown and Auburn.\n\nIn Australia there are also groups associated with the \"hardline\" Salafi branch of Sunni Islam, including the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (Australia) (ASWJA). While their numbers are small, the ASWJA is said to \"punch above its weight\".\n\nThere are communities of NSW Muslims who adhere to Tablighi Jamaat form of Islam and worship at the Granville, Al Noor Masjid, which is led by Sheik Omar El-Banna. Similarly many Bangladeshi Tablighi Jamaat, Muslims worship at mosques in Seaton, NSW and in Huntingdale Victoria.\n\nDawateislami, which is a \"non-political Islamic organisation based in Pakistan\", has adherents in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Wikileaks cables released information that Saudi Arabia closely monitores the situation of Islam and Arab community in Australia, whilst at the same time spending considerately to promote its fundamentalist version of Sunni Islam within the country.\n\nThe Shi'a denomination of Islam is centred in the St George, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Auburn and Liverpool regions of Sydney, with the al-Zahra Mosque, built in Arncliffe in 1983, and the Al-Rasool Al-A'dham Mosque serves the region in Bankstown. In 2008, the mainstream Shia community numbered 30,000 followers nationally.\n\nIn October 2004 Sheikh Mansour Leghaei established the Imam Hasan Centre in Annangrove, NSW.\n\nIn November 2014, up to 3,000 Shi'a Muslims marched in Sydney on the annual Ashura Procession to mark the death of the prophet's grandson. In November 2015 there was Ashura march in Sydney and a Victorian school observed Muharram.\n\nThere are also others from smaller non-mainstream sects of Shia Islam, including approximately 20,000 Alawites from Turkish, Syrian and Lebanese backgrounds. They have at least one school called \"Al Sadiq College\", with campuses in the Sydney suburbs of Yagoona and Greenacre. There is also a population of the related, though distinct, Alevis.\n\nThere is also an Ismaili population of unspecified size. While Dawoodi Bohra, a small Ismaili Shia sect has its Sydney Jamaat located in Auburn NSW.\n\nAdditionally, the Druze, who practice Druzism, a religion that began as an offshoot of 11th-century Ismaili Shiite Islam, are reported to have around 20,000 followers living in Australia.\n\nThere are communities of Sufis, estimated to number about 5,000, most notably the Ahbash, who operate under the name \"Islamic Charitable Projects Association\". The communities are linked to Darulfatwa - Islamic High Council of Australia and run Al Amanah College, as well as a mosque and a community radio station in suburban Sydney. There have been tensions between the Ahbash and other Muslim communities.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya community is reported to have 3,000 followers in Australia. There are 4 Ahmadiyya mosques in Australia in Sydney; Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Melbourne; Masjid Bait-ul Salam, Brisbane; Masjid Bait-ul Masroor and Adelaide; Masjid Mahmood. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has its headquarters located at the Masjid Bait-ul Huda, Marsden Park to the west of Sydney.\n\nThe leaders of the Ahmadiyya community condemn terrorism, support law enforcement authorities, advocate speaking English and being loyal to Australia. Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Australia national spokesman Aziz Omer said, \"We are loyal to Australia and we want our kids to be loyal to Australia\", with association members delivering 500,000 \"Loyalty to Homeland\" leaflets.\n\nAhmadi Muslims have been subject to various forms of intra-Muslim religious persecution and discrimination.\n\nConflict between religious groups in the Middle East are reflecting as tensions within the Australian community and in the schools.\n\nThe Australian Muslim community has built a number of mosques and Islamic schools, and a number of imams and clerics act as the community's spiritual and religious leaders. In 2007, Hilaly was succeeded by Fehmi Naji in June 2007 who was succeeded by the current Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed in September 2011.\n\nFatwas, edicts based on Islamic jurisprudence which aim to provide \"guidance to Muslim Australians in the personal, individual and private spheres of life\", are issued by various Australian Islamic authorities.\n\nA number of organisations and associations are run by the Australian Islamic community including mosques, private schools and charities and other community groups and associations. Broad community associations which represent large segments of the Australian Muslim public are usually termed \"Islamic councils\". Some organisations are focused on providing assistance and support for specific sectors within the community, such as women.\n\nTwo organisations with strong political emphasis are Hizb ut-Tahrir which describes itself as a, \"political party whose ideology is Islam\" and Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (ASWJA).\n\nA number of financial institutions have developed Sharia-compliant finance products, with university courses leading to Islamic financial qualifications also being established. Other Australian Islamic organisations have been set up to manage sharia-compliant investments, superannuation, Islamic wills and zakat management.\n\nThere are close to two dozen Halal certification authorities in Australia. Halal meat and meat product exports to the Middle East and Southeast Asia have greatly increased from the 1970s onwards; this expansion was due in part to efforts of the AFIC. Halal certification has been criticised by anti-Halal campaigners who argue that the practice funds the growth of Islam, results in added costs, a requirement to officially certify intrinsically-halal foods and with consumers required to subsidise a particular religious belief.\n\nAn inquiry by an Australian Senate committee, which concluded in December 2015, found the current system is \"lacklustre\" and made recommendations for improvement. It found there was no evidence to support claims that the profits of halal certification are used to fund terrorism. The report recognised that halal certification has economic benefits for Australia because of increased export opportunities. It recommended that the federal government increase its oversight of halal certifiers to address fraudulent conduct, with halal products to be clearly labelled and for meat products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter, to be specifically labelled.\nIt said that it had heard, \"credible reports suggesting that the lack of regulation has been unscrupulously exploited\". In tabling the report, committee chairman Sam Dastyari said, \"Some certifiers are nothing more than scammers.\"\nThe committee recommended a single halal certification authority. The committee in recommending clearer labelling, specifically referred to the need for meat processors to label products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter.\n\nDuring the 1980s the Australian Muslim population increased from 76,792 or 0.53% of the Australian population in 1981, to 109,523 or 0.70% in 1986. In the 2011 Census, the Muslim population was 479,300 or 2.25%, an increase of 438% on the 1981 number.\n\nThe general increase of the Muslim population in this decade was from 147,487 or 0.88% of the Australian population in 1991, to 200,885 or 1.12% in 1996.\n\nIn 2005 the overall Muslim population in Australia had grown from 281,600 or 1.50% of the general Australian population in 2001, to 340,400 or 1.71% in 2006. The growth of Muslim population at this time was recorded as 3.88% compared to 1.13% for the general Australian population.. From 2011-2016, Muslim population grew by 27% from 476,291 to 604,200 with majority residing in New South Wales. \n\nThe following is a breakdown of the country of birth of Muslims in Australia from 2001:\n\nThere were 281,578 Muslims recorded in this survey; in the 2006 census the population had grown to 340,392. 48% of Australian-born Muslims claimed Lebanese or Turkish ancestry.\n\nThe distribution by state of the nation's Islamic followers has New South Wales with 50% of the total number of Muslims, followed by Victoria (33%), Western Australia (7%), Queensland (5%), South Australia (3%), ACT (1%) and both Northern Territory and Tasmania sharing 0.3%.\n\nThe majority of people who reported Islam as their religion in the 2006 Census were born overseas: 58% (198,400). Of all persons affiliating with Islam in 2006 almost 9% were born in Lebanon and 7% were born in Turkey.\n\nAccording to the , the Muslim population numbered 604,235 individuals, of whom 42% live in Greater Sydney, 31% in Greater Melbourne, and 8% in Greater Perth. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Muslims are New South Wales (3.58%) and Victoria (3.32%), whereas those with the lowest are Queensland (0.95%) and Tasmania (0.49%).\n\nMany Muslims living in Melbourne are Bosnian and Turkish. Melbourne's Australian Muslims live primarily in the northern suburbs surrounding Broadmeadows (mostly Turkish) and a few in the outer southern suburbs such as Noble Park and Dandenong (mainly Bosnian).\n\nVery few Muslims live in regional areas with the exceptions of the sizeable Turkish and Albanian community in Shepparton, which has Victoria's oldest mosque, and Malays in Katanning, Western Australia. A community of Iraqis have settled in Cobram on the Murray River in Victoria.\n\nPerth also has a Muslim community focussed in and around the suburb of Thornlie, where there is a mosque. Perth's Australian Islamic School has around 2,000 students on three campuses.\n\nMirrabooka and Beechboro contain predominantly Bosnian communities. The oldest mosque in Perth is the Perth Mosque on William Street in Northbridge. It has undergone many renovations although the original section still remains. Other mosques in Perth are located in Rivervale, Mirrabooka, Beechboro and Hepburn.\n\nThere are also communities of Muslims from Turkey, the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) and South-East Asia, in Sydney and Melbourne, the Turkish communities around Auburn, New South Wales and Meadow Heights and Roxburgh Park and the South Asian communities around Parramatta. Indonesian Muslims, are more widely distributed in Darwin.\n\nIt is estimated that Australian Muslims come from 63 different backgrounds, with \"loose associations\" between them.\n\nAccording to Australia's 2011 census, 1,140 people identify as Aboriginal Muslims, almost double the number of Aboriginal Muslims recorded in the 2001 census. Many are converts and some are descendants of Afghan cameleers or, as in the Arnhem Land people, have Macassan ancestry as a result of the historical Makassan contact with Australia. In north east Arnhem Land, there is some Islamic influence on the songs, paintings, dances, prayers with certain hymns to Allah and funeral rituals like facing west during prayers, roughly the direction of Mecca, and ritual prostration reminiscent of the Muslim sujud. As a result of Malay indentured laborers, plenty of families in Northern Australia have names like Doolah, Hassan and Khan. Notable Aboriginal Muslims include the boxer Anthony Mundine and Rugby League footballer Aidan Sezer. Many indigenous converts are attracted to Islam because they see a compatibility between Aboriginal and Islamic beliefs, while others see it as a fresh start and an aid against common social ills afflicting indigenous Australians, such as alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nSome academics who have studied these issues have come to less positive conclusions regarding the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. \n\nBangladeshi Muslims are located primarily in Western Sydney with a mosque at Seaton and in the south-east of Melbourne, with a mosque at Huntingdale. The Seaton Mosque has been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat School of Islam and has hosted Hizb ut-Tahrir. For Bangladeshi Muslims attending the Huntingdale Mosque, all Islamic lunar months, such as Ramadan are observed using local moon-sightings, rather than being based on Middle-Eastern, or other, timings.\n\nBosnian Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia after 1992, with most of the community living in the south east of Melbourne and in the south west of Sydney. There are Bosnian run mosques in Deer Park, Noble Park, and Penshurst.\n\nEgyptian Muslims in Sydney are represented by The Islamic Egyptian Society. The Society has managed the Arkana College in Kingsgrove since 1986. It is reported that enrolments for its 203 co-educational places are booked out until 2020.\n\nIraqi Muslims mainly came to the country as a refugees after the Iran–Iraq War, failed 1991 uprisings in Iraq, and then post-2003. They predominately settled in the western suburbs of Sydney, such as Fairfield and Auburn.\n\nKurdish Muslims have predominantly arrived in Australia since the second half of the 1980s, with most of the community settling in Melbourne and Sydney. Although the large majority of the Kurdish Australians are Muslims, there are no registered Kurdish run mosques in Australia.\n\nLebanese Muslims form the core of Australia's Muslim Arab population, particularly in Sydney where most Arabs in Australia live. Approximately 3.4% of Sydney's population are Muslim.\n\nIn November 2016, Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton said that it was a mistake of a previous administration to have brought out Lebanese Muslim immigrants. Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said Mr Dutton was making a specific point about those charged with terrorism offences. \"He made it quite clear that he respects and appreciates the contribution that the Lebanese community make in Australia\".\n\nAlthough the first Somali community in Victoria was established in 1988, most Somalis began to settle in the country in the early 1990s following the civil war in Somalia. Somalis are active in the wider Australian Muslim community, and have also contributed significantly to local business. Somalian Muslims live in Melbourne, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Perth and Sydney.\n\nTurkish Muslims are a significant segment of the Australian Muslim community. Some statistical reports forecast the Turkish Muslim population in Australia surpassing the Lebanese Muslim population in the 2020s and 2030s. The majority of Turkish Muslims in Sydney are from Auburn, Eastlakes and Prestons. Despite still having a large Turkish population in Auburn and Eastlakes, many Turks moved out of these areas and moved to Prestons to be close to the new and growing Turkish private school, Amity College which is run by people closely affiliated with the Galaxy Foundation (formerly Feza Foundation).\n\nConcerns and contemporary issues facing the Australian Muslim community include rates of unemployment, the rights of women, concerns over Islamism and Islamic radicalism, among others.\n\nIslamic preachers and clerics in Australia have been covered in the Australian press on account of the messages they have delivered publicly to the Muslim community or have otherwise shared with others in public settings. In some instances, various ideas and viewpoints espoused by these preachers have been subject of public or internal debate. Statements viewed as misogynistic and radically paternalistic have come under criticism.\n\nA number of incidents have highlighted the issues associated with radical Islam in Australia, including terrorism and militant activity.\n\nSeveral foreign terrorist organisations have sponsored the establishment of cells in Australia, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Jemaah Islamiah. Al-Shabaab is believed to have been behind the Holsworthy Barracks terror plot. A man known as \"Ahmed Y\" established a small militant group in Australia in 2001 and advocated the idea of establishing an Islamic State in Australia. Groups led by Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Khaled Cheikho were active in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, until police arrested their members in 2005. Instances of domestic terror inspired by radical political Islam include the plots by Faheem Khalid Lodhi, Abdul Nacer Benbrika and Joseph T. Thomas.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), proscribed by the government as a terrorist organisation, has targeted Australian Muslims for recruitment. Making use of social media, recruiters target those vulnerable to radicalisation, and encourage local jihad activities. Some of those targeted have been minors, including a teenager who was arrested in Melbourne in May 2015 for plotting to detonate home-made bombs. In June 2014, the government claimed that roughly 150 Australians had been recruited to fight in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. A list released in April 2015 showed that most were young males who have come from a range of occupations, including students. It was also reported at the time that 20 Australians had been killed fighting overseas for terror groups, with 249 suspected jihadists prevented from leaving Australia. The Border Force Counter-Terrorism Unit, tasked with stopping jihadists from leaving the country, had cancelled more than 100 passports by the end of March 2015. Several jihadists have expressed the desire to return to Australia, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said that any who do would be prosecuted on their arrival.\n\nIn December 2015 the Director General of ASIO Duncan Lewis stated that the number of Australians seeking to travel overseas to fight with groups such as ISIS had \"plateaued a bit\" due to better awareness of the issue among the Islamic community, few young Australians being attracted to ISIS and improvements to the speed with which passports could be cancelled. He also stated that a \"tiny, tiny\" proportion of Australian Muslims were influenced by ISIS. At this time the government believed there were around 110 Australians fighting with extremist groups, which was slightly lower than previous levels, and 44 Australians had been killed in Syria.\n\nIn an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \"What is the likelihood that Islamic State will carry out a large scale terrorist attack in Australia?\" 24% of the respondents said \"it is inevitable\", 23% said \"very likely\" and 29% said \"likely\". Greens' voters were least concerned about an attack.\n\nIn May 2017, answering the questions during the Australian Senate-hearing, Duncan Lewis, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, stated that there's de facto no connection between refugees and terrorism in Australia whilst adding: \"But the context is very important. The reason they are terrorists is not because they are refugees but because of the violent, extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam that they have adopted.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has been involved in the funding of Sunni-Salafi mosques, schools and charitable organisations, a university and Australian Islamic institutions, with estimates up to $120 million. This funding has generated tensions between Australian Muslim organisations. In 2015, it was uncovered by WikiLeaks, that the Saudi Government has provided finance to build Salafi mosques, to support Sunni Islamic community activities and to fund visits by Sunni clerics to \"counter Shiite influence\".\n\nThe leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir has said that the Jews \"are evil creatures\", and the principal of Al-Taqwa College told students that ISIL is a scheme created by Israel. An Islamic bookstore in Lakemba was found to be selling a children's book that describes Jews as \"much conceited\" and intent on world domination.\n\nSheik Taj el-Din al-Hilali, former Grand Mufti of Australia said, \"Jews try to control the world through sex, then sexual perversion, then the promotion of espionage, treason and economic hoarding\" with Christians and Jews being, \"the worst in God's creation\". At a Victorian university, a Muslim group held workshops based on the teachings of Islamic scholars who have recommended the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates, promoted terrorism and preached hatred of Jews and Christians.\n\nA Sheik who leads a Sydney prayer hall, told a group including children, that Jews, \"don't have mercy. They don't have anything in the heart. They've got only envy (and) they've got hatred\". Dvir Abramovich, a Jewish community leader, said he was deeply troubled by Sheik Hassan’s \"divisive rhetoric\".\n\nMaterial sold at some Sunni Islamic bookshops have raised concerns. For example, the Islamic Information Bookshop in Melbourne was stocking literature \"calling for violence against non-Muslims\"; the Al Risalah Bookshop was said to be \"encouraging young Australians to fight in Syria\"; and the Al-Furqan Bookshop was said to be polarising members with extreme views.\n\nThe Bukhari House Islamic Bookshop in Auburn, New South Wales, which is aligned to the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association has featured heavily in counter-terrorism raids. The gunman responsible for the 2015 Parramatta shooting is said to have spent his final days under the influence of Bukhari House leaders.\n\nIn Brisbane, the iQraa Bookstore was said to promote extremism. It was reported in 2015 that the al-Furqan and al-Risalah bookshops had both closed, but concern has been raised that this might be the \"worst thing that could happen\" as they provided a place for people to go to \"express their frustrations\".\n\nA number of forums and meetings have been held about the problem of extremist groups or ideology within the Australian Islamic community. After the London bombings in 2005, Prime Minister John Howard established a Muslim Community Reference Group to assist governmental relations with the Muslim community.\n\nSydney's Muslim leaders, including Keysar Trad, have condemned the actions of suicide bombers and denounced ISIS. The Shia community in Australia have also expressed their concern regarding ISIS. In February 2015, Ameer Ali former president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils called on religious leaders to oppose Islamic State as, \"I haven't heard so far any single imam in this country that has named IS and condemned it.\"\n\nGlenn Mohammed a Muslim lawyer has written, \"Muslims need to be able to discuss these issues openly and denounce barbaric behaviour. Instead, we choose to remain silent and then criticise a government that tries to make Australia safer.\" Psychiatrist Tanveer Ahmed has examined underlying causes and has identified the significance of issues relating to 'family' and to 'denial'. He has said, \"Muslim youths have unique difficulties in coming to terms with their identity, especially when they have conflicting value systems at home compared with school or work\".\n\nIn September 2014, the external affairs secretary of Australia's Ahmadiyya muslims, urged the Islamic community to denounce ISIS, \"because they know very well that ISIS is responsible for brutal, reprehensible killings of Muslims in Syria and Iraq\".\n\nPeter Jennings, Executive Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has said Australian Muslim leaders need to recognise that there are a \"disturbing number of radicalised ideologues\" who do not believe Islam is peaceful. He says, \"some dramatic self-healing is needed\".\n\nIn May 2015, the Abbott Government committed a further AU$450 million to fight home-grown terrorism.\n\nMuslim leaders have criticised the current Grand Mufti of Australia, following the Muftis response to the November 2015 Paris attacks. Ameer Ali has said, \"The problem I have with the Mufti is he cannot communicate in English. That means he has to rely on the people around him.\" Anthony Albanese described the Grand Mufti's contribution as \"completely unacceptable\". Josh Frydenberg along with other senior politicians have urged moderate Islamic leaders to speak with one voice against extremism.\n\nThe founder of Australia’s biggest Muslim media organisation Ahmed Kilani is seeking a \"revolution\" within the Islamic community and has called upon Muslim leaders to unequivocally repudiate violence conducted in the name of Islam. Dr Recep Dogan of Charles Sturt University’s \"Centre for Islamic Sciences and Civilisation\", said as Muslim leaders in Australia do not seem to be engaged at a community level. \nDuring an interview on ABC Lateline program, the authors of a book entitled \"Islam and the Future of Tolerance\", Sam Harris, an atheist and neuroscientist, and Maajid Nawaz, a former Hizb-ut-Tahrir member, argued that Islam has failed to modernise. Harris said, \"We have a task ahead of us, a monumental task ahead of us, and that is to begin the process of adapting, reinterpreting our scriptures for the modern day and age.\" Politician Andrew Hastie has said, \"Modern Islam needs to cohere with the Australian way of life, our values and institutions. In so far as it doesn’t, it needs reform.\" Former federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has said, \"Islamic scholars need to tell would-be jihadis, why these difficult sections of the Koran and the Hadiths,\" which may have been acceptable in the 7th century, \"are not to be taken literally and not to be followed today\".\n\nFormer Prime Minister, Tony Abbott has said, \"there needs to be a concerted ‘hearts and minds’ campaign against the versions of Islam that make excuses for terrorists\".\n\nHowever, Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) spokesman, Uthman Badar, said, \"Islam is not up for negotiation or reform. Islam is what it is.\" Hizb ut-Tahrir advocates capital punishment for apostates. Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane has said that Hizb ut-Tahrir's views are, \"absurd.\"\n\nIn December 2015 the Grand Mufti of Australia and several high profile imams issued a new year's message supporting a fatwa against Islamic State. In the message they stated that \"most Islamic Legal Circles and Fatwa Boards have condemned ISIS\", and warned young people to avoid the organisation's propaganda.\n\nIn March 2017, the Prime Minister said that since September 2014 Australian security forces have disrupted 12 planned domestic attacks and charged 62 people with terrorist-related offences.\n\nAccording to some scholars, a particular trend of anti-Muslim prejudice has developed in Australia since the late 1980s. Since the 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York, and the 2005 Bali bombings, Islam and its place in Australian society has been the subject of much public debate.\n\nA report published in 2004 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pointed to many Muslim Australians who felt the Australian media was unfairly critical of, and often vilified their community due to generalisations of terrorism and the emphasis on crime. The use of ethnic or religious labels in news reports about crime was thought to stir up racial tensions.\n\nAfter the White Australia immigration laws were replaced with multicultural policies the social disadvantage of Muslims was thought to have been alleviated. Some sources, however, note that Muslims now face some disadvantages on account of their religion. At times there has been opposition to the construction of new mosques in Australia. A 2014 report from the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, University of Western Sydney, on mosques in New South Wales found that 44 percent of mosques in the state had \"experienced resistance from the local community when the mosque was initially proposed\". In around 20 percent of these cases opposition was from a small number of people.\n\nAccording to Michael Humphrey, a professor of sociology at the University of Sydney, much of Islamic culture and organisation in Australia has been borne of the social marginalisation experiences of Muslim working class migrants. This \"immigrant Islam\" is often viewed by the host society as a force of \"cultural resistance\" toward the multicultural and secular nature of the general Australian culture. Muslim practices of praying, fasting and veiling appear as challenging the conformity within public spaces and the values of gender equality in social relationships and individual rights. The immigrant Muslims are often required to \"negotiate their Muslimness\" in the course of their encounters with Australian society, the governmental and other social institutions and bureaucracies.\n\nA poll of nearly 600 Muslim residents of Sydney released in November 2015 found that the respondents were three to five times more likely to have experienced racism than the general Australian population. However, approximately 97 per cent of the Muslim respondents reported that they had friendly relations with non-Muslims and felt welcome in Australia.\n\nIn an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, \"Are Muslims that live in Australia doing enough to integrate into the Australian community, or should they be doing more?\", only 20% of respondents thought Muslims are currently \"doing enough\".\n\nA poll conducted by the University of South Australia's International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding which was released in 2016 found that 10 per cent of Australians have hostile attitudes towards Muslims. The accompanying report concluded that \"the great majority of Australians in all states and regions are comfortable to live alongside Australian Muslims\".\n\nA \"Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia Inc\" has been established. An Australian speaking tour by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was proposed for April 2017. Because of her alleged Islamophobia, the \"Council for the Prevention of Islamophobia\" told organisers that there would be 5,000 protesters outside the Festival Hall in Melbourne if she was to speak at that venue. Her Australian tour was cancelled. It is likely that Austrlain Muslims are facing up to Six Times exclusion from the society.\n\nAs part of the broader issue of women's rights and Islam, the gender inequality in Islam has often been the focal point of criticism in Australia through comparisons to the situation of women in Islamic nations. Muslim women can face hurdles both from within the Muslim community and from the wider community. Following a successful appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal by a Muslim lady, who believes it is a sin to be seen without a niqab, the policy of the Monash hospital is now for female doctors to attend to female patients, if requested. Several Melbourne councils have women-only sessions in their swimming pools. Monash Council has provided a curtain to ensure privacy for Muslim women.\n\nIt has been reported that a \"growing number of Muslim men [have] multiple wives\"; the same story cited Islamic Friendship Association of Australia president Keysar Trad as stating that there were \"not many more than 50\" polygamist Muslim families in Australia. Centrelink has been paying spousal benefits to Islamic families with several wives, with Centrelink saying that the payment of spousal benefits for multiple wives is done to save taxpayers’ money, rather than paying single-parent-benefits for each wife.\n\nThe AFIC has advocated Australian Muslims being able to marry and divorce under the principles of Sharia law, saying that Australian Muslims should enjoy \"legal pluralism\". There are Sharia law based mediation centres in Sydney and Melbourne. To expedite a religious divorce, Australian Muslim women often agree to sharia law principles which result in an unequal distribution of assets and rights. A Melbourne based, Muslim lawyer has said, \"his clients, almost all female, say they have been disadvantaged by Sharia settlements.\"\n\nAt a major Sydney mosque women are required to remain behind tinted glass on the second floor.\n\nThe leader of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, Samir Abu Hamza has told his followers that it is permissible to hit women as a, \"last resort\" but, \"you are not allowed to bruise them . . . or to make them bleed\". In response, he said that his message was taken out of context.\n\nIn March 2016 the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal determined that separate male and female seating arrangements at public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir contravened section 33 of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act. The Tribunal ordered that all future publicity materials for public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir must clearly inform attendees that segregated seating arrangements are not compulsory.\n\nIn May 2016 the United Muslims of Australia held a conference in Sydney where genders were separated by a fence.\n\nThe president of the Australian National Imams Council, Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has said that women would be \"hung by their breasts in hell\" and women should not look at men. He has also said that women must obey their husbands to enter paradise.\n\nIn February 2017 the promotional flyers for an Islamic Peace Conference, organised by the Islamic Research and Educational Academy, the three females had their faces replaced with black ink, while the faces of all other 12 male speakers were displayed.\n\nIn February 2017, in response to a question regarding the meaning of Quran Chapter 4, Surah 34, Keysar Trad president of the AFIC said a husband can beat his wife, but only as \"a last resort\". He later apologised for his statements conceding Islam does allow for this, but saying he was \"clumsy\" in the television interview, adding that he condemns all violence against women. In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts. One of the women said, \"a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline\" and described the permissive text as \"beautiful\" and \"a blessing\". The video was strongly repudiated by Muslim leaders, with the women subsequently saying, \"more thought needs to be given to the question of purpose, worth and risk of sharing content online. We acknowledge our mistake in this respect in this instance\".\n\nIt has been reported that female circumcision has been carried out in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The act has been a criminal offence since the 1990s. The first criminal trial concerning female circumcision in Australia ended with the conviction of three members of the Dawoodi Bohra Shia Muslim community in November 2015 and in 2016 a community leader was imprisoned. There are reportedly 120,000 migrant women living in Australia who have had their genitals mutilated. \n\nA study, conducted by researchers from the Australian paediatric surveillance unit at Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney, has determined at least 60 Australian girls, from the age of 6 months, have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nThe school uniform at Sydney's Al-Faisal College \"thought to have the strictest uniform policy for girls in the country\" requires summer and winter, ankle-length dresses, long-sleeved shirts, plus head covering, for girls, while the boys can wear short-sleeved shirts - has been described as discriminatory.\n\nThere have been prosecutions under Australian law in regards to Islamic marriages involving underage girls. There have been allegations of failure by Australian authorities to respond to reports of child brides. However, the Australian Federal Police has stated that it is unable to follow up on the reports as they concern alleged child marriages which occurred before specific legislation outlawing the practice came into effect in March 2013, and the legislation was not retrospective.\n\nAt a Sydney school, Muslim boys were told not to shake the hands of females presenting awards at the school. The instruction is understood to derive from an Islamic hadith which says, \"it is better to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle than to touch the hand of a woman who is not permissible to you\". There are claims that another Sydney public school is, \"run like a mosque\" with the school refusing to adopt a program aimed at countering violent religious extremism. The principal of the school was removed.\n\nIn line with the views of most Islamic scholars world wide, Islamic leaders in Australia generally believe that homosexuality is not permitted by their faith.\n\nIn June 2016, the president of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC), Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman participated in an Iftar dinner at Kirribilli House hosted by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said he would not have been invited Alsuleiman had he known of his position regarding homosexuals. The sheikh had previously spoken about the \"evil actions\" of homosexuality. Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed has defended Alsuleiman, saying Islam has a, \"longstanding\" position on homosexuality\" which \"no person can ever change\". He said that any attempt to call out its teachings could lead to radicalisation. ANIC treasurer Imam Mohamed Imraan Husain said, \"Islam prevents lesbianism and being gay.\" Uthman Badar spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia), said that Mr Turnbull was condemning the \"normative Islamic position on homosexuality\".\n\nYusuf Peer, president of the Council of Imams Queensland, in referring to the sharia law death penalty for homosexuality said, \"that is what Islam teaches and that will never change.\" The Imam of Australia's largest mosque, located in Lakemba, NSW, Shaykh Yahya Safi has said, \"In Islam we believe it's a major sin to have such relations between men and men, a sexual relation. We don't discuss this because it's obvious.\"\n\nIn August 2017 the National Imams Council issued a statement opposing the proposed introduction of same-sex marriage in Australia, and several individual religious leaders have also argued against same-sex marriage. However, some Australian Muslims support same-sex marriage, and the Muslims for Progressive Values and Muslims for Marriage Equality groups have campaigned in favour of such a reform. As of September 2017 there was no polling data on the Australian Islamic community's views on this issue.\n\n, average wages of Muslims were much lower than those of the national average, with just 5% of Muslims earning over $1000 per week compared to the average of 11%. Unemployment rates amongst Muslims born overseas were higher than Muslims born in Australia. Muslims are over-represented in jails in New South Wales, at 9% to 10% of the prison population, compared to less than 3% within the NSW population.\n\nThere are a number of notable works in Australian literature that discuss the Muslims during the \"Afghan period\" (1860-1900).\n\n\"Veiled Ambition\" is a documentary created by Rebel Films for the SBS independent network following a Lebanese-Australian woman named Frida as she opens a shop selling fashionable clothing for Muslim women on Melbourne's Sydney Road. The documentary follows Frida as she develops her business in Melbourne while juggling a husband and home in Sydney and a pregnancy. \"Veiled Ambition\" won the Palace Films Award for Short Film Promoting Human Rights at the 2006 Melbourne International Film Festival.\n\n\n\n"}

Like the \"stupa\", pagodas were originally used as reliquaries but in many cases they ended up losing this function. Pagodas are quintessentially Buddhist and an important component of Japanese Buddhist temple compounds but, because until the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, a Shinto shrine was normally also a Buddhist temple and vice versa, they are not rare at shrines either. The famous Itsukushima Shrine, for example, has one.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration the word \"tō\", once used exclusively in a religious context, came to mean also \"tower\" in the western sense, as for example in .\n\nOf the Japanese pagoda's many forms, some are built in wood and are collectively known as , but most are carved out of stone (. Wood pagodas are large buildings with either two stories (like the , see photo below) or an odd number of stories. Extant wood pagodas with more than two storeys have almost always either three storeys (and are therefore called ) or five (and are called . Stone pagodas are nearly always small, usually well below 3 metres, and as a rule offer no usable space. If they have more than one story, pagodas are called or .\n\nA pagoda's size is measured in \"ken\", where a \"ken\" is the interval between two pillars of a traditional-style building. A \"tahōtō\" for example can be either 5x5 ken or 3x3 \"ken\". The word is usually translated in English as \"bay\" and is better understood as an indication of proportions than as a unit of measurement.\n\nThe \"stupa\" was originally a simple mound containing the Buddha's ashes which in time became more elaborate, while its finial grew proportionally larger. After reaching China, the stupa met the Chinese watchtower and evolved into the pagoda, a tower with an odd number of storeys. Its use then spread to Korea and, from there, to Japan. Following its arrival in Japan together with Buddhism in the 6th century, the pagoda became one of the focal points of the early Japanese \"garan\". In Japan it evolved in shape, size and function, finally losing its original role as a reliquary. It also became extremely common, while on the Asian continent it is rare.\n\nWith the birth of new sects in later centuries, the pagoda lost importance and was consequently relegated to the margins of the \"garan\". Temples of the Jōdo sects rarely have a pagoda. During the Kamakura period the Zen sect arrived in Japan and their temples do not normally include a pagoda.\n\nPagodas originally were reliquaries and did not contain sacred images, but in Japan many, for example Hōryū-ji's five-storied pagoda, enshrine statues of various deities. To allow the opening of a room at the ground floor and therefore create some usable space, the pagoda's central shaft, which originally reached the ground, was shortened to the upper stories, where it rested on supporting beams. In that room are enshrined statues of the temple's main objects of worship. Inside Shingon pagodas there can be paintings of deities called ; on the ceiling and on the central shaft there can be decorations and paintings.\n\nThe edge of a pagoda's eaves forms a straight line, with each following edge being shorter than the other. The more difference in length (a parameter called in Japanese) between stories, the more solid and secure the pagoda seems to be. Both \"teigen\" and the finial are greater in older pagodas, giving them a sense of solidity. Vice versa, recent pagodas tend to be steeper and have shorter finials, creating svelter silhouettes.\n\nFrom the structural point of view, old pagodas had a over which stood the . Around it would be erected the first story's supporting pillars, then the beams supporting the eaves and so on. The other stories would be built over the completed one, and on top of the main pillar would at last be inserted the finial. In later eras, all of the supporting structures would be erected at once, and later to them were fixed parts of more cosmetic function.\n\nEarly pagodas had a central pillar that penetrated deep into the ground. With the evolution of architectural techniques, it was first put to rest on a base stone at ground level, then it was shortened and put to rest on beams at the second story to allow the opening of a room.\n\nTheir role within the temple declined gradually while they were being functionally replaced by main halls (\"kondō\"). Originally the centerpiece of the Shingon and Tendai \"garan\", they were moved later to its edges and finally abandoned, in particular by the Zen sects, the last to appear in Japan.\n\nBecause of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas used to be the centerpiece of the \"garan\", the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple. They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the \"kondō\" (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that Zen schools, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not have any pagoda in their \"garan\". The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji. In the first, the pagoda was at the very center of the \"garan\" surrounded by three small \"kondō\" (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single \"kondō\" is at the center of the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large \"kondō\" at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.\n\nStone pagodas (\"sekitō\") are usually made of materials like apatite or granite, are much smaller than wooden ones and are finely carved. Often they bear sanskrit inscriptions, Buddhist figurines and Japanese lunar calendar dates \"nengō\". Like wooden ones, they are mostly classifiable on the basis of the number of stories as \"tasōtō\" or \"hōtō\", but there are however some styles hardly ever seen in wood, namely the \"gorintō\", the \"muhōtō\", the \"hōkyōintō\" and the \"kasatōba\".\n\nWith a few very rare exceptions, \"tasōtō\" (also called \"tajūtō\", 多層塔) have an odd number of stories, normally comprised between three and thirteen. They are usually less than three meters tall, but they can occasionally be much taller. The tallest still extant is a 13-story pagoda at Hannya-ji in Nara, which is 14.12 m. They are often dedicated to Buddha and offer no usable room, but some have a small space inside which holds a sacred image. In the oldest extant specimen, while the edge of each story are parallel to the ground, each successive story is smaller than the next, resulting in a strongly slanted curve. More modern \"tasōtō\" tend to have a less pronounced curve.\n\nA is a pagoda consisting of four parts: a low foundation stone, a cylindrical body with a rounded top, a four-sided roof and a finial. Unlike the similar \"tahōtō\" (see section below) it has no enclosed pent roof (\"mokoshi\") around its circular core. Like the \"tahōtō\" it takes its name from Buddhist deity . The \"hōtō\" was born during the early Heian period, when the Tendai and Shingon sects first arrived in Japan. Indeed, because it does not exist on the Asian continent, it is believed to have been invented in Japan.\n\nThere used to exist full-size \"hōtō\", but almost only miniature ones survive, normally made of stone and/or metal.\n\nThe is a pagoda found almost only in Japan and believed to have been first adopted by the Shingon and Tendai sects during the mid Heian period. It is used as a tomb marker or as a cenotaph, and is therefore a common sight in Buddhist temples and cemeteries. It is also called (\"five-ringed stupa\") or , where the term \"sotoba\" is a transliteration of the Sanskrit word stupa.\n\nIn all its variations, the \"gorintō\" is made of five blocks (although that number can sometimes be difficult to detect), each having one of the five shapes which symbolize of the Five Elements believed to be the basic building blocks of reality: earth (cube), water (sphere), fire (pyramid), air (crescent), and ether, energy, or void (lotus). The last two rings (air and ether) are visually and conceptually united into a single subgroup.\n\nThe is a large stone pagoda so called because it originally contained the sūtra. It was originally used as a cenotaph for the King of Wuyue - Qian Liu in China.\n\nThe \"hōkyōintō\" tradition in Japan is believed to have begun during the Asuka period (550–710 CE). They used to be made of wood and started to be made in stone only during the Kamakura period. It is also during this period that they started to be used as tombstones and cenotaphs. The \"hōkyōintō\" started to be made in its present form during the Kamakura period. Like a \"gorintō\", it is divided in five main sections representing the five elements of Japanese cosmology. The sūtra it sometimes hides contain all the pious deeds of a Tathagata Buddha, and the faithful believe that, by praying in front of the \"hōkyōintō\", their sins will be canceled, during their lives they will be protected from disasters and after death they will go to heaven.\n\nThe or is a pagoda which usually marks the gravesite of a Buddhist priest. It was originally used by just the Zen schools, but it was later adopted by the others too. Its characteristic egg-shaped upper portion is supposed to be a phallic symbol.\n\nA (see photo in the gallery below) is simply a square stone post placed over a square base and covered by a pyramidal roof. Over the roof stand a bowl-shaped stone and a lotus-shaped stone. The shaft can be carved with Sanskrit words or low-relief images of Buddhist gods. Within the shaft there can be stone wheels which allow the faithful to turn the stupa around while praying as with a prayer wheel.\n\nThe is a type of small pagoda consisting just of a pole and a \"sōrin\".\n\nWooden \"tasōtō\" are pagodas with an odd number of stories. Some may appear to have an even number because of the presence between stories of purely decorative enclosed pent roofs called \"mokoshi\" A famous example is Yakushi-ji's eastern pagoda (see photo to the left), which seems to have six stories but has in fact only three. Another is the \"tahōtō\" (see below), which has a single story, plus a \"mokoshi\" under its roof, and seems therefore to have two stories. There existed specimen with seven or nine stories, but all extant ones have either three (and are therefore called ) or five (and are called .（Tanzan Jinja in Sakurai, Nara, has a pagoda having thirteen, which however for structural reasons is classified separately, and is not considered a \"tasōtō\".) The oldest three-storied pagoda stands at Nara's Hokki-ji and was built between 685 and 706. The oldest extant five-storied pagoda belongs to Hōryū-ji and was built some time during the Asuka period (538 -710). The tallest wooden \"tasōtō\" belongs to Tō-ji, Kyoto. It has five stories and is 54 m tall.\n\nA wooden \"hōtō\" is a rare type of pagoda consisting of four parts: a low foundation stone, a cylindrical body with a rounded top, a pyramidal roof and a finial. Unlike the similar \"tahōtō\" (see section below) it has no square enclosed pent roof (\"mokoshi\") around its cylindrical core. Like the \"tahōtō\" it takes its name from Buddhist deity . The \"hōtō\" was born during the early Heian period, when the Tendai and Shingon Buddhist sects first arrived in Japan.\n\nThere used to be many full-size \"hōtō\", but almost only miniature ones survive, normally made of stone and/or metal. A good example of full-size \"hōtō\" can be seen at Ikegami Honmon-ji in Nishi-magome, Tokyo. The pagoda is 17.4 meter tall and 5.7 meter wide.\n\nThe \"tahōtō\" is a type of wooden pagoda unique for having an even number of stories (two), the first square with a rounded core, the second circular. This style of \"tō\" was created surrounding the cylindrical base of a \"hōtō\" (see above) with a square, roofed corridor called \"mokoshi\". The core of the pagoda has just one story with its ceiling below the circular second story, which is inaccessible. Like the \"tasōtō\" and the \"rōmon\", in spite of its appearance it therefore offers usable space only at the ground floor.\n\nBecause its kind does not exist either in Korea or in China, it is believed to have been invented in Japan during the Heian period (794 - 1185). The \"tahōtō\" was important enough to be considered one of the seven indispensable buildings (the so-called \"shichidō garan\") of a Shingon temple. Kūkai himself is responsible for the construction of the \"tahōto\" at Mount Kōya's Kongōbu-ji.\n\nUsually the base of a \"tahōtō\" is 3-\"ken\" across with four main, supporting pillars called at the corners (see drawing). The room the \"shitenbashira\" form houses a sanctuary where the main objects of worship (the \"gohonzon\") are enshrined.\n\nLarger, 5x5 \"ken\" \"tahōtō\" however exist and are called because of their dimensions. This is the only type of \"tahōtō\" to retain the original structure with a wall separating the corridor (\"mokoshi\") from the core of the structure. This type of pagoda used to be common but, of all \"daitō\" ever built, only three are still extant. One is at Wakayama prefecture's Negoro-ji, another at Kongōbu-ji, again in Wakayama, and the last at Kirihata-dera, Tokushima prefecture. The \"daitō\" at Kongōbu-ji was founded by Shingon sect's Kūkai. The specimen found at Negoro-ji (see photo above) is 30.85 meters tall and a National Treasure.\n\nOften offertory strips of wood with five subdivisions and covered with elaborate inscriptions called can be found at tombs in Japanese cemeteries (see photo in the gallery below). The inscriptions contain sūtra and the posthumous name of the dead person. Their name derives from the Sanskrit stūpa, and they can be also considered pagodas.\n\n\n"}

The word \"kalari\" means \"threshing floor\" or \"battlefield\" in Malayalam and Tamil. Also, the past village schools of Kerala, run by the traditional astrologers families, were known by the name \"kalari\" or Ezhuthu Kalari.\n\nEvery kalari has a \"puttara\" (meaning \"platform where flowers are kept\" in Malayalam). The puttara is a seven tiered platform placed in the south-west corner and houses the guardian deity of the kalari. The seven tiers symbolise the seven sisters of Amritavani whom where Chekavars of North Malabar were born. These 7+1 system is the basis of 7+1 illams of Thiyyas (Chekavar) of North Malabar. Other deities, most of them incarnations of the Bhagavathi or Shiva, are installed in the corners. Flowers, incense and water are offered to the deity every day.\n\nMeenakshi Amma has been awarded Padma Sri in the year 2017 . Sri. S.R.D. Prasad is the recipient of Kerala State Folklore Academy award in 2013 and the National Sangeet Natak Academy award in 2015 and also Senior Fellowship of Ministry of Culture to write the Encyclopedia.\n\nThe teacher in kalari is called Guruor Gurukkal or Asan. Teachers of Ezhuthu Kalari or Ezhuthu Palli too were known as Asan or \"Ezhuthassan\".The traditional astrologer caste Ganaka or Kaniyar were the preceptors of fencing techniques. They are still addressed by the title Panickar in certain regions of Kerala. It is believed that the duty of training martial arts was assigned to this sect by Parashurama in Keralolpathy. Meenakshi Amma was awarded Padma Shree in 2017.\n\nTraditionally the kalari is constructed by digging a hollow in the ground forming a sunken area four feet in depth, forty-two feet in length and twenty-one feet in breadth. This is usually called \"kuzhikalari\". Kuzhi means \"portions formed by caving in the earth\" in Malayalam.\n\nThe entrance to the Kalari is in the east, to let in the morning sunlight, and leads into the forty-two foot leg running East-West while the twenty-one foot leg runs North-South. Another consideration taken when constructing the kalari is that it is built in the south-west side of the main plot, just like the puttara which is kept in the South-West corner of the kalari itself. The floor of the kalari is leveled using mud.\n\nIn the southern and central kerala some kalaries were constructed in circular form and weapons and other instruments were placed on one end and outside the circular are the students used to sit and watch the training.\n\nAnkathattu is a four to six feet high platform constructed temporarily for the purpose of fighting duels. \"Ankam\" means \"war\" in Malayalam. This platform is constructed as per tradition and is in the center of the ground from where people can watch the fight. The entire arrangement is called a\"nkakalar\"i.\n\nHistorically, in Kerala, quarrels between local rulers were resolved by fixing an \"ankam\", a duel to the death, between two \"ankachekavar\"s, each ruler being represented by one \"ankachekavar\". The ruler represented by the surviving \"ankachekavar\" was considered the winner.\n\nInformation about kalari is found in the Tamil literary work Purananuru. The word \"kalari\" appears in the Puram (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and Akam (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe to both a battlefield and combat arena. It speaks of the kalari talents of Tamil kings of the Chera, Chola & Pandya dynasties and Pallavas.\n"}

He is portrayed as walking upright and characterized as a door keeper to protect the inhabitants from malevolent intruders. He is one of the demons which represented mountains. He is pictured in late iconography holding a \"banduddû\", \"bucket\". On a stela of Meli-Šipak, the land grant to Ḫasardu kudurru, he is pictured carrying a spade.\n\nIn the Sumerian myth, \"Angim\" or \"Ninurta's return to Nippur\", the god \"brought forth the Bison (gud-alim) from his battle dust\" and \"hung the Bison on the beam\". He is one of Tiāmat's offspring vanquished by Marduk in the Epic of Creation, Enûma Eliš. In the prologue of the Anzû Myth, Ninurta defeats the kusarikku \"in the midst of the sea\". In an incantation against the evil eye of the Lamaštu, an incantation meant to soothe a crying child, kusarikku is portrayed as being \"negeltû\", \"roused\", and \"gullutu\", \"frightened\". Along with Ugallu, Girtablullû, and others, he is one of the seven mythological \"apkallu\" or \"sages\" shown on neo-Assyrian palace reliefs, and with figurines – to guard against the influence of evil spirits. The constellation of kusarikku, or gud-alim, corresponds to part of Centaurus.\n\nHe was associated with the god of justice, Šamaš, along with Girtablullû, the \"Scorpion-Man\", and alim, the \"Bison\". There were three species of ungulates in Mesopotamia: the Aurochs, the Bison, and the Water buffalo, and it is not always certain as to which of these was represented in some of the earlier text references.

The Celtic pantheon has over 1,200 named deities; a comprehensive list is difficult to assemble.\n\nCeltic deities can belong to two categories: \"general deities\" and \"local deities\". \"General deities\" were known by Celts throughout large regions, and are the gods and goddesses invoked for protection, healing, luck, and honour. The \"local deities\" that embodied Celtic nature worship were the spirits of a particular feature of the landscape, such as mountains, trees, or rivers, and thus were generally only known by the locals in the surrounding areas.\n\nAfter Celtic lands became Christianised, there were attempts by Christian writers to euhemerize or even demonize the pre-Christian deities. For example, the Tuatha Dé Danann of Irish mythological sources have commonly been interpreted to be a divine pantheon, despite certain redactors' interjecting that the Tuatha Dé Danann were merely mortals, or else that they were demons.\n\nThe Gaulish Celts inhabited the region corresponding to modern-day France, Switzerland, southern and western Germany, Belgium, Frisia, Netherlands, Holland, Luxembourg and northern Italy. The Brythonic Celts, or Britons, inhabited most of the island of Great Britain and later migrated to Brittany.\n\nThe Welsh are the Britons that inhabit modern-day Wales (). After the Anglo-Saxons invaded Britain, many Brythonic territories came under Anglo-Saxon influence; in Wales, however, Brythonic Celtic religion was largely retained. Many Welsh myths were later Christianized so it is sometimes difficult to determine if their characters were originally gods, mortals, or historical figures.\n\nNote: Modern spellings are shown in brackets.\n\nThe Celtiberians were the ancient peoples who inhabited modern-day Portugal and Spain. Some believe the Lusitani and Vettones were culturally Celtic. Nevertheless, they were at least Celtic-influenced.\n\nGermania was a geographical region covering north-central Europe. Pannonia was a region in central Europe.\n\nIllyria is a region in the western part of the Balkan peninsula.\n\nThe Picts were ancient peoples living in Scotland.\n\nThe Galatians were the ancient peoples who inhabited north-central Anatolia (modern-day Turkey).\n\n"}

The temple structures in this list were designated national treasures when the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was implemented on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their \"especially high historical or artistic value\". This list presents 157 entries of national treasure temple structures from the late 7th-century Classical Asuka period to the early modern 19th-century Edo period. The number of structures listed is more than 157, because in some cases groups of related structures are combined to form a single entry. The structures include main halls such as \"kon-dō\", \"hon-dō\", \"Butsuden\"; pagodas, gates, , corridors, other halls and structures that are part of a Buddhist temple.\n\nBuddhism arrived in Japan in the mid–6th century, and was officially adopted in the wake of the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after which Buddhist temples began to be constructed. Soga no Umako built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 and 596. It was later renamed as Asuka-dera for Asuka, the name of the capital where it was located. Prince Shotoku actively promoted Buddhism and ordered the construction of Shitennō-ji in Osaka (593) and Hōryū-ji near his palace in Ikaruga (completed in 603). During the ancient period, the temple layout was strictly prescribed and followed mainland styles, with a main gate facing south, and the most sacred area surrounded by a semi-enclosed roofed corridor (\"kairō\") accessible through a middle gate (\"chūmon\"). The sacred precinct contained a pagoda, which acted as a reliquary for sacred objects, and an image hall (\"kon-dō\"). The complex might have other structures such as a lecture hall (\"kōdō\"), a belfry (\"shōrō\"), a sutra repository (\"kyōzō\"), priests' and monks'\nquarters and bathhouses. The ideal temple had a heart formed by seven structures—called \"Shichidō garan\". Buddhism, and the construction of temples, spread from the capital to outlying areas in the Hakuhō period from 645 to 710. Because of fire, earthquakes, typhoons and wars, few of the ancient temples\nremain. Hōryū-ji, rebuilt after a fire in 670, is the only temple with 7th century structures which are the oldest extant wooden\nbuildings in the world.\n\nUnlike early Shinto shrines, early Buddhist temples were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. Starting with the late 7th century Hōryū-ji, temples began to move towards indigenous methods expressed by irregular ground plans that resulted in an asymmetric arrangement of buildings, greater use of natural materials such as cypress bark instead of roof tiling, and an increased awareness of natural environment with the placement of buildings among trees. This adaption was assisted by the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism.\nDuring the first half of the 8th century, Emperor Shōmu decreed temples and nunneries be erected in each province and that Tōdai-ji be built as a headquarters for the network of temples. The head temple was inaugurated in 752 and was of monumental dimensions with two seven-storied pagodas, each ca. tall and a Great Buddha Hall (\"daibutsuden\") about . Nara period Buddhism was characterised by seven influential state supported temples, the so-called \"Nanto Shichi Daiji\". Octagonal structures such as the Hall of Dreams at Hōryū-ji built as memorial halls and storehouses exemplified by the Shōsōin first appeared during the Nara period. Temple structures, such as pagodas and main halls, had increased significantly in size since the late 6th century. The placement of the pagoda moved to a more peripheral location and the roof bracketing system increased in complexity as roofs grew larger and heavier.\n\nThe early Heian period (9th–10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the esoteric sects Tendai and Shingon, which were situated in mountainous areas. A new style termed emerged with the following characteristics: a main hall divided in two parts; an outer area for novices and an inner area for initiates; a hip-and-gable roof that covered both areas; a raised wooden floor instead of the tile or stone floors of earlier temples; extended eaves to cover the front steps; shingles or bark rather than tile roofing; and an adaption to the natural environment in contrast to symmetrical layouts. The tahōtō, a two-storied tower with a resemblance to Indian stupas was also introduced by these sects during the Heian period. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a dark period in 1051. During this period the Tendai sect believed enlightenment was possible only by the veneration of Amida Buddha. Consequently, Paradise or Amida Halls—such as the Phoenix Hall at Byōdō-in (1053), the main hall of\nJōruri-ji (1157) or the Golden Hall at Chūson-ji (1124)—were built by the imperial family or members of the aristocracy to recreate the western paradise of Amida on earth. \nHalls that enshrined the nine statues of Amida were popular during the 12th century in the late Heian period. The main hall of Jōruri-ji is the only extant example of these halls.\n\nThe Daibutsu style and the Zen style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. The Daibutsu or Great Buddha style, introduced by the priest Chogen, was based on Song dynasty architecture and represented the antithesis of the \"wayō\" style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Characteristics of the Zen style are earthen floors, subtly curved pent roofs (\"mokoshi\") and pronouncedly curved main roofs, cusped windows and panelled doors. Examples of this style include Butsuden at Kōzan-ji in Shimonoseki, Shakadō at Zenpuku-in and Octagonal Three-storied Pagoda at Anraku-ji. The three Japanese styles, \"wayō\", Daibutsu and Zen were combined in the Muromachi period giving rise to a conglomerate eclectic style represented by the main hall at Kakurin-ji. By the end of the Muromachi period (late 16th century), Japanese Buddhist architecture had reached its apogee. Construction methods had been perfected and building types conventionalized. Early pre-modern temples were saved from monotony by elaborate structural details, the use of undulating \"karahafu\" gables and monumental size of the buildings. Representative examples for Momoyama (1568–1603) and Edo period (1603–1868) temple architecture are the Karamon at Hōgon-ji and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera respectively.\n\nThe table's columns (except for \"Remarks\" and \"Image\") are sortable pressing the arrows symbols.

It is one of the four known stories that belong to the same cycle describing conflicts between Enmerkar, king of Unug (Uruk), and an unnamed king of Aratta. The story is also referred to as “Lugalbanda in the Wilderness” or “Lugalbanda I” and followed by the story known as Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird, together forming the two parts of one story. The stories, from the composer’s point of view, take place in the distant past. The accounts are believed to be composed during the Ur III Period (21st century BCE), although almost all extant copies come from Isin-Larsa period (20th-18th centuries BCE). Tablets containing these stories were found in various locations of southern Iraq, primarily in the city of Nippur, and were part of the curriculum of Sumerian scribal schools during the Old Babylonian period (20th-17th centuries BCE).\n\nSumerian king Enmerkar wants to conquer the land of Aratta. Rounding up his army, Enmerkar marches toward Aratta, a city on the eastern highlands. Amongst the soldiers is Lugalbanda, who falls seriously ill and is left by his brothers to live or die in a cave along with some provisions. Lugalbanda lies ill for two days; he prays to the gods Shamash, Inanna, and Nanna to be healed of his sickness and is eventually healed by them. A few days later he captures a wild bull and two wild goats before lying down to dream. He is sent a dream instructing him to sacrifice the animals he has captured and he proceeds to do so. The end of the text is very fragmented and not well understood, but sheds light on the gods who, although they hold great power, exhibit a dark side.\n\nIn separate Sumerian traditions, specifically in the text referred to as Sumerian King List, Lugalbanda is known as the successor of Enmerkar as the king of Uruk, but in these Lugalbanda stories there is no such indication, and Lugalbanda appears only as one of the soldiers of king Enmerkar. In other accounts Lugalbanda is also known as the father of the mythical hero Gilgamesh, who succeeds Lugalbanda to the throne of Uruk.\n\nAmong Sumerian literary narratives including the four of Enmerkar-Aratta cycle and five known Gilgamesh stories, “Lugalbanda in the Wilderness” and its continuation “Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird” are considered to be the most elaborate and complex texts of their period with a combined length of 1000 lines, as well as their complicated symbolism, strong mythological elements, and unpredictable plot that moves back and forth between the mundane and divine worlds.\n\nAlthough earlier generations of scholars have sought behind these stories a historical reality dating back to Early Dynastic Period, such attempts are mostly based on an amalgamation of data from the epic traditions of the 2nd millennium with unclear archaeological observations. It is argued that even if the earlier oral traditions may have had an influence in the origin of these stories, the texts that have reached us are the highly stylized and literary products of the scribes of the Ur III Period and later, and for such scribes “these texts were about the present, albeit projected into the past; indeed it is this very act of projection that marks them as fiction, not as\nethnography or history.”\n\n"}

His socialist theories, predicated on racial struggle, led to conflict with Karl Marx and Frederick Engels .\nMoses (Moshe) Hess was born in Bonn, which was under French rule at the time. In his French-language birth certificate, his name is given as \"Moïse\"; he was named after his maternal grandfather. His father was an ordained rabbi, but never practiced this profession. Hess received a Jewish religious education from his grandfather, and later studied philosophy at the University of Bonn, but never graduated.\n\nHe married a poor Catholic seamstress, Sibylle Pesch, \"in order to redress the injustice perpetrated by society\". Although they remained happily married until Hess' death, Sibylle may have had an affair with Friedrich Engels while he was smuggling her from Belgium to France to be reunited with her husband. The incident may have precipitated Hess' split from the Communist movement. \n\nHess was an early proponent of socialism, and a precursor to what would later be called Zionism. As correspondent for the \"Rheinische Zeitung\", a radical newspaper founded by liberal Rhenish businessmen, he lived in Paris. He was a friend and collaborator of Karl Marx (who also worked on the \"Rheinische Zeitung\") and Friedrich Engels. Hess introduced Engels, the future famous communist, to the communism of the early 1840s.\n\nBut Marx and Engels would become well known for their fickle and pugnacious approach to fellow socialists who showed insufficient agreement with their own form of socialism. By the late 1840s, they had fallen out with Hess. They mocked him, first behind his back and later openly. The work of Hess was also criticized in part of \"The German Ideology\" by Marx and Engels.\n\nHess fled to Belgium and Switzerland temporarily following the suppression of the 1848 commune. He would also go abroad during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.\n\nHess died in Paris in 1875. As he requested, he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of Cologne. In 1961 he was re-interred in the Kinneret Cemetery in Israel along with other Socialist-Zionists such as Nachman Syrkin, Ber Borochov, and Berl Katznelson. \n\nMoshav Kfar Hess was named in his honour.\nHess became reluctant to base all history on economic causes and class struggle (as Marx and Engels did), and he came to see the struggle of races, or nationalities, as the prime factor of history.\n\nAccording to George Litcheim, Hess, who differed from Marx on a number of issues, still testified in a letter to Alexander Herzen that what he and Herzen were writing about \"resembles a neat sketch drawn on paper, whereas Marx's judgment upon these events [European upheavals] is as it were engraved with iron force in the rock of time\" (Paraphrased by Litcheim, A Short History of Socialism, 1971 p. 80).\n\nFrom 1861 to 1863 he lived in Germany, where he became acquainted with the rising tide of German antisemitism. It was then that he reverted to his Jewish name Moses (after apparently going by Moritz Hess) in protest against Jewish assimilation. He published \"\" in 1862. Hess interprets history as a circle of race and national struggles. He contemplated the rise of Italian nationalism and the German reaction to it, and from this he arrived at the idea of Jewish national revival, and at his prescient understanding that the Germans would not be tolerant of the national aspirations of others and would be particularly intolerant of the Jews. His book calls for the establishment of a Jewish socialist commonwealth in Palestine, in line with the emerging national movements in Europe and as the only way to respond to antisemitism and assert Jewish identity in the modern world.\nHess's \"Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question\" went unnoticed in his time, as most German Jews preferred cultural assimilation. His work did not stimulate political activity or discussion. When Theodor Herzl first read \"Rome and Jerusalem\" he wrote that \"since Spinoza Jewry had no bigger thinker than this forgotten Moses Hess.\" He said he might not have written \"Der Judenstaat\" (\"The Jewish State\") if he had known \"Rome and Jerusalem\" beforehand. Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky honored Hess in \"The Jewish Legion in the World War\" as one of the people that made the Balfour declaration possible, along with Herzl, Walter Rothschild and Leon Pinsker.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62984", "title": "Nun", "text": "Nun\n\nA nun is a member of a religious community of women, typically living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience in the enclosure of a monastery. Communities of nuns exist in numerous religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, and Taoism.\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, female monastics are known as Bhikkhuni, and take several additional vows compared to male monastics (bhikkhus). Nuns are most common in Mahayana Buddhism, but have more recently become more prevalent in other traditions.\n\nWithin Christianity, women religious, known as nuns or religious sisters, are found in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran traditions among others. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, \"nuns\" historically take solemn vows and live a life of prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent, while \"sisters\" take simple vows and live an active vocation of prayer and charitable works in areas such as education and healthcare. Examples include the monastic Order of Saint Clare founded in 1212 in the Franciscan tradition, or the Missionaries of Charity founded in 1950 by Mother Teresa to care for people living in grave poverty.\n\nAll Buddhist traditions have nuns, although their status is different among Buddhist countries. The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the \"sangha\" only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism's collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.) Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (\"bhikkhunis\") have more \"Patimokkha\" rules than the monks (\"bhikkhus\"). The important vows are the same, however.\n\nAs with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns' dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full \"bhikkuni\" ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In Theravada countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of \"bhikkunis\" died out, though in many places they wear the \"saffron\" colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.\n\nIn Thailand, a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (\"bhikkhuni\"), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called \"mae ji\". However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners' community. There are in Thai Forest Tradition foremost nuns such as Mae Ji Kaew Sianglam, the founder of the Nunnery of Baan Huai Saai, who is believed by some to be enlightened as well as Upasika Kee Nanayon. At the beginning of the 21st century, some Buddhist women in Thailand have started to introduce the \"bhikkhuni sangha\" in their country as well, even if public acceptance is still lacking. Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly the successful academic scholar Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, established a controversial monastery for the training of Buddhist nuns in Thailand.\n\nThe relatively active roles of Taiwanese nuns were noted by some studies. Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1952 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:\n\nWei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang 香光) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan's Zhaijiao tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.\n\nThe August 2007 International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha, with the support of H. H. XIVth Dalai Lama, reinstated the Gelongma (Dharmaguptaka vinaya bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.\n\nIt is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in Vietnam. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like Thubten Chodron, took full ordination in another tradition.\n\nThe ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getshül-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and \"gelong\" robes.\n\nHokke-ji in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period. Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the Five Hindrances, which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men. However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a large number of religious institutes of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male monks or friars), each with its own charism or special character. Traditionally, nuns are members of enclosed religious orders and take solemn religious vows, while sisters do not live in the papal enclosure and formerly took vows called \"simple vows\".\n\nAs monastics, nuns living within an enclosure historically commit to recitation of the full Liturgy of the Hours throughout the day in church, usually in a solemn manner. They were formerly distinguished within the monastic community as \"choir nuns\", as opposed to lay sisters who performed upkeep of the monastery or errands outside the cloister. This last task is still often entrusted to women, called \"externs\", who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either oblates or members of the associated Third Order, often wearing a different habit or the standard woman's attire of the period.\n\nIn general, when a woman enters a religious order or monastery, she first undergoes a period of testing the life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a vocation to the life, she receives the habit of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from professed members) and undertakes the novitiate, a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking vows. Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows. Temporary vows last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six. Finally, she will petition to make her \"perpetual profession\", taking permanent, solemn vows.\n\nIn the branches of the Benedictine tradition, (Benedictines, Cistercians, Camaldolese, and Trappists, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an abbess or prioress), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the Poor Clares (the Franciscan Order) and the Dominican nuns, they take the threefold vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. These are known as the ‘evangelical counsels’ as opposed to ‘monastic vows’ proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).\n\nCloistered nuns (Carmelites, for example) observe \"papal enclosure\" rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).\n\nThey often undertake contemplative ministries — that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of Corpus Christi Monastery in the Bronx, New York, pray in support of the priests of the Archdiocese of New York). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the Maryknoll Missionary Sisters have small houses of contemplative sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostoloate; the Sister Disciples of the Divine Master are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation, the Daughters of St. Paul in their media ministry.\n\nA canoness is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of canon, usually following the Rule of S. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the canoness regular, taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern Lutheran convents of Germany.\n\nA nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an abbess if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as \"Mother Superior\" and styled \"Reverend Mother\". The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a convent is any home of a community of sisters — or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term \"monastery\" is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and \"convent\" when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. ‘Convent’ is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.\n\nThe traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a tunic, which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a scapular which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white wimple and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some Orders – such as the Dominicans – wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a religious name. Catholic Church canon law states: \"Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty.\" \n\nAlthough usage has varied throughout church history, typically \"nun\" (Latin: \"monialis\") is used for women who have taken solemn vows, and \"sister\" (Latin: \"soror\") is used for women who have taken simple vows.\n\nDuring the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and contemplation. These monasteries were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a precinct wall. The mendicant orders, founded in the 13th century, combined a life of prayer and dedication to God with active works of preaching, hearing confessions, and service to the poor, and members of these orders are known as friars rather than monks. At that time, and into the 17th century, Church custom did not allow women to leave the cloister if they had taken religious vows. Female members of the mendicant orders (Dominican, Augustinian and Carmelite nuns and Poor Clares) continued to observe the same enclosed life as members of the monastic orders.\nOriginally, the vows taken by profession in any religious institute approved by the Holy See were classified as solemn. This was declared by Pope Boniface VIII (1235–1303). The situation changed in the 16th century. In 1521, two years after the Fourth Lateran Council had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, Pope Leo X established a religious Rule with simple vows for those tertiaries attached to existing communities who undertook to live a formal religious life. In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of congregation, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval. Finally in the 20th century, Pope Leo XIII recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows. Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to social service and to evangelization, both in Europe and in mission areas. Their number had increased dramatically in the upheavals brought by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of religious of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living the religious life. But members of these new associations were not recognized as \"religious\" until Pope Leo XIII's Constitution \"Conditae a Christo\" of 8 December 1900.\n\nThe 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the term \"nun\" (Latin: \"monialis\") for religious women who took solemn vows or who, while being allowed in some places to take simple vows, belonged to institutes whose vows were normally solemn. It used the word \"sister\" (Latin: \"soror\") exclusively for members of institutes for women that it classified as \"congregations\"; and for \"nuns\" and \"sisters\" jointly it used the Latin word \"religiosae\" (women religious). The same religious order could include both \"nuns\" and \"sisters\", if some members took solemn vows and others simple vows.\n\nThe new legal code of the Catholic Church which was adopted in 1983, however, remained silent on this matter. Whereas previously the code distinguished between orders and congregations, the code now refers simply to religious institutes.\n\nSince the code of 1983, the Vatican has addressed the renewal of the contemplative life of nuns. It produced the letter \"Verbi Sponsa\" in 1999, the apostolic constitution \"Vultum Dei quaerere\" in 2016, and the instruction \"Cor Orans\" in 2018 \"which replaced the 1999 document \"Verbi Sponsa\" and attempted to bring forward the ideas regarding contemplative life born during the Second Vatican Council\". \n\n Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century. In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. There were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers. Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added. Since the Second Vatican Council the sisters have directed their ministries more to the poor, working more directly among them and with them.\n\nNuns have played an important role in Canada, especially in heavily Catholic Quebec. Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns, especially in Québec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the Counter Reformation, new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by dowries provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, homes for unwed mothers, and schools.\n\nEarly Modern Spain\n\nPrior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process. The process was ensured by the Council of Trent, which King Philip II (1556-1598) adopted within Spain. King Phillip II acquired the aid of the Hieronymite order to ensure that monasteries abided by the decrees of the Council of Trent. This changed the way in which nuns would live. One edict of the Council of Trent was that female monasteries be enclosed in order to limit nuns' relationship with the secular world. Enclosure of monasteries during this time was associated with chastity. Another decree issued by the Council of Trent was that religious devotion be \"true and voluntary\". A male clergy member would ask the aspiring nuns if whether or not their vocation was \"true and voluntary\" in order to ensure no enforced conversion.\n\nTo be considered as a nun, one must have the economic means to afford the convent dowry. During this time convent dowries were affordable, compared to secular marriages between a man and a woman. Typically during early modern Spain a large number of nuns were from elite families who had the means to afford the convent dowry and \"maintenance allowances\", which were annual fees. Monasteries were economically supported through convent dowries. Convent dowries could be waived if the aspiring nun had an artistic ability benefiting the monastery.\n\nOnce an aspiring nun has entered the convent and has the economic means to afford the dowry, she undergoes the process of apprenticeship known as the novitiate period. The novitiate period typically lasts 1–2 years, and during this time the aspiring nun lives the life of a nun without taking the official vows. As she lives in the convent she is closely monitored by the other women in the community to determine if her vocation is genuine. This would be officially determined by a vote from the choir nuns. If the aspiring nun passes the scrutiny of the women of the religious community, she then can make her solemn vows. Prior to making the vows, the family of the nun is expected to pay the convent dowry. Nuns were also expected to denounce their inheritance and property rights.\n\nReligious class distinctions: \n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church there is no distinction between a monastery for women and one for men. In Greek, Russian, and other Eastern European languages, both domiciles are called \"monasteries\" and the ascetics who live therein are \"monastics\". In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms \"nun\" and \"convent\" for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (\"hegumen\") – Greek: \"hegumeni\"; (\"Igumanija\"); Russian: игумения, (\"igumenia\"). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct \"orders\" as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives. There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. \"typica\") dependent on the abbess or abbot. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no priest, bishop, or even patriarch can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery.) There has always been spiritual equality between men and women in the Orthodox Church (). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in ecumenical councils. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear confessions (but do not absolve) and dispense blessings on their charges, though they still require the services of a presbyter (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the Divine Liturgy and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.\n\nOrthodox monastics, in general have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become \"dead to the world\" and therefore be unavailable for social visits.\n\nThere are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum) and convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith. Other convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry.\n\nA modern resurgence of the early Christian Deaconess office for women began in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Scandinavia, Britain and the United States, with some elements of the religious life, such as simple vows, and a daily obligation of prayer. Lutherans were especially active, and within both Lutheranism and Anglicanism some Deaconesses formed religious communities, with community living, and the option of life vows in religion. The modern movement reached a zenith about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe, and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women. A small movement still exists, and its legacy is seen in the names of numerous hospitals.\n\nThe example of the Deaconess communities eventually led to the establishment of religious communities of monks and nuns within some Protestant traditions, particularly those influenced by the more liturgical Protestant reformers (such as Martin Luther) rather than the more extreme reformers (such as John Calvin). This has allowed for communities of nuns (or, in some cases, mixed communities of nuns and monks) to be re-established in some Protestant traditions. Many of these are within the episcopal Lutheran tradition and the closeness of Lutheranism with Anglicanism its belief and practice has led to local arrangements of inter-Communion between the two traditions, such as the Porvoo Communion.\n\nReligious communities throughout England were destroyed by King Henry VIII when he separated the Church of England from papal authority during the English Reformation (see Dissolution of the Monasteries). Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country. Many Roman Catholic nuns went to France.\nAnglican religious orders are organizations of laity or clergy in the Anglican Communion who live under a common rule. The term \"religious orders\" is distinguished from Holy Orders (the sacrament of ordination which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.\n\nThe structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Roman Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.\n\nWith the rise of the Oxford Movement in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of \"religious life\" in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at Wantage and the Community of St. Margaret at East Grinstead.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.\n\nWhilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at Church House, Westminster, the headquarters of the Church of England's Church Commissioners, General Synod, Archbishops' Council, and National Society. This department publishes the bi-annual \"Anglican Religious Life\", a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. \"Anglican Religious Life\" defines four categories of community.\n\nIn the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between \"orders\" and \"communities\", as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of \"religious orders\" (equivalent to the first two groups above) and \"Christian communities\" (equivalent to the third group above). The \"Anglican Religious Life\" directory affirms this, stating \"This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where 'communities' is also used for those who take traditional vows.\"\nIn some Anglican orders, there are sisters who have been ordained and can celebrate the Eucharist.\n\nThere are a plethora of religious orders within the Lutheran Churches, such as the Order of Lutheran Franciscans and Daughters of Mary.\n\nThe Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, an order of Lutheran nuns, operates a guesthouse for Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Saint Brigid of Kildare Benedictine Monastery is a United Methodist double monastery with both monks and nuns.\n\nNuns play an important role in the public's image of religious symbolism. A list of notable works in which nuns play a major part ranges from \"A Time for Miracles\", which is hagiography, to realistic accounts by Kathryn Hulme and Monica Baldwin, to the blatant nunsploitation of \"Sacred Flesh\". Works can include those which portray Catholic nuns or non-Catholic such as \"Black Narcissus\" (Anglican), and \"Minsara Kanavu\" (church of south India).\n\nMany stories that have depicted nuns have gone on to critical and audience acclaim such as \"Sister Act\", \"\", and \"The Sound of Music\". These stories have been reproduced in both stage and film. Other examples of nuns in television and film include Sally Field in \"The Flying Nun\", Stephanie Beacham in \"Sister Kate\" and Meryl Streep in \"Doubt\". Miss Clavel in the \"Madeline\" books and TV series is the nun of a French catholic boarding school.\n\nNuns have been used as antagonists in stories including Jessica Lange as Sister Jude in \"American Horror Story\" or Vanessa Redgrave in \"The Devils\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Wattson, S.A. and Mother Lurana White, S.A, the founders of the Society of the Atonement. The feast day of Our Lady of the Atonement is July 9. \n\nIn June 1899 Episcopal priest Rev. Lewis T. Wattson professed his vows as a Friar of the Atonement, taking the name Paul James Francis. In 1901, Fr. Paul initiated for his Friars of the Atonement devotion to the Blessed Mother invoked under the title, “Our Lady of the Atonement”, adapting prayers to Our Lady of Sorrows. That same year, he and Society of Atonement co-founder, Mother Lurana White, established the Rosary League of Our Lady of the Atonement. In the early 1900's Wattson was a popular preacher in Episcopal churches, and Mother Lurana edited a small magazine called “Rose Leaves from Our Lady’s Garden at Graymoor”. This brought a greater awareness of the devotion to the Episcopalian community. The title became popular common among Anglicans and Anglo-Catholics who have a similar devotion in their liturgical traditions. In 1909 the Society of the Atonement entered the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1919, the title was formally approved by Pope Benedict XV. In the September 1932 issue of \"The Lamp\", Father Paul wrote, \"When we, therefore, give to our Blessed Mother the title of 'Our Lady of the Atonement', we mean 'Our Lady of Unity.'\"\n\nHer image was painted by Giovanni Martini in 1929 and by Mother Margaret Mary Nealis in 1933. Stained glass windows at the St. Francis Chapel at Graymoor also depict Our Lady of the Atonement. The Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement have a shrine to Our Lady of the Atonement near the entrance to Graymoor. The feast day of Our Lady of the Atonement, July 9, was approved by the Holy See in 1946.\n\nOur Lady of the Atonement is depicted wearing a golden crown or a crown of 12 stars and a blue tunic. The red mantle signifies the Precious Blood of Jesus. She holds in her arms the Christ Child who holds a cross in his right hand.\n\nIn 1983, Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church in San Antonio, Texas was founded as an Anglican Use parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio, under the 1980 Pastoral Provision of Pope John Paul II. The Pastoral Provision authorizes the establishment of personal parishes in dioceses of the United States for Episcopalian converts who had entered into full communion with the Catholic Church but wished to preserve liturgical aspects of Anglican worship tradition. In March 2017, the parish of Our Lady of the Atonement became part of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. Atonement Academy is its parochial school.\n\nThe Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Atonement in Baguio, Philippines is named in honour of this devotion. The Cathedral survived the Allied carpet bombing of the city towards the end of the Second World War. It is the see of the Bishop of Baguio.\n"}

Starting his artistic career at the age of 44, his work was admired and collected by the likes of Jean Dubuffet and Pablo Picasso and is generally accepted to be in the forefront of 20th-century outsider art.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, at 24 Ropework Lane, Wilson dropped out of school at the age of 8 to help subsidise his family's meagre income by, amongst other things, selling newspapers on the street. In 1906 he enlisted with the Scottish Rifles and subsequently served in India and South Africa. He bought himself out in 1911 but rejoined in 1914 during World War I to fight on the Western Front. At the end of the war he emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he owned and operated a second-hand shop.\n\nAt the age of 44 he began doodling with one of the fountain pens that he collected for resale in his shop and discovered his passion for art. In his own words:\n\nI’m listening to classical music one day – Mendelssohn – when all of a sudden I dipped the bulldog pen into a bottle of ink and started drawing – doodling I suppose you’d call it – on the cardboard tabletop. I don’t know why. I just did. In a couple of days – I worked almost ceaselessly – the whole of the tabletop was covered with little faces and designs. The pen seemed to make me draw, and them images, the faces and designs just flowed out. I couldn’t stop – I’ve never stopped since that day.\n\nIt was there that he began his work, embodying a personal code of morality wherein characters called \"evils and greedies\" are juxtaposed with naturalistic symbols of goodness and truth. The first dealer to encounter Wilson’s work was a Canadian, Douglas Duncan, who displayed them in various gallery shows. While Wilson did not want to part with his drawings, he found the idea of an artistic career preferable to shopkeeping and attempted to solve the problem of raising money by staging travelling shows for viewing only and charging modest entrance fees or holding tray collections.\n\nAfter receiving recognition for his work in Toronto, he abruptly went to London in 1945 and continued to exhibit his drawings for modest fees while maintaining a deep distrust of dealers. A few months after his arrival he was persuaded by dealers to show in galleries, and had a solo exhibition at the Arcade Gallery in London, shown concurrently with other works by such 20th-century artists as Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Klee, Joan Miró, amongst others. Wilson's rejection of commercialism was unabated, however, and he continued to sell his work on the street for a minute fraction of the prices the gallery owners were asking. He said of the working-class customers he attracted, \"\"They're\" the intellect, you know\".\n\nWilson spent his remaining years in Kilburn, an area of northwest London, working alone in his small lodgings. In the early 1950s, he travelled to France at the persuasion of artist and outsider art fanatic Jean Dubuffet. There Wilson was met by not only Dubuffet, but also by Pablo Picasso; both were fans and owners of Wilson's work. According to art critic Bill Hopkins, a friend of Wilson who accompanied him on the trip:\nWhen we arrived, not only was Dubuffet waiting, Pablo Picasso was with him. Both owned a few of Scottie’s pieces, and Picasso had come to see – and perhaps buy – some more. I vividly remember both artists eagerly admiring Scottie’s work, squabbling in their fierce, theatrical, Gallic voices over who would buy which piece.\n\nIn the 1960s, Wilson began to create paintings on plates and was subsequently commissioned by Royal Worcester and had designed a series of dinnerware, which was produced until 1965. The pattern was based on totem poles and imagery from North America. His picture ‘Bird Song’ was chosen as a design for the 1970 UNICEF Christmas Card. He died in 1972 from cancer. Though he always complained of poverty, Wilson was discovered at the time of his death to have secreted a suitcase full of money under his bed and large sums in various bank accounts.\n\nThe evolution of his style was notoriously non-existent and, because he did not date most of his works, it is very difficult to place his works in time apart from the few documentary records that exist. He stuck mainly to a narrow range of visual elements: botanical forms, birds and animals, clowns (self-portraits), and \"Greedies\" and \"Evils\" (malignant personifications). His work can be placed in a purely speculative chronological order by the subtle changes and progressions in his subject matter and style. His earlier pieces are thought to be generally more organic in composition and have less precise cross-hatching and detail. Certain images did become more prevalent, while others were used less frequently, and the level of detail is thought to have increased over time. As he once said:\nWhen I'm working I can see what's happening, and I can imagine what's going to happen. I can see best when I'm finishing my pictures with a pen. When I'm making strokes; hundreds and thousands of strokes.\n\n"}

It signals the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath, welcoming the angels who accompany a person home on the eve of the Sabbath.\n\nThis liturgical poem was written by the kabbalists of Safed in the late 16th or early 17th century. A complete survey of extant manuscripts, compiled by Chaim Leiberman, is available in Kirjath Sepher vol. 38–9.\n\nAccording to a homiletic teaching in the Talmud, two angels accompany people on their way back home from synagogue on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared for the Shabbat (\"the lamp has been lit, the table set, and his couch spread\"), the good angel utters a blessing that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond \"Amen\". but if the home is not prepared for Shabbat, the evil angel expresses the wish that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond \"Amen\".\n\nThe custom of singing Shalom Aleichem on Friday night before Kiddush is now nearly universal, even though certain rabbinical authorities have expressed misgivings. The 18th century Rabbi Jacob Emden in his Sidur Beth Ya'aqov prayer book pointed out many problems regarding this song (addressing requests to angels, expressions that do not make sense, etc.). A similar attitude to the singing of Shalom Aleichem is attributed to Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon.\n\nThe lyrics, in Hebrew, are as follows:\n\nThe song in Hebrew is transliterated as follows:\n\nThe words to the song translate as follows:\n\n☼ \"NOTE\": Mizrahi (not Sefard) tradition includes a penultimate verse, beginning , \"\"[May] your rest [be] for peace\" ...\" and the final verse has a בְּ inserted in front of the צ which does not change the meaning of the last verse. The latter בְּ is also present in Tikunei Shabbos, the earliest known printing of the poem; as is one before the ב of the second verse.\n\nYaakov Chaim Sofer, in his work \"Kaf Hachayim\", (262:16) notes:\n\nRabbi Jacob Emden, in his prayerbook, \"Bet El\" (1745), criticized both the use of the hymn (on the grounds that supplications on the Sabbath and supplications to angels were inappropriate) and its grammar—arguing that the inclusion of the prefix מִ at the beginning of every second line (i.e., \"mee-melech\") was bad form, as it rendered the passage, \"angels of the Most High, \"away from\" the King who rules over kings\". He therefore deleted that מִ, thereby reducing \"mi-melech\" to \"melech\", and that deletion has been emulated in some other prayerbooks (apparently a small minority) such as Seligman Baer's \"Siddur Avodat Yisroel\" (1868), the Orot Sephardic, and Koren's Mizrahi (but not Koren's Ashkenaz or Sefard) prayerbook, although it makes the musical meter a bit awkward.\n\nMany different melodies have been written for \"Shalom Aleichem\".\n\nThe slow, well-known melody for the song was composed by the American composer and conductor Rabbi Israel Goldfarb on May 10, 1918 while sitting near the Alma Mater statue in front of Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, and first published later that year as \"Sholom Alechem—שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם\" in \"Friday Evening Melodies\" by Israel and his brother Samuel. The famous Goldfarb song is often presumed to be a traditional Hasidic melody. I. Goldfarb wrote in 1963, \"The popularity of the melody traveled not only throughout this country but throughout the world, so that many people came to believe that the song was handed down from Mt. Sinai by Moses.\" In the Preface to \"Friday Evening Melodies\" the composers articulated the goal of avoiding the extremes of both the free-form emotive Eastern European musical liturgical style and the classical Western European musical structure of \"Israel Emancipated.\"\n\nLately, a modern, exuberantly joyful version of this melody has been popularized by Idan Yaniv and Kinderlach.\n\nAs one of her last acts, Debbie Friedman shared her beautiful and haunting \"Shalom Aleichem\" with Rabbi Joy Levitt. Friedman believed it was this song that would become her legacy.\n\nThe Faster Common Traditional Melody was composed by Rabbi Shmuel Brazil.\n\n"}
{"id": "25646895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25646895", "title": "Surau", "text": "Surau\n\nSurau is an Islamic assembly building in some regions of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula used for worship and religious instruction. Generally smaller physical structures, its ritual functions are similar to a mosque, allow men and women, and are used more for religious instruction and festive prayers. They depend more on grassroots support and funding. They can be compared to the Arab Zawiya. In Minangkabau society they continued pre-Islamic traditions of an all-male gathering place to worship ancestors and were built up high on posts.\n\nIn contemporary usage, Surau is often used to refer to either a small mosque, or a designated room in a public building (such as a shopping mall, a university, or a rest stop along a highway) for men or women to do their prayers.\n\nSurau among the Minankabau of Sumatra date to pre-Islamic times. Men lived together in them. The first Islamic Surau in Minangkabau is believed to have been built in the late 17th century in the coastal town of Ulakan.\n\nSmaller surau are known as Surau Mangaji, and consist mostly of a small room for to 20 students and one teacher who is usually also the Imam and teaches Quran recitation. Large Surau, during the heyday of Surau culture in the 18th century, help up to 1,000 students and included up to 20 buildings.\n\nThe central figure of Surau was the Tuanku shaikh who mostly as carriers of Baraka was. He oversaw in large Surau usually a large number of teachers who as Guru were called and had mostly learned even with him or even met with him. The establishment and maintenance of Surau performed usually by foundations ( waqf ) and donations from parents as well as by the work of Surau residents. Minangkabau Surau has great similarities with the institution of the pesantren, which was initially distributed only to Java.\n\nMany Surau were simultaneously centers of Sufi orders. In this case, the Tuanku Shaikh was the spiritual leader of Surau-residents, and this kept him the oath of allegiance. The Surau of Ulakan served as a center of Shattāriyya Order, which had been introduced by Burhan ad-Din, a student of Abd al-Ra'uf as-Singkilī. Other orders, which had their own Surau in Minangkabau, were the Naqshbandīyya and Qadiriyya. Some students visited various Surau succession and could be introduced in different orders. The fact that the students of Tuanku shaikh as Mureed or Faqīr are called, shows the great impact of Sufism on the Surau culture.\n\nEarly 19th century was the Surau system of Hāddschis that in Mecca with the teachings of the Wahhabi had come into contact, radically questioned. They and their followers, the so-called Padris, denounced the Surau as centers of dissemination un-Islamic teachings and practices and burning some of them during the so-called Padri Wars (1821–38) down. Other steps that heralded the demise of Surau culture, were in 1870 to introduce a new type of school, the so-called Sekolah Nagari, by the Dutch, and in 1900 the intellectual attacks of reformist Muslims who denounced the Surau as hoards of backwardness and own secular schools established. Today, there are tentative attempts to revive the Surau culture at the Minangkabau.\n\nOn the Malay Peninsula, the functional difference between mosque and Surau is not always so clear. In rural areas the Surau was for centuries the center of Islamic worship and thus tantamount to a mosque. In today's urban area in Malaysia and Singapore there are also Surau. Sharifa Zaleha who has dealt with Surau in Malaysia, concludes that the difference between the two institutions is that the mosques are built by the state, while the Surau depend grassroots initiatives. As with Minangkaba the success of the Surau depends very much on the religious scholars involved. During the heyday of the Dakwah movement in the 1970s and 1980s the Surau in Malaysia were also centers of student life. Many male and female students spent several nights a month in Surau to there in the form of i'tikaf to pray until morning to recite the Quran and perform devotions.\n\n\n"}

It is a snapshot of the religious movements in the U.S. before its entry into World War I.\n\nThe book is the first of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American institutions. The series also includes \"The Brass Check\" (journalism), \"The Goose-step\" (higher education), \"The Goslings\" (elementary and high school education), \"Mammonart\" (art) and \"Money Writes!\" (literature). The term “Dead Hand” ironically refers to Adam Smith’s concept that allowing an \"invisible hand\" of individual self-interest to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.\n\nIn this book, Sinclair attacks institutionalized religion as a “source of income to parasites, and the natural ally of every form of oppression and exploitation.”\n\nMost clergymen are hypocrites, but they are not entirely to blame. Like other men, they are victimized by “the competitive wage-system, which presents them with the alternative to swindle or to starve.”\n\nSinclair savages the Episcopal establishment for transforming the proletarian Jesus into a defender of wealth and privilege, and for a long history of alliance with political power in England and the United States.\n\nTurning to the “nonconforming” Protestant sects, adherents of \"The Church of the Merchants\" are focused on achieving prosperity within the existing economic system. So are the devotees of the mostly California-based ‘new religions’ or ‘cults’, including New Thought.\n\nSinclair wants to rescue the true message of Jesus, the friend of the poor and brother of all men.\n\nThe writing is fluent, vivid and personal. At the same time, almost every paragraph is built upon evidence that includes historic and contemporary quotations, articles, events, and anecdotes. It is not meant to be objective, but to present a compelling case. It reads like the exhaustive oral argument of a very able prosecuting attorney.\n\nNote: The chapters of Book Six are listed to give a flavor of Sinclair's writing style.\n\nReviewing several of the Dead Hand series, a contemporary critic wrote, \"These great pamphlets…are storehouses of laborious research. They are indispensable to any student of present American life. I have heard Upton Sinclair charged with reckless, inaccurate and indiscreet use of his material. I am glad to say here that in my own experience I have found him scrupulously anxious, at whatever trouble to himself, to report the exact facts and to weigh carefully his judgments upon them. Why, then, have not these books the authority which they should have?…His explanation is oversimplified; he tends to see his facts in the light of a single motive.\" \n\nIn \"The Brass Check\" (1919), Sinclair wrote, \"\"The Profits of Religion\" was practically boycotted by the capitalist press of America. Just one newspaper, the \"Chicago Daily News\", reviewed it—or rather allowed me space in which to review it myself. Just one religious publication, the \"Churchman,\" took the trouble to ridicule it at length. Half a dozen others sneered at it in brief paragraphs, and half a dozen newspapers did the same, and that was all the publicity the book got, except in the radical press.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27387528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27387528", "title": "Wabunowin", "text": "Wabunowin\n\nThe Wabunowin (also spelled Wabanowin, Wabenowin, and Wabunohwin; Waabanoowiwin in the \"double-vowel\" spelling) is the \"Dawn Society\", also sometime improperly called the \"Magical Dawn Society\", a distinct Anishinaabeg society of visionaries, practiced among the Anishinaabeg peoples, consisting of the Algonquin/Nipissing, Ojibwa/Chippewa/Saulteaux/Mississaugas, Odawa, Potawatomi and Oji-cree, located primarily in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. Like the \"Midewiwin\", the Wabunowin is a secretive animistic religion, requiring an initiation, thus early non-indigenous writers lumped the information on the Wabunowin with the Midewiwin. But unlike the \"Mide\", the \"Waabano\" have sometimes two levels, and sometimes four. This variation is dependent on the particular lodge.\n\nThis society was mentioned in \"The Song of Hiawatha\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow who used informational materials made available from Henry Schoolcraft to compose the epic poem. The Dawn Society members were systematically imprisoned in mental hospitals by the United States government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because of this persecution, the Wabunowin went underground and have just begun to reemerge in the last decade. While many of the ceremonies and traditions are closely guarded, one that is known is the Fire Dance.\n\nThe Waabanowin have been coming out from underground and re-establishing themselves for about 15 years now. There are active lodges in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, Indiana and Michigan.\n\nThe word for \"dawn\" or \"east\" in the Anishinaabe language is \"waaban\". Its practitioners are called \"Waabanow\" (plural: \"Waabanowag\") and the practices of \"Waabanowin\" referred to as the \"Waabano\" (often transcribed as \"Waubuno\"). Unlike the \"mide\" where gender-specific references could be made for its practitioners, \"Waabano\" do not. Though of differing etymology, culturally, \"waaban\" is associated with \"owaabi'aan\" (syncoped as \"waabhaan\"), \"they see them\", from \"waabi′\", \"to see \". This word association reinforces the idea of the \"Waabanowag\" as being visionaries.\n\nThere are differing stories about the origins of the \"Waabanowin\". Many writings put them as a late 19th-century origin, but the members with their oral traditions place the origin many centuries ago. The oral traditions of the lodge put the formation of the society happening shortly after creation.\n\nThe \"Waabanowin\" elders trace the origins of the lodge or society to the original teachings of Nanabozho. The stories of Nanabozho are used in the ceremonies and teachings of the Society. Further, the \"Waabanowin\" lodge, usually with less than 25 participants, but as many as 300, only needed one or two elders to perform the ceremonies, unlike the \"Midewiwin\" which required several. This would allow the \"Waabanowin\" ceremonies to have existed in the much smaller settlements that the Anishinaabeg lived before contact with Europe.\n\nThe \"Waabanowin\" have a basic set of beliefs that anthropologist call 'animist.' In many ways this is correct but in some ways it is not. They do not believe in a multitude of deities in every living thing, but there is a single creator entity called \"Gichi-manidoo\". There are \"Manidoog\" in all living things and these are spirits but not deities. It is the goal of \"Waabanow\" to live a life in balance with everything around them and with all of creation. They do not try to do only good and no bad.\n\nThe elders in the \"Waabano\" guide those who come to the lodge. It is not their way to dictate a what a person believes, or does. The \"Waabanow\" points the person in the correct direction using the stories and traditions of the lodge. There is no dogma or absolutes. Each person has their own path to walk and their own things to learn because what one person has to learn is different from another, they cannot have absolutes.\n\nThere is no effort to convert people to the beliefs of the lodge. People will find their way to the traditions or they will not. It is the belief of the lodge is that every person is placed on this earth to learn certain things. Each person has different things to learn. If the individual does not learn his or her individual life purpose lesson, then that individual will come back to this world again; if the individual does learn his or her life purpose lesson, then the individual will move on to the next world and lesson.\n\nThe lodge has several ceremonies they share in common with the other medicine traditions of the Anishinaabe people. They also have ceremonies that are specific to the Dawn Society. While many would like to know more the actual ceremonies are not written down and traditions of the society prohibit the writing or the ceremonies. For these that want to know more it is recommended that they seek out a \"Waabanowin\" and learn from the lodge and elders directly. What follows is a basic overview of the ceremonies.\n\nOn the solstice and equinox the lodge performs a set of ceremonies that begin at dusk and end at dawn. Each of the ceremonies differ, with the winter ceremony being the highest ceremony of the lodge. All of the lodge ceremonies begin with a purification done through a \"Madoodiswan\" (sweat lodge). After the sweat the ceremony begins at dusk and goes until dawn.\n\nThe Spring Equinox was the beginning of the new year to the \"Waabanowin\", which unlike the dominate \"Midewiwin\" whose new year began in Winter. \"Minookamin\" (Late Spring) was a time to celebrate and fell just after the Maple camps. During the Spring Ceremony the focus is on the \"Waabanong Manidoo\" (Spirit of the East), the Grandfather.\n\nThe Summer Solstice is a time of gathering of many villages or bands. The ceremony goes for 4 days and is more of a time of teaching and fellowship. It is normally the largest of the \"Waabanowin\" ceremonies in the number of people. The ceremony starts at dusk with the lighting of the \"Mishi-ishkode\" or sacred fire.\n\nLike the Spring the \"dagwaagin\" (Autumn) ceremony fell just before the Wild rice camps.\n\nTraditionally the Anishinaabe peoples only told certain traditions during \"biboon\" (winter). This was because the underwater \"Manidoo\" hibernated at that time. Because of this the \"Waabanowin\" would recount the \"Nanabozho\" and creation stories as a part of the winter ceremonies. The Ceremony was a teaching time and a prayer for healing of individuals and \"aki\" (Earth). It was at this time that the fire dance was done as a part of the ceremony.\n\nWinter Solstice is the most important of all of the \"Waabanowin\" ceremonies. It is the time of healing for \"Aki\" (Earth) and for personal healing. The traditional ceremony calls for \"Madoodiswan\" to be performed at dusk for two days, then again on the solstice with the sweat ending at dusk. The ceremonies including the fire dance go on throughout the longest night of the year. At dawn the ceremony is finished and the men come out a \"Madoodiswan\" again. They then sweat twice more for the following two days.\n\nThe \"Waabanowin\" are known as spiritual healers. There is a ceremony they perform to bring the person's spirit and body back into alignment thus healing them. In \"Waabanowin\" teachings sickness that cannot be cured by the herbs and medicines of the herbal healers are caused those things in a persons life that are out of balance with creation. These can and are performed as needed but are also part of the Solstice ceremonies.\n\n"}
{"id": "19408797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19408797", "title": "Wadi es-Sebua", "text": "Wadi es-Sebua\n\nWadi es-Sebua, or Valley of the Lions (so-called because of the sphinx-lined approach to the temple forecourts) (Arab: وادي السبوع), is the site of two New Kingdom Egyptian temples, including one speos temple constructed by the 19th dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II, in Lower Nubia. The first temple was built by the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep III and subsequently restored by Ramesses II. In its first stage, this temple \"consisted of a rock-cut sanctuary (about 3 m by 2 m) fronted by a brick-built pylon, a court and a hall, partly painted with wall paintings.\" The temple was perhaps dedicated to one of the local Nubian forms of Horus, but his representations were altered to Amun at a later point in time. During the Amarna period, images of Amun were attacked and the decorations deteriorated but Ramesses II later restored and extended Amenhotep III's temple by building structures in front of the pylon.\n\nThe second larger temple which was built at el-Sebua was known as \"\"The Temple of Ri'amesse-meryamun\" [Ramesses II] \"in the Domain of Amun\"\" and constructed roughly 150 m northeast of Amenhotep III's temple. Contemporary monuments and representations of the viceroy of Kush, Setau, indicate that this temple was set up between Years 35 and Year 50 of Ramesses II. Setau is known to have served as the Viceroy of Kush or Nubia between Year 38 to 63 of this pharaoh's reign and was responsible for Ramesses' later Nubian temples. The temple of Wadi es-Sebua was the third sanctuary or chapel constructed from rock with a forecourt built with stones that Ramesses II erected in Nubia. Located at approximately a hundred and fifty kilometers south of Aswan, on the western bank of the Nile, the temple owed its importance to the fact that during the Ramesside period, the city was built at the outlet of the caravan roads, was used as the place of residence for the viceroy of Kush and because it was located at a difficult stretch of the Nile which was difficult for boats to traverse up against the current. Ramesses II entrusted the management of his work projects here to the viceroy of Nubia Setau which, if one judges by the poor quality of the Osiride style and statues of the court, was forced to settle on an \"untrained work force, many of whom were snatched from the Libyan oases\" and by \"inferior raw materials.\" \n\nThe temple of \"Ramesses beloved of Amon in the field of Amun\" was used as a quay or resting place for boats during its descent of the Nile river. The local Arabs, inspired by the stone sculptures of sphinxes which lined the entrance to the first temple, baptized the place as 'Wadi es-Sebua' or the Valley of the lions. The temple comprised three distinct parts: two open courts which were decorated with sphinxes or dromos, a large interior court with Osiride pillars and the rock hewn temple. This temple was, hence, \"partly free-standing and partly rock-cut.\" \n\nThe temple once possessed three pylons. The first two, however, were made of inferior Nile mud brick and have since crumbled. Only the stone gate passageway through them has survived. Beyond the first tower, the first courtyard appears with two human headed sphinxes accompanied by two statues of the pharaoh himself which originally stand on both sides of the passageway. Only the left-hand statue of Ramesses II remains \"in situ\" whereas the other statue now lies in the desert. Beyond the second pylon, a second courtyard with four falconheaded sphinxes appear representing Horus of Miam, of Meha, of Baki and, curiously, Horus of Edfu when one would expect that of Buhen instead in Nubia. Between their legs, a statuette with the image of Ramesses capped with the némès crown appears. On their base, an inscription states Ramesses \"Lord of Sed-festivals, as his/her Ptah father\" refers to the desire for longevity on behalf of this pharaoh which was already expressed on the vestiges of the second door: \"Ramsès-Meryamun, lord of Sed-festivals, like Ptah.\" Just prior to entering the third tower, four colossal statues of Ramesses II appear of which, only one statue remains upright today. The third pylon is decorated with the conventional Egyptian style of the Pharaoh smiting his enemies and making offerings to the gods, including himself. Once one passes through the third pylon, the rock cut section of the temple begins with a hypostyle hall composed of 12 square pillars:\n\nThe \"antechamber opens into two side rooms, two side chapels and the sanctuary itself.\" Although the statues in the sanctuary niches were destroyed, they \"undoubtedly represented Amon-Re, Re-Harakhty and Ramesses II himself.\" The larger temple at Wadi es-Sebua was built in the rather rough Nubian style, which marked some of Ramesses II's larger buildings.\n\nIn the 5th century AD, the temple was converted into a Christian church. Some temple reliefs were covered with a layer of plaster, where painted images of God was done. This layer helped to preserve for posterity the original reliefs; the best examples here are located in the sanctuary and associated chapels of Ramesses' temple where colourful scenes depict Ramesess adoring the sacred boats of Amun-Re and Re-Horakhty. There is also an interesting scene in the central niche of Wadi es-Sebua temple where two statues of Amun and Re-Horakhty which stood besides Ramesses II were hacked away by later Christian worshippers and replaced by an image of St. Peter. When the plaster coating was removed from the carved reliefs, one finds a bizarre image of Ramesses II offering flowers to...St Peter instead.\n\nWhen the Wadi es-Sebua temples were threatened by flooding from the construction of the Aswan Dam project, the temple was dismantled in 1964 with U.S. support by the Egyptian Antiquities Service. They were moved to a new site only 4 km west from their original location. \n\nThe Temple of Dakka and Temple of Maharraqa were also moved and rebuilt at the new Wadi es-Sebua temple complex area.\n\n"}
