Today it is an Israeli national park. The legally disputed \"micronation\" of \"Akhzivland\" is located in the immediate vicinity.\n\nExcavations have unearthed a fortified Canaanite city of the second millennium BCE. The Phoenician town of the first millennium BCE is known both from the Hebrew Bible and Assyrian sources. Phoenician Achzib went through ups and downs during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. In Roman times \"Acdippa\" was a road station. The Bordeaux Pilgrim mentions it in 333-334 CE still as a road station; Jewish sources of the Byzantine period call it \"Kheziv\" and \"Gesiv\". There is no information about settlement at the site for the Early Muslim period. The Crusaders built a new village with a castle. During the Mamluk and Ottoman periods a modest village occupied the old tell (archaeological mound). This village was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The only permanent resident of Achziv is an Israeli who has been welcoming visitors to a small stretch of beach where he has lived since 1975.\n\nAchziv was the first fortified settlement found by archaeologists, is a large Canaanite port city from the Middle Bronze Age IIB (1800-1550 BCE). The massive ramparts, some 4.5 m (15 ft) high, protected the city proper and a large area of port facilities. To the north and south the city extended to the two nearby rivers, which the Canaanite engineers connected by a fosse, thus transforming Achzib into an island. A substantial destruction level from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age proves that even these fortifications were eventually not sufficient.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the area including the Phoenician city of Achzib was assigned to the tribe of Asher, but the Asherites did not manage to conquer it from the Phoenicians:\nKing David added the city into his Kingdom, but King Solomon returned it to Hiram I as part of the famous pact.\n\nDuring the invasions of Sennacherib the Assyrians conquered the city.\n\nDuring the reign of the Seleucids the border was established at Rosh HaNikra, just north to Achziv, making it a border city which they called \"Ekdippa\" (Έκδιππα in Ancient Greek) and put it under the control of Acre.\n\nA maritime city named Cziv, nine miles (14 km) north of Acre, is mentioned by Josephus Flavius and later by Eusebius.\nAchziv (Cheziv) is mentioned in Jewish rabbinic writings, for example Midrash Vayikra Rabba 37:4. Additionally, Achziv is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, and by the relating Middle Age commentators, concerning the location of Achziv in regards to historical borders of Israel.\n\nDuring the Crusader period, the site was known as Casale Umberti, or Casal Humberti, after Hubert of Pacy who held the casale and is documented in 1108. European farmers settled there in 1153 under Baldwin III. In 1232 it was the site of the Battle of Casal Imbert between German and French Crusaders as part of the War of the Lombards.\n\nThe Arab village of Az-Zeeb was established during the Mamluk period, the houses erected using the stones of the Crusader castle.\n\nThe town existed during Ottoman rule in the region.\n\nIn 1946, The Jewish Resistance Movement attempted to blow up the railroad bridge over the creek at Achziv in an operation known as Night of the Bridges. A monument to the 14 soldiers killed there was erected on the site. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Arab villagers of az-Zib fled to Lebanon.\n\nAchziv became an Israeli national park.\n\nRemnants of ancient Achziv, now known as Tel Achziv, are located on a sandstone mound between two streams, Kziv on the north and Shaal on the south, close to the border with Lebanon.\n\nAn ancient port was located on the coast, and another secondary port is located 700 m to the south.\n\nArcheological excavations have revealed that a walled city existed at the location from the Middle Bronze period. History of Achziv goes back to the Chalcolithic period (4500-3200 BC).\n\n\n"}

Located near the Sutlej River, the city is one of the most sacred places in Sikhism, being the place where the last two Sikh Gurus lived and where Guru Gobind Singh Ji founded the Khalsa Panth in 1699. The city is home to Keshgarh Sahib Gurdwara, one of the five Takhts in Sikhism. \n\nThe city is a pilgrimage site in Sikhism. It is the venue of the largest annual Sikh gathering and festivities during Hola Mohalla in the spring season.\n\nAnandpur Sahib is located on National Highway 503 that links Kiratpur Sahib and Chandigarh to Nangal, Una and further Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. It is situated near the Sutlej river, the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab. \n\nAnandpur Sahib was founded in June 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. He previously lived in Kiratpur, but given the disputes with Ram Rai – the elder son Guru Har Rai and other sects of Sikhism, he moved to village in Makhoval. He named it \"Chakk Nanaki\" after his mother. In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was tortured and beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a martyrdom that led Sikhs to rename the town to Anandpur and coronate his son Gobind Das (also known as Gobind Rai) as his successor and famous as Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nThe village grew into town, likely dramatically state Louis E. Fenech and W. H. McLeod, as Sikhs moved near Guru Gobind Singh. The growing strength of Sikhs in Anandpur under the tenth Guru, after the execution of the ninth Guru, raised concerns of the neighboring Pahari rajas - the vassals of the Mughal Empire, along with the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. In 1693, Aurangzeb issued an order that banned large gatherings of Sikhs such as during the festival of Baisakhi. In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa panth and gathered a large armed militia. This triggered Aurangzeb and his vassal Hindu kings around Anandpur to blockade Anandpur. This led to several battles:\n\n\nAccording to Louis Fenech, Anandpur's history during the late 17th century and early 18th century was complex and war prone because the relationship of Guru Gobind Singh with his neighbors was complex. Sometimes the hill chiefs and Guru Gobind Singh cooperated in a battle, sometimes they fought against each other, where the difficult mountainous terrain made it difficult for the Mughal to subdue everyone with force and the terrain made it easier for Pahari chieftains to rebel against the Mughals routinely.\n\nAnandpur Sahib is in Punjab state of India, close to the Himachal Pradesh border. It is about north of Ropar (Rupnagar) and south of Nangal. Anandpur has been significant to the Sikh history. These historical locations now feature the following Gurdwaras:\n10th Sikh Guru Guru Gobind Singh made five forts on the border of the city. The buildings to commemorate each of these were built between late 1970s and the late 1980s:\n\n\n India census, The Anandpur Sahib Municipal Council has population of 16,282 of which 8,545 are males while 7,737 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.\n\nPopulation of Children with age of 0-6 is 1774 which is 10.90% of total population of Anandpur Sahib (M Cl). In Anandpur Sahib Municipal Council, Female Sex Ratio is of 905 against state average of 895. Moreover, Child Sex Ratio in Anandpur Sahib is around 932 compared to Punjab state average of 846. Literacy rate of Anandpur Sahib city is 82.44% higher than state average of 75.84%. In Anandpur Sahib, Male literacy is around 85.75% while female literacy rate is 78.78%.\n\nAnandpur Sahib Municipal Council has total administration over 3,270 houses to which it supplies basic amenities like water and sewerage. It is also authorized to build roads within Municipal Council limits and impose taxes on properties coming under its jurisdiction.\n\nAnandpur Sahib features a major festival and gathering of Sikhs every year on the occasion of Hola Mohalla. This tradition dates back to the times of the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The guru decreed that the occasion of the festival of Holi be the occasion for the display of the martial spirit of his people. He gave this festival of Holi the Sikh name of 'Hola Mohalla'. Each year Hola Mohalla marks the congregation of nearly 100,000 Sikhs from all over the country for a festival of colour and gaiety. The festival, among other things, remembers the creation of Khalsa on the Baisakhi day in 1699.\n\nThe fair lasts for three days. The Gurudwaras are specially decorated for the occasion. During Hola Mohalla, Anandpur Sahib wears a festive appearance and hums with activities in March. Community conferences and religious functions are also organized. On this occasion, Nihangs from all over the country gather for the celebrations. The highlight is a huge procession by the Nihangs, clad in their traditional dress and weapons, on the last day of the fair. The procession starts from the headquarters of the Nihangs, opposite Gurudwara Anandgarh Sahib, and passes through the bazaar, goes to village Agampur and reaches the fort of Holgarh, the place where Guru Gobind Singh used to celebrate this fair. Thereafter, the procession heads toward the sandy bed of Charan Ganga, where demonstration of martial games including riding, tent pegging, sword-wielding, etc. are witnessed by a large number of people.\n\nBaisakhi in 1999, at Anandpur Sahib marked the completion of 300 years of the birth of the Khalsa. It was on Baisakhi day in 1699 that Guru Gobind Singh baptised the \"Panj Pyaras\" at the place where Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib stands.\n\nThe world's tallest khanda is installed at Sri Anandpur Sahib at Panj Piara Park with an estimated height of 70 feet.\n\n\n\n"}

After having narrowly escaped being burnt at the stake by the authorities in Westphalia who had charged him with sorcery, the German Count Alexander Leopold Anton von Rantzau secretly gave him refuge in Holzminden. During this stay in 1736, Falk made his impressive kabbalistic performances in Rantzau’s castle witnessed by noblemen and Alexander’s son Count Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau. In his famous \"Mémoires du comte de Rantzow\", which are referred to by many researchers as an original standard source, this young Count gives a thorough and detailed account of all these mystic demonstrations. Sometime after 1736, Falk arrived in London. He lived at 35 Prescott Street, London, United Kingdom and at Wellclose Square, London until his death. He was a neighbour of Emanuel Swedenborg and there is some evidence that he had a significant influence on him.\n\nRabbi Jacob Emden accused him of being a Sabbatean, a supporter of Sabbatai Zevi, as he invited Moses David of Podhayce, a known Sabbatean with connections to Jonathan Eibeschutz, to his home.\n\nHe died on 17 April 1782 and was buried in Alderney Road Cemetery, Mile End, London Falk bequeathed in his will an annual sum of 100 pounds to the Great Synagogue of London as well as some Sefer Torahs.\n\nMany stories exist regarding Falk's extraordinary powers. According to one account, Falk made secretive visits to Epping Forest in his carriage, where he was said to have buried some treasure. On one of these occasions a wheel came loose from the vehicle on the Whitechapel Road, but followed the carriage all the way to the forest. When Falk ran short of coal, he was said to have performed a magical feat involving three shirts and a ram's horn. Falk was also able to keep candles burning miraculously, and to transport objects from one place to another.\n\nSome claimed that he had saved the Great Synagogue from fire by writing something in Hebrew on the pillars of the door.\n\nFalk kept a diary containing records of dreams and the Kabbalistic names of angels. This can be found in the library of the United Synagogue in London. In 2002 Michal Oron published the diary and a biography of Falk. The diary is written in Hebrew and is very cryptic. The diary was published together with the diary of Falk's assistant, Tsvee Hirsch of Kalish.\n\n"}

It has spread, in a limited way, to neighbouring countries such as Uruguay. Every year since its inception in 1840, miracles are said to have occurred at the shrine of La Difunta Correa, and thousands of people have visited there to pay their respects. The shrine is situated in the small town of Vallecito, 1160 km from Buenos Aires and 63 km from the city of San Juan.\n\nAccording to popular legend, the husband of Deolinda Correa was forcibly recruited around the year 1840, during the Argentine civil wars. When he became sick, he was abandoned by the \"Montoneras\" [partisans]. In an attempt to reach her sick husband, Deolinda took her baby and followed the tracks of the \"Montoneras\" through the desert of San Juan Province. When her supplies ran out, she died. Her body was found days later by gauchos who were driving cattle through. They were astonished when they saw the dead woman's baby was still alive, feeding from her \"miraculously\" ever-full breast. The men buried her body in present-day Vallecito in the Caucete Department of San Juan, and took her baby with them.\n\nOnce the folk tale became known, the inhabitants of the nearby areas started visiting Deolinda Correa's grave, building after time an oratory that slowly became a sanctuary.\n\nThe cultus to the \"Difunta Correa\" is that of an unofficial popular saint, not recognised by the Catholic Church. Her devout followers believe her to perform miracles and intercede for the living. The survival of her child would have been her first miracle.\n\nCattle keepers first, then truck drivers, disseminated the figure of the Difunta, creating wayside shrines in many roads throughout the country, with images and sculptures of the \"Deceased\". They there leave bottles of water as votive offerings, \"to calm her eternal thirst\".\n\nSince the 1940s her sanctuary at Vallecito, at first merely a cross on the top of a hill, has been transformed into a small town in which there are several votive chapels (17 as of 2005), full of offerings. The chapels are donated by her followers, whose names are engraved on plates fixed to the doors.\n\nIn the chapel located on the top of the hill there is a life-size statue depicting the \"Difunta\" lying face to the heavens, with her child at her breast. The sanctuaries are segregated by themes. For instance, one of the chapels is full of wedding dresses offered to the \"Difunta\" by women whose prayers to get married were fulfilled. Car registrations and scale-model houses can be found all around the hill to the main sanctuary.\n\nVisits to the Difunta Correa's Vallecito shrine take place during the whole year, but they are more numerous during Easter or at All-Souls' Day (November 2) and on dates special to truck drivers and gauchos, mostly in summer. On such occasions, crowds of 200,000 people have been claimed.\n\n\n\n"}

It was owing to the fog of smoke that rose from them as they were burning that others have said that they came in a fog of smoke\".\n\nThe miraculous powers of the feth Fiada have come to be ascribed to Christian saints. An allusion to this is found in Saint Patrick's Breastplate - a hymn whose composition was attributed to St. Patrick. The hymn is accompanied by a prose explanation of how it came to be created. The high king Lóegaire mac Néill, with the will to prevent the saint and his band from coming to Tara to spread the faith, sent out troops to find and intercept them. But then Patrick chanted this hymn, which caused his pursuers to mistake Patrick for deer and fawns. The hymn was given the title Fáeth Fiada, said to mean \"Deer's Cry\", though the phrase manifestly derives from the magic mist féth fíada.\n\nThe magic mist is also called ceo druidechta (Modern Irish: ceo draíochta ) and an example of its usage can be found in the Ulster Cycle tale \"Fled Bricrinn\" (\"The Feast of Bricriu\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "84221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84221", "title": "Galanthis", "text": "Galanthis\n\nIn Greek mythology, Galanthis or Galinthias was the woman who interfered with Hera's plan to hinder the birth of Heracles in favor of Eurystheus, and was changed into a weasel or cat as punishment for being so insolent as to deceive the goddesses of birth that were acting on Hera's behalf.\n\nIn the version followed by Ovid in \"Metamorphoses\", Galanthis was the red-gold haired servant of Alcmene, who assisted her during the birth of Heracles. When Alcmene was in labor, she was having difficulty giving birth to a child so large. After seven days she called for assistance from Lucina, the goddess of childbirth (that is, the Greek Eileithyia). However, Lucina did not help her due to the wishes of Hera. Instead, she clasped her hands and crossed her legs, preventing the child from being born. Alcmene struggled in pain, cursed the heavens, and became close to death. Galanthis noticed Lucina and deduced Hera's plans. She told the goddess that the baby was born; this so startled her that she jumped up and unclasped her hands. This freed Alcmene, and she was able to give birth. Galanthis laughed and ridiculed Lucina, and as a punishment was turned into a weasel or cat. She continued to live with Alcmene after her transformation, thus initiating the practice of weasels being kept as household animals.\n\nThe account of Antoninus Liberalis makes Galinthias a daughter of the Theban Proetus, and a playmate of Alcmene. In his version, Eileithyia and the Moerae came to Alcmene and held her tight to make her labor pains last longer, so as to please Hera. Galinthias confused them by telling that Alcmene had given birth by the will of Zeus, and accordingly all the rites in honor of the birth goddesses had been cancelled. The goddesses were taken aback and loosened their grip so Alcmene delivered. The Moerae, enraged by the fact that a mortal was able to deceive them, changed Galinthias into a weasel, an animal that in ancient times was believed to conceive through the ear and give birth through the mouth via the curse of the scorned deities. Hecate, however, took pity on her and made the weasel her own sacred animal. When Heracles grew up, he built a sanctuary to Galinthias and sacrificed to her; the practice of honoring Galinthias in Thebes lasted down to late times.\n\nThe myth of Galanthis is also briefly mentioned by Pausanias: he recounts the Theban version of the story, which referred to the heroine as Historis, called her a daughter of Tiresias, and made no mention of her transformation. In this version, she deceived the female agents of Hera known as the Pharmacides (\"Herbalists\" or \"Sorceresses\") who had been keeping Alcmene from giving birth, by announcing the birth of the child, which made the Pharmacides leave and let Alcmene be delivered.\n\n\n"}

When he arrived uninvited, he was further insulted by the king, seeing which Sati felt infuriated and self-immolated herself in the Yagna Kund, or Sati Kund as it is called now, situated in Kankhal. The heart and navel of Sati had fallen at the place which is the present site of the Maya Devi Temple, Haridwar, dating back to the 11th century. Daksha was later killed by the demon Virabhadra, born out of Shiva's anger. Subsequently, the king was brought to life and given a goat's head by Shiva.\n\nSkanda Purana mentions a legend, in which \"Chanda-Munda\", the Army Chief of local Demon Kings \"Shumbh\" and \"Nishumbha\" were killed here by goddess Chandi at a place, which got the name Chandi Devi Temple.\n\nSage Kapila had an Ashram here. The legendary King Bhagirath, the great-grandson of the Suryavanshi King Sagar, (an ancestor of Rama), is said to have brought the river Ganges down from heaven, through years of penance in Satya Yuga, for the salvation of 60,000 of his ancestors from the curse of the saint Kapila.\n\nLord Vishnu is said to have left his footprint on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har-Ki-Pauri (literally, \"footsteps of the Lord\"), where the Holy Ganges touches it at all times. Devout Hindus perform ritualistic bathing here on the banks of the river Ganges, an act considered to be the equivalent of washing away one's sins to attain Moksha.\n\nSeven sages or Saptarishis, namely Kashyapa, Vashisht, Atri, Vishwamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadwaja and Gautam, are said to have meditated at the site of Sapt Rishi Ashram & Sapt Rishi Sarovar, a place near Haridwar, where the Ganges split into seven currents, so that the Rishis would not be disturbed by the flow.\n\nIn the Vanaparva of the Mahabharat, where sage Dhaumya tells Yudhishthira about the tirthas of India, Gangadwar, i.e. Haridwar and Kankhal, have been referred to; the text also mentions that Agastya Rishi did penance here, with the help of his wife, Lopamudra (the princess of Vidharba).\n\nIt is said that while Pandavas were going to Himalayas through Haridwar, prince Bhima drew water from the rocks here, by thrusting his knee (goda) into the ground at the present site of 'Bhimagoda' situated at a distance of about 1 km from Har-ki-Pauri.\n\nArchaeological findings have proved that terra cotta culture dating between 1700 BCE and 1200 BCE existed in this region.\n\nHaridwar came under the rule of the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE), and later under the Kushan Empire (c. 1st–3rd centuries).\n\nIt is believed that the sacred Ghat Har ki Pauri was constructed by King Vikramaditya (1st century BC) in memory of his brother Bharthari, who had come to Haridwar and meditated on the banks of holy Ganges and died here.\n\nFirst ancient era written evidence of Haridwar is found in the accounts of a Chinese traveller, Huan Tsang, who visited India in 629 AD, during the reign of King Harshavardhan (590–647). He records Haridwar as 'Mo-yu-lo', the remains of which still exist at Mayapur, a little to the south of the modern Haridwar town; among the ruins are a fort and three temples, decorated with broken stone sculptures. He also mentions the presence of a temple, north of Mo-yu-lo called 'Gangadwara', Gateway of the Ganges.\n\nIt is believed that Adi Shankracharya had visited this region and the existing main statue of Chandi Devi Temple was established by him in 8th century A.D.\n\nHaridwar region was a part of Delhi Sultanate. The armies of Emperor Timur (1336–1405), a Turkic conqueror, had passed through this region on 13 January 1399 to attack Delhi.\n\nDuring his visit, first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak (1469–1539) bathed at Haridwar's 'Kushwan Ghat', wherein the famous, 'watering the crops' episode took place. His visit is today commemorated by a gurudwara (Gurudwara Nanakwara); according to two Sikh Janamsakhis, this visit took place on the Baisakhi day in 1504 AD. He later had also visited Kankhal en route to Kotdwara in Garhwal. Besides this, third Sikh Guru, Sri Amar Das also visited Hardwar twenty two times during his lifetime.\n\n\"The Mughal period\": Ain-e-Akbari, written by Abul Fazal in the 16th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, refers to Maya (Mayapur), known as Hardwar on the Ganges, as sacred city of Hindus. It also mentions that during his travels, and also while at home, Mughal Emperor Akbar drank water from the Ganges river, which he called 'the water of immortality'. Special people were stationed at Sorun and later Haridwar to dispatch water, in sealed jars, to wherever he was stationed.\n\nIt is said that Akbar's famous Commander-in-Chief, Raja Man Singh of Amber, laid the foundation of the present day city of Haridwar and also renovated the ghats at Har-ki-pauri. After his death, his ashes are also said to have been immersed at Brahma Kund by Mughal emperor Akbar himself. \"Brahma Kund\" (literally “Brahma's reservoir”) at Har ki Pauri, Haridwar is one among the four sites where drops of the elixir of immortality, Amrita, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher, in which it was being carried away by the celestial bird Garuda, after the Samudra manthan by the Devas and the Asuras. The famous Kumbh Melas are held at these four sites in rotation, to commemorate the event. Thomas Coryat, an English traveller, who visited the city in the reign of Emperor Jahangir (1596–1627) mentions it as 'Haridwara', the capital of Shiva.\n\nThe Ganges Canal was opened in 1854 after the work began in April 1842, prompted by the famine of 1837–38. The unique feature of the canal is the half-kilometre-long aqueduct over Solani river at Roorkee, which raises the canal 25 metres above the original river.\nIn 1947, when India achieved independence from the British colonial subjugation, the region of present Haridwar district was a part of the then Saharanpur district, in the United Province of the British Raj; the province was renamed as Uttar Pradesh state of India. The Haridwar district came into existence on 28 December 1988 as part of Saharanpur Divisional Commissionary. On 24 September 1998 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly passed the 'Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Bill', 1998'; eventually the Parliament also passed the Indian Federal Legislation – 'Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000' – and thus on 9 November 2000, Haridwar district became part of the newly formed Uttarakhand (then Uttaranchal), the 27th state in the Republic of India.\n\n\nAgriculture is the mainstay of this well irrigated district. Industrialisation had commenced with the establishment of Central Government owned Public Sector plants (PSUs) of [Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (IDPL)] and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, in pre-Uttarakhand 1960s period. The State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand (SIDCUL) has now established one new 'industrial development zone' in the district, adjacent to Shivalik Nagar near Haridwar, to encourage industrialisation; with industrial giants like Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Mahendra & Mahendra and Havells having moved in, it is making the desired progress. Not insignificant to the district's economy is the contribution of Hindu pilgrims who visit the holy places and attend the religious fairs in large numbers.\n\nHaridwar district has several academic institutions, covering studies in sciences, engineering, technology and advanced research in the town of Roorkee.\n\nEducation in Sanskrit based classics and Hindu religious/cultural disciplines is an age-old tradition in the district, mainly centred in and around Haridwar city. Some of the important institutions of this genre are:\n\n\nModern Ashrams are also being established in the district for imparting training in yoga and meditation to people coming now from near and far, including foreign countries of the West :\n\n\nBeing a place of intense religious significance, Haridwar also hosts several religious festivals throughout the year; popular among them are the Kavad Mela, Somvati Amavasya Mela, Ganga Dashara, Gughal Mela, in which around 2–2.5 million people take part.\n\nApart from these, there is the mammoth Kumbh Mela which takes place once in every twelve years, when the planet Jupiter (Brihaspati) comes into the sign Aquarius (Kumbha). First written evidence of the Kumbha Mela can be found in the accounts of Chinese traveller Huan Tsang or Xuanzang (602 – 664 A.D.), who visited India in 629 AD. The 1998 Maha Kumbh Mela saw over 80 million pilgrims visiting this city, to take a dip in the holy river Ganges.\n\nHar ki Pauri: One of the holiest spots on earth for the Hindus, this ancient bathing ghat (Steps) is of prime importance. A majority of the present ghats were largely developed in the 1800s.\n\nSati Kund: It is the well-known mythological Sati immolation heritage situated in Kankhal.\n\nDaksheswara Mahadev Temple: The ancient temple of Daksha Mahadev, also known as Daksheswara Mahadev Temple, is situated in the south of Kankhal town and is a tribute to the legends of Sati's self-immolated and king Daksha's death and later life with a goat's head.\n\nMaya Devi Temple: This temple of the Adhisthatri deity of Haridwar is considered one of the \"Siddhapeethas\" and is said to be the place where the heart and navel of Goddess Sati had fallen. It is one of the few ancient temples still standing in Haridwar, along with Narayani Shila Temple and Bhairav Temple.\n\nSapt Rishi Ashram and Sapt Rishi Sarovar, where the Ganges split herself into seven currents so that seven great sages on its bank would not be disturbed by the flow.\n\nBhimgoda Tank: This tank, where Bhima is said to have drawn water from the rocks by thrusting his knee into the ground, is situated at a distance of about 1 km from Har-ki-Pauri.\n\nChandi Devi Temple: The present temple, commemorating the ancient Chandi legend, was constructed in 1929 AD by the Dogra King of Kashmir, Suchat Singh; it can also be reached through a ropeway.\n\nMansa Devi Temple: The temple dedicated to Mansa Devi, a form of Shakti draws many pilgrims. There are two ways to reach the temple – trekking or it can also be reached through a ropeway.\n\nPiran Kaliyar Sharif: This famous 'Dargah' (Shrine) of Hazrat Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, a 13th-century Sufi Saint of Chishti Order, was built by Ibrahim Lodhi, a Delhi Sultanate ruler. Also known as Sarkar Sabir Pak, it is located in Kaliyar village, 7 km from Roorkee, and is a living example of religious harmony in India; it is visited by devotees from all over the world, during the annual 'Urs' festival, which is celebrated from 1st day (of sighting the new moon) to 16th day of Rabee-ul-awwal month of Islamic calendar.\n\nShantikunj: Shantikunj is headquarters of spiritual and social organisation All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP). Founder of the organisation, Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya, was a great saint, spiritual leader and freedom fightor. He spent last twenty years of his life here, writing and directing activities of the organisation. Shantikunj is considered as a place of pilgrimage by millions of devotees of this global organisation.\n\nNational Highway 58, between Delhi and Mana Pass, passes through Haridwar. Indian Railways links Haridwar Railway Station to all parts of India. The nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport, Dehradun, though Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi is preferred.\n\n\n"}

Hesselius writes letters to a Dutch colleague about the victim's condition, which gets steadily worse with time as the creature steps up its methods, all of which are purely psychological.

{"id": "1262063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1262063", "title": "Jewish culture", "text": "Jewish culture\n\nJewish culture is the culture of the Jewish people from the formation of the Jewish nation in biblical times through life in the diaspora and the modern state of Israel. Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief, so that it has been called not only a religion, but an orthopraxy. Not all individuals or all cultural phenomena can be classified as either \"secular\" or \"religious\", a distinction native to Enlightenment thinking.\n\nJewish culture in its etymological meaning retains linkage to the Jewish people's land of origin, the people named for the Kingdom of Judah, study of Jewish texts, practice of community charity, and Jewish history. The term \"secular Jewish culture\" therefore refers to many aspects, including: Religion and World View, Literature, Media, and Cinema, Art and Architecture, Cuisine and Traditional Dress, attitudes to Gender, Marriage, and Family, Social Customs and Lifestyles, Music and Dance. \"Secular Judaism,\" is a distinct phenomenon related to Jewish secularization - a historical process of divesting all of these elements of culture from their religious beliefs and practices.\n\nSecular Judaism, derived from the philosophy of Moses Mendelssohn, arose out of the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, which was itself driven by the values of the Enlightenment. In recent years, the academic field of study has encompassed Jewish Studies, History, Literature, Sociology, and Linguistics. Historian David Biale has traced the roots of Jewish secularism back to the pre-modern era. He, and other scholars highlight the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who was dubbed \"the renegade Jew who gave us modernity\" by scholar and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein in an intellectual biography of him. Today, the subject of Jewish secularization is taught, and researched, at many North American and Israeli universities, including Harvard, Tel Aviv University, UCLA, Temple University and City University of New York which have significant Jewish alumni. Additionally, many schools include the academic study of Judaism and Jewish culture in their curricula.\n\nThroughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world, in Europe before and after the Age of Enlightenment, in Al-Andalus, North Africa and the Middle East, in India and China, and in the contemporary United States and Israel, Jewish communities have seen the development of cultural phenomena that are characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews with host populations in the diaspora, and others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different variations of Jewish culture unique to their own communities.\n\nThere has not been a political unity of Jewish society since the united monarchy. Since then Israelite populations were always geographically dispersed (see Jewish diaspora), so that by the 19th century the Ashkenazi Jews were mainly in Eastern and Central Europe; the Sephardi Jews were largely spread among various communities in the Mediterranean region; Mizrahi Jews were primarily spread throughout Western Asia; and other populations of Jews were in Central Asia, Ethiopia, the Caucasus, and India. (See Jewish ethnic divisions.)\n\nAlthough there was a high degree of communication and traffic between these communities — many Sephardic exiles blended into the Ashkenazi communities in Central Europe following the Spanish Inquisition; many Ashkenazim migrated to the Ottoman Empire, giving rise to the characteristic Syrian-Jewish family name \"Ashkenazi\"; Iraqi-Jewish traders formed a distinct Jewish community in India; many of these populations were cut off to some degree from the surrounding cultures by ghettoization, by Muslim laws of \"dhimma\", and traditional discouragement of contact with polytheistic populations.\n\nMedieval Jewish communities in Eastern Europe continued to display distinct cultural traits over the centuries. Despite the universalist leanings of the Enlightenment (and its echo within Judaism in the Haskalah movement), many Yiddish-speaking Jews in Eastern Europe continued to see themselves as forming a distinct national group — \" 'am yehudi\", from the Biblical Hebrew — but, adapting this idea to Enlightenment values, they assimilated the concept as that of an ethnic group whose identity did not depend on religion, which under Enlightenment thinking fell under a separate category.\n\nConstantin Măciucă writes of \"a differentiated but not isolated Jewish spirit\" permeating the culture of Yiddish-speaking Jews. This was only intensified as the rise of Romanticism amplified the sense of national identity across Europe generally. Thus, for example, members of the General Jewish Labour Bund in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were generally non-religious, and one of the historical leaders of the Bund was the child of converts to Christianity, though not a practicing or believing Christian himself.\n\nThe Haskalah combined with the Jewish Emancipation movement under way in Central and Western Europe to create an opportunity for Jews to enter secular society. At the same time, pogroms in Eastern Europe provoked a surge of migration, in large part to the United States, where some 2 million Jewish immigrants resettled between 1880 and 1920.\nBy 1931, shortly before The Holocaust, 92% of the World's Jewish population was Ashkenazi in origin. Secularism originated in Europe as series of movements that militated for a new, heretofore unheard-of concept called \"secular Judaism\". For these reasons, much of what is thought of by English-speakers and, to a lesser extent, by non-English-speaking Europeans as \"secular Jewish culture\" is, in essence, the Jewish cultural movement that evolved in Central and Eastern Europe, and subsequently brought to North America by immigrants.\nDuring the 1940s, the Holocaust uprooted and destroyed most of the Jewish communities living in much of Europe. This, in combination with the creation of the State of Israel and the consequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, resulted in a further geographic shift.\n\nDefining secular culture among those who practice traditional Judaism is difficult, because the entire culture is, by definition, entwined with religious traditions: the idea of separate ethnic and religious identity is foreign to the Hebrew tradition of an \" 'am yisrael\". (This is particularly true for Orthodox Judaism.) Gary Tobin, head of the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, said of traditional Jewish culture:\nThe dichotomy between religion and culture doesn't really exist. Every religious attribute is filled with culture; every cultural act filled with religiosity. Synagogues themselves are great centers of Jewish culture. After all, what is life really about? Food, relationships, enrichment … So is Jewish life. So many of our traditions inherently contain aspects of culture. Look at the Passover Seder — it's essentially great theater. Jewish education and religiosity bereft of culture is not as interesting.\n\nYaakov Malkin, Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at Tel Aviv University and the founder and academic director of Meitar College for Judaism as Culture in Jerusalem, writes:\nToday very many secular Jews take part in Jewish cultural activities, such as celebrating Jewish holidays as historical and nature festivals, imbued with new content and form, or marking life-cycle events such as birth, bar/bat mitzvah, marriage, and mourning in a secular fashion. They come together to study topics pertaining to Jewish culture and its relation to other cultures, in \"havurot\", cultural associations, and secular synagogues, and they participate in public and political action coordinated by secular Jewish movements, such as the former movement to free Soviet Jews, and movements to combat pogroms, discrimination, and religious coercion. Jewish secular humanistic education inculcates universal moral values through classic Jewish and world literature and through organizations for social change that aspire to ideals of justice and charity.\n\nIn North America, the secular and cultural Jewish movements are divided into three umbrella organizations: the Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ), the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations (CSJO), and Workmen's Circle.\n\nJewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of Judaism. The Jewish philosophy is extended over several main eras in Jewish history, including the ancient and biblical era, medieval era and modern era (see Haskalah).\nThe ancient Jewish philosophy is expressed in the bible. According to Prof. Israel Efros the principles of the Jewish philosophy start in the bible, where the foundations of the Jewish monotheistic beliefs can be found, such as the belief in one god, the separation of god and the world and nature (as opposed to Pantheism) and the creation of the world. Other biblical writings that associated with philosophy are Psalms that contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current and Ecclesiastes that is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the Hebrew Bible; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning. Other writings related to philosophy can be found in the Deuterocanonical books such as Sirach and Book of Wisdom.\nDuring the Hellenistic era, Hellenistic Judaism aspired to combine Jewish religious tradition with elements of Greek culture and philosophy. The philosopher Philo used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize Greek philosophy with Jewish philosophy. His work attempts to combine Plato and Moses into one philosophical system. He developed an allegoric approach of interpreting holy scriptures (the bible), in contrast to (old-fashioned) literally interpretation approaches. His allegorical exegesis was important for several Christian Church Fathers and some scholars hold that his concept of the Logos as God's creative principle influenced early Christology. Other scholars, however, deny direct influence but say both Philo and Early Christianity borrow from a common source.\n\nBetween the Ancient era and the Middle Ages most of the Jewish philosophy concentrated around the Rabbinic literature that is expressed in the Talmud and Midrash. In the 9th century Saadia Gaon wrote the text Emunoth ve-Deoth which is the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism. The Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain included many influential Jewish philosophers such as Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, Isaac Abravanel, Nahmanides, Joseph Albo, Abraham ibn Daud, Nissim of Gerona, Bahya ibn Paquda, Abraham bar Hiyya, Joseph ibn Tzaddik, Hasdai Crescas and Isaac ben Moses Arama. The Most notable is Maimonides who is considered, beside the Jewish world, as a prominent philosopher and polymath in the Islamic and Western worlds. Outside of Spain, other philosophers are Natan'el al-Fayyumi, Elia del Medigo, Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi and Gersonides.\n\nPhilosophy by Jews in Modern era was expressed by philosophers, mainly in Europe, such as Baruch Spinoza founder of Spinozism, whose work included modern Rationalism and Biblical criticism and laying the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment. His work has earned him recognition as one of Western philosophy's most important thinkers; Others are Isaac Orobio de Castro, Tzvi Ashkenazi, David Nieto, Isaac Cardoso, Jacob Abendana, Uriel da Costa, Francisco Sanches and Moses Almosnino. A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of Moses Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn has been described as the \"'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism,\" just as new eras began with Moses the prophet and with Moses Maimonides. Mendelssohn was a German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been \"resistant to claim him as their spiritual father\". Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Germans and Jews. The Jewish Enlightenment philosophy included Menachem Mendel Lefin, Salomon Maimon and Isaac Satanow. The next 19th century comprised both secular and religious philosophy and included philosophers such as Elijah Benamozegh, Hermann Cohen, Moses Hess, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Samuel Hirsch, Nachman Krochmal, Samuel David Luzzatto, Nachman of Breslov founder of Breslov and Karl Marx founder of Marxist worldview. The 20th century included the notable philosophers Jacques Derrida, Karl Popper, Emmanuel Levinas, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Hilary Putnam, Alfred Tarski, Ludwig Wittgenstein, A. J. Ayer, Walter Benjamin, Raymond Aron, Theodor W. Adorno, Isaiah Berlin and Henri Bergson.\nA range of moral and political views is evident early in the history of Judaism, that serves to partially explain the diversity that is apparent among secular Jews who are often influenced by moral beliefs that can be found in Jewish scripture, and traditions. In recent centuries, secular Jews in Europe and the Americas have tended towards the liberal political left, and played key roles in the birth of the 19th century's labor movement and socialism. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the conservative side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support pluralism more consistently than many other elements of the political right. Some scholars attribute this to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, derived from Halakha. This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in diaspora countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed since 363 CE.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, European laws prevented Jews from owning land and gave them powerful incentive to go into other professions that the indigenous Europeans were not willing to follow. During the medieval period, there was a very strong social stigma against lending money and charging interest among the Christian majority. In most of Europe until the late 18th century, and in some places to an even later date, Jews were prohibited by Roman Catholic governments (and others) from owning land. On the other hand, the Church, because of a number of Bible verses (e.g., Leviticus 25:36) forbidding usury, declared that charging any interest was against the divine law, and this prevented any mercantile use of capital by pious Christians. As the Canon law did not apply to Jews, they were not liable to the ecclesiastical punishments which were placed upon usurers by the popes. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having a class of men like the Jews who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication, and so the money trade of western Europe by this means fell into the hands of the Jews.\n\nHowever, in almost every instance where large amounts were acquired by Jews through banking transactions the property thus acquired fell either during their life or upon their death into the hands of the king. This happened to Aaron of Lincoln in England, Ezmel de Ablitas in Navarre, Heliot de Vesoul in Provence, Benveniste de Porta in Aragon, etc. It was often for this reason that kings supported the Jews, and even objected to them becoming Christians (because in that case they could not be forced to give up money won by usury). Thus, both in England and in France the kings demanded to be compensated for every Jew converted. This type of royal trickery was one factor in creating the stereotypical Jewish role of banker and/or merchant.\n\nAs a modern system of capital began to develop, loans became necessary for commerce and industry. Jews were able to gain a foothold in the new field of finance by providing these services: as non-Catholics, they were not bound by the ecclesiastical prohibition against \"usury\"; and in terms of Judaism itself, Hillel had long ago re-interpreted the Torah's ban on charging interest, allowing interest when it's needed to make a living.\n\nThe strong Jewish tradition of religious scholarship often left Jews well prepared for secular scholarship. In some times and places, this was countered by banning Jews from studying at universities, or admitted them only in limited numbers (see Jewish quota). Over the centuries, Jews have been poorly represented among land-holding classes, but far better represented in academia, professions, finance, commerce and many scientific fields. The strong representation of Jews in science and academia is evidenced by the fact that 193 persons known to be Jews or of Jewish ancestry have been awarded the Nobel Prize, accounting for 22% of all individual recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2014. Of whom, 26% in physics, 22% in chemistry and 27% in Physiology or Medicine. In the fields of mathematics and computer science, 31% of Turing Award recipients and 27% of Fields Medal in mathematics were or are Jewish.\n\nThe early Jewish activity in science can be found in the Hebrew bible where some of the books contain descriptions of the physical world. Biblical cosmology provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a Biblical impression of the physical universe. There have been comparisons between the Bible, with passages such as from the Genesis creation narrative, and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally. The Old Testament also contains various cleansing rituals. One suggested ritual, for example, deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a leper (). It is a fairly elaborate process, which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy (), involving extensive cleansing and personal hygiene, but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed.\n\nThe Torah proscribes Intercropping (Lev. 19:19, Deut 22:9), a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern agricultural science. The Mosaic code has provisions concerning the conservation of natural resources, such as trees () and birds ().\n\nDuring Medieval era astronomy was a primary field among Jewish scholars and was widely studied and practiced. Prominent astronomers included Abraham Zacuto who published in 1478 his Hebrew book \"Ha-hibbur ha-gadol\" where he wrote about the solar system, charting the positions of the Sun, Moon and five planets. His work served Portugal's explorering journeys and was used by Vasco da Gama and also by Christopher Columbus. The lunar crater \"Zagut\" is named after Zacuto's name. The mathematician and astronomer Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi authored the first European book to include the full solution to the quadratic equation x2 - ax + b = 0, and influenced the work of Leonardo Fibonacci. Bar Hiyya proved by geometro-mechanical method of indivisibles the following equation for any circle: S = LxR/2, where S is the surface area, L is the circumference length and R is radius.\n\nGarcia de Orta, Portuguese Renaissance Jewish physician, was a pioneer of Tropical medicine. He published his work Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India in 1563, which deals with a series of substances, many of them unknown or the subject of confusion and misinformation in Europe at this period. He was the first European to describe Asiatic tropical diseases, notably cholera; he performed an autopsy on a cholera victim, the first recorded autopsy in India. Bonet de Lattes known chiefly as the inventor of an astronomical ring-dial by means of which solar and stellar altitudes can be measured and the time determined with great precision by night as well as by day. Other related personalities are Abraham ibn Ezra, whose the Moon crater \"Abenezra\" named after, David Gans, Judah ibn Verga, Mashallah ibn Athari an astronomer, The crater \"Messala\" on the Moon is named after him.\n\nAlbert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist and is considered as one of the most prominent scientists in history, often regarded as the \"father of modern physics\". His revolutionary work on the relativity theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century. When first published, relativity superseded a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton.\nIn the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.\nEinstein formulated the well-known Mass–energy equivalence, \"E = mc2\", and explained the photoelectric effect. His work also effected and influenced a large variety of fields of physics including the Big Bang theory (Einstein's General relativity influenced Georges Lemaître), Quantum mechanics and nuclear energy.\n\nThe Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II and many Jewish scientists had a significant role in the project. The theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, often considered as the \"father of the atomic bomb\", was chosen to direct the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1942. The physicist Leó Szilárd, that conceived the nuclear chain reaction; Edward Teller, \"the father of the hydrogen bomb\" and Stanislaw Ulam; Eugene Wigner contributed to theory of Atomic nucleus and Elementary particle; Hans Bethe whose work included Stellar nucleosynthesis and was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory; Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Victor Weisskopf and Joseph Rotblat.\n\nThe mathematician and physicist Alexander Friedmann pioneered the theory that universe was expanding governed by a set of equations he developed now known as the Friedmann equations. Arno Allan Penzias, the physicist and radio astronomer co-discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which helped establish the Big Bang theory, the scientists Robert Herman and Ralph Alpher had also worked on that field. In quantum mechanics Jewish role was significant as well and many of most influential figures and pioneers of the theory were Jewish: Niels Bohr and his work on the atom structure, Max Born (Schrödinger equation), Wolfgang Pauli, Richard Feynman (Quantum chromodynamics), Fritz London work on London dispersion force and London equations, Walter Heitler and Julian Schwinger work on Quantum electrodynamics, Asher Peres a pioneer in Quantum information, David Bohm (Quantum potential).\n\nSigmund Freud, known as the father of psychoanalysis, is one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. In creating psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious as an agency disruptive of conscious states of mind. Freud postulated the existence of libido, an energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt.\n\nJohn von Neumann, a mathematician and physicist, made major contributions to a number of fields, including foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, geometry, topology, numerical analysis, quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics and game theory. In made also a major work with computing and the development of the computer, he suggested and described a computer architecture called Von Neumann architecture and worked on linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. Emmy Noether was an influential mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. Described by many prominent scientists as the most important woman in the history of mathematics, she revolutionized the theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation laws.\n\nMore remarkable contributors include Heinrich Hertz and Steven Weinberg in Electromagnetism; Carl Sagan, his contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of Venus and known for his contributions to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life; Edward Witten (M-theory); Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau (Ginzburg–Landau theory); Yakir Aharonov (Aharonov–Bohm effect); Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR paradox);Moshe Carmeli (Gauge theory). Rudolf Lipschitz (Lipschitz continuity); Paul Cohen (Continuum hypothesis, Axiom of choice); Laurent Schwartz (theory of distribution); Grigory Margulis (Lie group); Richard M. Karp (Theory of computation); Adi Shamir (RSA, cryptography); Judea Pearl (Artificial intelligence, Bayesian network); Max Newman (Colossus computer); Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (Jacobi elliptic functions, Jacobian matrix and determinant, Jacobi symbol).

Land - inventor of Land Camera; Bob Kahn- inventor of TCP and IP; Bram Cohen- creator of Bittorent; Sergei Brin and Larry Page- creators of Google; Laszlo Biro - Ballpoint pen; Simcha Blass- Drip irrigation; Lee Felsenstein - designer of Osborne 1; Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans co-creators of PHP and founders of Zend Technologies; Ralph H. Baer, \"The Father of Video Games\".\n\nIn some places where there have been relatively high concentrations of Jews, distinct secular Jewish subcultures have arisen. For example, ethnic Jews formed an enormous proportion of the literary and artistic life of Vienna, Austria at the end of the 19th century, or of New York City 50 years later (and Los Angeles in the mid-late 20th century). Many of these creative Jews were not particularly religious people. In general, Jewish artistic culture in various periods reflected the culture in which they lived.\n\nLiterary and theatrical expressions of secular Jewish culture may be in specifically Jewish languages such as Hebrew, Yiddish or Ladino, or it may be in the language of the surrounding cultures, such as English or German. Secular literature and theater in Yiddish largely began in the 19th century and was in decline by the middle of the 20th century. The revival of Hebrew beyond its use in the liturgy is largely an early 20th-century phenomenon, and is closely associated with Zionism. Apart from the use of Hebrew in Israel, whether a Jewish community will speak a Jewish or non-Jewish language as its main vehicle of discourse is generally dependent on how isolated or assimilated that community is. For example, the Jews in the shtetls of Poland and the Lower East Side of New York during the early 20th century spoke Yiddish at most times, while assimilated Jews in 19th and early 20th-century Germany spoke German, and American-born Jews in the United States speak English.\n\nJewish authors have both created a unique Jewish literature and contributed to the national literature of many of the countries in which they live. Though not strictly secular, the Yiddish works of authors like Sholem Aleichem (whose collected works amounted to 28 volumes) and Isaac Bashevis Singer (winner of the 1978 Nobel Prize), form their own canon, focusing on the Jewish experience in both Eastern Europe, and in America. In the United States, Jewish writers like Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, and many others are considered among the greatest American authors, and incorporate a distinctly secular Jewish view into many of their works. The poetry of Allen Ginsberg often touches on Jewish themes (notably the early autobiographical works such as \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\"). Other famous Jewish authors that made contributions to world literature include Heinrich Heine, German poet, Mordecai Richler, Canadian author, Isaac Babel, Russian author, Franz Kafka, of Prague, and Harry Mulisch, whose novel \"The Discovery of Heaven\" was revealed by a 2007 poll as the \"Best Dutch Book Ever\".\n\nIn \"Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide\", Yaakov Malkin, Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at Tel Aviv University and the founder and academic director of Meitar College for Judaism as Culture in Jerusalem, writes:\nSecular Jewish culture embraces literary works that have stood the test of time as sources of aesthetic pleasure and ideas shared by Jews and non-Jews, works that live on beyond the immediate socio-cultural context within which they were created. They include the writings of such Jewish authors as Sholem Aleichem, Itzik Manger, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, S.Y. Agnon, Isaac Babel, Martin Buber, Isaiah Berlin, Haim Nahman Bialik, Yehuda Amichai, Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua, and David Grossman. It boasts masterpieces that have had a considerable influence on all of western culture, Jewish culture included - works such as those of Heinrich Heine, Gustav Mahler, Leonard Bernstein, Marc Chagall, Jacob Epstein, Ben Shahn, Amedeo Modigliani, Franz Kafka, Max Reinhardt (Goldman), Ernst Lubitsch, and Woody Allen.\n\nOther notable contributors are Isaac Asimov author of the \"Foundation series\" and others such as \"I, robot\", \"Nightfall\" and \"The Gods Themselves\"; Joseph Heller (\"Catch-22\"); R.L. Stine (\"Goosebumps\" series); J. D. Salinger (\"The Catcher in the Rye\"); Michael Chabon (\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\", \"The Yiddish Policemen's Union\"); Marcel Proust (\"In Search of Lost Time\"); Arthur Miller (\"Death of a Salesman\" and \"The Crucible\"); Will Eisner (\"A Contract with God\"); Shel Silverstein (\"The Giving Tree\"); Arthur Koestler (\"Darkness at Noon\", \"The Thirteenth Tribe\"); Saul Bellow (\"Herzog\"); The historical novel series \"The Accursed Kings\" by Maurice Druon is an inspiration for George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels.\n\nAnother aspect of Jewish literature is the ethical, called Musar literature. Among recipient of Nobel Prize in Literature, 13% were or are Jewish.\nHebrew poetry is expressed by various of poets in different eras of Jewish history. Biblical poetry is related to the poetry in biblical times as it expressed in the Hebrew bible and Jewish sacred texts. In medieval times the Jewish poetry was mainly expressed by piyyutim and several poets such as Yehuda Halevi, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra and Dunash ben Labrat. Modern Hebrew poetry is mostly related to the era of and after the revival of the Hebrew language, pioneered by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in the Haskalah era and succeeded by poets such as Hayim Nahman Bialik, Nathan Alterman and Shaul Tchernichovsky.\nThe Ukrainian Jew Abraham Goldfaden founded the first professional Yiddish-language theatre troupe in Iași, Romania in 1876. The next year, his troupe achieved enormous success in \nBucharest. Within a decade, Goldfaden and others brought Yiddish theater to Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Germany, New York City, and other cities with significant Ashkenazic populations. Between 1890 and 1940, over a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone, in the Yiddish Theater District, performing original plays, musicals, and Yiddish translations of theatrical works and opera. Perhaps the most famous of Yiddish-language plays is \"The Dybbuk\" (1919) by S. Ansky.\n\nYiddish theater in New York in the early 20th century rivalled English-language theater in quantity and often surpassed it in quality. A 1925 \"New York Times\" article remarks, \"…Yiddish theater… is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe. People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay Broadway prices on Second Avenue.\" This article also mentions other aspects of a New York Jewish cultural life \"in full flower\" at that time, among them the fact that the extensive New York Yiddish-language press of the time included seven daily newspapers.\n\nIn fact, however, the next generation of American Jews spoke mainly English to the exclusion of Yiddish; they brought the artistic energy of Yiddish theater into the American theatrical mainstream, but usually in a less specifically Jewish form.\n\nYiddish theater, most notably Moscow State Jewish Theater directed by Solomon Mikhoels, also played a prominent role in the arts scene of the Soviet Union until Stalin's 1948 reversal in government policy toward the Jews. (See Rootless cosmopolitan, Night of the Murdered Poets.)\n\nMontreal's Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre continues to thrive after 50 years of performance.\n\nFrom their Emancipation to World War II, Jews were very active and sometimes even dominant in certain forms of European theatre, and after the Holocaust many Jews continued to that cultural form. For example, in pre-Nazi Germany, where Nietzsche asked \"What good actor of today is not Jewish?\", acting, directing and writing positions were often filled by Jews. Both MacDonald and Jewish Tribal Review would generally be counted as anti-Semitic sources, but reasonably careful in their factual claims. \"In Imperial Berlin, Jewish artists could be found in the forefront of the performing arts, from high drama to more popular forms like cabaret and revue, and eventually film. Jewish audiences patronized innovative theater, regardless of whether they approved of what they saw.\" The British historian Paul Johnson, commenting on Jewish contributions to European culture at the Fin de siècle, writes that\nThe area where Jewish influence was strongest was the theatre, especially in Berlin. Playwrights like Carl Sternheim, Arthur Schnitzler, Ernst Toller, Erwin Piscator, Walter Hasenclever, Ferenc Molnár and Carl Zuckmayer, and influential producers like Max Reinhardt, appeared at times to dominate the stage, which tended to be modishly left-wing, pro-republican, experimental and sexually daring. But it was certainly not revolutionary, and it was cosmopolitan rather than Jewish.\nJews also made similar, if not as massive, contributions to theatre and drama in Austria, Britain, France, and Russia (in the national languages of those countries). Jews in Vienna, Paris and German cities found cabaret both a popular and effective means of expression, as German cabaret in the Weimar Republic \"was mostly a Jewish art form\". The involvement of Jews in Central European theatre was halted during the rise of the Nazis and the purging of Jews from cultural posts, though many emigrated to Western Europe or the United States and continued working there.\n\nIn the early 20th century the traditions of New York's vibrant Yiddish Theatre District both rivaled and fed into Broadway. In the English-speaking theatre Jewish émigrés brought novel theatrical ideas from Europe, such as the theatrical realist movement and the philosophy of Konstantin Stanislavski, whose teachings would influence many Jewish-American acting teachers such as the Yiddish theatre-trained acting theorist Stella Adler. Jewish immigrants were instrumental in the creation and development of the genre of musical theatre and earlier forms of theatrical entertainment in America, and would innovate the new, distinctly American, art form, the Broadway musical. \nBrandeis University Professor Stephen J. Whitfield has commented that \"More so than behind the screen, the talent behind the stage was for over half a century virtually the monopoly of one ethnic group. That is... [a] feature which locates Broadway at the center of Jewish culture\". New York University Professor Laurence Maslon says that \"There would be no American musical without Jews… Their influence is corollary to the influence of black musicians on jazz; there were as many Jews involved in the form\". Other writers, such as Jerome Caryn, have noted that musical theatre and other forms of American entertainment are uniquely indebted to the contributions of Jewish-Americans, since \"there might not have been a modern Broadway without the \"Asiatic horde\" of comedians, gossip columnists, songwriters, and singers that grew out of the ghetto, whether it was on the Lower East Side, Harlem (a Jewish ghetto before it was a black one), Newark, or Washington, D.C..\" Likewise, in the analysis of Aaron Kula, director of The Klezmer Company,\n…the Jewish experience has always been best expressed by music, and Broadway has always been an integral part of the Jewish-American experience… The difference is that one can expand the definition of \"Jewish Broadway\" to include an interdisciplinary roadway with a wide range of artistic activities packed onto one avenue--theatre, opera, symphony, ballet, publishing companies, choirs, synagogues and more. This vibrant landscape reflects the life, times and creative output of the Jewish-American artist.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries the European operetta, a precursor the musical, often featured the work of Jewish composers such as Paul Abraham, Leo Ascher, Edmund Eysler, Leo Fall, Bruno Granichstaedten, Jacques Offenbach, Emmerich Kalman, Sigmund Romberg, Oscar Straus and Rudolf Friml; the latter four eventually moved to the United States and produced their works on the New York stage. One of the librettists for Bizet's \"Carmen\" (not an operetta proper but rather a work of the earlier Opéra comique form) was the Jewish Ludovic Halévy, niece of composer Fromental Halévy (Bizet himself was not Jewish but he married the elder Halevy's daughter, many have suspected that he was the descendant of Jewish converts to Christianity, and others have noticed Jewish-sounding intervals in his music). The Viennese librettist Victor Leon summarized the connection of Jewish composers and writers with the form of operetta: \"The audience for operetta wants to laugh beneath tears—and that is exactly what Jews have been doing for the last two thousand years since the destruction of Jerusalem\". Another factor in the evolution of musical theatre was vaudeville, and during the early 20th century the form was explored and expanded by Jewish comedians and actors such as Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, The Marx Brothers, Anna Held, Al Jolson, Molly Picon, Sophie Tucker and Ed Wynn. During the period when Broadway was monopolized by revues and similar entertainments, Jewish producer Florenz Ziegfeld dominated the theatrical scene with his Follies.\n\nBy 1910 Jews (the vast majority of them immigrants from Eastern Europe) already composed a quarter of the population of New York City, and almost immediately Jewish artists and intellectuals began to show their influence on the cultural life of that city, and through time, the country as a whole. Likewise, while the modern musical can best be described as a fusion of operetta, earlier American entertainment and African-American culture and music, as well as Jewish culture and music, the actual authors of the first \"book musicals\" were the Jewish Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein II, George and Ira Gershwin, George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind. From that time until the 1980s a vast majority of successful musical theatre composers, lyricists, and book-writers were Jewish (a notable exception is the Protestant Cole Porter, who acknowledged that the reason he was so successful on Broadway was that he wrote what he called \"Jewish music\"). Rodgers and Hammerstein, Frank Loesser, Lerner and Loewe, Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Schwartz, Kander and Ebb and dozens of others during the \"Golden Age\" of musical theatre were Jewish. Since the Tony Award for Best Original Score was instituted in 1947, approximately 70% of nominated scores and 60% of winning scores were by Jewish composers. Of successful British and French musical writers both in the West End and Broadway, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Lionel Bart are Jewish, among others.\n\nOne explanation of the affinity of Jewish composers and playwrights to the musical is that \"traditional Jewish religious music was most often led by a single singer, a cantor while Christians emphasize choral singing.\"\nMany of these writers used the musical to explore issues relating to assimilation, the acceptance of the outsider in society, the racial situation in the United States, the overcoming of obstacles through perseverance, and other topics pertinent to Jewish Americans and Western Jews in general, often using subtle and disguised stories to get this point across. For example, Kern, Rodgers, Hammerstein, the Gershwins, Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg wrote musicals and operas aiming to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urging racial harmony; these works included \"Show Boat\", \"Porgy and Bess\", \"Finian's Rainbow\", \"South Pacific\" and \"The King and I\". Towards the end of Golden Age, writers also began to openly and overtly tackle Jewish subjects and issues, such as \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Rags\"; Bart's \"Blitz!\" also tackles relations between Jews and Gentiles. Jason Robert Brown and Alfred Uhry's \"Parade\" is a sensitive exploration of both anti-Semitism and historical American racism. The original concept that became \"West Side Story\" was set in the Lower East Side during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and Italian Catholic.\n\nThe ranks of prominent Jewish producers, directors, designers and performers include Boris Aronson, David Belasco, Joel Grey, the Minskoff family, Zero Mostel, Joseph Papp, Mandy Patinkin, the Nederlander family, Harold Prince, Max Reinhardt, Jerome Robbins, the Shubert family and Julie Taymor. Jewish playwrights have also contributed to non-musical drama and theatre, both Broadway and regional. Edna Ferber, Moss Hart, Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller and Neil Simon are only some of the prominent Jewish playwrights in American theatrical history. Approximately 34% of the plays and musicals that have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama were written and composed by Jewish Americans.\n\nThe Association for Jewish Theater is a contemporary organization that includes both American and international theaters that focus on theater with Jewish content. It has also expanded to include Jewish playwrights.\n\nThe earliest known Hebrew language drama was written around 1550 by a Jewish-Italian writer from Mantua. A few works were written by rabbis and Kabbalists in 17th-century Amsterdam, where Jews were relatively free from persecution and had both flourishing religious and secular Jewish cultures. All of these early Hebrew plays were about Biblical or mystical subjects, often in the form of Talmudic parables. During the post-Emancipation period in 19th-century Europe, many Jews translated great European plays such as those by Shakespeare, Molière and Schiller, giving the characters Jewish names and transplanting the plot and setting to within a Jewish context.\n\nModern Hebrew theatre and drama, however, began with the development of Modern Hebrew in Europe (the first Hebrew theatrical \"professional performance\" was in Moscow in 1918) and was \"closely linked with the Jewish national renaissance movement of the twentieth century. The historical awareness and the sense of primacy which accompanied the Hebrew theatre in its early years dictated the course of its artistic and aesthetic development\". These traditions were soon transplanted to Israel. Playwrights such as Natan Alterman, Hayyim Nahman Bialik, Leah Goldberg, Ephraim Kishon, Hanoch Levin, Aharon Megged, Moshe Shamir, Avraham Shlonsky, Yehoshua Sobol and A. B. Yehoshua have written Hebrew-language plays. Themes that are obviously common in these works are the Holocaust, the Arab–Israeli conflict, the meaning of Jewishness, and contemporary secular-religious tensions within Jewish Israel. The most well-known Hebrew theatre company and Israel's national theatre is the Habima (meaning \"the stage\" in Hebrew), which was formed in 1913 in Lithuania, and re-established in 1917 in Russia; another prominent Israeli theatre company is the Cameri Theatre, which is \"Israel's first and leading repertory theatre\".\n\nIn the era when Yiddish theatre was still a major force in the world of theatre, over 100 films were made in Yiddish. Many are now lost. Prominent films included \"Shulamith\" (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film \"His Wife's Lover\" (1931), \"A Daughter of Her People\" (1932), the anti-Nazi film \"The Wandering Jew\" (1933), \"The Yiddish King Lear\" (1934), \"Shir Hashirim\" (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time \"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" (1936), \"Where Is My Child?\" (1937), \"Green Fields\" (1937), \"Dybuk\" (1937), \"The Singing Blacksmith\" (1938), \"Tevya\" (1939), \"Mirele Efros\" (1939), \"Lang ist der Weg\" (1948), and \"God, Man and Devil\" (1950).\n\nThe roster of Jewish entrepreneurs in the English-language American film industry is legendary: Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, David O. Selznick, Marcus Loew, and Adolph Zukor, Fox to name just a few, and continuing into recent times with such industry giants as super-agent Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner, Lew Wasserman, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. However, few of these brought a specifically Jewish sensibility either to the art of film or, with the sometime exception of Spielberg, to their choice of subject matter. The historian Eric Hobsbawm described the situation as follows:\nA more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, or Woody Allen; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle \"Yentl\" (1983), or John Frankenheimer's \"The Fixer\" (1968).\n\nThe first radio chains, the Radio Corporation of America and the Columbia Broadcasting System, were created by the Jewish-American David Sarnoff and William S. Paley, respectively. These Jewish innovators were also among the first producers of televisions, both black-and-white and color. Among the Jewish immigrant communities of America there was also a thriving Yiddish language radio, with its \"golden age\" from the 1930s to the 1950s.\n\nAlthough there is little specifically Jewish television in the United States (National Jewish Television, largely religious, broadcasts only three hours a week), Jews have been involved in American television from its earliest days. From Sid Caesar and Milton Berle to Joan Rivers, Gilda Radner, and Andy Kaufman to Billy Crystal to Jerry Seinfeld, Jewish stand-up comedians have been icons of American television. Other Jews that held a prominent role in early radio and television were Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Walter Winchell and David Susskind. More figures are Larry King, Michael Savage and Howard Stern. In the analysis of Paul Johnson, \"The Broadway musical, radio and TV were all examples of a fundamental principle in Jewish diaspora history: Jews opening up a completely new field in business and culture, a \"tabula rasa\" on which to set their mark, before other interests had a chance to take possession, erect guild or professional fortifications and deny them entry.\"\n\nOne of the first televised situation comedies, \"The Goldbergs\" was set in a specifically Jewish milieu in the Bronx. While the overt Jewish milieu of \"The Goldbergs\" was unusual for an American television series, there were a few other examples, such as \"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1991–1993) and Bridget Loves Bernie. Jews have also played an enormous role among the creators and writers of television comedies: Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Selma Diamond, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, and Neil Simon all wrote for Sid Caesar; Reiner's son Rob Reiner worked with Norman Lear on \"All in the Family\" (which often engaged anti-semitism and other issues of prejudice); Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld created the hit sitcom \"Seinfeld\", Lorne Michaels, Al Franken, Rosie Shuster, and Alan Zweibel of \"Saturday Night Live\" breathed new life into the variety show in the 1970s.\n\nMore recently, American Jews have been instrumental to \"novelistic\" television series such as \"The Wire\" and \"The Sopranos\". Variously acclaimed as one of the greatest television series of all time, \"The Wire\" was created by David Simon. Simon also served as executive producer, head writer, and show runner. Matthew Weiner produced the fifth and sixth seasons of \"The Sopranos\" and later created \"Mad Men\".\nMore remarkable contributors are David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, creators of \"Game of Thrones\" TV series; Ron Leavitt co-creator of \"Married... with Children\"; Damon Lindelof and J. J. Abrams, co-creators of \"Lost\"; David Crane and Marta Kauffman, creators of \"Friends\"; Tim Kring creator of \"Heroes\"; Sydney Newman co-creator of \"Doctor Who\"; Darren Star, creator \"Sex and the City\" and \"Melrose Place\"; Aaron Spelling co-creator of \"Beverly Hills, 90210\"; Chuck Lorre, co-creator of \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Two and a Half Men\"; Gideon Raff, creator of \"Prisoners of War\" which \"Homeland\" is based on; Aaron Ruben and Sheldon Leonard co-creators of \"The Andy Griffith Show\"; Don Hewitt creator of \"60 Minutes\"; Garry Shandling, co-creator of \"The Larry Sanders Show\"; Ed. Weinberger, co-creator of \"The Cosby Show\"; David Milch, creator of \"Deadwood\"; Steven Levitan, co-creator of \"Modern Family\"; Dick Wolf, creator of \"Law & Order\"; David Shore, creator \"House\"; Max Mutchnick and David Kohan creators of \"Will & Grace\". There is also a significant role of Jews in acting by actors such as Sarah Jessica Parker, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Mila Kunis, Zac Efron, Hank Azaria, David Duchovny, Fred Savage, Zach Braff, Noah Wyle, Adam Brody, Katey Sagal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Michelle Trachtenberg, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow and Mayim Bialik.\n\nJewish musical contributions also tend to reflect the cultures of the countries in which Jews live, the most notable examples being classical and popular music in the United States and Europe. Some music, however, is unique to particular Jewish communities, such as Israeli music, Israeli Folk music, Klezmer, Sephardic and Ladino music, and Mizrahi music.\n\nBefore Emancipation, virtually all Jewish music in Europe was sacred music, with the exception of the performances of klezmorim during weddings and other occasions. The result was a lack of a Jewish presence in European classical music until the 19th century, with a very few exceptions, normally enabled by specific aristocratic protection, such as Salamone Rossi and Claude Daquin (the work of the former is considered the beginning of \"Jewish art music\"). After Jews were admitted to mainstream society in England (gradually after their return in the 17th century), France, Austria-Hungary, the German Empire, and Russia (in that order), the Jewish contribution to the European music scene steadily increased, but in the form of mainstream European music, not specifically Jewish music. Notable examples of Jewish Romantic composers (by country) are Charles-Valentin Alkan, Paul Dukas and Fromental Halevy from France, Josef Dessauer, Karl Goldmark and Gustav Mahler from Bohemia (most Austrian Jews during this time were native not to what is today Austria but the outer provinces of the Empire), Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer from Germany, and Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein from Russia. Singers included John Braham and Giuditta Pasta. There were very many notable Jewish violin and pianist virtuosi, including Joseph Joachim, Ferdinand David, Carl Tausig, Henri Herz, Leopold Auer, Jascha Heifetz, and Ignaz Moscheles. During the 20th century the number of Jewish composers and notable instrumentalists increased, as did their geographical distribution. Sample Jewish 20th-century composers include Arnold Schoenberg and Alexander von Zemlinsky from Austria, Hanns Eisler and Kurt Weill from Germany, Viktor Ullmann and Jaromír Weinberger from Bohemia and later the Czech Republic (the former perished at the Auschwitz extermination camps), George Gershwin and Aaron Copland from the United States, Darius Milhaud and Alexandre Tansman from France, Alfred Schnittke and Lera Auerbach from Russia, Lalo Schifrin and Mario Davidovsky from Argentina and Paul Ben-Haim and Shulamit Ran from Israel. There are some genres and forms of classical music that Jewish composers have been associated with, including notably during the Romantic period French Grand Opera. The most prolific composers of this genre included Giacomo Meyerbeer, Fromental Halévy, and the later Jacques Offenbach; Halevy's \"La Juive\" was based on Scribe's libretto very loosely connected to the Jewish experience.\n\nWhile orchestral and operatic music works by Jewish composers would in general be considered secular, many Jewish (as well as non-Jewish) composers have incorporated Jewish themes and motives into their music. Sometimes this is done covertly, such as the klezmer band music that many critics and observers believe lies in the third movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 1, and this type of Jewish reference was most common during the 19th century when openly displaying one's Jewishness would most likely hamper a Jew's chances at assimilation. During the 20th century, however, many Jewish composers wrote music with direct Jewish references and themes, e.g. David Amram (\"Symphony – \"Songs of the Soul\"\"), Leonard Bernstein (\"Kaddish Symphony\", \"Chichester Psalms\"), Ernest Bloch (\"Schelomo\"), Arnold Schoenberg, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (\"Violin Concerto no. 2\") Kurt Weill (\"The Eternal Road\") and Hugo Weisgall (\"Psalm of the Instant Dove\").\n\nIn the late twentieth century, prominent composers like Morton Feldman, Gyorgy Ligeti or Alfred Schnittke gave significant contributions to the history of contemporary music\n\nThe great songwriters and lyricists of American traditional popular music and jazz standards were predominantly Jewish, including Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Frank Loesser, Richard Rodgers, Philip Glass and Irving Berlin.\n\nDeriving from Biblical traditions, Jewish dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions. Each Jewish diasporic community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events. For Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe, for example, dances, whose names corresponded to the different forms of klezmer music that were played, were an obvious staple of the wedding ceremony of the shtetl. Jewish dances both were influenced by surrounding Gentile traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time. \"Nevertheless the Jews practiced a corporeal expressive language that was highly differentiated from that of the non-Jewish peoples of their neighborhood, mainly through motions of the hands and arms, with more intricate legwork by the younger men.\" In general, however, in most religiously traditional communities, members of the opposite sex dancing together or dancing at times other than at these events was frowned upon.\n\nJewish humor is the long tradition of humor in Judaism dating back to the Torah and the Midrash, but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal, frequently self-deprecating and often anecdotal humor originating in Europe. Jewish humor took root in the United States over the last hundred years, beginning with vaudeville, and continuing through radio, stand-up, film, and television. A significant number of American comedians have been or are Jewish.\n\nCompared to music or theater, there is less of a specifically Jewish tradition in the visual arts. The most likely and accepted reason is that, as has been previously shown with Jewish music and literature, before Emancipation Jewish culture was dominated by the religious tradition of aniconism. As most Rabbinical authorities believed that the Second Commandment prohibited much visual art that would qualify as \"graven images\", Jewish artists were relatively rare until they lived in assimilated European communities beginning in the late 18th century. It should be noted however, that despite fears by early religious communities of art being used for idolatrous purposes, Jewish \"sacred\" art is recorded in the Tanakh and extends throughout Jewish Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The Tabernacle and the two Temples in Jerusalem form the first known examples of \"Jewish art\". During the first centuries of the Common Era, Jewish religious art also was created in regions surrounding the Mediterranean such as Syria and Greece, including frescoes on the walls of synagogues, of which the Dura Europas Synagogue was the only survivor, prior to its destruction by ISIL in 2017, as well as the Jewish catacombs in Rome.\nA Jewish tradition of illuminated manuscripts in at least Late Antiquity has left no survivors, but can be deduced from borrowings in Early Medieval Christian art. A number of luxury pieces of gold glass from the later Roman period have Jewish motifs. Several Hellenistic-style floor mosaics have also been excavated in synagogues from Late Antiquity in Israel and Palestine, especially of the signs of the Zodiac, which was apparently acceptable in a low-status position on the floor. Some, such as that at Naaran, show evidence of a reaction against images of living creatures around 600 CE. The decoration of sarcophagi and walls at the cave cemetery at Beit She'arim shows a mixture of Jewish and Hellenistic motifs. However, for a period of several centuries between about 700 and 1100 CE there are scarcely any survivals of identifiably Jewish art.\n\nMiddle Age Rabbinical and Kabbalistic literature also contain textual and graphic art, most famously illuminated haggadahs such as the Sarajevo Haggadah, and other manuscripts like the Nuremberg Mahzor. Some of these were illustrated by Jewish artists and some by Christians; equally some Jewish artists and craftsmen in various media worked on Christian commissions. Outside of Europe, Yemenite Jewish silversmiths developed a distinctive style of finely wrought silver that is admired for its artistry. Johnson again summarizes this sudden change from a limited participation by Jews in visual art (as in many other arts) to a large movement by them into this branch of European cultural life:\nAgain, the arrival of the Jewish artist was a strange phenomenon. It is true that, over the centuries, there had been many animals (though few humans) depicted in Jewish art: lions on Torah curtains, owls on Judaic coins, animals on the Capernaum capitals, birds on the rim of the fountain-basis in the 5th century Naro synagogue in Tunis; there were carved animals, too, on timber synagogues in eastern Europe - indeed the Jewish wood-carver was the prototype of the modern Jewish plastic artist. A book of Yiddish folk-ornament, printed at Vitebsk in 1920, was similar to Chagall's own bestiary. But the resistance of pious Jews to portraying the living human image was still strong at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThere were few Jewish \"secular\" artists in Europe prior to the Emancipation that spread throughout Europe with the Napoleonic conquests. There were exceptions, and Salomon Adler was a prominent portrait painter in 18th-century Milan. The delay in participation in the visual arts parallels the lack of Jewish participation in European classical music until the nineteenth century, and which was progressively overcome with the rise of Modernism in the 20th century. There were many Jewish artists in the 19th century, but Jewish artistic activity boomed during the end of World War I. The Jewish artistic Renaissance has its roots in the 1901 Fifth Zionist Congress, which included an art exhibition featuring Jewish artists E.M. Lilien and Hermann Struck. The exhibition helped legitimize art as an expression of Jewish culture. According to Nadine Nieszawer, \"Until 1905, Jews were always plunged into their books but from the first Russian Revolution, they became emancipated, committed themselves in politics and became artists. A real Jewish cultural rebirth\". Individual Jews figured in the modern artistic movements of Europe— With the exception of those living in isolated Jewish communities, most Jews listed here as contributing to secular Jewish culture also participated in the cultures of the peoples they lived with and nations they lived in. In most cases, however, the work and lives of these people did not exist in two distinct cultural spheres but rather in one that incorporated elements of both.\n\nDuring the early 20th century Jews figured particularly prominently in the Montparnasse movement, and after World War II among the abstract expressionists: Alexander Bogen, Helen Frankenthaler, Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston, Al Held, Lee Krasner, Barnett Newman, Milton Resnick, Jack Tworkov, Mark Rothko, and Louis Schanker as well as among Contemporary artists, Modernists and Postmodernists. Many Russian Jews were prominent in the art of scenic design, particularly the aforementioned Chagall and Aronson, as well as the revolutionary Léon Bakst, who like the other two also painted. One Mexican Jewish artist was Pedro Friedeberg; historians disagree as to whether Frida Kahlo's father was Jewish or Lutheran. Gustav Klimt was not Jewish, but nearly all of his patrons and several of his models were. Among major artists Chagall may be the most specifically Jewish in his themes. But as art fades into graphic design, Jewish names and themes become more prominent: Leonard Baskin, Al Hirschfeld, Ben Shahn, Art Spiegelman and Saul Steinberg.\n\nJews have also played a very important role in medias other than painting; in photography some notable figures are André Kertész, Robert Frank, Helmut Newton, Garry Winogrand, Cindy Sherman, Steve Lehman, and Adi Nes; in installation art and street art some notable figures are Sigalit Landau, Dede, and Michal Rovner.\n\nGraphic art, as expressed in the art of comics, has been a key field for Jewish artists as well. In the Golden and Silver ages of American comic books, the Jewish role was overwhelming and large number of the medium's foremost creators have been Jewish.\n\nMax Gaines was a pioneering figure in the creation of the modern comic book when in 1935 he published the first one called \"Famous Funnies\". In 1939, he founded, with Jack Liebowitz and Harry Donenfeld, All-American Publications (the AA Group). The publication is known for the creation of several superheroes such as the original \"Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman\", and \"Wonder Woman\". Donenfeld and Liebowitz were also the owners of National Allied Publications which distributed \"Detective Comics\" and \"Action Comics\". That company was also a precursor of DC Comics.\n\nIn 1939, the pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman formed Timely Publications, a company to be known, since the 1960s, as Marvel Comics. At Marvel, Artists such as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber and Joe Simon created a large variety of characters and cultural icons including \"Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Daredevil\", and the teams \"Fantastic Four, Avengers\", \"X-Men\" (including many of its characters) and \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\". Stan Lee attributed the Jewish role in comics to the Jewish culture.\n\nAt DC Comics Jewish role was significant as well; the character of \"Superman\", which was created by the Jewish artists Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, is partly based on the biblical figure of Samson. It was also suggested the Superman is partly influenced by Moses, and other Jewish elements.\nMore at DC Comics are Bob Kane, Bill Finger and Martin Nodell, creators of \"Green Lantern, Batman\" and many related characters as \"Robin, The Joker, Riddler, Scarecrow\" and \"Catwoman\"; Gil Kane, co-creator of \"Atom\" and \"Iron Fist\".\nMany of those involved in the later ages of comics are also Jewish, such as Julius Schwartz, Joe Kubert, Jenette Kahn, Len Wein, Peter David, Neil Gaiman, Chris Claremont and Brian Michael Bendis. There is also a large amount of Jewish characters among comics superheroes such as \"Magneto, Quicksilver, Kitty Pryde, The Thing, Sasquatch, Sabra, Ragman, Legion\", and \"Moon Knight\", of whom were and are influenced by events in Jewish history and elements of Jewish life.\n\nIn 1944, Max Gaines founded \"EC Comics\". The company is known for specializing in horror fiction, crime fiction, satire, military fiction and science fiction from the 1940s through the mid-1950s, notably the \"Tales from the Crypt\" series, \"The Haunt of Fear\", \"The Vault of Horror\", \"Crime SuspenStories\" and \"Shock SuspenStories\". Jewish artists that are associated with the publisher include Al Feldstein, Dave Berg, and Jack Kamen.\n\nWill Eisner was an American cartoonist and was known as one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry. He is the creator of the \"Spirit\" comics series and the graphic novel \"A Contract with God\". The Eisner Award was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium.\n\nIn 1952, William Gaines and Harvey Kurtzman founded \"Mad\", an American humor magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1970s circulation peak. Other known cartoonists are Lee Falk creator of \"The Phantom\" and \"Mandrake the Magician\"; The Hebrew comics of Michael Netzer creator of Uri-On and Uri Fink creator of Zbeng!; William Steig, creator of \"Shrek!\"; Daniel Clowes, creator of \"Eightball\"; Art Spiegelman creator of graphic novel \"Maus\" and \"Raw\" (with Françoise Mouly).\n\nIn animation, Jewish animators role is expressed by many: Genndy Tartakovsky is the creator of several animation TV series such as \"Dexter's Laboratory\" and \"Samurai Jack\"; Matt Stone co-creator of \"South Park\"; David Hilberman who helped animate \"Bambi\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\"; Friz Freleng, \"Looney Tunes\"; Ralph Bakshi, \"Fritz the Cat, , Wizards, The Lord of the Rings, Heavy Traffic, Coonskin, Hey Good Lookin', Fire and Ice\", and \"Cool World\"; Alex Hirsch, creator of \"Gravity Falls\"; Dave Fleischer and Lou Fleischer, founders of \"Fleischer Studios\"; Max Fleischer, animation of \"Betty Boop\", \"Popeye\" and \"Superman\". Several companies producing animation were founded by Jews, such as \"DreamWorks\", which its products include \"Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\"; \"Warner Bros.\", which its animation division is known for cartoons such as \"Looney Tunes, Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain\" and \"Freakazoid!\" .\n\nJewish cooking combines the food of many cultures in which Jews have settled, including Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Spanish, German and Eastern European styles of cooking, all influenced by the need for food to be kosher. Thus, \"Jewish\" foods like bagels, hummus, stuffed cabbage, and blintzes all come from various other cultures. The amalgam of these foods, plus uniquely Jewish contributions like tzimmis, cholent, gefilte fish and matzah balls, make up Jewish cuisine.\n\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard.\n\nDated 7 February 1965, it lays out ten points concerning the exact application and preservation of \"Standard Tech\" in Dianetics and Scientology, and the eradication of \"non-standard tech\", more commonly referred to in Scientology as \"squirreling.\"\n\nIt is one of the most important and oft-repeated policies in Scientology. It was the principal subject discussed by Tom Cruise in his leaked video of January 2008.\n\n\nThe ten directives Hubbard listed in the 1965 policy letter, when considered as a whole, “seek to ensure the proper and continued application of Scientology “standard tech” along with the eradication of anything counter to it,” according to \"Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy.\"\n\nL. Ron Hubbard claims that the main stumbling blocks he listed all pertain to \"incorrect technologies\" and \"incorrect applications\" listed in the last four items. He claims that the reasons for the problems with the last four items are due to poor certainty that the \"technology\" works, people with low IQs, people trying to \"defend themselves against anything they confront\", and \"the bank\" (Scientology jargon which basically refers to the \"reactive mind\" that supposedly contains negative memories), which defends itself by trying to \"knock out the good and perpetuate the bad.\"\n\nHubbard states, \"I know what a group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable 'technology'. By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology.\" He also states, \"See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.\" The remainder of the document is further justifications for why \"incorrect technologies and applications\" have to be ruthlessly hammered out of existence to keep Scientology working, including one example where Hubbard claims that a failure to do this for one student of Scientology meant that \"his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse.\"\n\nIn Janet Reitman’s \"Inside Scientology\", she quotes Hubbard: “Never let anyone be half-minded about being Scientologists,” he wrote in Keeping Scientology Working. “When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined for the duration of the universe – never permit an ‘open-minded approach.”\n\nAccording to scholar Shannon Trosper Schorey, the KSW “was a statement of the re-assertion of official church control over the proliferation of adaptations and interpretations of church practice.” At the core of KSW is “the mandate that Scientology technology must at all times be practiced in consonance with official Church of Scientology guidelines.”\n\nThe German Office for the Protection of the Constitution has cited this passage as one of its reasons for designating Scientology an organization opposed to the democratic order.\n\nIn a section on KSW point 4 \"teaching correctly the correct technology\" Hubbard states: \"The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs (organisations) where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles... When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists..The proper instruction attitude is, 'You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" This last sentence has been cited in a report by the state government of Baden-Württemberg, as evidence that Scientology represents a totalitarian ideology.\n"}

The pillars or columns were made of brown sandstone; the structure itself was \"perhaps connected to a small temple on the East Bank [of the Nile] which was still in existence in 1813.\" \n\nThis charming kiosk has now been moved to the site of New Kalabsha in Southern Egypt but \"once stood to the entrance to the sandstone quarries\" of Qertassi. Its capitals \"are decorated with Hathor heads, in honour of the goddess who was [the] patron of quarry-men and miners. Since Hathor was often associated with Isis, as she is at Philae, it has been suggested that \"this kiosk and the small temples of Dabod and Dendur were way stations on the processional route taken by priests bearing the image of Isis around Lower Nubia, which was held to be her estate.\" Due to the paucity of timber in the arid region of Nubia, the kiosk's roof was constructed with sandstone slabs that were supported by architraves on its long sides.\n\n"}

Since 2012 LSJS also offers rabbinical training, returning to its roots. \n\nMany leading figures in British Jewry have been associated with the School, including Michael Friedländer, Principal from 1865 to 1907; Isidore Epstein, Principal 1948–1961; Louis Jacobs, Moral Tutor 1959–1961; and in recent years Jonathan Sacks (later Lord Sacks), Principal 1984–1990.\n\nThe London School of Jewish Studies was founded as Jews' College in 1855, a rabbinical seminary in London. The organisation was re-focussed and given its present name in 1999, with an emphasis on providing a broader range of adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community. The rabbinical training programme was suspended, and much of the historical holdings of the library were sold off. LSJS has had growing success in its new role, and since 2012 once again offers rabbinical training, in partnership with the programme set up by the London Sephardi community.\n\nJews' College was opened in Finsbury Square, London as a rabbinical seminary in 1855 with the support of Chief Rabbi Nathan Adler and of Sir Moses Montefiore, who had conceived the idea for such a venture as early as 1841. The college quickly established itself as a place where high quality rabbinical training was available and its alumni and staff often became prominent in Anglo-Jewry.\n\nIn 1881, the College moved to larger premises in Tavistock Square, close to University College, where it was envisaged that Jews’ College students would be able to combine their religious studies and university studies to degree level. As early as 1904, the University of London granted an Honours degree in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of the candidates being from Jews’ College. In 1932, with the building of Woburn House, a centre for Anglo-Jewry, still in Tavistock Square, Jews' College moved again.\n\nDuring the Second World War, despite the bombing of London, the College kept its doors open. Apart from the rabbinical studies and degree course, Chazzanut courses and teacher training programmes were now offered.\n\nIn 1954, the College moved, yet again, to larger premises in Montagu Place. That building in central London was sold in the early 1980s, and now houses the Embassy of Sweden. The College operated from temporary premises at Finchley Synagogue for a number of years, under the leadership of Rabbi Dr Nahum Rabinovitch. Under the auspices of Rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks and with the financial backing of Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the College relocated in 1984 to its current building, now known as Schaller House, in Hendon, North-West London, close to the hub of London’s Jewish community.\n\nIn 1998, the University of London announced that it would be terminating the \"Associated Institute\" status that the College and three other small institutions enjoyed. Jews' College was forced to seek an academic partner within the University in order to be able to continue its degree programmes. Without the freedom to determine its own curriculum and the financial security that came from student fee income, it became increasingly difficult for the College to survive in its previous form. Rabbinic training was also uneconomic as many students looked to the Torah centres of Israel and America for their education and the number of available rabbinic posts in the UK decreased.\n\nIn 2002, the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) decided to terminate its relationship with LSJS, which threatened the organisation's status. A small team of young community leaders and educators, led by the late Marc Weinberg, presented the then Chair of Council, Howard Stanton, with a proposal to use the human and financial resources available to refocus the School's activities and to secure its future as a hub of academic study and lifelong learning, catering to a wide spectrum of the community.\n\nSince then, under the leadership of Dr Raphael Zarum and Dr Tamra Wright, LSJS has welcomed hundreds of students to a range of academic courses and events. In addition to numerous community focused offerings, more formal programs include:\n\nThe London School of Jewish Studies also houses the synagogue Alei Tzion. The synagogue refers to itself as a \"young and vibrant congregation \". Services take place regularly. These include; Shacharit, Mincha and Maariv prayer. The highlight of the week are the complete shabbat services which include 2 children's services.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28128359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28128359", "title": "Madeline Montalban", "text": "Madeline Montalban\n\nMadeline Montalban (born Madeline Sylvia Royals; 8 January 1910 – 11 January 1982) was an English astrologer and ceremonial magician. She co-founded the esoteric organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of Luciferianism.\n\nBorn in Blackpool, Lancashire, Montalban moved to London in the early 1930s, immersing herself in the city's esoteric subculture, and influenced by Hermeticism she taught herself ceremonial magic. She associated with significant occultists, including Thelemites like Aleister Crowley and Kenneth Grant, and Wiccans like Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders. From 1933 to 1953 she published articles on astrology and other esoteric topics in the magazine \"London Life\", and from then until her death in the nationally syndicated magazine \"Prediction\". These were accompanied by several booklets on astrology, released using a variety of different pseudonyms, including Dolores North, Madeline Alvarez and Nina del Luna.\n\nIn 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. After moving to Southsea in Hampshire, they founded the OMS as a correspondence course in 1956, teaching subscribers their own magical rites. Viewing Lucifer as a benevolent angelic deity, she believed Luciferianism had its origins in ancient Babylon, and encouraged her followers to contact angelic beings associated with the planetary bodies to aid their spiritual development. After her relationship with Heron ended in 1964, she returned to London, continuing to propagate the OMS. She settled in the St. Giles district, where she became known to the press as \"The Witch of St. Giles\". She died of lung cancer in 1982.\n\nHaving refused to publish her ideas in books, Montalban became largely forgotten following her death, although the OMS continued under new leadership. Her life and work was mentioned in various occult texts and historical studies of esotericism during subsequent decades; a short biography by Julia Philips was published by the Atlantis Bookshop in 2012.\n\nMadeline Sylvia Royals was born on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's involvement in the First World War, although she appears to have had a strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H. Rider Haggard and E. T. A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.\n\nIn the early 1930s, she left Blackpool, and moved south to London. Her reasons for doing so have never been satisfactorily explained, and she would offer multiple, contradictory accounts of her reasoning in later life. According to one account, her father sent her to study with the famed occultist and mystic Aleister Crowley, who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noted that while she met Crowley in London, this story remains implausible. Another of Montalban's accounts held that she moved to the capital to work for the \"Daily Express\" newspaper; this claim has never been corroborated, and one of the paper's reporters at the time, Justine Glass, has claimed that she never remembered Montalban working there. Montalban often changed her stories, and informed later disciple Michael Howard that upon arrival in London, the \"Daily Express\" sent her to interview Crowley. According to this story, when she first visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was suffering from an asthma attack, and having had experience with this ailment from a family member she was able to help him, earning his gratitude. They subsequently went to the expensive Café Royal in Regent Street, where after their lunch, he revealed that he was unable to pay, leaving Montalban to sort out payment.\n\nAlthough her own accounts of the initial meeting are unreliable, Montalban met with Crowley, embracing the city's occult scene. Having a deep interest in western esotericism, she read widely on the subject, and taught herself the practice of magic rather than seeking out the instruction of a teacher. She was particularly interested in astrology, and in 1933 wrote her first article on the subject for the magazine \"London Life\", entitled \"The Stars in the Heavens\". Her work continued to see publication in that magazine until 1953, during which time she used different pseudonyms: Madeline Alvarez, Dolores del Castro, Michael Royals, Regina Norcliff, Athene Deluce, Nina de Luna, and the best known, Madeline Montalban, which she created based upon the name of a film star whom she liked, the Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán.\n\nBy the end of the 1930s, Montalban was living on Grays Inn Road in the Borough of Holborn. In 1939, she married fireman George Edward North in London. They had a daughter, Rosanna, but their relationship deteriorated and he left her for another woman. She later informed friends that during the Second World War, George had served in the Royal Navy while she served in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), although such claims have never been corroborated. Gerald Gardner, founder of Gardnerian Wicca – known for his unreliable stories – claimed that he met Montalban during the war, when she was wearing a WRNS uniform, and that at the time she was working as a \"personal clairvoyant and psychic advisor\" to Lord Louis Mountbatten. Various individuals who knew her would comment that she had in her possession a framed blurry picture of Mountbatten with an individual who looked like her.\n\nShe continued her publication of articles under an array of pseudonyms in \"London Life\", and from February 1947 was responsible for a regular astrological column entitled \"You and Your Stars\" under the name of Nina del Luna. She also undertook other work, and in the late 1940s, Michael Houghton, proprietor of Bloomsbury's esoteric-themed Atlantis Bookshop, asked her to edit a manuscript of Gardner's novel \"High Magic's Aid\", which was set in the Late Middle Ages and which featured practitioners of a Witch-Cult; Gardner later alleged that the book contained allusions to the ritual practices of the New Forest coven of Pagan Witches who had initiated him into their ranks in 1939. Gardner incorrectly believed that Montalban \"claimed to be a Witch; but got wrong\" although he credited her with having \"a lively imagination.\" Although initially seeming favourable to Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be \"a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert.\" She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, Charles Cardell, although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the Alexandrian Wiccan tradition, Alex Sanders and his wife, Maxine Sanders, who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices. She personally despised being referred to as a \"witch\", and was particularly angry when the esoteric magazine \"Man, Myth and Magic\" referred to her as \"The Witch of St. Giles\", an area of Central London which she would later inhabit.\n\nIn his 1977 book \"Nightside of Eden\", the Thelemite Kenneth Grant, then leader of the Typhonian OTO, told a story in which he claimed that both he and Gardner performed rituals in the St. Giles flat of a \"Mrs. South\", probably a reference to Montalban, who often used the pseudonym of \"Mrs North\". The truthfulness of Grant's claims have been scrutinised by both Doreen Valiente and Julia Philips, who have pointed out multiple incorrect assertions with his account.\n\nFrom August 1953, Montalban ceased working for \"London Life\", publishing her work in the magazine \"Prediction\", one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for \"Prediction\". Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's \"Your Stars and Love\" and Madeline Alvarez's \"Love and the Stars\". She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.\nIn 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An engraver, photographer and former journalist for the \"Brighton Argus\", he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or \"Ordo Stella Matutina\" (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained \"The Book of Lumiel\", a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.\n\nShe encouraged members of her OMS course to come and meet with her, and developed friendships with a number of them, blurring the distinction between teacher and pupil. Meetings of OMS members were informal, and rarely for ritual, with the majority of the organisation's rites requiring solitary work. According to later members of her Order, Montalban's basis was in Hermeticism, although she was heavily influenced by Mediaeval and Early Modern grimoires like the \"Picatrix\", \"Corpus Hermeticum\", \"The Heptameron\" of Pietro d'Abano, \"The Key of Solomon\", \"The Book of Abramelin\", and Cornelius Agrippa's \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\". Unlike the founders of several older ceremonial magic organisations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn or the Fraternity of the Inner Light, she did not claim any authority from higher spiritual beings such as the Ascended masters or Secret Chiefs. She believed that the Luciferian religion had its origin among the Chaldean people of ancient Babylon in the Middle East, and believed that in a former life, the OMS's members had been \"initiates of the Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian priesthood\" from where they had originally known each other. She considered herself the reincarnation of King Richard III, and was a member of the Richard III Society; on one occasion, she visited the site of Richard's death at the Battle of Bosworth with fellow OMS members, wearing a suit of armour. In March 1964, Montalban broke from her relationship with Heron, and moved back to London.\n\nFrom 1964 until 1966 she dwelt in a flat at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, which was owned by the husband of one of her OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles district of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, as well as to the British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for \"Prediction\". After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in \"Prediction\" and \"Prediction Annual\" until summer 2012.\n\nIn 1967, Michael Howard, a young man interested in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in \"Prediction\"; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that she could see the \"Mark of Cain\" in his aura. She invited him to become a student of the ONS, which he duly did. Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a \"magical mystery tour\" to the West Country, visiting Stonehenge, Boscastle and Tintagel. In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently \"hit a stormy period\" with the pair going \"[their] own ways for several years.\"\n\nA lifelong smoker, Montalban developed lung cancer, causing her death on 11 January 1982. The role of sorting out her financial affairs fell to her friend, Pat Arthy, who discovered that despite her emphasis on the magical attainment of material wealth, she owned no property and that her estate was worth less than £10,000. The copyright of her writings fell to her daughter, Rosanna, who entrusted the running of the OMS to two of Montalban's initiates, married couple Jo Sheridan and Alfred Douglas, who were authorised as the exclusive publishers of her correspondence course. Sheridan – whose real name was Patricia Douglas – opened an alternative therapy centre in Islington, North London, in the 1980s, before retiring to Rye, East Sussex in 2002, where she continued running the OMS correspondence course until her death in 2011.\n\nAccording to her biographer Julia Philips, Montalban had been described by her magical students as \"tempestuous, generous, humorous, demanding, kind, capricious, talented, volatile, selfish, goodhearted, [and] dramatic\". Philips noted that she was a woman who made a \"definite impression\" in all those whom she encountered, but who equally could be quite shy and disliked being interviewed in anything other than print. Philips asserted that Montalban had a \"mercurial personality\" and could be kind and generous at one moment and fly into a violent temper the next. Several of her friends noted that she was prudish when it came to sexual matters, and her friend Maxine Sanders stated that even as an elderly lady Montalban boasted of only taking men under the age of twenty-five as her lovers. She would take great pleasure in causing arguments, particularly between a couple who were romantically involved.\n\nDescribing herself as a \"pagan\", Montalban's personal faith was Luciferian in basis, revolving around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel. Montalban considered astrology to be a central part of her religious worldview, and always maintained that one could be a good magician only if they had mastered astrology. Her correspondence course focused around the seven planetary bodies that were known in the ancient world and the angelic beings that she associated with them: Michael (Sun), Gabriel (Moon), Samael (Mars), Raphael (Mercury), Sachiel (Jupiter), Anael (Venus) and Cassiel (Saturn). Each of these beings was in turn associated with certain days, hours, minerals, plants, and animals, each of which could be used in the creation of talismans that invoked the angelic power. Montalban disliked the theatrical use of props and rites in ceremonial magic, such as that performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, preferring a more simplistic use of ritual.\n\nIn his book on the history of Wicca, \"The Triumph of the Moon\" (1999), historian Ronald Hutton of Bristol University noted that Montalban was \"one of England's most prominent occultists\" of the 20th century. Michael Howard referred to Montalban's teachings in his book on Luciferian mythology, \"The Book of Fallen Angels\" (2004), with religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius noting that Howard played an \"important [role] in furthering an interest\" in Montalban's ideas.\n\nIn 2012, Neptune Press – the publishing arm of Bloomsbury's Atlantis Bookshop – published a short biography of Montalban entitled \"Madeline Montalban: The Magus of St Giles\", written by Anglo-Australian Wiccan Julia Philips. Philips noted that for much of the project she found it difficult separating fact from fiction when it came to Montalban's life, but that she had been able to nevertheless put together a biographical account, albeit an incomplete one, of \"one of the truly great characters of English occultism.\"\n"}

The attendance is nine people, after an evangelistic campaign conducted on May 28, by Dr. Othoniel Rios Paredes, Pastor of Elim Christian Mission in Guatemala. \n\nIn 1983, the mission in El Salvador separated from that of Guatemala over disagreements as to their doctrinal positions, but the separation did not involve a name change due to the difficulty of starting this type of proceeding in the country which was still wracked by civil war. The church in El Salvador is still called \"Misión Cristiana Elim de El Salvador\" until today (the church in Guatemala changed its name to \"Partners Area Elim Ministries\" and later \"Elim Ministries\").\n\nIn 1985 the church in San Salvador had about 3,000 people. Elim decide to develop the prayer cell concept of Yoido Full Gospel Church, South Korea.

In 1988, the attendance is 20,000.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Pastor Solorzano experienced a spiritual crisis in his personal life that would eventually result in the naming of a new senior pastor to look after MCEI. He eventually overcame his doubts and went on to establish another world impact ministry, \"La Palabra Viva\" (The Living Word) in the late 1990s, which continues to flourish to this day. \n\nIn 1997, Mario Vega became senior pastor. He is considered as a resource person to shed light on some social issues. \n\nMCEI owns 6 radio stations under the name \"Radio Restauracion\" in El Salvador and Los Angeles and is in the process of building an 11,000 seat auditorium and television studio in San Salvador.\n\nIn 2007, the Pastors Cesar Flores (Elim San Fernando Valley) and Nelson Martinez (Elim Guatemala) forged a division of enormous scope that separates nearly half of its branches within Elim Mission.

Speaking at a 2007 conference on the necessity for Muslims to adopt democracy, she said that there was a ‘vital necessity’ to increase dialogue between the three religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam); that ‘values shared by these religions transcend the theological differences of our spiritual pluralism’; and that a better understanding of ‘what we share can help us better accept and respect what separates us.’\n\nIn 2007, the MBS became the main sponsor of ‘Sacred: Discover what we share’, a British Library project that displayed the oldest surviving texts of the Abrahamic faiths side by side.\n\nJoumala described the project as ‘aiming to foster inter-religious dialogue in these times of prevalent political and religious tensions internationally’. She went on: ‘The Moroccan British Society, in contributing to this event, seeks to underline\nthe Moroccan example, where interfaith respect is the norm.

In 2007, Eugene Rogan wrote that ‘The King Mohammed VI Fellowship in Moroccan and Mediterranean Studies has served as the basis for extending cooperation between Moroccan academics and Great Britain, and has enabled the MEC to develop its work in North Africa significantly.’ However, although Rogan regarded the donation as a merely academic exercise, for the donors it was seen as a diplomatic move aimed at benefiting the Moroccan state and its unelected rulers. Examples contributing to this can be found on the website of the Moroccan British Society. Because there is little mention of academic goals, but the public relations aspect of the Fellowship and its goal of ‘raising the profile of Morocco at Oxford and in the UK in general’ are emphasised.\n\n"}

It seems very likely that Bacharach borrowed heavily from many sources (including Sarug, Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, and Shabbetai Horowitz) without acknowledging the debt (Scholem 1974). The book had a major impact on later kabbalah as it was regarded among many, including the Chabad Hasidim and the followers of the Vilna Gaon, as an authoritative statement of Luria's kabbala. Its influence is also evident in Ramchal's system. The book indicates that, prior to the conquest of Jerusalem and the Babylonian captivity, the prophet Jeremiah hid the treasures of Solomon's Temple, with the assistance of five others.\n\nAlthough \"Emeq HaMelekh\" contained approbations from well-respected scholars , it also met with substantial disapproval from contemporary kabbalists such as Chaim Joseph David Azulai, Berechiah Berak, and Moses Hagiz. See Scholem (1974) for more details.\n\nThe book \"Emeq HaMelekh\" is the source for the famous story about the historic Avraham Avinu synagogue in Hebron. According to the introduction, a stranger appeared on the evening of Yom Kippur to serve as the 10th man of the minyan and thus complete the required number of people for a prayer service. After Yom Kippur, the rest of the congregation couldn't find him. That night the hazzan of the synagogue dreamed that the man was speaking to him and told him that he was Avraham Avinu, the Patriarch of the Jewish people who is buried nearby in the Cave of Machpela.

{"id": "52243927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52243927", "title": "National Meeting of Black Women", "text": "National Meeting of Black Women\n\nThe first National Meeting of Black Women (, I ENMN) took place between 2 and 4 December 1988, in Valença, Rio de Janeiro, with the participation of 450 women from 17 Brazilian states. The Encontro Nacional resulted from a great impulse to organize among black women, mainly the fluminenses, who already prepared the I Encontro Estadual de Mulheres Negras of Rio de Janeiro, in 1987.\n\nThe Encontro Estadual represented a mark in the feminist movement guaranteeing that only black women participated in the event, created the opportunity for constituting an \"introspective organisation\". That posture was challenging not only in front of some sectors of the feminist movement, as well as of traditional leaders of the black movement. Even with the caused tension, it was imperative that black women constituted their expressing spot in an independent way. The meeting, that occurred in the Brazilian city of Nova Iguaçu, counted with a considerable participation of state black women.\n\nAs a medium for the organisation of the Encontro Estadual, the fluminense black women also participated in the IX Encontro Nacional Feminista, in Garanhuns (PE). After a long road trip and the challenges imposed by the lack of resources, already in a first moment, they could note the racial thematic was not in the main subjects of the event. As Sandra Bello tells, the class question was present in the meeting, because many feminists didn't accept the active participation of black women with a profile related to the suburban and to the favelas. Also, these women represented a rupture with the eurocentric feminist vision, through which white feminists \"defined the quotas of participation of black women in the Meetings\".\n\nVersing about the preparation process of I ENMN, Joselina da Silva recognises that the IX Encontro Nacional Feminista made the responsibility of black women of Rio de Janeiro in relation to the enacting of the state event appear, while the same became part of the organisation of the Encontro Nacional that would unite Brazil's black women. As a participant of the organisation of the national event, Joselina highlights the high level of difficulty, both in financial, political and cultural aims, considering that the organising commission was integrated by women of different movements and day-to-day life experiences.\n\nDuring the preparations for the national event, reunions followed gathering an ever greater participation of more Brazilian states, getting the presence of nine states in the reunion at São Paulo. In these occasions several organisational aspects and two commissions were created, one executive and one organisational. The Executive Commission was in charge of fourteen black women from Rio de Janeiro, elected by direct and secret vote. The Organisational Commission was formed by the States present in the national reunions. At the same time, several public activities were organised to offer divulgation and visibility to the Meeting, as well as a course for the selection of the visual identity of the event.\n\nJoselina da Silva highlights that one of the problems found in the consecution of the national event was the place of its enaction, based in the available money. In respect to the difficulty found by the Executive Commission to find a place where the event could be enacted, there was chosen a hotel where the activities would take place; while others scattered around the city of Valença would guard the participants and their families.\nDuring the meetings that culminated in this first meeting at a national level, the organisers were able to bring to the discussion and listen to the demands of black women from the most diverse regions of the country and socioeconomic realities. During the meeting itself, black women found a space to fulfill their specific, everyday demands, derived from the intersectionality between, mainly, gender, race and class. If, on one hand, they could show the falsity of the abolition of slavery, in its centenary; on the other hand, also would denounce the domestic violence suffered by black women.\n\nI ENMN was looking for a greater pluralisation of social demands, expliciting conflicts beyond those related to the dynamics of social classes. Everyday questions, intimately connected to relations of power, could be transformed. Under this view, new analytic possibilities would be capable of promoting collective transforming actions. This thought was important in defining one of the general objectives of the meeting: \"make emerge the most diverse forms of fight and autodetermination against the forms of existing discrimination\". Another general objective focused in the construction of new analytic places: \"set an unitary perspective of fight inside the social, cultural and political diversity of the women present at the Meeting\".\n\nGenerally, the Meeting covered six distinct methodologies, recognising the multiple identity aspects by offering voice to women belonging to different social, academic and political origins. To guarantee inclusion, it was necessary that a significant number of women would be inserted in the organisation team and that a division into different sectors would be needed. According to Joselina, the group of subjects present in the terms developed by the participants shows that race and gender were the analyses's deflagrators. Other contributions should also be received, because black women could be victims of different discriminatory manifestations on social subjects.\n\nAt the same time, according to the opening talk of the Meeting, spoken by Maria José Lopes da Silva (member of the executive commission), in that moment, the question of the black woman was essential in the reconstruction process of the Brazilian democracy:\n\"In the process of review of the place of the woman in the Brazilian society, triggered by the women movement one decade ago, the question of the black women becomes constituting one of the fundamental agents of democratic reconstruction of this country. So, from this expectation, appears our first national meeting. Aside from reflecting the purpose of the black woman in the Brazilian reality it is pretended in this meeting to develop a discussion about the relation of black woman and main activities of social life with the necessity of improving that relation that involves the participation of women from various sectors like: black movements, women movements, syndicates, communitary associations and organised entities of the social movement that led to this first meeting having as its central theme the black woman. In the search for enrichening the debate and willing to widen its range, this meeting is opened to participation of delegations of the entire country, having the State of Rio de Janeiro the responsibility of hosting it.\"\n\nIn the context of this opening talk, itis inferred the big amplitude of this Meeting, making it the reflection point about the condition of black women in society. In this space, black activists could formulate strategies that “retrofed” their day-to-day fights against several lived exploitation forms. </div>\n"}

Strimska, Davy, Adler, Gallagher-Ashcraft, and recently Chryssides refer to it as a polytheistic reconstructionist community. Because it has a structure based on the ancient Roman Republic, with a senate, magistrates and laws enacted by vote of the comitia, and with its own coinage, and because the Nova Roma Wiki states that the group self-identifies as a \"sovereign nation\", some outside observers classify it as a micronation.\n\nNova Roma has adopted the ancient Roman religion as its state cult, but also maintains the freedom of religion of its citizens. As a polytheistic reconstructionist practice, the \"religio Romana\" or \"cultus deorum Romanorum\" (Latin designations used by Nova Roma adherents when referring to their religion) reportedly attracts people especially of military background.\n\nBoth the domestic religious traditions and the so-called state religion (\"sacra publica\") are represented in the practices of Nova Roma, including the restoration of the ancient priestly \"collegia\", including the offices of pontifex and Vestal Virgin, and the honoring of the full cycle of Roman holidays throughout the year. According to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, at the time of Christmas, Nova Romans celebrate the Roman holiday Saturnalia.\n\nIn 2006 Margot Adler noted the organization's plan to restore a Magna Mater shrine in Rome.\n\nNova Roman citizens participate in such events as the Festival of Ancient Heritage in Svishtov, Bulgaria, the defunct Roman Market Day in Wells Harbor Park, Maine and \"Forum Fulvii\" in Italy, \"Ludi Savarienses\" Historical Carnival or the \"Aquincum Floralia\" Spring Festival in Hungary.\nOn March 1 2018, Nova Roma celebrated its twentieth anniversary.\n\nAmong the cultural activities of Nova Roma, competitions and games associated with various Roman festivals have an important place.

It is a vehicle of the Ogdoadic Tradition, itself an important element of the Western Mystery Tradition. Ordo Aurum Solis is best known through the published works of two of its past Grand Masters, Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski. Better known by their pseudonyms, Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, the husband and wife team together authored many books (some reappearing in newer editions) that cover different aspects of magical practice, such as the \"Llewellyn Practical Guide to Astral Projection\" and \"Llewellyn Practical Guide to Creative Visualization\", as well as their seminal work (reprinted in three volumes) outlining the philosophy and practices of Ordo Aurum Solis: \"The Magical Philosophy\".\n\nDespite a few similarities to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, some of its descendants, various Thelemic orders, and other groups stemming from the Rosicrucian revival of the 19th century, Ordo Aurum Solis represents a distinct and unique system of magical philosophy and practice based on the Ogdoadic Tradition\n\nThe Ogdoadic Tradition stems from the Mediterranean mystery religions of ancient Greece as well as the Theurgic practices of the priesthoods of Ptolemaic Egypt. Its signature symbol is the Eight-pointed Star of Regeneration, an emblem signifying the Regeneration of the Soul and Divine Inspiration. Its philosophy and practices appear in the works of early Hermetists and the teachings of the Neoplatonic schools of Alexandria, Apamea, and Athens in Late Antiquity. According to its initiates, the father-figure of the Tradition is Hermes Trismegistus.\n\nThe symbols and philosophy of the Ogdoadic Tradition were also expressed in Byzantine art. The Ogdoadic Tradition, as mentioned in \"The Foundations of High Magick\" (\"The Magical Philosophy\", vol. 1) by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, made itself evident in the frescos painted by Giotto (1270-1337) and was also incorporated into the construction of the Baptistery at Florence.\n\nThe initiatory structure of Ordo Aurum Solis consists of three \"Halls\", preceded by a special training in the \"Circle of the Pronaos\". The three grades associated with the Halls of the Order are as follows:\n\n\nVarious initiatic traditions existed in ancient Greece. These were called \"Mysteries\". In Greece the Mysteries of Eleusis, Samothrace, Orpheus, and Dionysus were among the most important, and in ancient Rome and across its empire, the Mithraic and Isiac Traditions. These effectively combined the sacred Mysteries with the rationalism of Philosophy, which constituted the real genius of such esoteric traditions.\n\nGreek initiates were strongly present in Alexandria, in the latest period of Egyptian history known as the Ptolemaic period. They brought with them the Greek initiatic system of the Mysteries, which was then incorporated by the ancient Egyptian priests into their traditions, thereby giving a new, coherent structure to the same. According to Ordo Aurum Solis and its initiates, this was the real birth of the Hermetic Theurgic Tradition, later to be known as the Ogdoadic Tradition, or Ordo Aurum Solis. As Sumerian and Egyptian magic also found their place in the clear system of the ancient Greek Mysteries, the Western initiatic tradition was born.\n\nJust before the dawn of the 20th century, there were a number of \"antiquarian\" and \"folklore\" societies in England that chronicled curiosities and pursued their own chosen researches. One such society was known as the \"Societas Rotae Fulgentis\" (i.e., “Society of the Blazing Wheel”) and had been slowly amassing a wealth of knowledge and research from its various antecedents in the Ogdoadic Tradition.\nTo this society belonged two dedicated occultists, Charles Kingold and George Stanton. In the changing religious and political environment of the late 19th century, they decided to take the core philosophy of the Societas Rotae Fulgentis and constitute it into a living magical and initiatory order, establishing Ordo Aurum Solis in 1897 and reawakening the Golden Chain of the Greek and Egyptian initiatic heritage.\n\nMelita Denning and Osborne Phillips are the pen-names of Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski, who together authored many books in the early days of Llewellyn Publications. Chief among these was the formal presentation of the Order Aurum Solis' philosophy and praxis: \"The Magical Philosophy\".\nMelita Denning, a Jungian scholar, was the first female Grand Master of the Order. She led the Order from 1976 to 1987, and from 1988 till her death on March 23, 1997. Earlier in her life, she had traveled throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean in search of occult knowledge. It was after six years of research that she finally came upon Ordo Aurum Solis.\n\nOsborne Phillips was Grand Master of the Order from 1997 to 2003. He received magical training early in his life at the hands of Ernest Page, a London astrologer of some repute. In the early 1970s, he was in charge of psychic investigation as conducted by certain initiates of Ordo Aurum Solis. Phillips was also a student of U Maung Maung Ji, who specialized in Eastern philosophical systems and was a co-worker of the UN Secretary-General U Thant.\n\n7th Grand Master of the Aurum Solis, Carl Llewellyn Weschcke was also the chairman of Llewellyn Worldwide, Ltd. until his death in 2015. He wrote several books on psychic empowerment and published, through Llewellyn, books of the Ordo Aurum Solis. Weschcke reaffirmed his support to the Hermetic Tradition in the foreword to Jean-Louis de Biasi's \"The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis\".\n\nJean-Louis de Biasi, an author and philosopher born in Southern France, has been involved in the Mystery Traditions for the past forty years. He has been Grand Master of Ordo Aurum Solis since 2003, as shown on the Order Aurum Solis' website. De Biasi has written books on the Ogdoadic Tradition, the Tarot, the aura, and Freemasonry. As per his website, he now seems to be actively writing books in English. He wrote \"Secrets and Practices of the Freemasons: Sacred Mysteries, Rituals and Symbols Revealed\" and has written two books directly related to Ordo Aurum Solis: \"The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis\" and \"Rediscover the Magick of the Gods and Goddesses\". Another book contains practices coming from the Aurum Solis. This is \"The Magical Use of Prayer Beads\". All these books have been published by Llewellyn Publications.\n\nVivian Godfrey (Melita Denning) was diagnosed with cancer early in 1997 and died on March 23 of that same year.\n\nOn June 14, 2003, Leon Barcynski (Osborne Phillips) retired as Grand Master and was succeeded by Jean-Louis de Biasi, the current Grand Master, who subsequently made a declaration that bore witness to the Hermetic nature of the work of the Order.\n\nThis initiatic order is present on several continents and has been one of the few to maintain a direct lineage through 120 years of existence. The current Grand Master Jean-Louis de Biasi continues to maintain the high moral standards of this tradition and its original system of teachings with countless unpublished material that is provided to its initiates. The practice of classical theurgy and philosophy as a way of life has been highlighted in the past years and seems an obvious continuation of this tradition.\n\n"}

The words \"Star of the Sea\" are a translation of the Latin title Stella Maris.\n\nThe title has been in use since at least the early medieval period. Originally arising from a scribal error in a supposed etymology of the name \"Mary\", it came to be seen as allegorical of Mary's role as \"guiding star\" on the way to Christ. Under this name, the Virgin Mary is believed to intercede as a guide and protector of seafarers in particular, the Apostleship of the Sea, and many coastal churches are named \"Stella Maris\" or Star of the Sea.\n\nThe name \"stella maris\" is first applied to the Virgin Mary in the manuscript tradition of Saint Jerome's Latin translation of the \"Onomasticon\" by Eusebius of Caesarea. although this is in fact a misnomer based on a transcription error. \nFor reaching this meaning the Hebrew name \"Miryam\" (מרים) had to go through a series of transformations: in Judeo-Aramaic it became \"Maryām\", rendered in Greek as \"Mariam\" (Μαριάμ).\nIt was this form that was etymologized by Eusebius. He interpreted \"Maryām\" as \"mar-yam\" (מר-ים) \"drop of the sea\", based on מר \"mar\", a rare biblical word for \"drop\" and ים \"yam\" \"sea\". \n\nSt Jerome adopted this interpretation and translated the name into Latin as \"stilla maris\", \"drop of the sea\", but at some later stage a copyist transcribed this into \"stella maris\", \"star of the sea\", and this transcription error became widespread. \n\nAnother opinion states that Jerome himself interpreted the name as meaning \"star of the sea\" or Stella Maris, by relating it to a Hebrew word for star, מאור (ma'or), from the verb אור ('or), to be light or shine.\n\nThe etymologization of the name of Mary as \"star of the sea\" was widespread by the early medieval period. It is referenced in Isidore's \"Etymologiae\" (7th century). The plainsong hymn \"Ave Maris Stella\" (\"Hail, Star of the Sea\") dates from ca the 8th century.\nPaschasius Radbertus in the 9th century has an allegorical explanation of the name, writing that Mary is the \"Star of the Sea\" to be followed on the way to Christ, \"lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea.\" \nIn the medieval period, \"stella maris\" came to be used as a name of Polaris in its role as lodestar (guiding star, north star); it may have been used as such since Late Antiquity, as it is referred to as ἀειφανής \"always visible\" by Stobaeus in the 5th century, even though it was still some eight degrees removed from the celestial pole at that time. \n\nIn the twelfth century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux wrote: \"If the winds of temptation arise;\" \n\"If you are driven upon the rocks of tribulation look to the star, call on Mary; If you are tossed upon the waves of pride, of ambition, of envy, of rivalry, look to the star, call on Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary.\"\n\nAnthony of Padua also wrote of Mary as Star of the Sea.\n\nPope Pius XII in his encyclical, Doctor Mellifluus, also quoted Bernard of Clairvaux in saying; \"Mary ... is interpreted to mean 'Star of the Sea.' This admirably befits the Virgin Mother.. (for) as the ray does not diminish the brightness of the star, so neither did the Child born of her tarnish the beauty of Mary's virginity.\"\n\n\"Stella maris\" was occasionally also used in reference to Christ. Robert Bellarmine (writing c. 1600) deprecated this use of the title, preferring the allegory of Christ as the morning star as the \"brightest star of all\", classing the less-bright polar star as \"paltry\" (\"exigua\").\n\nThe idea of Mary as a guiding star for seafarers has led to devotion to Our Lady, Star of the Sea in many Catholic coastal and fishing communities. Numerous churches, schools and colleges are dedicated to \"Stella Maris, Our Lady Star of the Sea\", or \"Mary, Star of the Sea\".\n\nStella Maris Monastery, the foundation house of the Carmelite order was established on Mount Carmel, Israel, in the early thirteenth century. The abbey was destroyed several times, but a refounded Stella Maris monastery is still considered the headquarters of the order.\n\nDevotions to this title of Mary are found in the popular Catholic hymn, \"Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star\" and the ancient prayer \"Ave Maris Stella\". The widely sung \"Sicilian Mariners Hymn\", O Sanctissima, also reflects this devotion.\n\nOur Lady, Star of the Sea is the patroness of the Netherlands.\nThe Roman Catholic Church honors Our Lady, Star of the Sea, with a feast day assigned to September 27.\n\nThe Apostleship of the Sea (AOS) is often known locally as Stella Maris, whom seafarers recognise for providing pastoral, practical and spiritual support via their port chaplains and ship visitors in ports around the world. Our Lady Star of the Sea is the patron of the AOS.\n\nThe Apostleship of the Sea has for many years now, been commemorating the Feast of Stella Maris, Our Lady, Star of the Sea, with Mass each year in September for seafarers. It is a day to pray for all seafarers and give thanks for their contribution to global trade. The dates, times and venues of Stella Maris Masses for 2018 in England and Scotland can be found here. At a gathering during the Stella Maris Mass in Westminster Cathedral in 2016, Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Vincent Nichols said, \"Caring for seafarers is profoundly Christian thing to do\".\n\n"}

However, it has become more prevalent in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nProtestantism made a comeback following the Glorious Revolution of 1868, which resulted in the granting of greater religious liberties; this was rescinded again during caudillo Francisco Franco's Spanish State.\n\nIn Franco's authoritarian Spanish State, Protestantism was deliberately marginalised and persecuted. During the Spanish Civil War, the rebel forces persecuted the country's 30,000 Protestants, and forced many pastors to leave the country. Once authoritarian rule was established, non-Catholic translations of the Bible were confiscated by the police and Protestant schools were closed. Although the 1945 Spanish Bill of Rights granted freedom of \"private\" worship, Protestants suffered legal discrimination and non-Catholic religious services were forbidden in public, to the extent that they could not be in buildings which had exterior signs indicating it was a house of worship and that public activities were prohibited. While the Catholic Church was declared official and enjoyed a close relation to the state, ethnically Basque clergymen harboured nationalist ideas opposed to Spanish centralism and were persecuted and imprisoned in a \"Concordate jail\" reserved for criminal clergy.\n\nAt present, the Spanish government observes the 1978 Constitution of Spain and the Law of Religious Freedom of 1980, thus guaranteeing many religious liberties to minorities.

In Yiddish the city was known as \"Pshaytsh\". The town, which dates from the 14th century, is located midway between Chodecz and Kłodawa. It is northwest of Łódź, west of Warsaw and east of Poznań. On the southeast, it borders on Lake Przedecz.\n\nThe earliest mention of Przedecz is in the 12th century, when it was owned by the Archbishops. In the second half of the 14th century, King Kazimierz purchased Przedecz and the surrounding lands from the Archbishops. It became a transit station for traders travelling from south to north and east to west, and a commercial center for the surrounding farms.\n\nPrzedecz was granted city status before the end of the 14th century.\n\nDuring the period of the Archbishops, Jews were forbidden to live there. Jewish settlement in Przedecz began towards the end of the 14th century. The Jewish cemetery is about six hundred years old.\n\nIn 1538, a major fire destroyed most of Przedecz. Ten years later, the king granted the right to produce and market liqueurs without paying taxes and allowed a market day each week.\n\nDuring the war with Sweden in the mid-17th century, Przedecz was destroyed. Only forty houses remained. The financial situation of Przedecz flourished at the beginning of the 18th century when the king gave permission to have two market days each week and a fair six times a year.\n\nIn a 1793 census, the population of Przedecz was 355, 139 of them Jews. By 1827, the town had grown to 1,935 persons, 346 of them Jews. Over the next three decades, the total population increased by only 2,000, whereas the Jewish population rose to 606. In other words, during these thirty years, the percentage of Jews radically increased. This occurred because Jews from the neighbouring villages moved to Przedecz. By 1921, the population was 3,040, of whom 840 were Jews.\n\nPrzedecz consisted of a few streets, but it had all the components of Jewish community life: a synagogue, \"Beth midrash\", \"mikva\", Jewish schools, a yeshiva, Jewish library, Jewish cemetery, \"eruv\", welfare and cultural organisations. Przedecz had its own rabbi, \"shochet\" and \"mohel\".\n\nIn the early days, the \"shechitah\" of animals took place in the butcher's backyard, and the \"shechitah\" of fowl in the \"shochet\"'s backyard. Prior to the Second World War, a large abattoir was built under the auspices of the Local Council. In this new abattoir, sanitary conditions were better and there was regular veterinary inspection by the Polish authorities.\n\nMany Jews were tailors, hatmakers, cobblers, etc. They worked from their homes assisted by their children and other employees, sometimes traveling from city to city to sell their wares. Other were small traders.\n\nEach village had its market day; for Przedecz it was Monday. On Mondays, the non-Jews would come from their farms to sell butter, eggs and chickens, and stock up on items they needed produced by the Jews. From morning to evening, the market was crowded with people.\n\nApart from the big synagogue of Przedecz, there was a \"Chevrat Tehillim\". This served as a synagogue for the artisans of the city. Services were also held in the \"Bet Hamedrash\". The \"Bet Hamedrash\" had its own library. On Fridays two boys aged 13–14 went around the houses collecting money to buy new books and pay for the rebinding of the old ones.\n\nThe \"mikvah\" was situated very near to the lake and quite near to the \"Chevrat Tehillim\". The city had its own \"eruv\", which enabled the Jewish residents to carry in the streets on Shabbat. On occasions when the \"eruv\" was down, the children would carry the \"siddurim\" and \"tallitot\" to the synagogue and bring the \"cholent\" to the houses from the bakery.\n\nThe religious affairs of the community were controlled by a committee (\"Parnasai Ha’ir\"). Every year members of the community would meet in the \"Bet Hamedrash\" and elect eight members to this committee. The function of the committee was to fix the salary of the rabbi and other religious officials, the price for \"shechitah\", the charge for the \"mikvah\", etc. A tax was levied on the families in order to pay for these services.\n\nIn Przedecz, there was a state elementary school. There was no high school and thus pupils who wished to study in a high school had to go to neighbouring cities. The elementary school was attended by both Jewish and non-Jewish children of the city. At first it was situated in the same building as the town hall, the school being upstairs and the town hall downstairs, but later a new large building was built on Stoldona Street.\n\nFor their religious instruction there was a \"Bet Sefer Ivri\", which would meet after regular school hours. Subjects such as \"Tanakh\" (Bible) and \"Dinim\" (Jewish law) were taught in this \"Bet Sefer Ivri\". In the religious education of the children, particularly of the boys, a love for Eretz Israel was prominent. In addition there was a \"Bet Ya’acov\" school for the more religious girls, although most of the Jews in Przedecz were observant. In the courtyard of the \"Bet Hamedrash\" there was another more religiously-oriented school. There was also a \"yeshivah\", whose principal was Rabbi Joseph Alexander Zemelman, the rabbi of Przedecz. For those who wanted to learn a trade such as tailoring, hatmaking or shoemaking, there were evening classes.\n\nThe city had a Jewish library that also functioned as a cultural centre. People met there in the evenings to read books, dance, listen to lectures, watch theatre performances, etc. The more religiously observant used the \"Agudah\" or \"Mizrachi\" facilities.\n\nThere were also welfare organisations in Przedecz, such as the \"Bikur Cholim\" society, which looked after the sick, and a \"Benevolent Fund\" which granted interest-free loans to needy Jews.\n\nIn 1926, with the assistance of the \"Joint\" a Jewish bank was set up in Przedecz. The main purpose of this bank was the granting of loans. These loans were made according to usual banking procedures and required two guarantors who were acceptable to the bank. This bank closed in 1936 as a result of the difficult financial situation of the Jews at that period.\n\nDuring the 20th century, various Zionist groups were established in Przedecz, including branches of the General Zionists, Poale Zion Yemin, Hashomer Hatzair, the Mizrachi and the Revisionists. Money was collected in Przedecz for the J.N.F. There were also a few Bundists.\n\nIn 1937 there were seventy people who had voting rights for delegates to the 20th Zionist Congress held in Zurich that year, of whom all but three utilised their rights. The establishment of these groups caused friction between those of the right and those of the left. As a result, those of the left stopped coming to the Jewish library. For the younger people there was the Young Mizrachi and Betar. The programmes of these youth groups included activities on Shabbat afternoons.\n\nAgudat Yisrael also had a branch in Przedecz, most of its members being Gerrer Hassidim. One of the people active in this branch was the Rabbi of Przedecz, Rabbi Zemelman.\n\nThere was even \"Hachsharah\" (preparing people for \"aliyah\" to Eretz Israel) in Przedecz. This group had some fields in which young people planted and grew vegetables which they then sold in Przedecz.\n\nThe houses in Przedecz were mostly just one story high. Some were owned by the Jewish residents and others were rented from non-Jews. There was no running water in the houses. In the centre of Przedecz was a pump. Electricity was only installed in 1928. Before that, the residents used gas lights. There were very few telephones in Przedecz and radio was a luxury.\n\nIn September 1939, Germany entered Poland and the Second World War began. A few weeks later on the night of the Festival of Shemini Atzeret, 4 October 1939, the Germans set fire to the Przedecz synagogue. On the day after the Festival, the Germans summoned the Rabbi of the city together with some of the leaders of the community and they were forced to sign a statement that the Jews themselves had burnt down the synagogue and in addition they had to pay a fine for so doing.\n\nThe Germans changed the name of the city to Moosburg.\n\nIn 1940 there were 769 Jews in Przedecz and nearly half of them were sent to forced labour camps. The majority of them died there from hunger and disease. The Germans set up a ghetto in Przedecz which was situated in the Old Market. In early 1942, the Germans packed the remaining Jews into the local church, where they were left with no food or water for three days. Many of them died from lack of air. On 24 April 1942 - 7 Iyar 5702, the remaining Jews were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp and the Jewish community of Przedecz was thus finally liquidated.\n\nThe 7th of Iyar has become the Memorial Day for this community.\n\nThe Rabbi of Przedecz managed to escape to Warsaw, where he took an active part in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, former residents of Przedecz and their descendants have gone back to visit. Where the synagogue had formerly stood, the Poles built houses. All that remains of the Jewish cemetery is an empty field and trees. All the tombstones have disappeared. Today there are no Jews in Przedecz. A memorial to the Jews was erected in the cemetery. Very few survived the Holocaust, but some managed to leave Poland on the eve of the war, settling in Israel, the United States and Mexico.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43538918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43538918", "title": "Shemay", "text": "Shemay\n\nShemay (also Shemai) was an ancient Egyptian official and later vizier toward the end of the 8th Dynasty (22nd century BCE) during the First Intermediate Period, mainly known for being the beneficiary of most of the Coptos Decrees. His career has been interpreted as a glaring sign of the extreme weakness of the central power, forced to bestow great privileges to maintain the loyalty of powerful local governors. Shemay is buried in a mudbrick mastaba just south of Coptos.\n\nShemay is known primarily from the Coptos Decrees, a series of decrees by various king of the 8th Dynasty granting titles and honours to him and his family. Shemay is also known from several rock inscriptions in the Wadi Hammamat and from his tomb located just south of Coptos.\n\nThe earliest mention of Shemay came from the three Coptos Decrees “g” to “i” which are generally attributed to pharaoh Neferkaure, and one of these is datable to his Year 4. These documents were displayed in the temple of Min at Coptos and were addressed to the \"Governor of Upper Egypt\" Shemay — who had been nomarch of the \"Two Falcons nome\" with Coptos as capital — and concerning administrative matters about the cult of pharaoh Pepi II and the temple of Min. The earliest of the three decrees mention the new nomarch of Coptos named Idy who very likely was the same person of Idy, son of Shemay; furthermore, the latest of the three decrees ensured to Shemay the responsibility over the 22 nomes of Upper Egypt.\n\nShortly after, king Neferkaure was succeeded by Neferkauhor and Shemay managed to marry his eldest daughter, princess Nebyet; in a single day of his Year 1 (possibly in the same day of his accession to the throne, the \"Month 2 of \"Peret\", Day 20\") Neferkauhor promulgated 8 of the Coptos Decrees (“j” to “q”), the beneficiary of which was always the newly promoted vizier Shemay as well as various member of his family.\n\nThe first decree concerned Nebyet's particular status — as well as Shemay's one, for being the son-in-law of the new pharaoh. Subsequent decrees established other new benefits for Shemay's sons: Idy again filled the vacuum left by his father, occupying the office of Governor of Upper Egypt (although he was responsible only of the 7 southernmost nomes of Upper Egypt) while another son earned a title in the temple of Min. Shemay and Nebyet also gained some privilege that were unprecedented for non-royal people: in fact, some priests were assigned to the funerary cult of their \"ka\", and the couple was allowed to make their own mortuary monuments from royal-exclusively red granite.\n\nIt seems that Shemay was already defunct when the last of the Coptos Decrees (“r”) was issued by the \"Horus\" Djemedjibtawy, who has been tentatively identified with both Wadjkare and Neferirkare: in fact it was addressed to the vizier Idy, providing evidence that once again the son followed his father's footsteps.\n\nIn life, he gathered an impressive amount of titles and offices, in a decree he is called \"...the god's father, beloved of god, king's (foster) child, pyramid-town overseer and vizier, overseer of scribes of the king's document, governor of Upper Egypt, sole companion, chamberlain, herdsman of Hierakonpolis, chief of El Kab, lector priest, overseer of the priest of Min\". Further high titles are found in his tomb \"iry-pat\" (hereditary prince) and \"Haty-a\" (count).\n\nShemay is buried in a tomb south of Coptos on a hill within the flood plain, in modern Kom el-Koffar also known as Kom el-Momanien and Naga el-Kom. The tomb was first excavated in 1956 by Labib Habachi and then from 1979 until 1982 by Rabia Hamdan. More recent excavation works have taken place in 2000 and 2002.\n\nThe tomb consists of a large mudbrick mastaba with a pillared hall in its center, which is entered from the North side via a forecourt and a long causeway. All these structures are paved with limestone while the walls of the pillared hall were adorned with offering scenes. A red granite false door is located on the south-east wall of the hall. Several stelae representing Shemay were discovered in niches on the external northern face of the mastaba were offerings to Shemay would possibly have been made.\n\nAn inscription on the East wall of the hall is dated to the first year of the reign of Neferkauhor, fourth month of the Shemu season, day 2. This inscription is the sole contemporary attestation of Neferkauhor beyond the Coptos Decrees. The upper register of the wall shows on the left Shemay with his wife. In front of him are workmen dragging a stone. In the middle register is shown the slaughtering of a bull and the dragging of another stone. In this register king Neferkauhor is mentioned twice. The lowest register shows a boat fight in the marshes. Another inscription details what Shemay's son Idy did for his father, giving offerings and ordering repair works in the necropolis.\n"}

Guru Nanak is also known to have passed through Greece in one of his journeys. A cemetery of Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army,still exists in Salonika. It was built in 1920,to bury the bodies of the Sikh soldiers of the First World War.However, The first Sikh community was formed in the 1950s by Sikh immigrants. They worked as farmers or fishermen in the Greek islands. Till the 1970s, the population of Sikhs in Greece was less than 200 people. After the 1970s, Sikh immigrants came to Greece through Turkey. Some of them started their own farm stores and recruited other immigrants to work with them.\n\nIn the 1990s the number of immigrants further increased. The Sikh community in Athens formed a small organization for their religious and social needs, which led to the building of Gurudwara Shri Guru Nanak Darbar. They called a granthi, brought some \"saroops\" of Guru Granth Sahib and rented a large industrial space that served as the temple. It was known by the Greeks as the \"Indian Organization of Tavros, Athens\", however the Punjabi characters on the temple board translate to \"Sikh Temple Shri Guru Nanak Darbar, Athens\". This was done to prevent the possible future attacks on a foreign religious monument. Following Athens' Sikh community, some other Sikh immigrants also made temples in Oinofita, Oropos, Kranidi and Thebes. A large place has been bought by the committee of one of the old Gurdwaras of Oinofita,for the construction of new Gurdwara, outside Schimatari and near to the Military Airport of Tanagra. Even though,a new construction of a Gurdwara needs lot of money, most of needed money has been donated by nearby-living Sikhs as Daswand. The saroop of Guru Granth Sahib was moved from the old building and moved to the new one,even though it is half-completed. It is the only non-rented and bought Gurdwara in Greece.

They are free to wear the Five Ks except the \"kirpan\" in schools and public places. There are still many cases of discrimination against the Sikhs in Greece.\n\nThe number of Sikhs living in Greece is estimated to be around 20, 000. Their main centers are Athens, Megara, Chalkida and Psachna. Sikhs have the lowest number of people in prison. Sikhs in Greece consist of only two generations, the one that migrated from India and the other that was born there. Migration to Greece is very unpopular among Punjabis, in general and Sikhs in particular. Practising Sikhs who wear turbans are often confused with Pakistanis or Radical Muslims and are often called racist names, assaulted and bullied on streets and schools. Attacks on Sikh properties particularly on Sikh Gurudwaras have been frequent, since the rise of Neo-nazi groups. Sikhs in Greece have still a long way to go to win many of their rights. Many Sikhs tend to migrate to other western countries like Britain and Canada, where the Sikh community is well-established.\n\nMore than three times, Molotov cocktail bottles have been thrown on the complex of the Athens Gurdwara. A small-scale demonstration was made by the Greek residents of Schimatari-Tanagra,against the building of the new Gurdwara in Schimatari. The police,which was called for help by Sikhs, made the mob to retire but they arrested many builders and charged them for not having certain licenses. The police released them after some hours. Two gurdwaras in Marathon was attacked with Gunshots with no reported casualty. These are uttered as common by local Sikhs and is believed to be racially motivated crimes and been targeted by right wing and Neo nazi parties.\n"}

The founders had the desire to further explore the relationship between their orthodox Protestant faith and the social crisis that surrounded them, particularly around the Vietnam War. In the fall of 1971, they began publishing the \"Post American\", a newspaper that expressed the group's commitment to the faith and ideas about social change. The Sojourners Community is most widely known for \"Sojourners\" magazine and for the writing and speaking of its founding member Jim Wallis.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, the group organized an intentional community in Rogers Park, Illinois. However, in 1974, the community disintegrated. The remaining members decided move to the inner-city neighborhood of Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C., where they could better address urban problems and national politics. Combining their assets and incomes, the group gradually established households and a network of social outreach programs. The community lived together in these common households together, shared a common purse, formed a worshiping community, got involved in neighborhood issues, organized national events on behalf of peace and justice and continued to publish \"Sojourners\" magazine. The vestige of the Sojourners' intentional living community remains its intern community, a group of individuals who are hired as year-long interns and who live together in intentional Christian community for that year as part of the internship experience.\n\nOther Evangelicals have critiqued the Sojourners Community due to their combination of strict evangelical Protestant beliefs (though the Sojourners living community and wider organizational network has also long included mainline Protestants and Catholics) and radical \"social priorities [which] run in markedly different directions\". Also, Sojourners differentiates from other evangelicals in its condemning of militarism, corporate excesses, and the exploitation of people in the Third World. However, other social critiques are similar to those of other evangelicals on issues such as condemning of abortion (as part of a wider pro-life stance that includes protection of life from cradle to grave, i.e. anti-war and anti-hunger stances). Sojourners advocates economic justice and expanded services for the poor.\n\n"}

{"id": "15934453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15934453", "title": "The Men Who Stare at Goats", "text": "The Men Who Stare at Goats\n\nThe Men Who Stare at Goats (2004) is a non-fiction work by Jon Ronson concerning the U.S. Army's exploration of New Age concepts and the potential military applications of the paranormal. The title refers to attempts to kill goats by staring at them and stopping their hearts. The book is companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on Channel 4—\"Crazy Rulers of the World\" (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\". The same title was used a third time for a loose feature film adaptation in 2009.\n\nThe book's first five chapters examine the efforts of a handful of U.S. Army officers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to exploit paranormal phenomena, New Age philosophy, and elements of the human potential movement to enhance U.S. military intelligence-gathering capabilities as well as overall operational effectiveness. These include the \"First Earth Battalion Operations Manual\" (1979) and a \"psychic spy unit\" established by Army Intelligence at Fort Meade, Maryland, in the late 1970s. (This was the Stargate Project, which the book never mentions by name.) Ronson is put on the historical trail of the \"men who stare at goats\"—Special Forces soldiers who supposedly experimented with psychic powers against de-bleated goats at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at the now-decommissioned \"Goat Lab\" medical training facility. He examines, and dispenses with, several candidates for the legendary \"master sergeant\" (Chapter 2) who was reported to have killed a goat simply by staring at it, in the earliest days of the program. A martial arts instructor named Guy Savelli claims to be the one.\n\nIn the middle third of the book (Chapters 6-11), the author leaps to the present day—i.e., 2004, just after the Abu Ghraib abuse revelations—and attempts to make connections between the earlier (now terminated, and mostly discredited) military programs and the abuses resulting from the post-9/11 War on Terror (Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, psyops in Iraq, etc.). This includes the use of the children's song \"Barney & Friends\" on Iraqi prisoners-of-war. A purported linking element is the alleged use of music and subliminal messaging at the 1993 Waco siege and other FBI operations. Another is the private business \"franchises\" and consultancies that retired members of the \"psychic unit\" later pursued as civilians. A connection is also proposed between these \"privatized\" psychics and the mass-suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult in 1997.\n\nThe final section of the book (Chapters 13-16) leaps backward to the 1950s and attempts to connect the Army psychic program, and later interrogation techniques, with the CIA's MK-ULTRA \"mind control\" research program and the notorious death of Army researcher Frank Olson in 1953. Ronson spends time with Olson's son Eric as he attempts to uncover the mystery of his father's death. The reason his father was terminated, as we discover, was not simply because he knew too much but, rather, that he was having a crisis of conscience and seriously entertaining the notion of going public with all that he knew. The narrative ends with the suggestion that the \"psychic warriors\" are now back in business working for the U.S. military again, possibly in support of assassinations.\n\n\n\nRonson's book was met with mostly positive, often glowing, reviews: the \"Boston Globe\" opined that it is \"a hilarious and unsettling book... Ronson comes off as an unusual cross between Comedy Central's Jon Stewart and \"The New Yorker\"s Seymour Hersh.\" \"The New York Times\" Janet Maslin stated that \"Ronson sets up his book perfectly. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity...\".\n\nSome critics, however, were skeptical of what they considered Ronson's shaky logic and some of his bolder assertions. Alex Heard's review in \"U-T San Diego\" was subtitled \"\"Goats\" tries hard to link psychic-spy projects from the past to today's events, and mostly fails\". In many instances, he wrote, \"...there isn't a link. Instead there's a progression of occurrences that don't connect in a meaningful way. The result is a strange new blend: Conspiracy theory meets Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon... You're left feeling like you've been told a shaggy-goat story.\"\n\nThe 2004 series \"Crazy Rulers of the World\" was aired in three parts:\n\n\nIt was broadcast in Britain on Channel 4.\n\nA fictionalized feature film version of the book was released in 2009 under the same name. Grant Heslov directed from a script by Peter Straughan. It is set in Iraq, but was filmed in Comerío Street, Bayamón, Puerto Rico and at the New Mexico Military Institute. The story centers on \"Bob Wilton\" (Ewan McGregor)—the Ronson stand-in—a desperate reporter who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime. He meets \"Lyn Cassady\" (George Clooney)—a composite character—who claims to be a former secret U.S. military psychic soldier re-activated post-9/11. Jeff Bridges plays \"Bill Django\"—clearly a version of Jim Channon—the founder of the psychic soldier program and Lyn's mentor. Kevin Spacey plays \"Larry Hooper\"—a wholly fictional character—who is a former psychic soldier now running a rogue PsyOps unit in Iraq. The film is prefaced with a title card stating \"More of this is true than you would believe\". The DVD release of \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" includes a bonus documentary featuring Ronson and many of the people who feature prominently in his book.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the feature film in 2009, John Sergeant, the producer of the TV series \"Crazy Rulers of the World\", accused Ronson of \"airbrushing him out of the story\". While Ronson dedicated his book to Sergeant and included an afterword commending his research and guidance, the feature film did not mention his contributions.\n\n"}
{"id": "11287874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11287874", "title": "Tommaso Palamidessi", "text": "Tommaso Palamidessi\n\nTommaso Palamidessi (Pisa, February 16, 1915 – Rome, April 29, 1983) was an Italian esotericist. Precociously attracted by astrology, parapsychology, and yoga-tantric doctrines, he was led by his manifold interests in the field of the occult and by his intense spiritual pursuit to build up an original form of Esoteric Christianity, which he called Archeosophy. In 1968, he founded in Rome the Archeosophical Society, which is still active and counts a few thousand members both in Italy and in the rest of Europe (mainly in Germany, Portugal, and France).\n\nBorn in Pisa on 16 February 1915 to Carlo Palamidessi, Senior Officer of the Army and the poet Luigia Tagliata, in 1920 Tommaso Palamidessi moved to Sicily. Since he was a child he studied astronomy, astrology, botany, medicine and religion and as an adolescent he traveled to Tripoli and Tunis to deepen his knowledge of Islamic Sufism.\n\nFrom 1933, when he moved to Turin, he applied himself to intensive research into astrology, alchemy and Tantric yoga, extrasensory experiences, favoured by his mediumistic predisposition, Egyptology and the study of hieroglyphs - the latter carried out in collaboration with the director of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, Ernesto Scamuzzi. He also has out-of-body experiences, bilocations and remembrances of his past lives.\n\nHis publications about Tantric yoga include: \"The Occult Powers of Man and the Indo-Tibetan Tantric Yoga\", \"Sexual Technique of Tantric Yoga\"; \"The Erotic Power of Kundalini Yoga\"; \"Yoga not to Die\". During these years, he also wrote an extensive unpublished commentary on Egyptian theurgy and the \"Book of the Dead\".\n\nTowards the end of the 1940s Palamidessi, as mentioned, began to teach astrology and yoga. He became one of the first Italian Astrological authors of the 1900s. In the catalogue of the National Library Service only six treatise of astrology written by Italian authors appear from 1900 to 1939. For the most these are general introductions and often mixed with chiromancy, physiognomy and occultism. In these years Tommaso Palamidessi wrote six astrological treatise: \"The Course of Stars and Man's Diseases; Medicine and Sidereal Influences\"; \"Mundane Astrology\" (1941); \"Cosmic Influences and the Precocious Diagnosis of Cancer\" (1943) \"Earthquakes, Eruptions and Cosmic influences\" (1943) and not forgetting the \"Perpetual Effemerides\" (1941)\n\nIn Italy during the 1900s the first volumes dedicated to two once glorious disciplines : World astrology and medical Astrology are treated . \nAt the time, Palamidessi established contacts with exponents of the Hamburg Astrologic School, to whom he dedicated an article in the journal \"Astral Language\" . Among the foreign contacts of Tommaso Palamidessi we can mention the French, such as, Alexandre Volguine ( 1903-1976), Henry Joseph Gouchon (1898-1978) and Jacques Reverchon (1909-1985). Like Reverchon, Gouchon gravitates around the journal Cahiers Astrologiques (1938-1983) founded by Volguine. \nWe can certainly add the English Francis Rolt-Wheeler (1876-1960), a curious and polyhedral figure, writer and Anglican priest with which Palamidessi held a collaborative relationship.\n\nIn 1947 Tommaso Palamidessi married Rosa Francesca Bordino (1916–1999) who did stand by him for a lifetime and gave him a daughter, Silvestra (1948–1996). In 1949 a radical spiritual crisis drove him to a deep conversion to Christ and consequently he decided to suspend his yoga publications.\n\nIn 1953 he moved to Rome with his family and contributed to various newspapers, among which it is worth mentioning his collaboration with the \"Tribuna Illustrata\", the most ancient Italian weekly magazine where he wrote a section about esotericism and astrology until 1969 when the magazine disappeared. He visited the monasteries of Kalambaka, Thessaly and Mt. Athos in 1957 and Jerusalem in the Easter of 1966 where he had special revelations on the Mt. Golgotha and in Gethsemane.\n\nIn Alexandria of Egypt he rediscovered archaeological sites that he had already seen during his paranormal experiences by which he had remembered to have been Origen (185-254), instructor at the Didaskaleyon, school of Christianity founded by the evangelist St. Mark in Alexandria. The study of Patristics did consolidate his faith in what he regarded the authentic Esoteric Christianity. By this time his formulation of a new doctrinal synthesis for the spiritual awakening of man and woman took shape in Archeosofica.\n\nOn 29 September 1968 Tommaso Palamidessi founded Archeosofica, \"Esoteric School of High Initiation\" in Rome. The foundation of \"Archeosofica\" was rooted in Palamidessi's spirit of collaboration toward spiritual realizations.\nIndeed, Tommaso Palamidessi founded Archeosofica as\n\n\"a free school for free scholars, who must not feel like pupils nor apprentices, but brothers who listen to the living voice of other brothers.\"[...]\n\n\"It is a call addressed to all, and it does not matter if they belong to the different communities (Theosophists, Anthroposophists, Martinists, Rosicrucians, Catholics, Yoghists, etc.). The Brotherhood is only one, and it can have only one verb: Love one another; only one Master: Jesus the Christ.\"\nIn the following years, he journeyed to India, Kashmir, Nepal China, South America but from 1968 forth his efforts was consecrated above all to the nourishing of the archeosophical doctrine and to the organisation of the many groups of study and experimentation that have soon spread all over Italy. Then in 1973 he founded a cultural association namely Archeosophical Society with the aim of developing and diffusing Archeosophy all over the world.\n\nThe archeosophical ascesis aims at solving the religious problem of a correction of human life that does not rely on either one's whim or on chance but on a solid spiritual Science and on techniques of spiritual awakening and interior transmutation. The program includes special gymnastics, breathing techniques, psycho-dynamic actions on hormones and nerve plexus in order to ascend to what corresponds to body and, though not being body, makes up the whole of the energetic bodies permeating the organic one with the purpose of finally reaching the causal body where the immortal I resides. Out-of-body experiences (in order to have a direct, personal experience of spiritual worlds), methods of meditation on the centres of force directly linked with the three principles of the immortal Ego (such as the meditation on the heart defined by Palamidessi as cardiognosis or \"inner knowledge of one's heart) and exercises of remembrance of some past lives are part of the itinerary of self-awareness and of the journey towards God. suggested by Archeosofica.\n\nIn his treatise \"Tecniche di Risveglio Iniziatico\" (Techniques of Initiatic Awakening) (Ed.Mediterranee 1975) Tommaso Palamidessi presents a program of integral ascesis where techniques of meditation on the centres of force and on the divine names on the one hand, an intense inner life devoted to transcendence, on the other and finally a cautious use of astral influences in order to determine the most convenient moments for the ascetic practices, converge on the unique purpose of granting a spiritual regeneration in a Christic sense.\n\nA special form of ascesis is carried out through art.\nDeeply interested in the mystical, theological and artistic tradition of the Orthodox Church, Tommaso Palamidessi brings back to light the technique for preparing and painting a sacred icon. The work he dedicates to this subject, \"L'Icona, I colori e l'Ascesi Artistica\" (tr.: Icon, Colours and Artistic Ascesis) (published posthumously in 1986) is a real handbook which aims at starting the reader off on the personal preparation of a sacred icon and on meditating on it. By following the rules of the chromatic symbolism as well as the traditional geometry of sacred art, the artist can make of his own icon a \"castle of meditation\", by which he transcends the formal aspect of the image and becomes sensitive to the divine archetypes hidden behind it. In this sense the icon has a sanctifying effect on the conscience of the artist.\n\nAnother important key for the mystic and initiatic self-realisation included in the ascetic program of Archeosofica is linked with the discoveries made by Tommaso Palamidessi over sacred music and its importance for the catharsis and the awakening of the spiritual centres in the regenerated Man.\n\n\n\nIn English:\n\n\nIn Italian, German and French:\n\n\nBooks:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19334491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19334491", "title": "Vishnu", "text": "Vishnu\n\nVishnu (; ; Sanskrit: विष्णु, IAST: \"\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, and the Supreme Being in its Vaishnavism tradition. Vishnu is the \"preserver\" in the Hindu triad (Trimurti) that includes Brahma and Shiva.\n\nIn Vaishnavism, Vishnu is identical to the formless metaphysical concept called Brahman, the supreme, the Svayam Bhagavan, who takes various avatars as \"the preserver, protector\" whenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces. His avatars most notably include Rama in the \"Ramayana\" and Krishna in the \"Mahabharata\". He is also known as Narayana, Jagannath, Vasudeva, Vithoba, and Hari. He is one of the five equivalent deities worshipped in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta Tradition of Hinduism.\n\nIn Hindu iconography, Vishnu is usually depicted as having a pale or dark blue complexion and having four arms. He holds a padma (lotus flower) in his lower left hand, Kaumodaki gada (mace) in his lower right hand, Panchajanya shankha (conch) in his upper left hand and the Sudarshana Chakra (discus) in his upper right hand. A traditional depiction is Vishnu reclining on the coils of the serpent Shesha, accompanied by his consort Lakshmi, as he \"dreams the universe into reality\".\n\nYaska, the mid 1st-millennium BCE Vedanga scholar, in his Nirukta (etymological interpretation), defines Vishnu as \"viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā\", \"one who enters everywhere\". He also writes, \"atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati\", \"that which is free from fetters and bondages is Vishnu\".\n\nThe medieval Indian scholar Medhātithi suggested that the word \"Vishnu\" has etymological roots in \",\" meaning \"to pervade\", thereby connoting that Vishnu is \"one who is everything and inside everything\".\n\nVishnu means \"all pervasive\".\n\nVishnu is a Vedic deity, but not a prominent one when compared to Indra, Agni and others. Just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the Rigveda, a 2nd millennium BCE Hindu text, are dedicated to Vishnu, and he finds minor mention in the other hymns. Vishnu is mentioned in the Brahmana layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian mythology, states Jan Gonda, Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.\n\nThough a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the Vedas, he has important characteristics in various hymns of Rig Veda, such as 1.154.5, 1.56.3 and 10.15.3. In these hymns, the Vedic mythology asserts that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed Atman (souls) reside, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu soteriology. He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.\n\nIn the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named Vritra. His distinguishing characteristic in Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in Mandala 7 refer to Vishnu. In section 7.99 of the Rgveda, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra. In the Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is Surya or Savitr (Sun god), who also bears the name \"Suryanarayana\". Again, this link to Surya is a characteristic Vishnu shares with fellow Vedic deities named Mitra and Agni, where in different hymns, they too \"bring men together\" and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities.\n\nIn hymn 7.99 of Rigveda, Indra-Vishnu are equivalent and produce the sun, with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all. In other hymns of the Rigveda, Vishnu is a close friend of Indra. Elsewhere in Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Upanishadic texts, Vishnu is equivalent to Prajapati, both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb, and according to Klaus Klostermaier, this may be the root behind post-Vedic fusion of all the attributes of the Vedic Prajapati unto the avatars of Vishnu.\n\nIn the Yajurveda, Taittiriya Aranyaka (10.13.1), Narayana sukta, Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of Narayana Suktam mentions the words \"paramam padam\", which literally mean \"highest post\" and may be understood as the \"supreme abode for all souls\". This is also known as Param Dhama, Paramapadam or Vaikuntha. Rig Veda 1.22.20 also mentions the same \"paramam padam\".\n\nIn the Atharvaveda, the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears, but without the word Vishnu or his alternate avatar names. In post-Vedic mythology, this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the Varaha legend, with Varaha as an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nSeveral hymns of the Rigveda repeat the mighty deed of Vishnu called the \"Trivikrama\", which is one of the lasting mythologies in Hinduism since the Vedic times. It is an inspiration for ancient artwork in numerous Hindu temples such as at the Ellora Caves, which depict the Trivikrama legend through the Vamana avatar of Vishnu. \"Trivikrama\" refers to the celebrated \"three steps\" or \"three strides\" of Vishnu. Starting as a small insignificant looking being, Vishnu undertakes a herculean task of establishing his reach and form, then with his first step covers the earth, with second the ether, and the third entire heaven.\n\nThe Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda says that the first and second of Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life. The Shatapatha Brahmana elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the savior of the mortals and the immortals (Devas).\n\nThe Shatapatha Brahmana contains ideas which Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe. In this Brahmana, states Klaus Klostermaier, Purusha Narayana (Vishnu) asserts, \"all the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all the worlds\". The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.\n\nVishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms, states S Giora Shoham, where he is \"ever present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all\", and the eternal, transcendental self in every being. The Vedic literature, including its Brahmanas layer, while praising Vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses. They present an inclusive pluralistic henotheism. Max Muller states, \"Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rig veda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute\".\n\nThe Vaishnava Upanishads are minor Upanishads of Hinduism, related to Vishnu theology. There are 14 Vaishnava Upanishads in the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is unclear when these texts were composed, and estimates vary from the 1st-century BCE to 17th-century CE for the texts.\n\nThese Upanishads highlight Vishnu, Narayana, Rama or one of his avatars as the supreme metaphysical reality called Brahman in Hinduism. They discuss a diverse range of topics, from ethics to the methods of worship.\n\nVishnu is the primary focus of Vaishnavism-focused Puranas genre of Hindu texts. Of these, according to Ludo Rocher, the most important texts are the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Nāradeya Purana, Garuda Purana and Vayu Purana. The Purana texts include many versions of cosmologies, mythologies, encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life, and chapters that were medieval era regional Vishnu temples-related tourist guides called \"mahatmyas\".\n\nOne version of the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu's eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where he watches the cosmos. In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the Hiranyagarbha, or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe. The Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.\nThe Vishnu Purana discusses the Hindu concept of supreme reality called Brahman in the context of the Upanishads, a discussion that the theistic Vedanta scholar Ramanuja interprets to be about the equivalence of the Brahman with Vishnu, a foundational theology in the Sri Vaishnavism tradition. Vishnu is equated with Brahman in Bhagavata Purana, such as in verse 1.2.11, as \"learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.\"\n\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" has been the most popular and widely read Purana texts relating to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages. Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent \"devas\" (deities) and evil \"asuras\" (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" is a revered text in Vaishnavism. The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the Sattriya, Manipuri dance, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Bhagavata Mela and Mohiniyattam.\n\nSome versions of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, is the source of creator deity Brahma in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu's iconography typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa).\n\nIn some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu takes the form of Rudra or commands Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu all over again, starting a new \"Kalpa\". For this the \"Bhagavata Purana\" employs the metaphor of Vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.\n\nThe Sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in Tamil language, mostly from the early centuries of the common era. These Tamil texts revere Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna and Rama, as well as other pan-Indian deities such as Shiva, Muruga, Durga, Indra and others. Vishnu is described in these texts as \"mayon\", or \"one who is dark or black in color\" (in north India, the equivalent word is Krishna). Other terms found for Vishnu in these ancient Tamil genre of literature include \"mayavan, mamiyon, netiyon, mal\" and \"mayan\".\n\nKrishna as Vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two post-Sangam Tamil epics \"Silappadikaram\" and \"Manimekalai\", each of which was probably composed about the 5th century CE. These Tamil epics share many aspects of the story found in other parts of India, such as those related to baby Krishna such as stealing butter, and teenage Krishna such as teasing girls who went to bathe in a river by hiding their clothes.\n\nIdeas about Vishnu in the mid 1st millennium CE were important to the Bhakti movement theology that ultimately swept India after the 12th century. The Alvars, which literally means \"those immersed in God\", were Tamil Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they travelled from one place to another. They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana's references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on \"bhakti\", have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that \"bhakti\" movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana summarizes the Vaishnava theology, wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual soul with the Absolute Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Supreme Truth), or \"the return of Brahman into His own true nature\", a distinctly Advaitic or non-dualistic philosophy of Shankara. The concept of moksha is explained as \"Ekatva\" (Oneness) and \"Sayujya\" (Absorption, intimate union), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one's true nature). This, states Rukmini, is proclamation of \"return of the individual soul to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute\", which is unmistakably Advaitic in its trend. In the same passages, the Bhagavata includes a mention of Bhagavan as the object of concentration, thereby presenting the Bhakti path from the three major paths of Hindu spirituality discussed in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe theology in the Bhagavad Gita discusses both the sentient and the non-sentient, the soul and the matter of existence. It envisions the universe as the body of Vishnu (Krishna), state Harold Coward and Daniel Maguire. Vishnu in Gita's theology pervades all souls, all matter and time. In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess Lakshmi) are described as inseparable, that they pervade everything together. Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana, in many passages, parallels the ideas of Nirguna Brahman and non-duality of Adi Shankara. For example,\n\nScholars describe the Vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as \"Advaitic Theism\". The Bhagavata Purana suggests that God Vishnu and the soul (Atman) in all beings is one. Bryant states that the monism discussed in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on the Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara. The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are \"real but different\" manifestations of sunlight.\n\nIn the Bhakti tradition of Vaishnavism, Vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience, energy, strength, lordship, vigour, and splendour. The Vaishnava tradition started by Madhvacharya considers Vishnu in the form of Krishna to be the supreme creator, personal God, all-prevading, all devouring, one whose knowledge and grace leads to \"moksha\". In Madhvacharya Vaishnava theology, the supreme Vishnu and the souls of living beings are two different realities and nature (dualism), while in Ramanuja's Sri Vaishnavism, they are different but share the same essential nature (qualified non-dualism).\n\nLakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity (both material and spiritual), is the wife and active energy of Vishnu. She is also called Sri or \"Thirumagal in Tamil\" because she is the source of eight auspicious strengths for Vishnu. When Vishnu incarnated on the Earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi incarnated as his respective consorts: Sita (Rama's wife) and Rukmini (Krishna's wife). Lakshmi and Padmavati are wives of Lord Vishnu at Tirupati. In Hinduism, Lord Vishnu had incarnated as Lord Venkatachalapathi at Tirupati, although this grand form of him is not counted as one of the dasavatars.\n\nTrimurti (three forms) is a concept in Hinduism \"in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer, preserver or protector and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.\" These three deities have also been called \"the Hindu triad\" or the \"Great Trinity\", all having the same meaning of three in One. They are the different forms or manifestations of One person the Supreme Being.\n\nShiva and Vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different Hindu denominations. Harihara is a composite of half Vishnu and half Shiva, and artwork related to Harihara is found from mid 1st millennium CE, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century Badami cave temples. Another half Vishnu half Shiva form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in Mahabharata.\n\nVishnu's mount (Vahana) is Garuda, the eagle. Vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders. Garuda is also considered as Vedas on which Lord Vishnu travels. Garuda is a sacred bird in Vaishnavism. In Garuda Purana, Garuda carries Lord Vishnu to save the Elephant Gajendra.\nGanga and Parvati alias Shakthi are sisters of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance. The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna and Rama. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts. The Mahabharata, the Krishna Charit Manas for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana, Ram Charit Manas includes Rama.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations (\"Dashavatara\"), are celebrated therein as his major appearances. The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana. Thirty-nine avatars are mentioned in the Pancharatra. The commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.\n\nThe ten best-known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the \"Dashavatara\" (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limitation to the abstract.\n\nVishnu is referred to as Gorakh in the scriptures of Sikhism. For example, in verse 5 of Japji Sahib, the guru is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom, and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained. Guru Nanak, state Christopher Shackle and Arvind Pal-Singh Mandair, teaches that the Guru (teachers) are \"Shiva (isar), Vishnu (gorakh), Brahma (barma) and mother Parvati (parbati)\", yet the one who is all and true cannot be described.\n\nThe Chaubis Avatar text of Sikhism lists the 24 avatars of Vishnu and this includes Krishna and Rama of Hinduism, and the Buddha of Buddhism as avatar of Vishnu. Similarly, the Dasam Granth includes Vishnu mythology mirror that found in the Vaishnav tradition. The latter is of particular importance to Sanatan Sikhs, including Udasis, Nirmalas, Nanak-panthis, Sahajdhari and Keshdhari sub-traditions within Sikhism; however, the Khalsa Sikhs disagree with the Sanatan Sikhs. According to Sanatan Sikh writers, the Gurus of Sikhs were avatars of Vishnu, because the Gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil Mughal era persecution.\n\nWhile some Hindus consider Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of Sri Lanka and protector of Buddhism. Vishnu is also known as Upulvan or uthpala varna, meaning \"Blue Lotus coloured\". Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Uthpala Varna was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in Puranic Hinduism. According to Chronicles Mahawamsa, \"Chulawamsa\" and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the custodianship to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra (Indra) and Sakra delegated this task of custodianship to god Vishnu. Many Buddhist and Hindu shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu \"Kovils\" or \"devalayas\", all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.\nJohn Holt states that Vishnu was one of the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th-century Lankatilaka and Gadaladeniya Buddhist temples. He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary Theravada monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples. According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in Ceylon was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital Polonnaruwa.\nVishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archeological sites of Southeast Asia, now predominantly of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. In Thailand, for example, statues of four armed Vishnu have been found in provinces near Malaysia and dated to be from the 4th to 9th-century, and this mirror those found in ancient India. Similarly, Vishnu statues have been discovered from the 6th to 8th century eastern Prachinburi Province and central Phetchabun Province of Thailand, and southern Đồng Tháp Province and An Giang Province of Vietnam. Krishna statues dated to the early 7th century to 9th century have been discovered in Takéo Province and other provinces of Cambodia. Archeological studies have uncovered Vishnu statues on the islands of Indonesia, and these have been dated to the 5th century and thereafter. In addition to statues, inscriptions and carvings of Vishnu, such as those related to the \"three steps of Vishnu\" (Trivikrama) have been found in many parts of Buddhist southeast Asia. In some iconography, the symbolism of Surya, Vishnu and Buddha are fused.\n\nIn Japanese Buddhist pantheon, Vishnu is known as Bichū-ten (毘紐天), and he appears in Japanese texts such as the 13th century compositions of Nichiren.\n\nAncient Egyptian God Horus too is a part of a trinity, just like Vishnu is, states James Freeman Clarke. According to Richard Leviton, the younger Horus riding on elder Horus is similar to Vishnu riding on Garuda. According to James Cowles Prichard, while the trinity concept is present in both Egyptian and Indian mythologies, Horus cannot be clearly identified with Vishnu and the link doubtful.\n\n4034 Vishnu is an asteroid discovered by Eleanor F. Helin.\n\nVishnu rocks are a type of volcanic sediment found in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. Consequently, mass formations are known as Vishnu's temples.\n\nDuring an excavation in an abandoned village of Russia in the Volga region, archaeologist Alexander Kozhevin excavated an ancient idol of Vishnu. The idol dates from between the 7th and 10th centuries. In the interview, Kozhevin stated that \"We may consider it incredible, but we have ground to assert that Middle-Volga region was the original land of Ancient Rus. This is a hypothesis, but a hypothesis, which requires thorough research.\"\n\nVishnu iconography show him with a dark blue, blue-gray or black colored skin, and as a well dressed jeweled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two armed representations are also found and discussed in Hindu texts on artworks. The historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell between first two fingers of one hand (left back), a chakra – war discus – in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil. One of his arms sometimes carries a \"gadda\" (club, mace) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge. In the fourth arm, he holds a lotus flower which symbolizes purity and transcendence. The items he holds in various hands varies, giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography, each combination representing a special form of Vishnu. Each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the \"Agni Purana\" and \"Padma Purana\". These texts, however, are inconsistent. Vishnu iconography show him either in standing pose, seated in a yoga pose, or reclining. Hindu texts on iconography describe design rules of these.\n\nSome of the earliest surviving grand Vishnu temples in India have been dated to the Gupta Empire period. The Sarvatobhadra temple in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, for example, is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of Vishnu. Its design based on a square layout and Vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium Hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the \"Brihat Samhita\" and \"Visnudharmottarapurana\".\n\nArchaeological evidence suggest that Vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century BCE. The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century BCE inscriptions in Rajasthan which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of ~100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in Naneghat cave in Maharashtra by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities, and several discoveries in Mathura relating to Vishnu, all dated to about the start of the common era.\n\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is dedicated to Vishnu. The temple has attracted huge donations in gold and precious stones over its long history.\n\n"}
{"id": "90297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90297", "title": "Xiuhtecuhtli", "text": "Xiuhtecuhtli\n\nIn Aztec mythology, Xiuhtecuhtli (\"Turquoise Lord\" or \"Lord of Fire\"), was the god of fire, day and heat. He was the lord of volcanoes, the personification of life after death, warmth in cold (fire), light in darkness and food during famine. He was also named Cuezaltzin (\"flame\") and Ixcozauhqui , and is sometimes considered to be the same as Huehueteotl (\"Old God\"), although Xiuhtecuhtli is usually shown as a young deity. His wife was Chalchiuhtlicue. Xiuhtecuhtli is sometimes considered to be a manifestation of Ometecuhtli, the Lord of Duality, and according to the Florentine Codex Xiuhtecuhtli was considered to be the father of the Gods, who dwelled in the turquoise enclosure in the center of earth. Xiuhtecuhtli-Huehueteotl was one of the oldest and most revered of the indigenous pantheon. The cult of the God of Fire, of the Year, and of Turquoise perhaps began as far back as the middle Preclassic period. Turquoise was the symbolic equivalent of fire for Aztec priests. A small fire was permanently kept alive at the sacred center of every Aztec home in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli.\n\nThe Nahuatl word \"xihuitl\" means \"year\" as well as \"turquoise\" and \"fire\", and Xiuhtecuhtli was also the god of the year and of time. The Lord of the Year concept came from the Aztec belief that Xiuhtecuhtli was the North Star. In the 260-day ritual calendar, the deity was the patron of the day \"Atl\" (\"Water\") and with the trecena 1 Coatl (\"1 Snake\"). Xiuhtecuhtli was also one of the nine Lords of the Night and ruled the first hour of the night, named \"Cipactli\" (\"Alligator\"). Scholars have long emphasized that this fire deity also has aquatic qualities. Xiuhtecuhtli dwelt inside an enclosure of turquoise stones, fortifying himself with turquoise bird water. He is the god of fire in relation to the cardinal directions, just as the brazier for lighting fire is the center of the house or temple. Xiuhtecuhtli was the patron god of the Aztec emperors, who were regarded as his living embodiment at their enthronement. The deity was also one of the patron gods of the \"pochteca\" merchant class.\n\nStone sculptures of Xiuhtecuhtli were ritually buried as offerings, and various statuettes have been recovered during excavations at the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan with which he was closely associated. Statuettes of the deity from the temple depict a seated male with his arms crossed. A sacred fire was always kept burning in the temples of Xiuhtecuhtli. In gratitude for the gift of fire, the first mouthful of food from each meal was flung into the hearth.\n\n Xiuhtecuhtli's face is painted with black and red pigment. Xiuhtecuhtli was usually depicted adorned with turquoise mosaic, wearing the turquoise \"xiuhuitzolli\" crown of rulership on his head and a turquoise butterfly pectoral on his chest, and he often wears a descending turquoise \"xiuhtototl\" bird (\"Cotinga amabilis\") on his forehead and the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent on his back. He owns fire serpent earplugs. On his head he has a paper crown painted with different colors and motifs. On top of the crown there are sprays of green feathers, like flames from a fire. He has feather tufts to each side, like pendants, toward his ears. On his back he has plumage resembling a dragon's head, made of yellow feathers with marine conch shells. He has copper bells tied to the insteps of his feet. In his left hand he holds a shield with five greenstones, called \"chalchihuites\", placed in the form of a cross on a thin gold plate that covered almost all the shield. In his right hand he has a kind of scepter that was a round gold plate with a hole in the middle, and topped by two globes, one larger than the other, the smaller one had a point. Xiuhtecuhtli is closely associated with youthful warriors and with rulership, and was considered a solar god. His principal symbols are the \"tecpatl\" (flint) and the \"mamalhuatzin\", the two sticks that were rubbed together to light ceremonial fires. A staff with a deer's head was also an attribute of Xiuhtecuhtli, although not exclusively so as it could also be associated with Xochiquetzal and other deities.\n\nMany of the attributes of Xiuhtecuhtli are found associated with Early Postclassic Toltec warriors but clear representations of the god are not common until the Late Postclassic. The \"nahual\", or spirit form, of Xiuhtecuhtli is Xiuhcoatl, the Fire Serpent.\n\nXiuhtecuhtli was embodied in the \"teotecuilli\", the sacrificial brazier into which sacrificial victims were cast during the New Fire ceremony. This took place at the end of each cycle of the Aztec calendar round (every 52 years), when the gods were thought to be able to end their covenant with humanity. Feasts were held in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli to keep his favors, and human sacrifices were burned after removing their heart.\n\nThe annual festival of Xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated in \"Izcalli\", the 18th veintena of the year. The Nahuatl word izcalli means \"stone house\" and refers to the building where maize used to be dried and roasted between mid-January and mid-February. The whole month was therefore devoted to fire. The Izcalli rituals grew in importance every four years. A framework image of the deity was constructed from wood and was richly finished with clothing, feathers and an elaborate mask. Quails were sacrificed to the idol and their blood spilt before it and copal was burnt in his honour. On the day of the festival, the priests of Xiuhtecuhtli spent the day dancing and singing before their god. People caught animals, including mammals, birds, snakes, lizards and fish, for ten days before the festival in order to throw them into the hearth on the night of the festival. On the tenth day of Izcalli, during a festival called \"huauhquiltamalcualiztli\" (\"eating of the amaranth leaf tamales\"), the New Fire was lighted, signifying the change of the annual cycle and the rebirth of the fire deity. During the night the image of the god was lit with using the \"mamalhuatzin\". Food was consumed ritually, including shrimp tamales, after first offering it to the god.\nEvery four years a more solemn version of the festival was held at the temple of Xiuhtecuhtli in Tenochtitlan, attended by the emperor and his nobles. Slaves and captives were dressed as the deity and sacrificed in his honour. Godparents were assigned to children on this day and the children had their ears ritually pierced. After this, the children, their parents and godparents all shared a meal together.\n\nXiuhtecuhtli was celebrated often but especially at the end of every 52-year period. This was the time the 365-day solar and the 260-day sacred calendars ended on the same day and the Aztec celebrated the Binding of the Years with the New Fire Ceremony. In order to perform the ritual, priests marched in solemn procession up the Hill of the Star on a peninsula near \"Culhuacán\" to wait for the star \"Yohualtecuhtli\" (either Aldebaran in the Taurus constellation or the Pleiades as a whole) to get past its zenith. Having ascertained this, they would tear out the heart of a sacrificial victim and kindle a flame in a small wooden hearth they placed inside the hole left in his chest. Priests used a drill method to generate this sacred flame. It was then carried on pine sticks to light the fires anew in every hearth, including the sacred braziers of perpetual fire, that numbered over 600 in the capital alone.\n\nA set of six postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail in 2003 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the British Museum featured a mask of Xiuhtecuhtli alongside other Museum objects such as the Sutton Hoo helmet and Hoa Hakananai'a.\n\n"}

The impetus to the group's formation was the Time of Troubles. The members believed the massacres and conflagrations of the time to be the manifestation of a wrathful God, angry with the Russian people's lack of religiosity. In response, the group called for the rebirth of the Russian Orthodox faith, and a renewal of the religious piety of the masses. \n\nThe Zealots of Piety included Fyodor Rtishchev, Archmandrite Nikon (Minin) of the Novospassky Monastery (future Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia), Abbot Ivan Neronov of the Kazan Cathedral, archpriests Avvakum Petrov, Loggin, Lazar, and Daniil. The members of the Zealots of Piety wanted to enhance the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church and increase its influence upon the people. Among other goals of the circle were the struggle against the shortcomings and vices of the clergy, revival of church sermons and other means for influencing the masses. They also aimed to assist the needy and weak in Russian society, protecting them from social injustice, and to spread the Gospel to the Russian people, making faith more integral in daily life. The Zealots of Piety soon became the actual rulers of the Russian Orthodox Church, thanks to the support from the tsar, who had paid much attention to the advice of his confessor. \n\nAfter Nikon had been elected patriarch in 1652, the groups turned against their former member, protesting several of his reforms. Over time, the group began to dissolve, as many of its members became active figures in the Old Believers movement.\n"}

Sixteen years later he was suddenly freed at the age of 64 as a ramification of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. At the time of his release, the major centres of Bahá'í population and scholarly activity were mostly in Iran, with other large communities in Baku, Azerbaijan, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Occident the religion had been introduced in the late 1890s in several locales. However, by 1910 the religion's followers still numbered less than a few thousands across the entire West. `Abdu'l-Bahá thus took steps to personally present the Bahá'í teachings to the West by travelling to Europe and North America. His first excursion outside of Palestine and Iran was to Egypt in 1910 where he stayed for around a year, followed by a near five-month trip to France and Great Britain in 1911. After returning to Egypt, he left on a trip to North America which lasted nearly 8 months. During that trip he visited many cities across the United States, from major metropolitan areas on the eastern coast of the country, to cities in the midwest, and California on the west coast; he also visited Montreal in Canada. Following his trip in North America he visited various countries in Europe, including France, Britain and Germany for six months, followed by a six-month stay again in Egypt, before returning to Haifa.\n\nWith his visits to the West, the small Western Bahá'í community was given a chance to consolidate and embrace a wider vision of the religion; the religion also attracted the attention of sympathetic attention from both religious, academic, and social leaders as well as in newspapers which provided significant coverage of `Abdu'l-Bahá's visits. During his travels `Abdu'l-Bahá would give talks at the homes of Bahá'ís, at hotels, and at other public and religious sites, such as the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration, the Bethel Literary and Historical Society, at the NAACP, at Howard and Stanford universities, and at various Theosophical Societies, among others. `Abdu'l-Bahá talks across the West also became an important addition to the body of Bahá'í literature. In succeeding decades after his visit the American community substantially grew and then spread across South America, Australasia, Subsaharan Africa and the Far East.\n\nDuring these journeys Bahiyyih Khánum, his sister, was given the position of acting head of the religion.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá left Haifa for Port Said, Egypt on 29 August 1910. Earlier on that day he had accompanied two pilgrims to the Shrine of the Báb, and then he headed down to the port in the city where at around 4pm he set sail on the steamer \"Kosseur London\" and then telegrammed the Bahá'ís in Haifa that he was in Egypt. `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in the city for around one month where Bahá'ís from Cairo came to visit him.\n\nOn 1 October, `Abdu'l-Bahá again set sail; his intention was to go to Europe, but because of his poor health, he instead landed in Alexandria where he stayed for nearly eight months. While in Egypt there was increasingly positive coverage of him and the Bahá'ís from various Egyptian news outlets. While in Alexandria he met with a larger number of people. In November he met with Briton Wellesley Tudor Pole who later became a Bahá'í. He also was visited by Russian/Polish Isabella Grinevskaya who also became a Bahá'í. In late April Louis Gregory, an Africa-American who had gone on Bahá'í pilgrimage, met with `Abdu'l-Bahá while he was in the suburb of Ramleh. Later in May `Abdu'l-Bahá moved to Cairo and got more favourable press coverage, including from Al-Ahram. During his time there he met the Mufti of Egypt, with Abbas II of Egypt, the Khedive of Egypt.\n\nFinally on 11 August 1911 `Abdu'l-Bahá left Egypt towards Europe. He boarded the \"SS Corsican\", an Allan Line Royal Mail Steamer towards the port of Marseilles, France accompanied by secretary Mírzá Mahmúd, and personal assistant Khusraw. Memoirs that cover the periods in Egypt include \n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's first European trip spanned from August to December 1911, at which time he returned to Egypt. During his first European trip he visited Lake Geneva on the border of France and Switzerland, Great Britain and Paris, France. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the West and to further spread his father's teachings, after sending representatives and a letter to the First Universal Races Congress in July.\n\nVarious memoirs cover this period.\n\nWhen `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Marseille, he was greeted by , a prominent early French Bahá'í. Dreyfus-Barney accompanied `Abdu'l-Bahá to Thonon-les-Bains, a French town, on Lake Geneva that straddles France and Switzerland.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Thonon-les-Bains in France for a few days before going to Vevey in Switzerland. In Vevey `Abdu'l-Bahá offered a talk on the Bahá'í point of view on the immortality of soul and relationship of worlds and on the subject of divorce. He also met Horace Holley there. While in Thonon, `Abdu'l-Bahá met Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan, who had asked to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá. Soltan, who had ordered the execution of King and Beloved of martyrs, was the eldest grandson of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar who had ordered the Execution of the Báb himself. Thompson, an American Bahá'í who had also come to visit `Abdu'l-Bahá, shared comments of Hippolyte who heard Soltan's stammering apology for past wrongs. `Abdu'l-Bahá embraced him and invited his sons to lunch. Thus Bahram Mirza Sardar Mass'oud and Akbar Mass’oud, another grandson of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, met with the Bahá'ís, and apparently Akbar was greatly affected by meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nOn 3 September `Abdu'l-Bahá left the shores of Lake Geneva travelling towards London where he arrived on 4 September; he would stay in London until 23 September. While in London `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed at a residence of Lady Blomfield. On the first few days in London `Abdu'l-Bahá was interviewed by the editor of the \"Christian Commonwealth\", a weekly newspaper devoted to a liberal Christian theology. The editor was also present at a meeting of the Reverend Reginald John Campbell and `Abdu'l-Bahá and wrote about the meeting in the 13 September edition of the \"Christian Commonwealth\" and the reprinted in the Star of the West Bahá'í magazine. After the meeting, the Reverend Reginald John Campbell asked `Abdu'l-Bahá to speak at City Temple.\n\nLater in the month `Abdu'l-Bahá took a trip to Byfleet near Surrey where he visited Alice Buckton and Anett Schepel at their home. On the evening of 10 September he gave his first public talk in the Occident at City Temple The English translation was read by Wellesley Tudor Pole and the talk was printed in the \"Christian Commonwealth\" newspaper on 13 September.\n\nOn 17 September, at the invitation of Albert Wilberforce, Archdeacon of Westminster, he addressed the congregation of Saint John the Divine, in Westminster. He spoke on the subject of the kingdoms of mineral, vegetable, animal, humanity, and the Manifestations of God beneath God; Albert Wilberforce read the English translation himself. On the 28th `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to Byfleet again visiting Buckhorn and Schepel. He visited Bristol on the 23rd–25th for several receptions and meetings though less public. On one such meeting he mentioned \"When a thought of war enters your mind, suppress it, and plant in its stead a positive thought of peace.\" On the 30th he spoke to a Theosophical Society meeting with Annie Besant, Alfred Percy Sinnett, Eric Hammond, who later published a volume on the religion in 1909. Back in London Alice Buckton visited Abdu'l-Bahá once again, and he went to Church House, Westminster to see a Christmas mystery play titled \"Eager Heart\" that she had written.\n\nFrom 23 to 25 September, `Abdu'l-Bahá went to Bristol where he met with many leading individuals including David Graham Pole, Claude Montefiore, Alexander Whyte, Lady Evelyn Moreton among others. Rev. Peter Z. Easton, a Presbyterian in the Synod of the Northeast in New York who was stationed in Tabriz, Iran from 1873 to 1880, didn't have an appointment to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá. Easton attempted to meet and challenge `Abdu'l-Bahá and in his actions made those around him uncomfortable; `Abdu'l-Bahá withdrew him to a private conversation and then he left. Later he printed a polemic attack on the religion, \"Bahaism — A Warning\", in the \"Evangelical Christendom\" newspaper of London (September–October 1911 edition.) The polemic was later responded to by Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl in his book \"The Brilliant Proof\" written in December 1911.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá returned to London on 25 September, and a pastor of a Congregational church in the east end of London invited him to give an address on the following Sunday evening. `Abdu'l-Bahá also visited to Oxford University where he met the higher Bible critic, Dr. Thomas Kelly Cheyne. Though ill, `Abdu'l-Bahá embraced him and praised his life's work. News of his activity in Britain was covered in New Zealand in a couple publications.\n\nEzra Pound met with him about the end of September, later explaining to Margaret Craven that Pound approached him like \"an inquisition… and came away feeling that questions would been an impertinence….\" The whole point is that they have \"done\" instead of talking, and a persian movement for religious unity that claims the feminine soul equal to the male… is worth while.\"\n\nOn 1 October 1911, he returned to Bristol to perform a wedding of Bahá'ís who had traveled from Persia and who brought humble gifts as well. On 3 October `Abdu'l-Bahá left London for Paris, France.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Paris for nine weeks, during which time he stayed at a residence at 4 Avenue de Camoens, and during his time there he was helped by Mr. Dreyfus-Barney and his wife, along with Lady Blomfield who had come from London. `Abdu'l-Bahá's first talk in Paris was on 16 October, and later that same day guests gathered in a poor quarter outside Paris at a home for orphans by Mr and Mrs. Ponsonaille which was much praised by `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nFrom almost every day from 16 October to 26 November he gives talks. On a few of the days, he gave more than one talk. The book Paris Talks, part I, records transcripts of `Abdu'l-Bahá's talks while he was in Paris for the first time. The substance of the volume is from notes Sara Louisa Blomfield, her two daughters and a friend. While most of his talks were held at his residence, he also gave talks at the Theosophical Society headquarters, at L'Alliance Spiritaliste, and on 26 November he spoke at Charles Wagner's church \"Foyer de l-Ame\". He also met with various people including Muhammad ibn `Abdu'l-Vahhad-i Qazvini and Seyyed Hasan Taqizadeh. It was during one of the meetings with Taqizadeh that `Abdu'l-Bahá personally first spoke on a telephone.\n\nOn 2 December 1911 `Abdu'l-Bahá left France, returning to Egypt.\n\nIn the following year, `Abdu'l-Bahá undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and Canada, ultimately visiting some 40 cities, to once again spread his father's teachings. He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912. While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited many cities on the east coast. Then in August he started a more extensive journey across to the West coast before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe. Several people, including `Abdu'l-Bahá himself, Dr. Allan L. Ward, author of \"239 Days\"', and critic Samuel Graham Wilson have taken note of the uniqueness of this trip. Ward wrote: \"... never before during the formative years of a religion has a figure of like stature made a journey of such magnitude in a setting so different from that of His native land.\" Wilson stated: \"But Abdul Baha, except for Hindu Swamis, was the first Asiatic revelator America has received. Its hospitality showed up well. The public and press neither stoned the \"prophet\" nor caricatured him but looked with kindly eye upon the grave old man, in flowing oriental robes and white turban, with waving hoary hair and long white beard.\"\n\nDuring his nine months on the continent, he met with David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University; Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise of New York City; the inventor Alexander Graham Bell; Jane Addams, the noted social worker; the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was touring America at the time; Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress; the industrialist and humanitarian Andrew Carnegie; Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor; the Arctic explorer Admiral Robert Peary; as well as hundreds of American and Canadian Bahá’ís, recent converts to the religion.\n\nA large number of memoirs cover this period as well as a wide array of newspaper stories.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá boarded the RMS Cedric in Alexandria, Egypt bound for Naples on 25 March 1912. Others with him included Shoghi Effendi, Asadu'lláh-i-Qumí, Dr Amínu'lláh Faríd, Mírzá Munír-i-Zayn, Áqá Khusraw, and Mahmúd-i-Zarqání. During the voyage a member of the Unitarians onboard requested if `Abdu'l-Bahá would send a message to them. He replied with a message announcing \"… Glad tidings, glad tidings, the Herald of the Kingdom has raised His voice.\" Through several conversations it was arranged by several passengers that he address a larger audience on the ship. The ship arrived in Naples harbour on 28 March 1912, and on the next day several Bahá'ís from America and Britain boarded the ship. `Abdu'l-Bahá and his group did not disembark for fear of being confused with Turks during the ongoing Italo-Turkish War. Shoghi Effendi and two others were refused further passage by reason of a minor illness and were taken ashore. Though all were not convinced of the sincerity of the diagnosis and some presumed it was ill will against the voyagers as if they were Turkish.\n\nThe American Bahá'í community had sent thousands of dollars urging `Abdu'l-Bahá to leave the Cedric in Italy and travel to England to sail on the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. Instead he returned the money for charity and continued the voyage on the Cedric. From Naples, the group sailed on to New York — the group included `Abdu'l-Bahá, Asadu'lláh-i-Qumí, Dr Amínu'lláh Faríd, Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, Mr and Mrs Percy Woodcock and their daughter from Canada, Mr and Mrs Austin from Denver, Colorado, and Miss Louisa Mathew. Other notables aboard included at least two Italian embassy officials; note `Abdu'l-Bahá was listed as an \"author\" on immigration paperwork. They passed Gibraltar on 3 April onward to New York. Many letters and telegrams were sent and received during the voyage as well as various tablets written.\n\nThe SS Cedric arrived in New York harbour on the morning of 11 April and telegrams were sent and received from Bahá'í local spiritual assemblies to announce his safe arrival while the passengers were processed for quarantine. Bahá'ís who had gathered at the port were generally sent to gather at a home where `Abdu'l-Bahá was to visit later. Reporters interviewed him while he was on board and he elaborated on the trip and his goals. However a few Bahá'ís, including Marjorie Morten, Rhoda Nichols and Juliet Thompson, hid themselves to catch a glimpse of `Abdu'l-Bahá. His arrival in New York was covered by various different newspapers including the New York Tribune and the Washington Post.\n\nWhile in New York he stayed at The Ansonia hotel. Several blocks to the north west of the hotel was the residence of Edward B. Kinney, where `Abdu'l-Bahá held his first meeting with the American Bahá'ís; his next talk was at given at Howard MacNutt's residence. From 11 April until 25 April he gave at least one talk a day and most mornings and afternoons were spent meeting often one by one with visitors coming to his residence. During `Abdu'l-Bahá's time in New York, Lua Getsinger helped correspond with various Bahá'ís about `Abdu'l-Bahá's plans as they evolved.\n\nRev. Percy Stickney Grant, through association with Juliet Thompson, invited `Abdu'l-Bahá to speak at Church of the Ascension on the evening of 14 April. The event was covered by the New York Times, the \"New York Tribune\", and the \"Washington Post\". The event caused a stir because, while there were rules in the Episcopal Church Canon forbidding someone of another ordination from preaching from the pulpit without the consent of the bishop, there was no provision against a non-ordained person offering prayer in the chancel.\n\nMary Williams, also known as Kate Carew, known for her caricatures, was among those who visited `Abdu'l-Bahá and travelled with him for a number of days. On 16 April, with Mary Williams still travelling with him, `Abdu'l-Bahá visited the Bowery. Mary Williams noted that she was impressed with `Abdu'l-Bahá's generosity of spirit in bringing people of social standing to the Bowery as well as that he then gave money to the poor. Some boys were reported to heckle the event but were invited afterwards for a personal meeting. At this meeting, after greeting all the boys, `Abdu'l-Bahá singled out an African-American boy and compared him to a black rose as well as rich chocolate.\n\nIn Boston newspaper reporters asked `Abdu'l-Bahá why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough. A full page summary of the religion was printed in the New York Times. A booklet on the religion was published late April.\n\nOn 20 April `Abdu'l-Bahá left New York and travelled to Washington D.C. where he stayed until 28 April. While in Washington D.C. a number of meetings and notable events took place. On 23 April `Abdu'l-Bahá attended several events; first he spoke at Howard University to over 1000 students, faculty, administrators and visitors — an event commemorated in 2009. Then he attended a reception by the Persian Charg-de-Affairs and the Turkish Ambassador; at this reception `Abdu'l-Bahá moved the place-names such that the only African-American present, Louis George Gregory, was seated at the head of the table next to himself. `Abdu'l-Bahá also welcomed William Sulzer, then a Democratic Congressman and later Governor from New York, as well as Champ Clark, then Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nLater during his stay in Washington, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at Bethel Literary and Historical Society, the leading African-American institution of Washington DC. The talk had been planned out by the end of March due to the work of Louis Gregory. While in Washington `Abdu'l-Bahá continued to speak from the Parson's home to individuals and groups. A Methodist minister suggested some of his listeners should teach him Christianity, though also judged him sincere.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Chicago on 29 April, though later than anticipated as he had hoped to be in Chicago in time for the American Bahá'í national convention. While in Chicago `Abdu'l-Bahá attended the last session of the newly founded Bahá'í Temple Unity, and laid the dedication stone of the Bahá'í House of Worship near Chicago.\n\nRobert Sengstacke Abbott, an African American lawyer and newspaper publisher, met `Abdu'l-Bahá when covering a talk of his during his stay in Chicago at Jane Addams' Hull House. He would later become a Bahá'í in 1934. Also while `Abdu'l-Bahá was in Chicago, the NAACP's print magazine \"The Crisis\" printed an article introducing the religion to their readers, and later in June noted `Abdu'l-Bahá's talk at their fourth national convention.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá left Chicago on 6 May and went to Cleveland where he stayed until the 7th. Though Saichiro Fujita, one of the first Bahá'ís of Japanese descent, was living in Cleveland working for a Dr Barton-Peek, a female Bahá'í, he failed to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá as he came through. He was able to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá later during his further travels. In Cleveland `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at his hotel twice and was interviewed by newspaper reporters. Among some who met `Abdu'l-Bahá in Cleveland included Louise Gregory, and Alain Locke.\n\nOn 7 May `Abdu'l-Bahá went to Pittsburgh where a speaking engagement was arranged for him in early April through the efforts of Martha Root. He stayed in Pittsburgh for one day before going back to Washington D.C on 8 May 1912.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Washington DC from 8 to 11 May, when he then returned to the New York City area. On 12 May he visited Montclair, NJ, and then on 14 May he went to northern New York state to Lake Mohonk where he addressed the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration and stayed at the Mohonk Mountain House.\n\nHis talk was covered by many publications, and began \"When we consider history, we find that civilization is progressing, but in this century its progress cannot be compared with that of past centuries. This is the century of light and of bounty. In the past, the unity of patriotism, the unity of nations and religions was established; but in this century, the oneness of the world of humanity is established; hence this century is greater than the past.\"\n\nIn the rest of his talk he outlined a brief history of religious conflict, spoke about some of the Bahá'í teachings including the oneness of humanity, the complimentary role of religion and science, the equality of women and men, the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty, and that humanity needs more than philosophy — that it needs the breadth of the Holy Spirit. A reverend heard his presentation and invited him and introduced him at a reception at another event on 28 May. Elbert Hubbard, an American writer, also noted `Abdu'l-Bahá's talk at the Mohonk conference. Samuel Chiles Mitchell, then President at the University of South Carolina was present and affected by his presentation. Through correspondence with Gregory, Gregory came to the view that Mitchell had repeated `Abdu'l-Bahá’s words \"upon many platforms.\"\n\nAfter the conference, `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to New York City, where he stayed until the 22nd, leaving to the Boston area for four days including a trip to Worcester, Massachusetts on the 23rd. On 26 May he returned to New York City, where he would remain for most of his time until 20 June. He took short trips to Fanwood, New Jersey, from 31 May to 1 June, to Milford, Pennsylvania, on 3 June, and to Philadelphia from 8 to 10 June, always returning to New York City.\n\nOn 18 June `Abdu'l-Bahá hosted a meeting at the MacNutt's home for the purpose of being filmed and recorded. This film was the second time that `Abdu'l-Bahá was filmed, and was done by Bahá'ís at the home of Howard MacNutt. The film recorded at the MacNutt residence was released as a short movie called \"Servant of Glory\".\n\nOver several days starting on 1 June `Abdu'l-Bahá sat for a life-sized portrait by Juliet Thompson. During that time Thompson witnessed Lua Getsinger given the task of conveying `Abdu'l-Bahá's message that New York was the \"City of the Covenant\"; when the group moved into the rest of the house Getsinger made the announcement.\n\nLater in the month, `Abdu'l-Bahá visited Montclair, New Jersey from 20 to 25 June, coming back to New York until 29 June. On 29 and 30 June he visited West Englewood, NJ which is now Teaneck and attended a \"Unity Feast\" similar to a Nineteen Day Feast where Bahá'ís, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Caucasians, African-Americans, and Persians attended. Among those that attended the event was Martha Root. For her it was a high point in her life and has since been commemorized as `Abdu'l-Bahá's \"Souvenir Picnic\". It is at this event that Lua Getsinger intentionally walked through poison ivy hoping to make her incapable of leaving the presence of `Abdu'l-Bahá when he asked her to travel ahead of him to California. Today the property is known as the Wilhelm Bahá'í Properties.\n\nHis further travels took him to Morristown, New Jersey on 30 June and he then went back to New York for a nearly a month from 30 June to 23 July, with a sojourn in West Englewood, NJ on 14 July. Starting on 23 June `Abdu'l-Bahá went to New England on his way to Canada in late August. He stayed in Boston for 23 and 24 July, and then went to the summer home of Mr. and Mrs. Parsons in Dublin, New Hampshire from 24 July to 16 Aug. He then went to Eliot, Maine from 16 to 23 Aug, where he stayed in Green Acre which was then a conference facility, and which since has become a Bahá'í school. His final destination in New England was Malden, Massachusetts where he stayed from 23 to 29 August.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá had mentioned an intention of visiting Montreal as early as February 1912 and in August a phone number was listed for inquirers to arrange appointments for his visit there. He left to Boston and then rode to Montreal where he arrived near midnight on 30 August 1912 at the Windsor train station on Peel Street and was greeted by William Sutherland Maxwell. He would stay in Montreal until 9 September. On his first day in the city he was visited by Frederick Robertson Griffin who would later lead the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. Later that morning he visited a friend of the Maxwell's who had a sick baby. In the afternoon he took a car ride around Montreal. That evening a reception was held including a local socialist leader. The next day he spoke at a Unitarian church on Sherbrooke Street. Anne Savage recorded that she had sought him out but uncharacteristically was shy upon seeing him. He took up residence in the Windsor Hotel. The next day William Peterson, then Principal of McGill University visited him. After a day of meeting individuals he took an afternoon excursion on his own possibly to the francophone part of the city and back. That evening he spoke to a socialist meeting addressing \"The Economic Happiness of the Human Race\" — that we are as one family and should care for each other, not to have absolute equality but to have a firm minimum even for the poorest, to note foremost the position of the farmer, and a progressive tax system. The next day he rode the Mountain Elevator of Montreal The next day Paul Bruchési Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal visited him and later he spoke at the Saint James United Church; his talk outlined a comprehensive review of the Bahá'í teachings. Afterwards he said:I find these two great American nations highly capable and advanced in all that appertains to progress and civilization. These governments are fair and equitable. The motives and purposes of these people are lofty and inspiring. Therefore, it is my hope that these revered nations may become prominent factors in the establishment of international peace and the oneness of the world of humanity; that they may lay the foundations of equality and spiritual brotherhood among mankind; that they may manifest the highest virtues of the human world, revere the divine lights of the Prophets of God and establish the reality of unity so necessary today in the affairs of nations. I pray that the nations of the East and West shall become one flock under the care and guidance of the divine Shepherd. Verily, this is the bestowal of God and the greatest honor of man. This is the glory of humanity. This is the good pleasure of God. I ask God for this with a contrite heart.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the \"Montreal Daily Star\" met with him and that newspaper along with The Montreal Gazette, \"Montreal Standard\", Le Devoir and La Presse among others reported on `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities. The headlines in those papers included \"Persian Teacher to Preach Peace\", \"Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices\", and \"Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth.\" The \"Montreal Standard\", which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him. The \"Harbor Grace Standard\" newspaper, of Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, printed a story summarizing several of his talks and trips. After he left the country, the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" highlighted his position on the equality of women and men. All together some accounts of his talks and trips would reach 440,000 in French and English coverage. He travelled through several villages on the way back to the States.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá left Canada and started his travel to the American West coast stopping in multiple places in the country during his travels. From 9 September through 12th he stayed in Buffalo, New York, where he made a fleeting visit to Niagara Falls on 12 September. He then travelled to Chicago (12–15 September), Kenosha, Wisconsin (15–16 September), back to Chicago on 16 September, and then to Minneapolis where he stayed from 16 to 21 September.\n\nHis further travels took him to Omaha, Nebraska (21 September), Lincoln, Nebraska (23 September), Denver, Colorado ( 24–27 September), Glenwood Springs, Colorado (28 September), and Salt Lake City (29–30 September). In Salt Lake City, `Abdu'l-Bahá, accompanied by his translators, Saichiro Fujita and others attended the Utah State Fair and visited the Mormon Tabernacle. During the Mormon's annual convention, at the steps of the Temple, he was reported to have said: \"They built me a temple but they will not let me in!\" He left the next day and travelled by railcar to San Francisco, on what was then the Central Pacific Railroad, through Reno. Traveling all day through Nevada on its way to California, the train made regular stops but there's no record of `Abdu'l-Bahá disembarking until his arrival in San Francisco. While traversing the Sierra Nevada, he made a reference to observing the snow sheds at Donner Pass and the struggle of the pioneering members of the Donner Party.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in San Francisco on 4 October. During his visit to California he mostly stayed in Bay Area including from 4–13 October, 16–18 October, 21–25 October with shorter trips to Pleasanton from 13 to 16 October, to Los Angeles from 18–21 October and to Sacramento from 25–26 October While in San Francisco, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at Stanford University on 8 October, and at Temple Emmanuel-El on 12 October.\n\nWhen `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Los Angeles he went to the Hotel Lankershim, where he would reside during he stay, and where he would later give a talk. On his first full day in Los Angeles `Abdu'l-Bahá, along with twenty-five other Bahá'ís, visited Thornton Chase's grave on 19 October. Thornton Chase was the first American Bahá'í, and he had only recently moved to Los Angeles and helped form the first Local Spiritual Assembly in the city. `Abdu'l-Bahá was eager to meet Thornton Chase, but Chase died on the evening of 30 September shortly before `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in California on 4 October. `Abdu'l-Bahá designated Chase's grave a place of pilgrimage, and revealed a tablet of visitation, which is a prayer to say in remembrance of a person, and decreed that his death be commemorated annually.\n\nAfter his visit to California, `Abdu'l-Bahá started his trip back to the East coast. On his way back he stopped in Denver (28–29 October), Chicago (31 October – 3 November) and Cincinnati (5–6 November) before arriving in Washington, D.C. on 6 November. In Washington he was invited to speak to the Washington Hebrew Congregation at their temple on 9 November.\n\nLater on 11 November, he travelled to Baltimore, where his arrival was anticipated from early April, and he spoke at a Unitarian church saying in part that \"the world looked to America as the leader in the world-wide peace movement\" and \"not being a rival of any other power and not considering colonization schemes or conquests, made it an ideal country to lead the movement.\" On the same day he travelled to Philadelphia, and the next day on 12 November he arrived back to New York where he stayed until he would leave back to Europe 5 December. During his stay in New York `Abdu'l-Bahá addressed a suffragette group elaborating on the equality of women and men.\n\nOn 5 December `Abdu'l-Bahá left New York, sailing for Liverpool on the RMS Celtic.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Liverpool on 13 December, and over the next six months he visited Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, and Germany before finally returning to Egypt on 12 June 1913.\n\nSeveral memoirs cover this period.\n\nAfter his arrival in Liverpool `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in the city for three days before going to London by train on 16 December. He stayed in London until 6 January 1913 and during his stay there he gave multiple talks. In one of his talks on 2 January he spoke about women's suffrage to the Women's Freedom League — part of his address, and the accompanying print coverage of his talk, noted the examples of Táhirih, Mary Magdalene, and Queen Zenobia to the organization.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá left London by the Euston Station at 10am and arrived in Edinburgh at 6.15pm where he was met by Jane Elizabeth Whyte, a notable Scottish Bahá'í and wife of Alexander Whyte, and others. While in Edinburgh he and his associates stayed at the Georgian House of #7 Charlotte Square. On 7 January `Abdu'l-Bahá visited the Outlook Tower, and then went on a driving tour of some of Edinburgh and the nearby countryside; later in the afternoon he met with students of the University of Edinburgh in the library of 7 Charlotte Sq, followed by a talk to the Edinburgh Esperanto Society in the Freemason's Hall. The meeting in the library was run by Alexander Whyte who said \"Dear and honoured Sir, I have had many meetings in this house, but never have I seen such a meeting It reminds me of what St. Paul said, ' God hath made of one blood all nations of men,' and of what our Lord said, ' They shall come from the East and the West, from the North and the South, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God.'\"\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's stay in Edinburgh was covered by The Scotsman newspaper. The newspaper coverage lead to a stream of visitors and speaking engagements on 8 Jan; he spoke at the Edinburgh College of Art, and the North Canongate School. Later in the evening he spoke at Rainy Hall, which is part of New College, which was followed by a viewing of Handel's Messiah in St Giles' Cathedral. Visitors again came on the 9th, and in the evening he gave a talk with the Theosophical society hosted by David Graham Pole. That night and or early the next morning `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie. The letter commented on reading The Gospel of Wealth. `Abdu'l-Bahá again sent a letter to Carnegie in 1915.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá and his associates leave Edinburgh mid-morning on the 10th, and went back to London until the 15th. Then he was in Bristol on 15 and 16 January, coming back to London where he stayed until the 21st, except for a trip to Woking on the 18th.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's arrived in Paris on 22 January; the visit which was his second to the city last for a couple months. During his stay in the city he continued his public talks, as well as with meeting Bahá'ís, including locals, those from Germany, and those who had come from the East specifically to meet with him. During his stay in Paris, `Abdu'l-Bahá's stayed at an apartment at 30 Rue St Didier which was rented for him by Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney.\n\nSome of the notables that `Abdu'l-Bahá met while in Paris include the Persian minister in Paris, several prominent Ottomans from the previous regime, professor 'Inayatu'llah Khan, and E.G. Browne. He also gave a talk on the evening of the 12th to the Esperantists, and on the next evening gave a talk to the Theosophists at the Hotel Moderne. He had met with a group of Pairs professors and theological students at Pasteur Henri Monneir's Theological Seminary; Pasteur Monnier was a distinguished Protestant theologian, vice-president of the Protestant Federation of France and professor of Protestant theology in Paris. Around a week later, on the 21st, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at the Salle de Troyes which was organized by L'Alliance Spiritualiste. On 30 March, `Abdu'l-Bahá left Paris toward Stuttgart.\n\nHe visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, Esslingen and Bad Mergentheim. During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of Esperantists. `Abdu'l-Bahá left Stuttgart to go to Budapest, and on his way he changed trains in Vienna, where a number of Iranian Bahá'ís were waiting for him. He spoke to them while he was waiting for the train to Budapest. In Budapest `Abdu'l-Bahá met with a number of well known social leaders including academics and leaders of peace movements including Turks, Arabs, Jews and Catholics. See the Bahá'í Faith in Hungary. He also met with the Theosophical Society, and the Turkish Association. On 11 April he spoke at the hall of the old building of parliament, and on the next day he spoke to some visitors who included the president of the Turanian Society. `Abdu'l-Bahá was supposed to leave to Vienna on the 15th, but because of a cold he did not travel to Vienna until 18 April. In Vienna `Abdu'l-Bahá met with the Persian minister, the Turkish Ambassador in multiple occasions, and spoke with Theosophists on three separate days. He also met with Bertha von Suttner, who was the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He left Vienna on the 24th, and went back to Stuttgart where he arrived early on 25 April 1913. During his week in Stuttgart, he mostly stayed at his hotel due to a lingering cold, but he did give a talk at a museum, as well as receiving guests at his room.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá left Stuttgart on 1 May, arriving in Paris on the 2nd for his third stay in the French capital; he stayed in Paris until 12 June. Because his travels had led to reduced physical strength, `Abdu'l-Bahá was largely unable to go to meetings held in Bahá'í homes during his final stay in Paris, but he did hold meetings and talks at his hotel. He also met again with Turkish and Persian ministers. On June 6h, Ahmed Izzet Pasha, the former grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire, gave a dinner party for `Abdu'l-Bahá. `Abdu'l-Bahá gave his final farewell at the Paris train station, when he boarded a train for Marseilles on 12 June. He stayed in Marseilles for one night before boarding the P & O steamer Himalaya early the next morning on 13 June. The steamer landed in Port Said in Egypt on 17 June 1913.\n\nWhen `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to Egypt, he decided not to immediately go back to Haifa. He stayed in Port Said until 11 July, and during his time there he met with many Bahá'ís, who had come to visit him from Haifa, and local Muslims and Christians. Because of bad weather conditions, `Abdu'l-Bahá moved to Ismailia, but there he contracted a fever and only attended his mail during his week there. Thinking that the humid conditions in Alexandria would be better for his health, `Abdu'l-Bahá travelled on 17 July to a Ramleh, a suburb of Alexandria. On 1 August, his grandson Shoghi Effendi, his sister Bahiyyih Khánum and his eldest daughter came to visit him from Haifa. Later during his stay he again met with Abbas II of Egypt, the Khedive of Egypt. Finally on 2 December he boarded a Lloyd Triestino boat, and headed for Haifa with stops in Port Said and Jaffa. He landed in Haifa in the early afternoon of 5 December 1913.\n\n\n\n"}
