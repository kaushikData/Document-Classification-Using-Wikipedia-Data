{"id": "102999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102999", "title": "Collective unconscious", "text": "Collective unconscious\n\nCollective unconscious (), a term coined by Carl Jung, refers to structures of the unconscious mind which are shared among beings of the same species. According to Jung, the human collective unconscious is populated by instincts and by archetypes: universal symbols such as The Great Mother, the Wise Old Man, the Shadow, the Tower, Water, the Tree of Life, and many more.\n\nJung considered the collective unconscious to underpin and surround the unconscious mind, distinguishing it from the personal unconscious of Freudian psychoanalysis. He argued that the collective unconscious had profound influence on the lives of individuals, who lived out its symbols and clothed them in meaning through their experiences. The psychotherapeutic practice of analytical psychology revolves around examining the patient's relationship to the collective unconscious.\n\nPsychiatrist and Jungian analyst Lionel Corbett argues that the contemporary terms \"autonomous psyche\" or \"objective psyche\" are more commonly used today in the practice of depth psychology rather than the traditional term of the \"collective unconscious.\"\n\nCritics of the collective unconscious concept have called it unscientific and fatalistic, or otherwise very difficult to test scientifically (due to the mythical aspect of the collective unconscious). Proponents suggest that it is borne out by findings of psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology.\n\nThe term \"collective unconscious\" first appeared in Jung's 1916 essay, \"The Structure of the Unconscious\". This essay distinguishes between the \"personal\", Freudian unconscious, filled with sexual fantasies and repressed images, and the \"collective\" unconscious encompassing the soul of humanity at large.\n\nIn \"The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology\" (November 1929), Jung wrote:\nAnd the essential thing, psychologically, is that in dreams, fantasies, and other exceptional states of mind the most far-fetched mythological motifs and symbols can appear autochthonously at any time, often, apparently, as the result of particular influences, traditions, and excitations working on the individual, but more often without any sign of them. These \"primordial images\" or \"archetypes,\" as I have called them, belong to the basic stock of the unconscious psyche and cannot be explained as personal acquisitions. Together they make up that psychic stratum which has been called the collective unconscious. \nThe existence of the collective unconscious means that individual consciousness is anything but a \"tabula rasa\" and is not immune to predetermining influences. On the contrary, it is in the highest degree influenced by inherited presuppositions, quite apart from the unavoidable influences exerted upon it by the environment. The collective unconscious comprises in itself the psychic life of our ancestors right back to the earliest beginnings. It is the matrix of all conscious psychic occurrences, and hence it exerts an influence that compromises the freedom of consciousness in the highest degree, since it is continually striving to lead all conscious processes back into the old paths.\n\nOn October 19, 1936, Jung delivered a lecture \"The Concept of the Collective Unconscious\" to the Abernethian Society at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He said:\n\nJung linked the collective unconscious to 'what Freud called \"archaic remnants\" – mental forms whose presence cannot be explained by anything in the individual's own life and which seem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited shapes of the human mind'. He credited Freud for developing his \"primal horde\" theory in \"Totem and Taboo\" and continued further with the idea of an archaic ancestor maintaining its influence in the minds of present-day humans. Every human being, he wrote, \"however high his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche.\"\n\nAs modern humans go through their process of individuation, moving out of the collective unconscious into mature selves, they establish a persona—which can be understood simply as that small portion of the collective psyche which they embody, perform, and identify with.\n\nThe collective unconscious exerts overwhelming influence on the minds of individuals. These effects of course vary widely, since they involve virtually every emotion and situation. At times, the collective unconscious can terrify, but it can also heal.\n\nJung contrasted the collective unconscious with the personal unconscious, the unique aspects of an individual study which Jung says constitute the focus of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. Psychotherapy patients, it seemed to Jung, often described fantasies and dreams which repeated elements from ancient mythology. These elements appeared even in patients who were probably not exposed to the original story. For example, mythology offers many examples of the \"dual mother\" narrative, according to which a child has a biological mother and a divine mother. Therefore, argues Jung, Freudian psychoanalysis would neglect important sources for unconscious ideas, in the case of a patient with neurosis around a dual-mother image.\n\nThis divergence over the nature of the unconscious has been cited as a key aspect of Jung's famous split from Sigmund Freud and his school of psychoanalysis. Some commentators have rejected Jung's characterization of Freud, observing that in texts such as \"Totem and Taboo\" (1913) Freud directly addresses the interface between the unconscious and society at large. Jung himself said that Freud had discovered a collective archetype, the Oedipus complex, but that it \"was the first archetype Freud discovered, the first and only one\".\n\nJung also distinguished the collective unconscious and collective consciousness, between which lay \"an almost unbridgeable gulf over which the subject finds himself suspended\". According to Jung, collective consciousness (meaning something along the lines of consensus reality) offered only generalizations, simplistic ideas, and the fashionable ideologies of the age. This tension between collective unconscious and collective consciousness corresponds roughly to the \"everlasting cosmic tug of war between good and evil\" and has worsened in the time of the mass man.\n\nOrganized religion, exemplified by the Catholic Church, lies more with the collective consciousness; but, through its all-encompassing dogma it channels and molds the images which inevitably pass from the collective unconscious into the minds of people. (Conversely, religious critics including Martin Buber accused Jung of wrongly placing psychology above transcendental factors in explaining human experience.)\n\nJung's exposition of the collective unconscious builds on the classic issue in psychology and biology regarding nature versus nurture. If we accept that nature, or heredity, has some influence on the individual psyche, we must examine the question of how this influence takes hold in the real world.\n\nOn exactly one night in its entire lifetime, the yucca moth discovers pollen in the opened flowers of the yucca plant, forms some into a pellet, and then transports this pellet, with one of its eggs, to the pistil of another yucca plant. This activity cannot be \"learned\"; it makes more sense to describe the yucca moth as experiencing intuition about how to act. Archetypes and instincts coexist in the collective unconscious as interdependent opposites, Jung would later clarify. Whereas for most animals intuitive understandings completely intertwine with instinct, in humans the archetypes have become a separate register of mental phenomena.\n\nHumans experience five main types of instinct, wrote Jung: hunger, sexuality, activity, reflection, and creativity. These instincts, listed in order of increasing abstraction, elicit and constrain human behavior, but also leave room for freedom in their implementation and especially in their interplay. Even a simple hungry feeling can lead to many different responses, including metaphorical sublimation. These instincts could be compared to the \"drives\" discussed in psychoanalysis and other domains of psychology. Several readers of Jung have observed that in his treatment of the collective unconscious, Jung suggests an unusual mixture of primordial, \"lower\" forces, and spiritual, \"higher\" forces.\n\nIn an early definition of the term, Jung writes: \"Archetypes are typical modes of apprehension, and wherever we meet with uniform and regularly recurring modes of apprehension we are dealing with an archetype, no matter whether its mythological character is recognized or not.\" He traces the term back to Philo, Irenaeus, and the \"Corpus Hermeticum\", which associate archetypes with divinity and the creation of the world, and notes the close relationship of Platonic ideas.\n\nThese archetypes dwell in a world beyond the chronology of a human lifespan, developing on an evolutionary timescale. Regarding the animus and anima, the male principle within the woman and the female principle within the man, Jung writes:\n\nThey evidently live and function in the deeper layers of the unconscious, especially in that phylogenetic substratum which I have called the collective unconscious. This localization explains a good deal of their strangeness: they bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote past. It is the mind of our unknown ancestors, their way of thinking and feeling, their way of experiencing life and the world, gods and men. The existence of these archaic strata is presumably the source of man's belief in reincarnations and in memories of \"previous experiences\". Just as the human body is a museum, so to speak, of its phylogenetic history, so too is the psyche.\n\nJung also described archetypes as imprints of momentous or frequently recurring situations in the lengthy human past.\n\nA complete list of archetypes cannot be made, nor can differences between archetypes be absolutely delineated. For example, the Eagle, a common archetype that may have a multiplicity of interpretations. It could mean the soul leaving the mortal body and connecting with the heavenly spheres. Or it may mean that someone is sexually impotent, in that they have had their spiritual ego body engaged. In spite of this difficulty Jungian analyst June Singer suggests a partial list of well-studied archetypes, listed in pairs of opposites:\nJung made reference to contents of this category of the unconscious psyche as being similar to Levy-Bruhl's use of \"collective representations\" or \"représentations collectives,\" Mythological \"motifs,\" Hubert and Mauss's \"categories of the imagination,\" and Adolf Bastian's \"primordial thoughts.\" He also called archetypes \"dominants\" because of their profound influence on mental life.\n\nIn his clinical psychiatry practice, Jung identified mythological elements which seemed to recur in the minds of his patients—above and beyond the usual complexes which could be explained in terms of their personal lives. The most obvious patterns applied to the patient's parents: \"Nobody knows better than the psychotherapist that the mythologizing of the parents is often pursued far into adulthood and is given up only with the greatest resistance.\"\n\nJung cited recurring themes as evidence of the existence of psychic elements shared among all humans. For example: \"The snake-motif was certainly not an individual acquisition of the dreamer, for snake-dreams are very common even among city-dwellers who have probably never seen a real snake.\" Still better evidence, he felt, came when patients described complex images and narratives with obscure mythological parallels. Jung's leading example of this phenomenon was a paranoid-schizophrenic patient who could see the sun's dangling phallus, whose motion caused wind to blow on earth. Jung found a direct analogue of this idea in the \"Mithras Liturgy\", from the Greek Magical Papyri of Ancient Egypt—only just translated into German—which also discussed a phallic tube, hanging from the sun, and causing wind to blow on earth. He concluded that the patient's vision and the ancient Liturgy arose from the same source in the collective unconscious.\n\nGoing beyond the individual mind, Jung believed that \"the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious\". Therefore, psychologists could learn about the collective unconscious by studying religions and spiritual practices of all cultures, as well as belief systems like astrology.\n\nPopperian critic Ray Scott Percival disputes some of Jung's examples and argues that his strongest claims are not falsifiable. Percival takes especial issue with Jung's claim that major scientific discoveries emanate from the collective unconscious and not from unpredictable or innovative work done by scientists. Percival charges Jung with excessive determinism and writes: \"He could not countenance the possibility that people sometimes create ideas that cannot be predicted, even in principle.\" Regarding the claim that all humans exhibit certain patterns of mind, Percival argues that these common patterns could be explained by common environments (i.e. by shared nurture, not nature). Because all people have families, encounter plants and animals, and experience night and day, it should come as no surprise that they develop basic mental structures around these phenomena.\n\nThis latter example has been the subject of contentious debate, and Jung critic Richard Noll has argued against its authenticity.\n\nAnimals all have some innate psychological concepts which guide their mental development. The concept of imprinting in ethology is one well-studied example, dealing most famously with the Mother constructs of newborn animals. The many predetermined scripts for animal behavior are called innate releasing mechanisms.\n\nProponents of the collective unconscious theory in neuroscience suggest that mental commonalities in humans originate especially from the subcortical area of the brain: specifically, the thalamus and limbic system. These centrally located structures link the brain to the rest of the nervous system and said to control vital processes including emotions and long-term memory .\n\nA more common experimental approach investigates the unique effects of archetypal images. An influential study of this type, by Rosen, Smith, Huston, & Gonzalez in 1991, found that people could better remember symbols paired with words representing their archetypal meaning. Using data from the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism and a jury of evaluators, Rosen et al. developed an \"Archetypal Symbol Inventory\" listing symbols and one-word connotations. Many of these connotations were obscure to laypeople. For example, a picture of a diamond represented \"self\"; a square represented \"Earth\". They found that even when subjects did not consciously associate the word with the symbol, they were better able to remember the pairing of the symbol with its chosen word. Brown & Hannigan replicated this result in 2013, and expanded the study slightly to include tests in English and in Spanish of people who spoke both languages.\n\nMaloney (1999) asked people questions about their feelings to variations on images featuring the same archetype: some positive, some negative, and some non-anthropomorphic. He found that although the images did not elicit significantly different responses to questions about whether they were \"interesting\" or \"pleasant\", but did provoke highly significant differences in response to the statement: \"If I were to keep this image with me forever, I would be\". Maloney suggested that this question led the respondents to process the archetypal images on a deeper level, which strongly reflected their positive or negative valence.\n\nUltimately, although Jung referred to the collective unconscious as an \"empirical\" concept, based on evidence, its elusive nature does create a barrier to traditional experimental research. June Singer writes: \nBut the collective unconscious lies beyond the conceptual limitations of individual human consciousness, and thus cannot possibly be encompassed by them. We cannot, therefore, make controlled experiments to prove the existence of the collective unconscious, for the psyche of man, holistically conceived, cannot be brought under laboratory conditions without doing violence to its nature. [...] In this respect, psychology may be compared to astronomy, the phenomena of which also cannot be enclosed within a controlled setting. The heavenly bodies must be observed where they exist in the natural universe, under their own conditions, rather than under conditions we might propose to set for them.\n\nProof of the existence of a collective unconscious, and insight into its nature, could be gleaned primarily from dreams and from active imagination, a waking exploration of fantasy.\n\nJung considered that 'the shadow' and the anima and animus differ from the other archetypes in the fact that their content is more directly related to the individual's personal situation'. These archetypes, a special focus of Jung's work, become autonomous personalities within an individual psyche. Jung encouraged direct conscious dialogue of the patient's with these personalities within. While the shadow usually personifies the personal unconscious, the anima or the Wise Old Man can act as representatives of the collective unconscious.\n\nJung suggested that parapsychology, alchemy, and occult religious ideas could contribute understanding of the collective unconscious. Based on his interpretation of synchronicity and extra-sensory perception, Jung argued that psychic activity transcended the brain. In alchemy, Jung found that plain water, or seawater, corresponded to his concept of the collective unconscious.\n\nIn humans, the psyche mediates between the primal force of the collective unconscious and the experience of consciousness or dream. Therefore, symbols may require interpretation before they can be understood as archetypes. Jung writes:\n\nWe have only to disregard the dependence of dream language on environment and substitute \"eagle\" for \"aeroplane,\" \"dragon\" for \"automobile\" or \"train,\" \"snake-bite\" for \"injection,\" and so forth, in order to arrive at the more universal and more fundamental language of mythology. This give us access to the primordial images that underlie all thinking and have a considerable influence even on our scientific ideas.\n\nA single archetype can manifest in many different ways. Regarding the Mother archetype, Jung suggests that not only can it apply to mothers, grandmothers, stepmothers, mothers-in-law, and mothers in mythology, but to various concepts, places, objects, and animals:\n\nOther symbols of the mother in a figurative sense appear in things representing the goal of our longing for redemption, such as Paradise, the Kingdom of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem. Many things arousing devotion or feelings of awe, as for instance the Church, university, city or country, heaven, earth, the woods, the sea or any still waters, matter even, the underworld and the moon, can be mother-symbols. The archetype is often associated with things and places standing for fertility and fruitfulness: the cornucopia, a ploughed field, a garden. It can be attached to a rock, a cave, a tree, a spring, a deep well, or to various vessels such as the baptismal font, or to vessel-shaped flowers like the rose or the lotus. Because of the protection it implies, the magic circle or mandala can be a form of mother archetype. Hollow objects such as ovens or cooking vessels are associated with the mother archetype, and, of course, the uterus, \"yoni\", and anything of a like shape. Added to this list there are many animals, such as the cow, hare, and helpful animals in general. \n\nCare must be taken, however, to determine the meaning of a symbol through further investigation; one cannot simply decode a dream by assuming these meanings are constant. Archetypal explanations work best when an already-known mythological narrative can clearly help to explain the confusing experience of an individual.\n\nPsychotherapy based on analytical psychology would seek to analyze the relationship between a person's individual consciousness and the deeper common structures which underlie them. Personal experiences both activate archetypes in the mind and give them meaning and substance for individual. At the same time, archetypes covertly organize human experience and memory, their powerful effects becoming apparent only indirectly and in retrospect. Understanding the power of the collective unconscious can help an individual to navigate through life.\n\nIn the interpretation of analytical psychologist Mary Williams, a patient who understands the impact of the archetype can help to dissociate the underlying symbol from the real person who embodies the symbol for the patient. In this way, the patient no longer uncritically transfers their feelings about the archetype onto people in everyday life, and as a result can develop healthier and more personal relationships.\n\nPractitioners of analytic psychotherapy, Jung cautioned, could become so fascinated with manifestations of the collective unconscious that they facilitated their appearance at the expense of their patient's well-being. Schizophrenics, it is said, fully identify with the collective unconscious, lacking a functioning ego to help them deal with actual difficulties of life.\n\nElements from the collective unconscious can manifest among groups of people, who by definition all share a connection to these elements. Groups of people can become especially receptive to specific symbols due to the historical situation they find themselves in. The common importance of the collective unconscious makes people ripe for political manipulation, especially in the era of mass politics. Jung compared mass movements to mass psychoses, comparable to demonic possession in which people uncritically channel unconscious symbolism through the social dynamic of the mob and the leader.\n\nAlthough civilization leads people to disavow their links with the mythological world of uncivilized societies, Jung argued that aspects of the primitive unconscious would nevertheless reassert themselves in the form of superstitions, everyday practices, and unquestioned traditions such as the Christmas tree.\n\nBased on empirical inquiry, Jung felt that all humans, regardless of racial and geographic differences, share the same collective pool of instincts and images, though these manifest differently due to the moulding influence of culture. However, above and in addition to the primordial collective unconscious, people within a certain culture may share additional bodies of primal collective ideas.\n\nJung called the UFO phenomenon a \"living myth\", a legend in the process of consolidation. Belief in a messianic encounter with UFOs demonstrated the point, Jung argued, that even if a rationalistic modern ideology repressed the images of the collective unconscious, its fundamental aspects would inevitably resurface. The circular shape of the flying saucer confirms its symbolic connection to repressed but psychically necessary ideas of divinity.\n\nThe universal applicability of archetypes has not escaped the attention of marketing specialists, who observe that branding can resonate with consumers through appeal to archetypes of the collective unconscious.\n\nIn a minimalist interpretation of what would then appear as \"Jung's much misunderstood idea of the collective unconscious\", his idea was \"simply that certain structures and predispositions of the unconscious are common to all of us...[on] an inherited, species-specific, genetic basis\". Thus \"one could as easily speak of the 'collective arm' – meaning the basic pattern of bones and muscles which all human arms share in common.\"\n\nOthers point out however that \"there does seem to be a basic ambiguity in Jung's various descriptions of the Collective Unconscious. Sometimes he seems to regard the predisposition to experience certain images as understandable in terms of some genetic model\" – as with the collective arm. However, Jung was \"also at pains to stress the numinous quality of these experiences, and there can be no doubt that he was attracted to the idea that the archetypes afford evidence of some communion with some divine or world mind', and perhaps 'his popularity as a thinker derives precisely from this\" – the maximal interpretation.\n\nMarie-Louise von Franz accepted that \"it is naturally very tempting to identify the hypothesis of the collective unconscious historically and regressively with the ancient idea of an all-extensive world-soul.\" New Age writer Sherry Healy goes further, claiming that Jung himself \"dared to suggest that the human mind could link to ideas and motivations called the collective unconscious...a body of unconscious energy that lives forever.\" This is the idea of monopsychism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"Digambara\" (Sanskrit) is a combination of two words: \"dig\" (directions) and \"ambara\" (sky), referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space. \"Digambara monks\" do not wear any clothes. The monks carry \"picchi\", a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers (for clearing the place before walking or sitting), \"kamandalu\" (a water container made of wood), and \"shastra\" (scripture).\nOne of the most important scholar-monks of \"Digambara\" tradition was Kundakunda. He authored Prakrit texts such as the \"Samayasāra\" and the \"Pravacanasāra\". Other prominent \"Acharyas\" of this tradition were, Virasena (author of a commentary on the \"Dhavala\"), Samantabhadra and Siddhasena Divakara. The \"Satkhandagama\" and \"Kasayapahuda\" have major significance in the \"Digambara\" tradition.\n\nRelics found from Harrapan excavations such as seals depicting \"Kayotsarga\" posture, idols in \"Padmasana\" and a nude bust of red limestone, give insight into the antiquity of the \"Digambara\" tradition. The presence of gymnosophists (naked philosophers) in Greek records as early as the fourth century BC, supports the claim of the \"Digambaras\" that they have preserved the ancient \"Śramaṇa\" practice.\n\nDundas talks about the archeological evidences which indicate that Jain monks moved from the practice of total nudity towards wearing clothes in later period. Ancient Tirthankara statues found in Mathura are naked. The oldest Tirthankara statue wearing a cloth is dated in 5th century CE. \"Digamabara\" statues of tirthankara belonging to Gupta period has half-closed eyes.\n\nAccording to \"Digambara\" texts, after liberation of the Lord Mahavira, three \"Anubaddha Kevalīs\" attained \"Kevalajñāna\" (omniscience) sequentially – Gautama \"Gaņadhara\", \"Acharya\" Sudharma, and Jambusvami in next 62 years. During the next hundred years, five \"Āchāryas\" had complete knowledge of the scriptures, as such, called \"Śruta Kevalīs\", the last of them being \"Āchārya\" Bhadrabahu. Spiritual lineage of heads of monastic orders is known as \"Pattavali\". Digambara tradition consider Dharasena to be the 33rd teacher in succession of Gautama, 683 years after the \"nirvana\" of Mahavira.\n\nThe word \"Digambara\" is a combination of two Sanskrit words: \"dik\" (दिक्) (directions) and \"ambara\" (अम्बर) (clothes), referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space. \"Digambara\" monks do not wear any clothes as it is considered to be \"parigraha\" (possession), which ultimately leads to attachment. A \"Digambara\" monk has 28 \"mūla guņas\" (primary attributes). These are: five \"mahāvratas\" (supreme vows); five \"samitis\" (regulations); \"pañcendriya nirodha\" (five-fold control of the senses); \"Ṣadāvaśyakas\" (six essential duties); and seven \"niyamas\" (rules or restrictions).\nThe monks carry \"picchi\", a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers for removing small insects without causing them injury, \"Kamandalu\" (the gourd for carrying pure, sterilized water) and \"shastra\" (scripture). The head of all monastics is called \"Āchārya\", while the saintly preceptor of saints is the \"upādhyāya\". The \"Āchārya\" has 36 primary attributes (\"mūla guņa\") in addition to the 28 mentioned above. The monks perform \"kayotsarga\" daily, in a rigid and immobile posture, with the arms held stiffly down, knees straight, and toes directed forward. Female monastics in Digambara tradition are known as \"aryikas\". Statistically, there are more Digambara nuns, than there are monks.\n\nThe \"Digambara\" Jains worship completely nude idols of \"tirthankaras\" (omniscient beings) and \"siddha\" (liberated souls). The \"tirthankara\" is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the \"Kayotsarga\" posture. \nThe \"Digambara\" sect of Jainism rejects the authority of the texts accepted by the other major sect, the \"Svetambaras\".\n\nAccording to the \"Digambaras\", \"Āchārya\" Dharasena guided two \"Āchāryas\", Pushpadanta and Bhutabali, to put the teachings of Mahavira in written form, 683 years after the \"nirvana\" of Mahavira. The two \"Āchāryas\" wrote \"Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama\" on palm leaves which is considered to be among the oldest known \"Digambara\" texts. \"Āchārya\" Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original Jain \"Agamas\". Later on, some learned \"Āchāryas\" started to restore, compile and put into written words the teachings of Lord Mahavira, that were the subject matter of \"Agamas\".\n\n\"Digambaras\" group the texts into four literary categories called \"anuyoga\" (exposition). The \"prathmanuyoga\" (first exposition) contains the universal history, the \"karananuyoga\" (calculation exposition) contains works on cosmology and the \"charananuyoga\" (behaviour exposition) includes texts about proper behaviour for monks and \"Sravakas\".\n\nMost eminent \"Digamabara\" authors include Kundakunda, Samantabhadra, Pujyapada, Jinasena, Akalanka, Vidyanandi, Somadeva and Asadhara.\n\nThe \"Digambara\" tradition can be divided into two main orders viz. \"Mula Sangha\" (original community) and modern community. \"Mula Sangha\" can be further divided into orthodox and heterodox traditions. Orthodox traditions included \"Nandi\", \"Sena\", \"Simha\" and \"Deva\" \"sangha\". Heterodox traditions included \"Dravida\", \"Yapaniya\", \"Kashtha\" and \"Mathura\" sangha. Other traditions of \"Mula sangha\" include \"Deshiya Gana\" and \"Balatkara Gana\" traditions. Modern \"Digambara\" community is divided into various sub-sects viz. \"Terapanthi\", \"Bispanthi\", \"Taranpanthi\" (or \"Samayiapanthi\"), \"Gumanapanthi\" and \"Totapanthi\".\n\nDigambara community was divided into \"Terapanthi\" and \"Bisapanthi\" on the acceptance of authority of \"Bhattaraka\". The \"Bhattarakas\" of Shravanabelagola and Mudbidri belong to \"Deshiya Gana\" and the \"Bhattaraka\" of Humbaj belongs to the \"Balatkara Gana\".\n\nThe Bispanth-Terapanth division among the Digambaras emerged in the 17th century in the Jaipur region: Sanganer, Amer and Jaipur itself.\n\nThe \"Terapanthis\" worship what the idols represent, with \"ashta-dravya\" similarly to the Bispanthis, but replace flowers and fruits with dry substitutes. The ashta-dravya \"jal\" (water), \"chandan\" (sandal), \"akshata\" (sacred rice), \"pushp\" (yellow rice), \"deep\" (yellow dry coconut), \"dhup\" (\"kapoor\" or cloves) and \"phal\" (almonds). Terapanthi is a reformist sect of \"Digambara\" Jainism that distinguished itself from the \"Bispanthi\" sect. It formed out of strong opposition to the religious domination of traditional religious leaders called \"bhattarakas\" in the 17th century. They oppose the worship of various minor gods and goddesses. Some \"Terapanthi\" practices, like not using flowers in worship, are followed by most of North Indian Jains. \"Terapanthis\" occur in large numbers in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe Terapanthi movement was born out of the \"Adhyatma\" movement that arose in 1626 AD (V.S. 1683) in Agra. Its leading proponent was Banarasidas of Agra.\n\nBesides \"tirthankaras\", \"Bispanthi\" also worship \"Yaksha\" and \"Yakshini\" like Bhairava and Kshetrapala. Their religious practices include \"aarti\" and offerings of flowers, fruits and \"prasad\". \"Bhattarakas\" are their \"dharma-gurus\" and they are concentrated in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharastra and South India. \n\nAccording to \"Digambara\" texts, after attaining \"Kevala Jnana\" (omniscience), \"arihant\" (omniscient beings) are free from human needs like hunger, thirst, and sleep. In contrast, Śvētāmbara texts preach that it is not so. According to the \"Digambara\" tradition, a soul can attain \"moksha\" (liberation) only from the male body with complete nudity being a necessity. While, Śvētāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation from female body itself and renunciation of clothes is not at all necessary.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39320626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39320626", "title": "Gold glass", "text": "Gold glass\n\nGold glass or gold sandwich glass is a luxury form of glass where a decorative design in gold leaf is fused between two layers of glass. First found in Hellenistic Greece, it is especially characteristic of the Roman glass of the Late Empire in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often cut out of the piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the catacombs of Rome as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried. About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered. Complete vessels are far rarer. Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional Greco-Roman religion and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. Others show portraits of their owners, and the finest are \"among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity\". From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in mosaics.\n\nVarious different techniques may sometimes also be described as \"gold glass\". Zwischengoldglas is very similar but the two layers of glass are cemented, not fused. It mostly comes from Germany and Bohemia from the 18th and 19th centuries. Verre églomisé properly covers a single layer of glass which is gilded (or coated with other types of metal leaf) on the back, as used in 19th century shop signs and the like. One process was revived by Jean-Baptise Glomy (1711–1786), hence the name. Both of these processes were also used in ancient times, and the German and French languages often use their native terms for what is called \"gold glass\" in English. Gold ruby glass or \"cranberry glass\" is actually red, coloured by the addition of gold oxide. Gold-band glass is another ancient technique covered below.\n\nThe manufacturing process for gold glass was difficult and required great skill. For a Late Roman glass, first a small round flat disc, typically about three to five inches across, was cut away from a blown sphere with a flattened bottom, either made of coloured or plain glass. A piece of gold leaf was then glued to this with gum arabic. The design was created by scraping away gold leaf. The main vessel, a cup or bowl, was formed by blowing and cutting, with a flat bottom the same size as the first disc. This was then heated again and carefully lowered onto the disc with the design, superimposing the flat bottom with the disc with the design so that they fused together. The complete vessel was then heated a final time to complete the fusing. Different accounts of different periods vary somewhat as to the precise sequence of stages and other details, but the process is essentially the same.\n\nThe larger Hellenistic glass bowls are thought to have been formed using moulds rather than blown, as the whole bowl is doubled and the inner and outer vessels must fit together exactly. Some of the finer later medallions seem to have been made as such from the start, and some contain pigments other than the gold. These smoother-edged medallions exploited the medium of glass as a matrix for portrait miniatures, and it has proved to be a very effective one, outlasting all alternatives except for precious metal and engraved gems. They were probably initially made to be hung for display, or set in jewellery in smaller examples like that of Gennadios, but were also used for funerary purposes, and often use a base of blue glass. They are a few Roman examples of vessels from Cologne of a different style where several of what have been called \"sidewall blobs\", small gold glass medallions about 2–3 cm across, with images, are fused into the walls of a vessel\nApart from roundels with figurative images the fused sandwich technique was used to create the tesserae for gold in mosaics, and for beads and the like. Gold glass tesserae, at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. Tesserae were made in blocks or \"cakes\" and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large in the case of gold backgrounds. Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or yellow ochre backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect. Most colours of tesserae seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones. In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of Kiev seems to have used gold tesserae made in Constantinople.\n\nRoman gold glass beads were made by using an inner tube or rod to which the gold leaf was stuck. A larger tube was slid over that and the beads crimped off. Easily transported and very attractive, Roman gold glass beads have been found as far outside the Empire as the Wari-Bateshwar ruins in Bangladesh, and sites in China, Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nGold-band glass is a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, sandwiched between colourless glass, are used as part of the marbling effect in onyx glass. It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.\n\nThe most common form of vessel in late Roman examples was a bowl or drinking cup, which are thought to have been originally family gifts for weddings, anniversaries, New Year, the various religious festivals and the like, in some cases perhaps presented at birth or Christian baptism. None of the type of gold glass vessels cut down as grave-markers has survived complete, though about 500 of the cut-off bottoms are known, but since so many have inscriptions encouraging the owner to drink, they are usually referred to as \"cups\" or \"glasses\". However Roman drinking cups and glasses were often very wide and shallow, though tall straight-sided or slightly flared shapes like modern tumblers are also found. A mosaic in the North African ruins of Dougga shows two hefty slaves pouring wine from \"amphorae\" into two shallow bowls held by slaves waiting on the banquet. The two \"amphorae\" are inscribed with \"ΠΙΕ\" and \"ΣΗϹΗϹ\" the Greek originals of the toasting formulae \"pie zeses\" (\"Drink, may you live\", discussed below) so common on Roman glasses, and it has been suggested that the mosaic shows the shape a complete cup would have had.\n\nAt what was probably a much later date, perhaps after decades of use, on the death of the owner the main vessel of undecorated glass was cut away and trimmed to leave only the gold glass roundel, which was then used in the catacombs as a grave marker. Presumably in many cases the cup had already broken in the normal course of use, and the thick bottom with the decoration had been preserved for later use in this way. Bodies were buried in the catacombs in small recesses called \"loculi\", stacked one above another mostly along narrow corridors hollowed out from the soft rock, and no doubt some form of marker was necessary for visitors to locate the right spot. They may also have functioned as a seal on the grave, as they were pressed into the mortar or stucco forming the final surface of the wall of the \"loculus\"; other classes of small decorative objects were also used in the same way. They may also have been regarded as capable of warding off evil spirits, especially in the later part of the period, when portraits of saints become most common. The very untidy trimming of many examples may be explained by this; an example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is still attached to a chunk of mortar round much of its edge, showing that the mortar overlapped the edge of the glass. Rough edges would mostly have been hidden by the mortar and also provided a firmer key for the mortar to hold the glass in place (as it happens the edges of the New York piece are unusually neatly trimmed).\n\nMany pieces of gold glass had portraits of private individuals, mostly married couples, who may have included the deceased, while others had portraits of religious figures such as saints, or religious symbols. This custom was followed by Christian, Jewish (13 identifiably Jewish examples are known) and pagan Romans. The different sets of imagery, apart from the increased number of private portraits, are typical of the paintings also found in the catacombs and other Early Christian art and its Jewish equivalent from the period. As Christian art developed in the late 4th and 5th centuries, its changes are reflected in the subjects and their treatment in gold glass, before the catacombs ceased to be used and the supply of examples ends.\n\nThe technique was used in Hellenistic times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry. The British Museum has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3 cm wide and 11.4 cm high, one of two from a tomb in Canosa in Apulia dating to around 270–160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with lotus and acanthus motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures. There are a handful of other near complete examples, and rather more fragments. These pieces are usually assigned to Alexandria in Egypt, which is often seen as the originating centre for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century satirist Martial and other sources; one seems to show a Nilotic landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere. However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on Rhodes. A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer Athenaeus) mentions two vessels that are \"diachysa\" (\"with gold in it\") and very likely made by this technique.\n\nGold glass mosaic tesserae begin to be used in domestic mosaics in the 1st century AD, with Rome apparently the first location. They continued to be used throughout the ancient and medieval periods into the modern day. By around 400 gold began to be used as the background colour for Christian religious mosaics, as it was throughout the Byzantine period.\n\nThe decorated late Roman pieces are usually assumed to have been made in and around Rome, especially in the case of portraits of residents there, but also in the Rhineland around Cologne and Augusta Treverorum, modern Trier, which was a centre for other luxury glass products like cage cups. Alexandria is still thought to have been a major centre, and from linguistic analysis of the inscriptions it has been suggested that the technique, and perhaps the actual artists and craftsmen, reached Rome and Germany from there. Yet it may just be a coincidence of survival that the other large body of \"middle-class\" portraiture from the period is the Fayum mummy portraits from Egypt. Apart from the Rhineland finds discussed below, small numbers of cut-off vessel bases have been found in northern Italy and modern Hungary and Croatia.\n\nThe Gennadios medallion in New York, illustrated above, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local dialect features. He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition. One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an Early Medieval crux gemmata in Brescia, in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and Gothic queen Galla Placida (died 450) and her children; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of Isis. The portrait in the Brescia medallion also shares clear stylistic features with the Fayum mummy portraits of Roman Egypt, in addition to a Greek inscription in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality. Yet Jás Elsner (2007) contends that the Brescia medallion, likely depicting a family from Alexandria since the inscription is in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek, has a range of possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century Christian cross.\n\nIt is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using lenses. Where the refined \"Alexandrian\" medallions, wherever they were actually produced, mostly have a simple thin gold line framing the subject, the Roman examples have a variety of heavier frames, often using two round borders, the style of which forms part of efforts to group them by workshop. The level of portraiture is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles. \nAn \"Alexander plate with hunting scene\" in the Cleveland Museum of Art is, if genuine, a very rare example of a complete vessel decorated with gold glass, and comes from the upper elite of Roman society. It is a shallow bowl or plate 25.7 cm (10 1/8 inches) in diameter and 4.5 cm (1 3/4 inches) high. The decorated flat roundel in the centre takes about two thirds of the whole diameter. It shows a mounted huntsman with a spear pursuing two elk, while beneath his horse a huntsman on foot with a hound on a leash confronts a wild boar. The Latin inscription \"\" means \"Alexander fortunate man, drink, may you live, together with yours\". The identity of \"Alexander\" has been the subject of discussion, but he is on the whole though to be an unknown aristocrat rather than Alexander the Great or the Emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 232–235). The dish is perhaps slightly later than his reign and at least during his reign he could never be addressed as merely a \"man\". The Greek drinking toast ZHCAIC given in Latin letters as ZESES, meaning \"live!\" or \"may you live\", is a very common part of inscriptions on gold glass, and sometimes the only inscription. It is more common than the Latin equivalent VIVAS, probably because it was considered more refined, somewhat like the modern \"bon appétit\" used in English. Two glasses including images of Jesus \"misspell\" \"ZESES\" as \"ZESUS\", managing to achieve wordplay between a drinking toast and the name of the Christian saviour. \nSuch secular \"blessings\" are typical, and on roundels made from cups they often urge the owner to drink, even when the iconography is religious. One Jewish example has the usual array of symbols and the inscription \"Drink, [so] you may live, Elares\". The Wedding at Cana is a popular Christian subject, with one example inscribed \"Worthy of your friends, may you live in the peace of God, drink\". Another popular phrase is DIGNITAS AMICORUM or \"[you are] the honour of your friends\". The majority of inscriptions are made up of either names or such conventional expressions, or the two combined. An example inscribed \"DIGNITAS AMICORVM PIE ZESES VIVAS\" typifies the tendency to pile together the common phrases. The convivial dedications found on so many examples are paralleled by several of the far more luxurious cage cups or \"diatreta\".\n\nOne round bottom from a larger bowl found in the catacombs is 10.8 cm across, and now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It has five abbreviated scenes from the Old and New Testaments surrounding a married couple in a roundel, with the feet of the outer figures to the centre. A large and complex bowl from Cologne was decorated all over with Christian scenes and Imperial portraits, but presumably because of its size (height 8.6, diameter 11.4 cm) no second layer of glass was fused on, so the gold has now all been lost, though the shapes of the design can be seen. The portraits of the sons of Constantine I allow an unusually precise probable dating to 326, his \"vicennalia\", or the 25th anniversary of his reign. Another complete piece is a paten from the Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne, founded in the 4th century. This is decorated with roundels containing Old Testament scenes and floral motifs. According to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Pope Zephyrinus, in office from 199–217, had approved the use of glass patens, and ones in other glass techniques survive. A variant technique is only known from vessels from Cologne with what have been called \"sidewall blobs\", where small gold glass medallions with images are fused into the walls of a vessel; one of the few examples was found in the cemetery of St Severin.\n\nAlmost all the Roman vessel bottoms have imagery of some sort, and around 240 have legible inscriptions as well. Of these, about half of the total number of gold glasses known, portraits are most common, but there are small narrative scenes, mainly Christian but a few pagan. Portraits of Christian sacred figures are on about half the full corpus. There are a small number of depictions of sports, animals, wreaths and the like, and a single example with a central image of a plant. No Imperial portraits are recorded, nor military scenes; unlike so much Roman public art the glasses concentrate on the private interests of individuals. Apart from a single near-naked Venus and some figures of erotes, sexual themes are another notable absence compared to much Roman art. Most glasses feature a single image occupying most of the round space within the border, but some have a number of small scenes, usually arranged in small circular frames around a central image. Most portraits are between bust and half-length. The small number of glasses with Jewish iconography are covered separately below.\n\nEither portraits or inscriptions naming private individuals are very common, though other examples have no personalizing aspect and were perhaps just bought from a dealer's stock. Portraits of married couples are at first most the common, but saints were more numerous towards the end of the period; the two are also often combined. It is not always possible to distinguish the two confidently, despite \"tituli\" inscriptions and a convention of using contemporary dress for owners and a conventional out of date costume for sacred figures, even recent male ones such as Pope Damasus I (r. 366–384). Damasus, exceptionally for a contemporary cleric, appears on at least four glasses, or at least it is thought he is who \"DAMAS\" refers to.\n\nSaints Peter and Paul together are very common, usually facing each other in profile, but sometimes with other figures. Both were martyred in Rome, and especially popular there; other local martyrs such as Agnes are depicted several times, and according to Lucy Grig \"the \"Roman-ness\" of the saints portrayed on the Roman glasses is striking\", and five popes from the 3rd and 4th centuries are probably depicted. Christ is shown in a number of examples, usually as clean-shaven and youthful, as well as figures such as the Good Shepherd which may symbolize him, or in some cases Orpheus or general bucolic imagery. A small Christ may stand between the heads of a married couple, blessing them. Orants perhaps representing the soul of an owner when not identified as a saint, and as in the catacombs always shown as female, appear a number of times, and female saints and the Virgin are always shown in the orant pose.\nNarrative scenes from the Old Testament are more common than miracles of Christ, as in the catacomb paintings, and the same \"abbreviated representations\" of scenes of deliverance feature: the story of Jonah, Daniel in the lions' den, the three youths in the Fiery Furnace. The most common scenes in later Christian art, centred around the liturgical calendar, are very rare. There are really only two non-Christian narrative scenes: one labour of Hercules (two more are shown in \"sidewall blobs\"), and one of Achilles, but a number of \"portrait\" figures, as with Christian sacred figures often combined with owners.\n\nThere are a small number of \"agonistic\" or sporting scenes, with wrestlers, boxers, one gladiator, and several racing chariot teams. Several of these, like others seeming to represent victory in a musical or dramatic context, feature palms and crowns and may well have been presented to celebrate victory in these fields in some amateur or professional setting, like the Alexandrian Gennadios portrait. Two identical glasses featuring two boxers with a trainer, all named, suggest that the glasses may sometimes have been ordered in sets; one may speculate that this may have been common. Single examples show Athena presiding over shipbuilders, a pair of personifications of Rome and Constantinople, and female figures representing the \"monetae\" or mints, which are often shown on coins. A number have animals that may carry symbolic meaning, or objects such as scrolls or wreaths.\n\nThe short inscriptions tend to be similar regardless of the content of the image, with names and the \"convivial formulae\" described above together or separately predominating. A religious implication (as may be intended in \"vivas\" or \"zeses\" for example) is relatively rarely explicitly stated. The names are in the single \"cognomen\" form which is hard to relate to such records as survive, but three glasses can possibly be related to known individuals who were potential owners, and one to a family (that of the poet Ausonius). These persons are rather grand, and one might think belonged to the classes buried in sarcophagi rather than \"loculi\"; the glasses perhaps belonged to \"amici\", clients or dependents, or had passed as gifts or legacies by the subjects. One glass in the British Museum is unusual in a number of respects: between a named couple is a smaller figure of Hercules, and the inscription: \"ORFITVS ET CONSTANTIA IN NOMINE HERCVLlS ACERENTINO FELICES BIBATIS\" or \"Orfitus and Constantia, may you live/drink in happiness in the name of Hercules of Acerentia\". This may well represent Memmius Vitruvius Orfitus, prefect of Rome, and his wife. Acerentia in southern Italy had a local cult of Hercules. For some historians Orfitus was \"notorious as the propaganda mastermind of the 'pagan revival'\" of his day.\n\nOnly 13 of the more than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to represent \"the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity\". They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact find spot and context of the great majority is unrecorded. Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography, and show that \"some Jews felt no qualm in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs\".\n\nIdentifiably Jewish roundels do not feature portraits but with one exception have a fairly standard array of religious symbols. The most common arrangement is on two levels, with two Lions of Judah flanking a Torah ark above, and below two menarot, a shofar (rams horn), etrog, lulav and perhaps others of the four Species, scrolls and vases. Not all the tiny symbols can be confidently identified. Alternatively, the objects are all in the top tier, above a banqueting scene. The single exception to such compositions has what is thought to be a representation of the Temple of Jerusalem, perhaps representing the feat of Purim.\n\nMost scholars are confident that Jewish customers used the same workshops as those of the other religions, who presumably kept patterns for designs for all religions, or were provided with sketches. Some of the attempts to group glasses by workshop attribute Jewish glasses and those of other religions to the same workshop. Apart from the use of symbols rather than human figures, the Jewish glasses seem to have been used in very much the same way as those from other religious groups, which is also characteristic of other classes of Jewish artefacts from Rome at this time, where the Jewish community adopted many aspects of the general Roman way of life. Of the 13 known, five have inscriptions including the phrase \"\"pie zeses\" (see above) and two \"anima dulcis\"\" (literally \"sweet soul\", equating to \"sweetheart\"), both very common phrases in Christian and pagan inscriptions. The rarer phrase \"vivas cum ...\" (\"live with ...\") is also found on Jewish and non-Jewish glasses. They would seem to have been given as gifts on the same sort of occasions, and there is evidence that Roman Jews shared the general Roman custom of New Year present-giving.\n\nThe technique continued to be used for mosaic tesserae, and at times for pieces that remained relatively large, for example in a small tile in New York with a pattern forming a cross, perhaps from a Syrian church of the 9th to 12th centuries. A small group of Islamic vessels are decorated with mostly simplified vegetal motifs and probably date to the 10th century from Syria; the most complete ones are decorated over a large curved area and must have been made by using a \"double vessel\" method. In both respects these are closer to the Hellenistic vessels than most Roman ones.\n\nFrom at least the 17th century the Roman glasses attracted antiquarian interest and they began to be removed from the catacombs, in a largely disorganized and unrecorded fashion; now only a \"handful\" remain in their original position in the catacomb walls. The first significant publication on them was by Filippo Buonarroti in 1716, \"Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma\" (\"Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome\"), in which he made the extraordinary, almost proto-Romantic assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for primitive art. After other studies, the Italian Jesuit Raffaele Garrucci published the first illustrated survey in 1858, with an expanded second edition in 1864. In the 19th century a number of imitations, copies and downright forgeries of Roman pieces were made, mostly in Murano off Venice, by firms such as Salviati. The first major public exhibition of these seems to have been at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, by Italian firms.\n\nA number of museums around the world have examples of Roman vessel bottoms. The largest collection is in the Vatican Museums, with the 60 pieces of Late Antique glass in the British Museum the second largest. A research project on their collection was due to finish in 2010 (see further reading below). The Wilshere Collection in the Ashmolean is the third largest, with some 34 pieces. The Corning Museum of Glass has 18 examples and the Metropolitan Museum in New York nearly as many. The most recent of many catalogues since the 18th century are by C.R. Morey in 1959, with 460 Roman vessel bases, against 426 in S. Smith's thesis of 2000. The corpus continues to be expanded by occasional new finds.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2359514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2359514", "title": "History of the Bahá'í Faith", "text": "History of the Bahá'í Faith\n\nBahá'í history is often traced through a sequence of leaders, beginning with the Báb's declaration in Shiraz on the evening of May 22, 1844, and ultimately resting on an Administrative Order established by the central figures of the religion. The religion had its background in two earlier movements in the nineteenth century, Shaykhism and Bábism. Shaykhism centred on theosophical doctrines and many Shaykhis expected the return of the hidden Twelfth Imam. Many Shaykhis joined the messianic Bábí movement in the 1840s where the Báb proclaimed himself to be the return of the hidden Imam. As the Bábí movement spread in Iran, violence broke out between the ruling Shi'a Muslim government and the Bábís, and ebbed when government troops massacred them, and executed the Báb in 1850.\n\nThe Báb had spoken of another messianic figure, He whom God shall make manifest. As one of the followers of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned during a subsequent wave of massacre by the Persian government against Bábís in 1852, was exiled to Iraq, and then to Constantinople and Adrianople in the Ottoman Empire. Amidst these banishments, in 1863 in Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh claimed to be the messianic figure expected by the Báb's writings. Bahá'ís consider the Baha'i religion to start from Bahá'u'lláh's statements in 1863.\n\nAt the time of Bahá'u'lláh's death the tradition was mostly confined to the Persian and Ottoman empires, at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa. Leadership of the religion then passed on to `Abdu'l-Bahá, Bahá'u'lláh's son, who was appointed by Bahá'u'lláh, and was accepted by almost all Bahá'ís. Under the leadership of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution.\n\nAfter the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community was passed on to his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, who was appointed in `Abdu'l-Bahá's will. The document appointed Shoghi Effendi as the first Guardian, and called for the election of the Universal House of Justice once the Bahá'í Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful. During Shoghi Effendi's time as leader of the religion there was a great increase in the number of Baha'is, and he presided over the election of many National Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nShoghi Effendi died in 1957, and because he was childless he had found it impossible to appoint another Guardian after himself to succeed him. In 1963 the Universal House of Justice was elected. Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion. See Bahá'í Faith by country for further information per country.\n\nIn Islam, the Mahdi is a messianic figure who is believed to be a descendant of Muhammad who will return near the end of time to restore the world and the religion of God. While both Sunni and Shi'a groups believe in the Mahdi, the largest Shi'a group, the Twelvers, believe that the Mahdi is the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed to have gone into occultation since 874 CE.\n\nIn the Twelver view the Twelfth Imam first went into a \"\"Minor Occultation\" between 874 and 941 CE where the Hidden Imam still communicated with the community through four official intermediaries. The \"Greater Occultation\"\" is then defined from the time when the Hidden Imam ceased to communicate regularly until the time when he returns to restore the world.\n\nThe Shaykhi movement was a school of theology within Twelver Shi'a Islam that was started through the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá'í. Shaykh Ahmad's teachings included that the Imams were spiritual beings and thus, in contrast to the widespread Shi'a belief, that the Imams existed within spiritual bodies, and not material bodies. He also taught that there must always exist the \"Perfect Shi'a\" who serves as an intermediary between the Imams and the believers, and is the one who can visualize the consciousness of the Hidden Imam.\n\nIn 1822 he left Iran and went to Iraq due to the controversy that his teachings had brought. There he also found himself at the centre of debate, thus deciding to move to Mecca, he died in 1826 on his way there.\n\nBefore the death of Shaykh Ahmad, he appointed Siyyid Kázim of Rasht to lead the Shaykhí movement, which he did until his death in 1843. Siyyid Kázim formulated many of the thoughts that were ambiguously expressed by Shaykh Ahmad including the doctrine of salvation history and the cycles of revelation. His teaching brought a sense of millenarian hope among the Shaykhis that the Hidden Imam may return. Siyyid Kazim did not leave a successor, but before his death in December, 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi, who according to his prophecies would soon appear.\n\nSiyyid `Alí-Muhammad, who later took on the title the Báb, was born on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz to a merchant of the city; his father died while he was quite young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí, who was also a merchant.\n\nIn May 1844 the Báb proclaimed to Mulla Husayn, one of the Shaykhis, to be the one whose coming was prophesied by Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid Kázim and the bearer of divine knowledge. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Siyyid Káẓim had recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later to be known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq. The Báb initially attracted most of the followers of the Shaykhí movement, but soon his teachings went far beyond those roots and attracted prominent followers across Iran. His followers were known as Bábís.\n\nThe first accounts in the West of events related to the history of the Báb and his followers appears January 8, 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports not published in the newspapers. This was an account of the first Letter of the Living to be dispatched from the presence of the Báb - the second Letter of the Living and first Babi martyr, Mullá `Alí-i-Bastámí. The British diplomat who recorded these events was Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, then Ambassador to Istanbul, and it included an enclosure from the Governor of Kirmánsháh protesting the arrest in Ottoman lands of a Persian mullá. Followup exchanges continued from January into April where diplomatic records of events end. Ottoman state archives affirm his arrival in Istanbul where he is then sentenced to serve in the naval ship yards at hard labor - the Ottoman ruler refusing to banishment him as it would be \"difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas.\" The first public account was published Nov 1, 1845 in the \"London Times\". It was centered on events in Shiraz when the last Letter of the Living, Quddús returned after traveling with the Báb. The story was also carried from Nov 15 by the Literary Gazette which was subsequently echoed widely in other countries.\n\nAfter some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. After being house arrest in Shiraz from June 1845 to September 1846, the Báb spent several months in Isfahan debating clergy, many who became sympathetic. He was then ordered by the Shah to Tehran in January 1847; after spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, where he was confined.\n\nHe was then transferred to the fortress of Máh-Kú in the province of Azarbaijan close to the Turkish border. During his incarceration there, the Báb began his most important work, the Persian Bayán, which he never finished. He was then transferred to the fortress of Chihríq in April 1848. In that place as well, the Báb's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. Hence the Prime Minister ordered the Báb back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the Báb on trial for blasphemy and apostasy. Bábism was also spreading across the country, and the Islamic government saw it as a threat to state religion and several military confrontations took place between government and Bábí forces. Communities of Bábís established themselves in Iran and Iráq, and in 1850 reached several cities of Azarbaijan. Coverage in newspapers in the West reoccurred in 1849 including in the French journal \"Revue de l'Orient\". In the fall of 1850 newspaper coverage fell behind quickly unfolding events. Though the Báb was named for the first time he had in fact already been executed.\n\nIn mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, ordered the execution of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from Chihríq, so that he could be shot by a firing squad. On the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch. The Báb and a companion were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot. After the order was given to shoot and the smoke cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. The soldiers subsequently found the Báb in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed. He was tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.\n\nThe remains, however, were rescued by a handful of Bábis and were hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported by way of Isfahan, Kirmansháh, Baghdad and Damascus, to Beirut and thence by sea to Acre, Israel on the plain below Mount Carmel in 1899. In 1909, the remains were then interred in a special tomb, erected for this purpose by `Abdu'l-Bahá, on Mount Carmel in the Bahá'í Holy Land in Haifa, Israel and remains an important place of pilgrimage for Bahá'ís. The Bahá'í Shrine in Haifa, Israel, is a protected site.\n\nWhile the Báb claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation. A constant theme in his works, especially the Persian Bayan was that of the great Promised One, the next embodiment of the Primal Will, whom the Báb termed He whom God shall make manifest, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth. In the books written by the Báb he constantly entreats his believers to follow He whom God shall make manifest when he arrives.\n\nBefore his death, the Báb had been in correspondence with two brothers, Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal who, after the death of many prominent disciples, emerged as the mostly likely leaders. In a letter sent to Subh-i-Azal, then aged around nineteen, the Báb appears to have indicated a high station or leadership position. The letter also orders Subh-i-Azal to obey the Promised One when he appears; in practise, Subh-i-Azal, however, seems to have had little widespread legitimacy and authority. Bahá'u'lláh in the meantime, while in private hinted at his own high station, in public kept his messianic secret from most and supported Subh-i-Azal in the interest of unity. In 1863 in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as \"He whom God shall make manifest\" and his followers began calling themselves Bahá'ís.\n\nBahá'u'lláh was born on November 12, 1817, in Tehran. Bahá'u'lláh's father was entitled Mírzá Buzurg while he served as vizier to Imám-Virdi Mírzá, the twelfth son of Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar. Mírzá Buzurg was later appointed governor of Burujird and Lorestan, a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when Muhammad Shah came to power. After his father died, Bahá'u'lláh was asked to take a government post by the new vizier Haji Mirza Aqasi, but he declined the position.\n\nAt the age of 28, Bahá'u'lláh received a messenger, Mullá Husayn, telling him of the Báb, whose message he accepted, becoming a Bábí. Bahá'u'lláh began to spread the new cause, especially in his native province of Núr, becoming recognized as one of its most influential believers. The accompanying government suppression of the Báb's religion resulted in Bahá'u'lláh's being imprisoned twice and enduring bastinado torture once Bahá'u'lláh also attended the Conference of Badasht, where 81 prominent Babis met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Babis who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispenation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out.\n\nIn 1852, two years after the execution of the Báb, the Bábís were polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against the Shah, Nasser-al-Din Shah while the other, under the leadership of Baha’u’llah, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Babí cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living. The militant group of Babis was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total Babi population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a \"Husayn Jan\", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group.\n\nBahá'u'lláh met briefly with a couple of the radical Babi leaders and learned of an assassination plan. He condemned the plan, but was soon asked to leave Tehran by the authorities. In the vacuum of leadership on August 15, 1852 about 3 Babis attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed. Amidst the general violence some Bábís were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál (Black Pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran. According to Bahá'u'lláh, perhaps the lone survivor, it was during his imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a Maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a Messenger of God and as the One whose coming the Báb had prophesied.\nThe government later found Bahá'u'lláh innocent of complicity in the assassination plot, and he was released from the Síyáh-Chál, but the government exiled him from Iran. Bahá'u'lláh chose to go to Iraq in the Ottoman Empire and arrived in Baghdad in early 1853. A small number of Babis, including his half-brother Subh-i-Azal, followed Bahá'u'lláh to Baghdad. An increasing number of Bábís considered Baghdad the new centre for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of pilgrims started coming there from Persia. In Baghdad people began to look to Subh-i-Azal for leadership less and less due to his policy of remaining hidden, and instead saw Bahá'u'lláh as their leader. Subh-i-Azal started to try to discredit Bahá'u'lláh and further divided the community. The actions of Subh-i-Azal drove many people away from the religion and allowed its enemies to continue their persecution.\n\nOn April 10, 1854 Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad in order to distance himself from Subh-i-Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community; he left with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, north-east of Baghdad, near the city Sulaymaniyah. For two years Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan living the life of a Sufi dervish. At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. During his time in Kurdistan he wrote many notable books including the Four Valleys. In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Subh-i-Azal, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, thus searched for Bahá'u'lláh, and pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad, which he did in 1856.\n\nBahá'u'lláh remained in Baghdád for seven more years. During this time, while keeping his perceived station as the Manifestation of God hidden, he taught the Báb's teachings. He published many books and verses including the Book of Certitude and the Hidden Words. Bahá'u'lláh's gatherings attracted many notables, both locals and Iranian pilgrims, giving him greater influence in Baghdad and in Iran. His rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. They were eventually successful in having the Ottoman government call Bahá'u'lláh from Baghdad to Constantinople.\n\nBefore he left Baghdad on the way to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh camped for twelve days in the Garden of Ridván near Baghdad starting on April 22, 1863. During his stay in the garden a large number of friends came to see him before he left. It was during his time in the Garden of Ridván that Bahá'u'lláh declared to his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God. Today Bahá'ís celebrate the twelve days that Bahá'u'lláh was in the Garden of Ridván as the festival of Ridván.\n\nAfter travelling for four-month over land, Bahá'u'lláh arrived in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (now Istanbul). Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from Baghdad was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually the penal colony of Akká, Ottomon Empire's Palestine (now Acre, Israel). Bahá'u'lláh and his family, along with a small group of Bábís, stayed in Constantinople for only four months. Due to his refusal to build alliances with the Ottoman politicians, Bahá'u'lláh had no means of resisting pressure from the Iranian ambassador to exile him further away, and Sultan Abdülâziz banished Bahá'u'lláh to Adrianople (current-day Edirne), which was a site for the exile of political prisoners.\nDuring the month of December 1863, Bahá'u'lláh and his family embarked on a twelve-day journey to Adrianople. Bahá'u'lláh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years. In Adrianople Bahá'u'lláh made his claim to be Him whom God shall make manifest more public through letters and tablets. Bahá'u'lláh's assertion as an independent Manifestation of God made Subh-i-Azal's leadership position irrelevant; Subh-i-Azal, upon hearing Bahá'u'lláh's words in a tablet read to him, challenging him to accept Bahá'u'lláh's revelation, refused and challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of divine will at a local mosque, but he lost face when he did not appear. This caused a break within the Bábí community, and the followers of Bahá'u'lláh became known as Bahá'ís, while the followers of Subh-i-Azal became known as Azalis.\n\nStarting in 1866, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh started writing a series of letters to world rulers, proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions. His letters also asked them to renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Some of these leaders written to in the coming years include Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III of France, Czar Alexander II of Russia, Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland, Násiri’d-Dín Sháh of the Persian Empire and the rulers of America.\nThe disagreements between the Bahá'ís and the Azalís allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bahá'u'lláh once again. Bahá'u'lláh and his family left Adrianople on August 12, 1868 and after a journey by land and sea arrived in Acre on August 31. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions on, and held very trying times for, Bahá'u'lláh. Mirzá Mihdí, Bahá'u'lláh's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bahá'u'lláh, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after Sultan `Abdu'l-`Aziz's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places.\n\nFrom 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.\n\nThe final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life were spent in the Mansion of Bahjí, just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in Acre and Bahjí, Bahá'u'lláh produced many volumes of work including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. On May 9, 1892 Bahá'u'lláh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on May 29, 1892. He was buried in a Shrine located next to the Mansion of Bahjí in Israel. During his lifetime, communities of Bahá'ís were established in Armenia, Burma, Egypt, Georgia, India, Lebanon, (what is now) Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.\n\nBahá'u'lláh was succeeded by his eldest son, `Abdu'l-Bahá. Designated as the \"Center of the Covenant\" and Head of the Faith, Bahá'u'lláh designated him in his will as the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings. \n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment. This imprisonment continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the \"Young Turk\" revolution in 1908. The remains of the Báb were buried on March 21, 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone.\n\nFollowing his release he led a life of travelling and speaking especially 1910–1913, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith. `Abdu'l-Bahá died in Haifa on November 28, 1921 and is now buried in one of the front rooms in the Shrine of the Báb, in Haifa, Israel. During his lifetime communities of Bahá'ís formed in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United States of America.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament is the charter of the Bahá'í administrative order. In this document `Abdu'l-Bahá established the institutions of the appointed Guardianship and the elected Universal House of Justice. In that same document he appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nShoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated the sacred writings of the Faith; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the Bahá'í World Centre; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the Faith, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.\nWith the unexpected passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the faith was left without a clear candidate for Guardian. The Hands of the Cause, appointed by Shoghi Effendi, took the necessary administrative roles at the Bahá'í World Centre, and organized the election of the Universal House of Justice, from which they excluded themselves from membership. By the time of the election of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá'í communities had been established in many of the countries of the world. Seventy nations had organized their communities to elect National Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nAfter the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, it then ruled that given the unique situation and the provisions of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá, it was not possible to appoint another Guardian. The Universal House of Justice today remains the supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its nine members are elected every five years. As recently as 2001 the number of countries with organized communities electing National Spiritual Assemblies was 182.\n"}

{"id": "10060892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10060892", "title": "Interfaith marriage in Judaism", "text": "Interfaith marriage in Judaism\n\nInterfaith marriage in Judaism (also called mixed marriage or intermarriage) was historically looked upon with very strong disfavour by Jewish leaders, and it remains a controversial issue among them today. In the Talmud and all of resulting Jewish law until the advent of new Jewish movements following the Jewish Enlightenment, the \"Haskala\", interfaith marriage is completely prohibited, although the definition of \"interfaith\" is not so simply expressed.\n\nA 2013 survey conducted in the United States by the Pew Research Center’s Religion & Public Life Project found the intermarriage rate to be 58% among all Jews and 71% among non-Orthodox Jews.\n\nThe Biblical position on exogamous marriage is somewhat ambiguous; that is, except in relation to intermarriage with a Canaanite, which the majority of the Israelite patriarchs are depicted as criticising. This attitude is formalised in the Deuteronomic Code, which forbids intermarriage with Canaanites, on the basis that it might lead to a son, resulting from the union, being brought up to follow the Canaanite religion. The principle is essentially a general one, and the deuteronomic explanation doesn't clarify why it singles out the Canaanites in particular; one of the Talmudic writers took it to forbid all intermarriage with non-Jewish nations. In Numbers 25, Phineas is praised by God for having punished an Israelite prince who (during an idolatrous feast) publicly cohabited with a Midianite woman (descendant of Abraham by his third wife and not called a Canaanite); this took place at a time when Moses himself had married a Midianite (Zipporah) (before he married a Cushite) and foreign (Moabite) women were inducing the Jews to perform idolatry. (Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, not Canaanite.)\n\nIn several places in the Tanakh, there are relations which obviously were intermarriages – for examples, King David is described as marrying the daughter of the king of Geshur, and Bathsheba as having married Uriah the Hittite. King Solomon is notable for having taken many foreign wives and serving their idolatries. Deuteronomy itself implies that intermarriage to Edomites or Egyptians was acceptable, by permitting the grandchildren of such people to be treated as Israelites. Traditional commentators generally explain such verses as referring to situations where the Gentile partner had converted, and explicitly so in the latter case, where \"grandchildren\" are understood as being the grandchildren of converts. In places, traditional commentators suggest that the person involved is not a Gentile, but a Jew who has lived in a Gentile country, or that the law of the captive woman is involved.\n\nIn any case, after the Babylonian Captivity disquiet seems to have arisen about such exogamy; the Book of Malachi declares that the intermarriage with \"the daughter of a foreign god\" (something different from marrying a non-Jewish person) that had occurred was a profanity, though Malachi also argues against divorce. Some Jewish leaders made a formal complaint to Ezra about these marriages. Ezra definitively extended the law against intermarriage to forbid marriage between a Jew and any non-Jew; he also excommunicated those people who refused to divorce their foreign spouses.\n\nChristine Hayes compares the Deuteronomic and Ezran viewpoints on intermarriage, and discusses in terms of ritual impurity and the fear of profaning the seed of Israel. First and foremost, Hayes holds that the fear of profaning the seed of Israel was the underlying rationale for the ban in exogamous marriage, rather than the ritual impurity of Gentiles in general. She also argues that the regulations on intermarriage in the times of Ezra were different from the restrictions on intermarriage according to the book of Deuteronomy. For example, the Ezra ban on intermarriage was different in that it was 1) Universal in scope, and 2) had the rationale that intermarriage was the profanation of the holy seed of Israel. She elaborates on these differences by saying that the prohibition at the time the Torah was written was not based on the ritual impurity of all Gentiles; rather, only the Gentiles of the seven Canaanite nations that were specified were to be avoided. This was \"based on the fear that intimate contact with the Canaanites will lead Israelites to imitate their idolatrous and immoral ways.\" Thus, Hayes contrasts the restrictions on intermarriage at the time the Torah was written with the time of Ezra by pointing out that the Torah did not prohibit intermarriage between all Gentiles, only those in the seven nations specified. Furthermore, the intent of the Ezra ban was different in that it was based on the preservation of a holy seed, as opposed to the idea in the Torah that contact with the Canaanites would lead to the Israelites imitating their idolatrous and immoral ways.\n\nAlthough most of the rabbis in the Talmud considered the Deuteronomic law to refer only to marriage to Canaanites, they considered all religious intermarriage to be prohibited at least rabbinically.\n\nChristian rulers regarded unions between Jews and Christians unfavourably, and repeatedly prohibited them under penalty of death.\n\nGradually, however, many countries removed these restrictions, and marriage between Jews and Christians (and Muslims) began to occur. In 1236 Moses of Coucy induced the Jews bespoused by such marriages to dissolve them. In 1807, Napoleon's Grand Sanhedrin declared that such marriages were valid and should not be treated as anathema. In 1844, the 1807 ruling was extended by the Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick to include \"any adherent of a monotheistic religion\"; but they also altered it to forbid marriages involving those who lived in states that would prevent children of the marriage from being raised Jewish. This conference was highly controversial; one of its resolutions called on its members to abolish the Kol Nidre prayer, which opens the Yom Kippur service. One member of the Brunswick Conference later changed his opinion, becoming an opponent of intermarriage.\n\nTraditional Judaism does not consider marriage between a Jew by birth and a convert as an intermarriage. Hence, all the Biblical passages that appear to support intermarriages, such as that of Joseph to Asenath, and that of Ruth to Boaz, were regarded by the classical rabbis as having occurred only after the foreign spouse had converted to Judaism. Some opinions, however, still considered Canaanites forbidden to marry even after conversion; this did not necessarily apply to their children. The Shulchan Aruch and its commentaries bring various opinions as to when intermarriage is a Torah prohibition and when the prohibition is rabbinic.\n\nA foundling – a person who was abandoned as a child without their parents being identified – was classified as a non-Jew, in relation to intermarriage, if they had been found in an area where at least one non-Jew lived (even if there were hundreds of Jews in the area, and just one non-Jew); this drastically contrasts with the treatment by other areas of Jewish religion, in which a foundling was classified as Jewish if the majority of the people were Jewish, in the area in which the foundling was found. If the mother was known, but not the father, the child was treated as a foundling, unless the mother claimed that the child was an Israelite (the claim would be given the benefit of the doubt).\n\nThe Talmud and later classical sources of Jewish law are clear that the institution of Jewish marriage, \"kiddushin\", can only be affected between Jews.\n\nThe more liberal Jewish movements—including Reform, Reconstructionist (collectively organized in the World Union for Progressive Judaism)—do not generally regard the historic corpus and process of Jewish law as intrinsically binding. Progressive rabbinical associations have no firm prohibition against intermarriage; according to a survey of rabbis, conducted in 1985, more than 87% of Reconstructionist rabbis were willing to officiate at interfaith marriages, and in 2003 at least 50% of Reform rabbis were willing to perform interfaith marriages. The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Reform rabbinical association in North America and the largest Progressive rabbinical association, consistently opposed intermarriage at least until the 1980s, including their members officiating at them, through resolutions and responsa. Today, however, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, according to Jack Wertheimer, seem not at all concerned about intermarriage and have nothing to say in public about it. Neither are non-Jewish spouses usually encouraged to convert to Judaism anymore. Regardless of their attitude to intermarriage itself, most rabbis from these denominations do still try to persuade intermarried couples to raise their children as Jews. In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.\n\nHumanistic Judaism is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life, and defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people. The Society for Humanistic Judaism answers the question \"Is intermarriage contributing to the demise of Judaism?\" on its website, stating, \"Intermarriage is the positive consequence of a free and open society. If the Jewish community is open, welcoming, embracing, and pluralistic, we will encourage more people to identify with the Jewish people rather than fewer. Intermarriage could contribute to the continuity of the Jewish people.\"\n\nAll branches of Orthodox Judaism follow the historic Jewish attitudes to intermarriage, and therefore refuse to accept that intermarriages would have any validity or legitimacy, and strictly forbid sexual intercourse with a member of a different faith. Orthodox rabbis refuse to officiate at interfaith weddings, and also try to avoid assisting them in other ways. Secular intermarriage is seen as a deliberate rejection of Judaism, and an intermarried person is effectively cut off from most of the Orthodox community, although some Chabad-Lubavitch and Modern Orthodox Jews do reach out to intermarried Jewish couples.\n\nThe Conservative Movement in Judaism does not sanction or recognize the Jewish legal validity of intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to the spouse's conversion to Judaism. The Rabbinical Assembly Standards of Rabbinic Practice prohibit Conservative rabbis from officiating at intermarriages. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism recently published the following statement on intermarriage:\n\nDifferent movements in Judaism have different views on who is a Jew, and thus on what constitutes an \"interfaith\" marriage. Unlike Reform Judaism, the Orthodox and Conservative streams do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was not performed according to classical Jewish law.\n\nOccasionally, a Jew marries a non-Jew who believes in God as understood by Judaism, and who rejects non-Jewish theologies; Jews sometimes call such people \"ethical monotheists\". Steven Greenberg, an Orthodox Rabbi, has made the controversial proposal that, in these cases, the non-Jewish partner be considered a \"resident alien\" – the biblical description of someone who is not Jewish, but who lives within the Jewish community; according to Jewish tradition, such \"resident aliens\" share many of the same responsibilities and privileges as the Jewish community in which they reside.\n\nIn the early 19th century, in some less modernised regions of the world, exogamy was extremely rare—less than 0.1% of the Jews of Algeria, for example, practiced exogamy. In the early 20th century, even in most Germanic regions of central Europe there were still only a mere 5% of Jews marrying non-Jews. However, the picture was quite different in other locations; the figure was 18% for Berlin, and during the same period, nearly half of all Jews in Australia intermarried.\n\nIn more recent times, rates of intermarriage have increased generally; for example, the US National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01 reports that, in the United States of America between 1996 and 2001, nearly half (47%) of Jews who had married during that time period had married non-Jewish partners. The 1990 National Jewish Population Survey reported an intermarriage rate of 52 percent among American Jews. The possibility that this might lead to the gradual dying out of Judaism is regarded by most Jewish leaders, regardless of denomination, as precipitating a crisis. For this reason, as early as the mid 19th century, some senior Jewish leaders denounced intermarriage as a danger to the continued existence of Judaism.\n\nIn the United States of America, other causes, such as more people marrying later in life, have combined with intermarriage to cause the Jewish community to decrease dramatically; for every 20 adult Jews, there are now only 17 Jewish children. Some religious conservatives now even speak metaphorically of intermarriage as a \"silent holocaust\". On the other hand, more tolerant and liberal Jews embrace interfaith marriage as an enriching contribution to a multicultural society. Regardless of attitudes to intermarriage, there is now an increasing effort to reach out to descendants of intermarried parents, each Jewish denomination focusing on those it defines as \"Jewish\"; secular and non-denominational Jewish organisations have sprung up to bring the descendants of intermarried parents back into the \"Jewish\" fold.\n\nIn some cases, children of a Jewish parent were raised in the non-Jewish parent's religion while maintaining a sense of Jewish ethnicity and identity.\n\nIn Christian–Jewish relations, interfaith marriage and the associated phenomenon of Jewish assimilation are a matter of concern for both Jewish and Christian leaders. A number of Progressive Christian denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer convert Jews. They have made use of dual-covenant theology. Additionally, Jewish counter-missionary and anti-missionary organizations, like Outreach Judaism, help Jews make educated decisions and aid them to reject conversion to other religions, most often Christianity, and intermarriage.\n\nMany Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships, particularly relationships between Jewish women and non-Jewish Arab men. A 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage is equivalent to \"national treason\". A group of 35 Jewish men, known as \"Fire for Judaism\", in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev started patrolling the neighborhood in an effort to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of Petah Tikva has also announced an initiative to prevent interfaith relationships, providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to \"inform\" on Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of Kiryat Gat launched a school programme in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.\n\nIn February 2010 \"Maariv\" has reported that the Tel Aviv municipality had instituted an official, government-sponsored counseling program to discourage Jewish girls from dating and marrying Arab boys. According to supporters of the program, the girls are often ostracized for being Jewish, and (some) fall into drugs and alcohol or are prevented from leaving their Arab boyfriends.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4187368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4187368", "title": "Islam in Japan", "text": "Islam in Japan\n\nThe history of Islam in Japan is relatively brief in relation to the religion's longstanding presence in other nearby countries. Islam is one of the smallest minority faiths in Japan, having more adherents in the country than the Bahá'í faith, but fewer than Christianity. There were isolated occasions of Muslims in Japan before the 19th century. Today, Muslims are made up of largely immigrant communities, as well as smaller ethnic Japanese community.\n\nIn 2016, Japan accepted 0.3% of refugee applicants, many of whom are Muslim.\n\nThere are isolated records of contact between Islam and Japan before the opening of the country in 1853, possibly as early as the 1700s; some Muslims did arrive in earlier centuries, although these were isolated incidents.\n\nThe earliest Muslim records of Japan can be found in the works of the Muslim cartographer Ibn Khordadbeh, who has been understood by Michael Jan de Goeje to mention Japan as the \"lands of Waqwaq\" twice: \"East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there.” And: “Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq.\"\nMahmud Kashgari's 11th century atlas indicates the land routes of the Silk Road and Japan in the map's easternmost extent.\n\nWithin Kublai's court, his most trusted governors and advisers appointed by meritocracy with the essence of multiculturalism were: Semu, Hui, Koreans and Chinese. Because the Wokou extended support to the crumbling Song dynasty, Kublai Khan initiated the Mongol invasions of Japan.\n\nThe court of the Goryeo supplied Korean troops and an ocean-going naval force for the Mongol campaigns. Despite the opposition of some of his Confucian-trained advisers, Kublai decided to invade Japan, Burma, Vietnam, and Java, following the suggestions of some of his Mongol officials. He also attempted to subjugate peripheral lands such as Sakhalin, where its indigenous people eventually submitted to the Mongols by 1308, after Kublai's death.\n\nDuring the 14th century, Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty made Ryukyu Kingdom a tributary vassal, and ethnic Chinese settlers consolidated the islands for their ruler in Nanjing.\n\nDuring that period there was contact between the Hui, general Lan Yu of the Ming dynasty and the swordsmiths of Japan. According to Chinese sources, Lan Yu owned 10,000 Katana, Hongwu Emperor was displeased with the general's links with Kyoto and more than 15,000 people were implicated for alleged treason and executed.\n\nEarly European accounts of Muslims and their contacts with Japan were maintained by Portuguese sailors who mention a passenger aboard their ship, an Arab who had preached Islam to the people of Japan. He had sailed to the islands in Malacca in 1555.\n\nThe first modern Muslim contacts were with Indonesians who served aboard British and Dutch ships in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the late 1870s, the biography of Muhammad was translated into Japanese. This helped Islam spread and reach the Japanese people, but only as a part of the history of cultures.\n\nAnother important contact was made in 1890 when the Ottoman Empire dispatched a naval vessel to Japan for the purpose of saluting the visit of Japanese Prince Komatsu Akihito to Constantinople several years earlier. This frigate was called the \"Ertugrul\", and was destroyed in a storm along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture on September 16, 1890.\n\nIn the wake of the October Revolution, several hundred Turko-Tatar Muslim refugees from Central Asia and Russia were given asylum in Japan, settling in several main cities and formed small communities. Some Japanese converted to Islam through contact with these Muslims. Historian Caeser E. Farah documented that in 1909 the Russian-born writer Abdurreshid Ibrahim (1857–1944), was the first Muslim who successfully converted the first ethnic Japanese, when Kotaro Yamaoka converted in 1909 in Bombay after contacting Ibrahim and took the name Omar Yamaoka. Yamaoka became the first Japanese to go on the Hajj. Yamaoka and Ibrahim were traveling with the support of nationalistic Japanese groups like Black Dragon Society (Kokuryūkai). Yamaoka in fact had been with the intelligence service in Manchuria since the Russo-Japanese war. His official reason for traveling was to seek the Sultan's approval for building a mosque in Tokyo. This approval was granted in 1910, and on 12 May 1938, the Tokyo Mosque, was finally completed, with generous financial support from the zaibatsu. Its first imams were Abdul-Rashid Ibrahim and Abdülhay Kurban Ali (Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev) (1889–1972). However, Japan’s first mosque, the Kobe Mosque was built in 1935, with the support of the Turko-Tatar community of traders there. On 12 May 1938, a Mosque was dedicated in Tokyo. Another early Japanese convert was Bunpachiro Ariga, who about the same time as Yamaoka went to India for trading purposes and converted to Islam under the influence of local Muslims there, and subsequently took the name Ahmed Ariga. Yamada Toajiro was for almost 20 years from 1892 the only resident Japanese trader in Constantinople. During this time he served unofficially as consul. He converted to Islam, and took the name Abdul Khalil, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca on his way home.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established in 1935 in Japan.\n\nIn the late Meiji period, close relations were forged between Japanese military elites with an Asianist agenda and Muslims to find a common cause with those suffering under the yoke of Western hegemony. In 1906, widespread campaigns were aimed at Muslim nations with journals reporting that a Congress of religions was to be held in Japan where the Japanese would seriously consider adopting Islam as the national religion and that the Emperor was at the point of becoming a Muslim.\n\nNationalistic organizations like the Ajia Gikai were instrumental in petitioning the Japanese government on matters such as officially recognizing Islam, along with Shintoism, Christianity and Buddhism as a religion in Japan, and in providing funding and training to Muslim resistance movements in Southeast Asia, such as the Hizbullah, a resistance group funded by Japan in the Dutch Indies. The founded in 1930, was the first official Islamic organisation in Japan. It had the support of imperialistic circles during World War II, and caused an \"Islamic Studies Boom\". During this period, over 100 books and journals on Islam were published in Japan. While these organizations had their primary aim in intellectually equipping Japan's forces and intellectuals with better knowledge and understanding of the Islamic world, dismissing them as mere attempts to further Japan's aims for a \"Greater Asia\" does not reflect the nature of depth of these studies. Japanese and Muslim academia in their common aims of defeating Western colonialism had been forging ties since the early twentieth century, and with the destruction of the last remaining Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire, the advent of hostilities in World War II and the possibility of the same fate awaiting Japan, these academic and political exchanges and the alliances created reached a head. Therefore, they were extremely active in forging links with academia and Muslim leaders and revolutionaries, many of whom were invited to Japan.\n\nShūmei Ōkawa, by far the highest-placed and most prominent figure in both Japanese government and academia in the matter of Japanese-Islamic exchange and studies, managed to complete his translation of the \"Qur'an\" in prison, while being prosecuted as an alleged class-A war criminal by the victorious Allied forces for being an 'organ of propaganda'. Charges were dropped for his erratic behaviour officially; however historians have speculated that the weakness of the charges against him was more likely the true reason. While Okawa did display unusual behaviour during the trial such as rapping on the head of Hideki Tōjō, he also stated that the trial was a farce and unworthy of being called one. He was transferred to a hospital on official claims of mental instability and then prison, and freed not long thereafter, dying as Muslim in 1957 after a quiet life where he continued lecturing, on his return to his home village and his wife, who survived him. He claimed to have seen visions of Muhammad in his sleep.\n\nThe Turks have been the biggest Muslim community in Japan until recently. The Japanese invasion of China and South East Asian regions during the Second World War brought the Japanese in contact with Muslims. Those who converted to Islam through them returned to Japan and established in 1953 the first Japanese Muslim organisation, the \"Japan Muslim Association\", which was officially granted recognition as a religious organization by the Japanese government in June 1968. The second president of the association was the Umar Mita, who was typical of the old generation, learning Islam in the territories occupied by the Japanese Empire. He was working for the Manshu Railway Company, which virtually controlled the Japanese territory in the northeastern province of China at that time. Through his contacts with Chinese Muslims, he became a Muslim in Peking. When he returned to Japan after the war, he made the Hajj, the first Japanese in the post-war period to do so. He also made a Japanese translation of the Qur'an from a Muslim perspective for the first time. Aljazeera also made a documentary regarding Islam and Japan called \"Road to Hajj – Japan\".\n\nThe economic boom in the country in the 1980s saw an influx of immigrants to Japan, including from majority Muslim nations. These immigrants and their descendants form the majority of Muslims in the country. Today, there are Muslim student associations at some Japanese universities.\n\nIn 1941, one of the chief sponsors of the Tokyo Mosque asserted that the number of Muslims in Japan numbered 600, with just three or four being native Japanese. Some sources state that in 1982 the Muslims numbered 30,000 (half were natives). Of the ethnically Japanese Muslims, the majority are thought to be ethnic Japanese women who married immigrant Muslims who arrived during the economic boom of the 1980s, but there are also a small number of intellectuals, including university professors, who have converted. Most estimates of the Muslim population give a range around 100,000 total. Islam remains a minority religion in Japan, and there is no evidence as to whether its numbers are increasing. Conversion is more prominent among young ethnic Japanese married women, as claimed by \"The Modern Religion\" as early as the 1990s. The true size of the current Muslim population in Japan remains a matter of speculation. Japanese scholars such as Hiroshi Kojima of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research and Keiko Sakurai of Waseda University suggest a Muslim population of around 70,000, of which perhaps 90% are resident foreigners and about 10% native Japanese. Of the immigrant communities, in order of population size, are Indonesians, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Iranians. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.\n\nAccording to japanfocus.org, there were 30 to 40 single-story mosques in Japan plus another 100 or more apartment rooms set aside for prayers in the absence of more suitable facilities. 90% of these mosques use the 2nd floor for religious activities and the first floor as a halal shop (Imported food; mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia), due to financial problems, as membership is too low to cover the expenses. Most of these Mosques have only a capacity of 30 to 50 people.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1937, she published her only book, \"Astrology and Stock Market Forecasting\". Some believe that “Louise McWhirter” was only an alias of famous market forecaster W. D. Gann.\n\nMcWhirter’s main theory was that the major of primary trend of business volume and finance is clearly pointed out by the 18.6-year cycle of the North Node as it passes through the twelve signs of the zodiac. During a long-term trend, the four crucial points of the stock market are reached when the Node enters the four fixed signs respectively:\n\n\nIt has been noted that the four crucial signs (the top, bottom and two break-even points) correspond to the four heads of the cherubim in the Book of Ezekiel.\n\nBelow is a table of stock market crashes and the respective North Node locations. Please note that the motion of the North is retrograde by default, so that it always travels from West to East, in the opposite way of other planets.\n\nMcWhirter also lists several secondary factors which tend to raise or depress business, mostly related to aspects of major planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto:\nMcWhirter maintained that one should pay attention when a planet moves to 14° Cancer (104°) and 24° Pisces (354°), because these places are where the Ascendant and Midheaven were when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was initiated by an agreement on 17 May 1792, though only after rectifying the exact time to 7:52 am. Similarly, since the tenth house of the NYSE chart was in Pisces and Aries, which are ruled by Neptune and Mars respectively, she also thought that aspects to these two planets are important.\n\nIn a shorter timeframe, McWhirter uses the new moon for timing market turns. The key idea is that she would pay attention to planets which make an astrological aspect to the new moon, and watch them as the moon passes through them later.\n\nM. G. Bucholtz suspects that “Louise McWhirter” is not the author’s real name. His reason is that he comes across no other books by McWhirter and finds no other sources mentioning this person. He believes that the real identity of Louise McWhirter was famous market forecaster W. D. Gann, whom Bucholtz believes used similar techniques in market predictions. According to Pythagorean numerology, the names “W. D. Gann” and “Louise McWhirter” share the same numerological root of “9”. It is possibly not an coincidence, since some people believe that Gann was an numerologist.\n\nOne of the biggest connection between McWhirter and Gann is that McWhirter’s Nodal cycle theory is very similar to Gann’s “financial timetable”. It is timetable with alternating 18- and 19-year cycle, which mimics the Nodal cycle very closely. Like McWhirter’s theory, Gann also found that the stock market follows a rhythm of 18–19 years.

{"id": "2239217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2239217", "title": "Mahikari", "text": "Mahikari\n\nMahikari is a Japanese new religious movement (shinshūkyō) that was founded in 1959 by Yoshikazu Okada (岡田 良一) (1901–1974). The word \"Mahikari\" means \"True (真, ma) Light (光, hikari)\" in Japanese.\n\nThis organization was founded based on a revelation dated February 27, 1959. Okada said that this revelation related to the mission of bringing purification to the world and humanity. Thus, he founded the organization, \"L.H. Yokoshi Tomo no Kai\" (陽光子友乃会 – Association of Positive People [children] of Light). In 1963, he registered the organization under the name \"Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan\" (World Divine Light Organization).\n\nOkada claimed that the revelation was from the Creator God, Mioya Motosu Mahikari Omikami (\"Great Parent, Great Origin, True Light, Great God\"), or simply, \"Su (主, Lord) God.\" He mentioned his role to pioneer the introduction of the art of True Light, a method of spiritual purification that cleanses the spirit, mind, and body, and serves as an expedient to attaining happiness.\n\nOkada claimed that the world was approaching a time of great upheaval, \"baptism by fire,\" in which humanity will be cleansed through abnormal weather, social turmoil, and so on. He emphasized that humanity had entered this period in earnest from January 1, 1962. Okada said an increase in what he called the spiritual energy of fire would result in phenomena such as flooding, cold snaps, and potable water would becoming increasingly scarce. He said humankind needed to work hastily to develop techniques of turning sea water into drinkable water.\n\nThe holy scriptures of Mahikari consist of \"The Holy Words\" (\"Goseigen\") and \"The Yōkōshi Prayer Book\" (\"Norigotoshū\").\n\nTenrikyo was founded by Miki Nakayama (1798–1886). Its name means “Heavenly Wisdom” (\"tenri\" means heavenly wisdom and \"kyo\" means teaching or religion). During a healing ceremony, Miki reportedly entered a trance and said, “I am the True and Original God. I have been predestined to reside here. I have descended from Heaven to save all human beings, and I want to take Miki as the Shrine of God and the mediatrix between God and men.”\n\nKonkokyo, which may be translated as “Golden Light,” was founded by Bunjiro Kawate (1814–1883) in 1859. \"[Kawate] found Parent of all men, the Parent-God of the Universe, who revealed himself ... as Tenchi-Kane-no-kami. It was on November the 15th of 1859 that the words of God came upon the Founder, calling him to the sacred mission of saving men, and revealing at the same time that the prosperity of mankind is the ultimate purpose of the Parent-God of the Universe, and that without the realization of that purpose God Himself is morally imperfect.\"\n\nOomoto, which means “The Teaching of the Great Origin,” was founded in 1892 by Nao Deguchi (1836–1918). She claimed she had a visitation of a supernatural entity bestowing a mission on her to save humankind, that the origin was one, that mankind must return to that origin, and that humankind faced a great upheaval. Oomoto was promoted as the catalyst to unite all religions. Deguchi claimed to receive revelations from her god-deity, which she wrote down as the Ofudesaki, \"From the Tip of the Brush,\" and used a healing method called \"Miteshiro\" (honorable hand-substitute) to drive out possessing spirits.\n\nSekai Kyūsei Kyō (世界救世教 – Church of World Messianity) was founded by Mokichi Okada (1882–1955). In June 1920, he joined Oomoto. Okada was a teacher in an Oomoto church in Tokyo in 1934 when he started using a process different from the official Oomoto healing method and was expelled.\n\nSome of the practices practiced by devotees of Sekai Kyūsei Kyō are very similar to those practiced by Mahikari members. For example, the practise of \"Johrei\" (Purification of the Spirit), the imagined energy radiating from the hand, is similar to \"Mahikari no waza\" (True Light), and the \"Ohikari\", the pendant worn around the neck by members of Sekai Kyusei Kyo, is similar in concept to the \"Omitama\" pendant worn around the neck by Mahikari members.\n\n\"In a collection of [Okada's] sermons we find a chapter entitled “Light from the East,” which explains that the founders of the world’s great religions realized their teachings could not reveal the ultimate truth, and knew that such the truth would eventually come from the East. \n\n\"Much earlier Mahikari mythology is attributed to the Kojiki, Records of Ancient Matters, which was written circa 712 CE. Though the Kojiki is a depository of Shinto myths, it is well known to scholars as a “late compilation in which political considerations and specifically Chinese conceptions intrude themselves almost everywhere.” Mahikari utilizes many of the mythological deities found in the Kojiki but focuses on the Su God who personally chose Okada as his savior.\" \n\nThe following organizations (listed in order of establishment date) are \"Shinshūkyō\" that were influenced by the world-view and practices of Yoshikazu Okada:\n\n\nSekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan (World Divine Light Organization) is the name of an independent organization founded by Yoshikazu Okada in 1959 as \"Yokoshi Tomo no Kai\" (Association of Positive People [children] of Light). Okada was the organization's first \"Holy Master\" (Holy name: \"Seio, Kotama\"). After Okada's death on June 23, 1974, the Reverend Seiho Sakae Sekiguchi (1909–1994) became the second \"Holy Master\" of the organization by \"divine degree\". During his leadership, the organization established the \"Su-za World Main Shrine\" in Mount Amagi on the Izu Peninsula on August 23, 1987. On January 3, 1994, the Reverend Seisho (Katsutoshi Sekiguchi (1939–) became the third \"Holy Master\" of the organization, also by \"divine degree\".\n\nSukyo Mahikari (崇教真光) is the name of an independent organization founded by Keishu Okada in 1978, the adopted daughter of Yoshikazu Okada, following his death and the subsequent legal dispute over leadership of Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan. The Sukyo Mahikari World headquarters is located at the \"World Shrine\" to the Creator God, which was completed in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture, in 1984. The Takayama site also includes the Hikaru Museum, a museum opened in 1999 that depicts the life and world-view of Mr. Okada and the Sukyo Mahikari organization.\n\nSuhikari Kōha Sekai Shindan was founded in 1980 by the spiritualist and manga artist Kuroda Minoru (1928– ). Kuroda had been a follower of Yoshikazu Okada and Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyōdan. After Okada's death, Kuroda left that organization and, after receiving a revelation, established the \"Shūkyō Dantai Kōrin\" in 1980, registering the group as an independent religious body under the Religious Corporations Law (Shūkyō Hōjinhō). In 1984 the group assumed its current name. Its headquarters are in Hachiōji City, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32312680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32312680", "title": "Messiah Part III", "text": "Messiah Part III\n\nMessiah (HWV 56), the English-language oratorio composed by George Frideric Handel in 1741, is structured in three parts. This listing covers Part III in a table and comments on individual movements, reflecting the relation of the musical setting to the text. Part I begins with the prophecy of the Messiah and his birth, shows the annunciation to the shepherds as a scene from the Gospel of Luke, and reflects the Messiah's deeds on Earth. Part II covers the Passion, death, resurrection, ascension, and the later spreading of the Gospel. Part III concentrates on Paul's teaching of the and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nThe libretto by Charles Jennens is entirely drawn from the Bible, mostly from the King James Bible, whereas several psalms are taken from the Book of Common Prayer. The librettist commented: \"... the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah ...\". \"Messiah\" differs from Handel's other oratorios by telling no story, instead offering reflections on different aspects of the Christian Messiah. Christopher Hogwood comments:\n\nThe oratorio's structure follows the liturgical year; Part I corresponding with Advent, Christmas and the life of Jesus, Part II with Lent, Easter, Ascension and Pentecost, Part III with the end of the church year, dealing with the end of time, the and Christ's glorification in heaven. The sources are drawn mostly from the Old Testament. Even the birth and death of Jesus are told in the words of the prophet Isaiah, the most prominent source of the libretto. The only true scene of the oratorio is taken from the Gospel of Luke, the annunciation to the shepherds. The imagery of shepherd and lamb features prominently, in the aria \"He shall feed His flock like a shepherd\", the only extended piece to talk about the Messiah on earth, in the opening of Part II, \"Behold the Lamb of God\", in the chorus \"All we like sheep\", and in the closing chorus of the work, \"Worthy is the Lamb\". Occasionally verses from different biblical sources are combined in one movement, but more often a coherent text section is set in different consecutive movements, such as the first \"scene\", the annunciation of Christian salvation, as a sequence of three movements, recitative, aria and chorus.\n\nWhen Handel composed \"Messiah\" in London, he was already a successful and experienced composer of Italian operas. He had started in 1713 to also compose sacred music on English texts, such as the \"Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate\". He set many oratorios on English libretti. In \"Messiah\" he used practically the same musical means as for those works, namely a structure based on chorus and solo singing. Only a few movements are a duet or a combination of solo and chorus. The solos are typically a combination of recitative and aria. The arias are called Air or Song, some of them have da capo form, but rarely in a strict sense, repeating a first section after a sometimes contrasting middle section. Handel finds various ways to use the format freely, in order to convey the text. The movements marked \"Recitative\" (Rec.) are \"secco\", only accompanied by the basso continuo. Recitatives marked \"Accompagnato\" (Acc.) are accompanied by additional string instruments. Handel uses four voice parts in both solo and chorus, soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B). Only once is the chorus divided in an upper chorus and a lower chorus, it is SATB otherwise. The orchestra scoring is simple: oboes, strings and basso continuo of harpsichord, violoncello, violone and bassoon. Two trumpets and timpani highlight selected movements, such as the closing movements of Part II, \"Hallelujah\". Handel uses a cantus firmus on long repeated notes especially to illustrate God's speech and majesty, such as \"King of Kings\" in the Hallelujah chorus.\n\nThe following table is organized by movement numbers. There are two major systems of numbering the movements of \"Messiah\": the historic Novello edition of 1959 (which is based on earlier editions and contains 53 movements), and the Bärenreiter edition of 1965 in the Hallische Händel-Ausgabe. Not counting some short recitatives as separate movements, there are therefore 47 movements. In the table below, the Novello number (Nov) is given first and is the index for the notes to individual movements in the \"movements\" section, then the Bärenreiter number (Bär).\n\nTo emphasise the movements in which the oboes (ob) and the rarely used trumpets (tr) and timpani (ti) play, the summary below does not mention the regular basso continuo and the strings in movements. Details on the development of keys, different tempo markings times within a movement are given in notes on the individual movements. Movements originally in Italian (It) are indicated in the Source column, however the exact origin is supplied in the notes on the movement.\n\nScene 1 tells in an aria and a chorus of the resurrection, based on the Messianic anticipation in the Book of Job () and Paul's teaching in his first epistle to the ().\n\nI know that my Redeemer liveth\n\nThe Air for soprano \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\" draws from both Job and Paul. It begins with the \"ascending fourth\", a signal observed by musicologist Rudolf Steglich as a unifying motif of the oratorio, on the words \"I know\", repeated almost every time these words appear again. \"For now is Christ risen\" is pictured in a steadily rising melody of more than an octave.\n\nSince by man came death\n\nThe text for the chorus \"Since by man came death\" continues Paul's thoughts, juxtaposing death and resurrection twice. Consequently, Handel twice uses a Grave a cappella setting in A minor with chromatic lines, opposed to an Allegro with orchestra in C major in most simple harmony, switching back and forth between these extremes.\n\nScene 2 deals with Paul's teachings on the on the Day of Judgement, as written in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. Accompagnato and Air share three verses, . Handel breaks the text in the middle of the second verse, to open the aria with the musical idea \"the trumpet shall sound\". The image, first found in Exodus 19, pictures a courtly herald who blew the trumpet as a signal that the king was about to enter the throne room, a signal to stand in his honour. The passage from 1 Corinthians 15 was also chosen by Johannes Brahms for \"Ein deutsches Requiem\", but in the German translation of the Bible the instrument is a trombone.\n\nBehold, I tell you a mystery\n\n\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\" is rendered as a bass accompagnato in D major. Towards the end, motifs like trumpet signals appear in the strings even before the last words \"at the last trumpet\".\n\nThe trumpet shall sound\n\nThe Air for bass \"The trumpet shall sound\", marked \"Pomposo, ma non allegro\", is a da capo aria. In the work's only instrumental solo, the trumpet provides motifs which the bass picks up. In \"and we shall be changed\", the word \"changed\" is treated in inventive ever-changing melismas of up to six measures. In the middle section, the word \"immortality\" is expressed in a lively melisma of first eight, then nine measures.\n\nScene 3 first continues the text of Scene 2 (), presented in recitative, duet and chorus, and ends with an Air on Paul's Assurance of salvation, as written in the Epistle to the Romans, .\n\nThen shall be brought to pass\n\nAn alto recitative delivers \"Then shall be brought to pass\", ending on \"death is swallow'd up in victory\".\n\nO death, where is thy sting?\n\n\"O death, where is thy sting?\" is sung as a duet in E flat major of alto and tenor on a walking bass of the continuo, without strings. The movement is based on the duet for soprano and alto \"Se tu non lasci amore\" (HWV 193, 1722). Such a movement would remind the London listeners of love duets concluding operas, such as the final scene of \"Giulio Cesare.\"\n\nBut thanks be to God\n\nThe chorus answers in the same key and tempo \"But thanks be to God\".\n\nIf God be for us, who can be against us\n\nThe scene closes with the assurance \"If God be for us, who can be against us\". As a contrast to the following choral conclusion of the oratorio, it is sung by the soprano. Towards the end, Handel quotes the characteristic intervals beginning Martin Luther's chorale \"Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir\" several times, leading into the final chorus.\n\nScene 4 closes the work by visionary verses from the Book of Revelation, The creatures in heaven give praise (), affirmed by an extended Amen.\n\nWorthy is the Lamb that was slain\n\nThe chorus, with the full orchestra including trumpets and timpani, proclaims in a solemn Largo \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain\", and continues Andante \"to receive power – and riches, – and wisdom, – and strength, – and honour, – and glory, – and blessing\". The sequence of Largo and Andante is repeated, but not exactly the same music. A fugue carries the words \"Blessing and honour, glory and pow'r be unto him\". The men's voices and the continuo begin in unison, the simple theme rises to a note which is repeated nine times and falls back, reminiscent of the repeated notes in \"For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it\" and \"King of Kings\". Several countersubjects add life and texture, gradually more instruments take part in the development on \"for ever – and ever\". These words are rendered in short downward runs, but then also in the same rhythm as in the Hallelujah chorus, and finally broadened to Adagio. The \"Amen\" begins again simply in the bass and continuo. An intricate melody rises in four measures and one octave. Every other voice, tenor, alto, soprano, also sings the theme once. Rather unexpectedly, a solo violin plays the theme, first unsupported, then assisted by a continuo entrance of the theme, interrupted by a choral four-part setting with the theme in the bass. After two more instrumental measures, a four-part-setting develops to imitation and counterpoint of more and more independent voices, ending on a rest of a full measure. Finally, Amen is repeated two more times, Adagio.\n\nA contemporary critic, conditioned by John Brown who objected to operatic features in oratorios such as recitatives, long ritornellos, and ornamented vocal lines, commented on Handel's display of musical inventiveness and \"contrapuntal skill\": \"The fugue too, on Amen, is entirely absurd, and without reason: at most, Amen is only a devout fiat, and ought never, therefore, to have been frittered, as it is, by endless divisions on A— and afterwards men.\" But Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \"rising still higher\" than in \"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\". Christopher Hogwood comments: \"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\". Daniel I. Block summarized in 1997: \"... in this piece we see the remarkable confluence of Hebrew theology and biblical truth, Italian operatic genius, English class, and German piety.\"\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her drawings and prints of leading cultural figures, dancers and musicians in action, such as Francis Bacon, Mikhail Baryshnikov, T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nMilein Cosman was born in Gotha, Germany, in 1921 but spent most of her childhood in Düsseldorf. Because of her Jewish background and the rise of National Socialism, she went to school in Switzerland, at the Ecole d'Humanité and the International School of Geneva between 1937 and 1939. She came to England in 1939.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1942, Cosman studied at the Slade School of Art. The Slade was located in Oxford during the war years and there Cosman studied drawing under Randolph Schwabe and lithography under Harold Jones. In 1943 she attended evening classes at Oxford Polytechnic, where she was taught by Bernard Meninsky. In the same year she started teaching French and Art at a convent school as well as giving lectures on Art for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA).\n\nIn 1946, Cosman moved to London. She began book illustration and working as a freelance artist, while continuing to teach evening classes for the WEA and working for the American Broadcasting Station in Europe. She contributed drawings to national and international magazines and newspapers, including the BBC’s \"Radio Times\". Particularly noteworthy is a commission from \"Heute\" to draw Konrad Adenauer's post-war cabinet in Germany 1949.\n\nIn 1947, Cosman met the Viennese-born musician, writer, broadcaster and teacher Hans Keller (1919-1985), whom she married in 1961. Some books of his writings – \"The Jerusalem Diary\" (2001), \"Stravinsky The Music Maker\" (2010) and \"Britten\" (2013), for example – include many of her drawings and prints.\n\nMilein Cosman made a series of schools programmes on drawing for ITV in 1958. In all, she has had nearly 30 solo exhibitions in the UK and abroad and her work has been acquired by many leading museums including the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin. She was renowned for drawing quickly, and much of her work was done from the wings or auditorium during rehearsals for concerts, theatrical and dance performances, capturing movement “in mid-flight” as Ernst Gombrich put it.\n\nIn 2006, Cosman founded the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust, which aims to support young musicians and artists as well as publishing, exhibiting and archiving her own and Hans Keller’s work.

{"id": "1188662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1188662", "title": "Miracles (book)", "text": "Miracles (book)\n\nMiracles is a book written by C. S. Lewis, originally published in 1947 and revised in 1960. Lewis argues that before one can learn from the study of history whether or not any miracles have ever occurred, one must first settle the philosophical question of whether it is logically possible that miracles can occur in principle. He accuses modern historians and scientific thinkers, particularly secular biblical scholars, of begging the question against miracles, insisting that modern disbelief in miracles is a cultural bias thrust upon the historical record and is not derivable from it.\n\nIn a chapter on \"The Naturalist and the Supernaturalist\" Lewis gives technical definitions to the two terms. Naturalists, under his definition, believe that the Universe is a vast process in which all events which ever happen find their causes solely in the events that happened before them within the system. Supernaturalists believe that interruptions or interferences can take place in this system of our Universe from some other system outside it. A supernatural event would be one that is not traceable, even in principle, solely to materially determined causes within our Universe. Libertarian free will, if it exists, would have to be supernatural under this view.\n\nIn a chapter on \"Natural Laws\", Lewis addresses the issue of whether miracles are incompatible with natural law or science. He argues that rather than being mutually exclusive, miracles are definite interventions that go beyond natural laws. Miracles are consistent with nature, but beyond natural law.\n\nLewis makes a case for the reality of miracles by presenting the position that something more than nature, a supernatural world, may exist, including a benevolent creator likely to intervene in reality after creation.\n\nAll of the major miracles of the New Testament are addressed, with the incarnation playing the central role. Also included are two appendices which deal with matters of free will and the value of prayer.\n\nPhilosophers and scientists including Victor Reppert, William Hasker, and Alvin Plantinga have expanded on the \"Argument from reason\" and credit Lewis with first bringing the argument to light in \"Miracles\".\n\nThe argument holds that if, as thoroughgoing naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then there is no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it, or anything else not the direct result of a physical cause.\n\nLewis asserts that by this logic, the statement \"I have reason to believe naturalism is valid\" is self-referentially incoherent in the same manner as the sentence \"One of the words of this sentence does not have the meaning that it appears to have\", or the statement \"I never tell the truth\". In each case, to assume the veracity of the conclusion would eliminate the possibility of valid grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes J. B. S. Haldane who appeals to a similar line of reasoning. Haldane states \"If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.\"\n\nThe original version of \"Miracles\" contained a different version of chapter 3 entitled \"The Self-Contradiction of the Naturalist\". In it, Lewis made the same argument but referred to atomic motions in the brain as \"irrational\". In a Socratic Club debate, G. E. M. Anscombe criticized this, prompting Lewis to revise the chapter. The revised chapter presents a more detailed elucidation of the argument and distinguishes between \"non-rational\" and \"irrational\" processes. Anscombe commented on the process after Lewis's death that the rewrite showed \"honesty and seriousness\" on the part of Lewis.\n\n"}
{"id": "3384835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3384835", "title": "Moral Orel", "text": "Moral Orel\n\nMoral Orel is an American adult stop-motion animated television series, which originally aired on Adult Swim from December 13, 2005 to December 18, 2008. The series has been described as \"\"Davey and Goliath\"... meets \"South Park\"\". However, Dino Stamatopoulos, the show's creator, is wary of the comparison with \"Davey and Goliath\", telling the \"New York Times\" that \"Moral Orel\" grew out of a concept for a send-up of a \"Leave It to Beaver\"-style 1950s sitcom that would star Iggy Pop.\n\nAt the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, Stamatopoulos announced that the show would not be renewed for a fourth season. The final season was aired interspersed with repeats from the first two seasons, since many of the episodes took place in parallel with events of past episodes. The event, which was called \"44 Nights of Orel\", was hosted by Stamatopoulos and others and started on October 6, 2008, running through December 18, when the series finale premiered. A special entitled \"Beforel Orel\" later aired on November 19, 2012.\n\nThe program takes place in the fictional capital city of Moralton, in the fictional Bible Belt state \"Statesota.\" According to the globe shown in the opening credits, Moralton is in the exact center of the United States, with the town's church at the exact center of the town.\n\nThe main character is Orel Puppington, a student at Alfred G. Diorama Elementary School, who tries to live by the fundamentalist Protestant Christian moral code as articulated in church or by his father, Clay. Orel naïvely follows this code to disastrous extremes. The series is a satire of the archetypes of Middle American suburban life, modern-day WASP culture, alcoholism, and religious fundamentalism with weighty emotional undertones that increase dramatically as the series progresses.\n\n\nThe first season of the show followed a standard formula: Orel would hear a sermon in church on Sunday, then proceed to have some sort of misadventure based on his attempts to live by his (usually warped) interpretation of the lesson. At the end of each episode, his father would sternly put a halt to the proceedings and \"correct\" Orel (by means of corporal punishment)—only to offer an even more warped interpretation (in the first season this would be one of the \"Lost Commandments\"). Before the end titles, Clay Puppington's trousers would fall down as a running gag, because he had removed his belt to \"correct\" Orel beforehand. Throughout the season, the series' primary characters were introduced and various subplots were established, such as Orel's father being a closeted bisexual in love with Orel's gym teacher, and Orel's mother being an unhappily married housewife feeling trapped in her marriage.\n\nThe second season of the show broke the first season format and began to build upon the subplots introduced in the first season, making them the primary focus of the show. Although still the primary character, Orel became less a catalyst for each episode's events than an unwitting bystander often left confused and dejected at the end of an episode, who found himself unable to reconcile his optimistic nature and faith with the corruption and cynicism of the adults around him, particularly his father. The season culminated in a two-part episode dealing with a camping trip, during which Orel lost all faith in his father. The finale—\"Nature (Part 1)\" and \"Nature (Part 2)\"—marked a darker turn in the series' tone, de-emphasizing the cynical parody of the previous two seasons in favor of exploring darker, more disturbing themes and character behavior.\n\nThe third and final season of the show was structured as a massive, interconnecting, thirteen-part story dealing with the events leading up to and during the camping trip, and their long-reaching implications. It is revealed that during the trip, Orel's father gets drunk and shoots Orel in the leg, only to express a complete lack of remorse or sense of responsibility afterward. The series culminates in the ultimate dissolution of Clay's relationship with Orel's coach, and the revelation that Orel will one day be able to put his unhappy childhood behind him to raise a better family than the one in which he grew up.\n\nOriginally, before being cut down to a 13-episode third season and later cancelled, the show was going to have two more seasons and evolve into a show entitled \"Moralton\" that would revolve around the life of the residents of Moralton as a whole.\n\nThe series was troubled throughout its run. Against the wishes of creator Stamatopoulos, the Christmas-themed first-season finale, \"The Best Christmas Ever\", was aired as the series premiere. Adult Swim wanted to debut the show in December as part of a holiday-themed programming block. The episode—which featured the culmination of numerous story arcs developed throughout the first season, and ended with a cliffhanger—confused viewers and prompted some questions on Adult Swim's message boards as to whether or not the episode was a one-off practical joke. When the series eventually premiered, three episodes were held back because Cartoon Network's Standards & Practices Department found them to be too dark and sexually explicit, even for a late night program aimed at adults. All were eventually approved; two aired in May 2006, and the third aired on July 31, 2006. The series would ultimately be canceled with seven scripts left unproduced, cutting the third season down from the intended twenty episodes to thirteen.\n\nAfter the 2011 Halloween mini-marathon for \"Mary Shelley's Frankenhole\", Orel himself announced the upcoming \"Moral Orel\" special and its release \"sometime in the near future\". \"Beforel Orel\" was officially announced on Dino's official Twitter page. The special was described in a press release by Adult Swim as \"[a] \"Moral Orel\" special that sheds light on the origin of Orel's religious nature and the birth of his brother, Shapey\". It premiered on Monday, November 19, 2012.\n\nOn April 24, 2007, \"Volume One: The Unholy Edition\" was released, which included the first 15 episodes and which covered all of the first season and the first five episodes of the second season. This has been the only release in the US, which was later included as part of the \"Adult Swim in a Box\" set in 2009. In October 2007, Madman Entertainment released a similar volume one set in Australia. Starting in 2010, Madman continued releasing the series, starting with a second volume which included the rest of the second season, and then a third volume which included all of the third season. Then, they released the \"Complete Lessons Collection\", which compiled the discs from the previously released volumes.\n\nThe entire show has been available to buy at various digital video on demand stores.\n\n"}

The organization advocates on behalf of agunot and promotes the universal adoption of Jewish prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal (a get is a bill of Jewish divorce). Although 98% of the people ORA helps are women, they also support men whose wives refuse to accept a get. ORA views get-refusal is considered to be a form of domestic abuse. Rabbi Jeremy Stern is the Executive Director of the organization.\n\nORA was founded in 2002 by a group of Yeshiva University students. Since then, the organization has resolved over 220 cases of get-refusal, and at any given time is actively involved in approximately 50 open agunah cases. In 2014, the Slingshot Guide named ORA as one of the most innovative non-profit organizations in North America for its success in \"advocating for vulnerable women and changing the conversation about divorce in the Orthodox community\".\n\nORA resolves cases of get-refusal by combining facilitation with advocacy. Their strategies may include \"staging protests in front of a husband’s home and office, urging his community and synagogue to keep him out, raising awareness in the media and applying financial and legal pressure.\"\n\nORA's advocacy efforts on behalf of agunot have been covered by several major newspapers, including The New York Times, New York Post, Washington Post, Newsweek, The Daily Beast, Fox News, New York Daily News, and The Huffington Post.\n\nORA's Agunah Prevention Initiative raises awareness in the Jewish community about the importance of signing the Jewish prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal. The tagline of their initiative is: \"Friends don't let friends get married without the \"halachic\" prenup\", and in November 2014, ORA released a video to promote that message. While there is no way to know definitively if Jewish prenuptial agreements are becoming more popular in the Orthodox world, Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann, Director of the Beth Din of America, stated that, \"Anecdotally, there appears to have been a big increase in awareness and usage in the last few years.\"\n"}
{"id": "3940386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3940386", "title": "Pagans in Recovery", "text": "Pagans in Recovery\n\nPagans in Recovery (PIR) is the phrase which is frequently used to describe the collective efforts of Neopagans to achieve abstinence or the remission of compulsive/addictive behaviors through twelve-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Al-Anon/Alateen, etc. These efforts generally focus on modifying or adapting the twelve steps to accommodate the Pagan world-view as well as creating Pagan-friendly twelve step meetings either as part of a pre-existing twelve-step program, or as independent entities.\n\nThe term 'Pagans in Recovery' appears to have first been used in a Neopagan newsletter from Ohio prior to 1989 which was titled \"Pagans in Recovery\". Isaac Bonewits also used the term in an essay he wrote in 1996.\n\nMany Pagans are uncomfortable with traditional twelve-step meetings because of the use of Christian prayers, the difficulty in finding supportive sponsors, the assumption that a person's Higher Power is male, etc. Some Pagans find the 12 steps themselves too reminiscent of Christian theology to be applicable to their belief systems. Pagans have been \"ousted from A.A. meetings or shunned\" when members of that A.A. group discovered that they were Pagans. However this type of conduct would not be approved by A.A. itself as any person who \"has a desire to stop drinking\" may declare themselves a member of A.A.\n\nThe focus in alternative groups tends to be on tolerance, balance, building better boundaries, healing old wounds, making amends, taking our power back and right action. As a result, these groups tend to be more in tune with Pagan, New Age, Native American, humanistic, feminist, and Buddhist teachings, as well as with the more progressive versions of the mainstream faiths.\nAnother issue among Pagans in recovery is the one-sided image of addicts, alcoholics, codependents, and survivors of dysfunctional families portrayed in official 12 Step literature and in the many books published on recovery and dysfunctional family systems since the 1980s. For example, Kasl and others in the field of addiction have long noted that the classic \"Characteristics of Adult Children of Alcoholics\" and the list known as \"The Problem\" in ACA (which are read at every ACA meeting) focus strongly on \"character defects\" and do not adequately support the creation or celebration of character strengths, strengths which are often the result of surviving these very systems.\n\nMany twelve-step programs, such as Narcotics Anonymous, have special interest groups, typically meetings specifically geared towards young people, men, women, gays and lesbians, etc. Alcoholics Anonymous has also started meetings specifically for Native Americans which accommodate the Native American view of spirituality. Pagans who are recovering alcoholics have started A.A. meetings specifically for Pagans\n\nMany Pagans seem to prefer a mutually supportive, spiritually based twelve step approach to recovery over non-spiritually based programs such as Secular Organizations for Sobriety, where one is expected to keep his or her spiritual beliefs separate from recovery, or Rational Recovery, which is not spiritually based and does not encourage members to seek support from others in recovery. Generally speaking, Pagan twelve step meetings follow the same format as other twelve step meetings except that they use Pagan friendly readings (which have not been approved by the General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous or other twelve step organizations), and substitute Pagan friendly prayers for the Lord's Prayer (which is not AA Conference approved, but widely used) and the Serenity Prayer. For example, the \"Recovery Spiral: A Pagan Path to Healing\" by Cynthia Jane Collins is sometimes used instead of or along with the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Native American Great Spirit prayer may be substituted for the Lord's Prayer.\n\nSome Pagan twelve step groups have reworked or reworded the twelve steps so as to make them more applicable to Pagans, especially in allowing for a Polytheistic and non-gendered view of divinity. The members of Pagan twelve step groups are still expected to work the twelve steps as a means of spiritual growth, obtain a sponsor, make amends for harm they have caused, and to help others.\n\nSome twelve step meetings for Pagans are eclectic, meaning that anyone from a twelve step recovery program, regardless of the nature of their addiction, may participate in the meeting. This is in sharp contrast to Alcoholics Anonymous' concept of \"Singleness of Purpose\" which holds that alcoholics should only work with other alcoholics.\n\n\n"}

He served as the pastor of Armero, where he was stationed until his murder in 1948. The outbreak of the conflict saw families offer to smuggle him out of the town for his safety, which he refused, saying that he would not abandon his people in their hour of need. But liberal insurgents – who saw him as an instigator of the assassination of a leading national politician – burst into his church and took him to the central square where he was lynched and mutilated.\n\nThe cause for Ramírez' canonization was opened in 1993. His beatification was approved in July 2017 by Pope Francis, who personally presided over his beatification in Villavicencio on 8 September 2017 during his apostolic visit to the nation.\n\nRamírez was born on 23 October 1899 in La Plata to Ramón Ramírez Flórez and Isabel Ramos. He was baptized the next day in the local Parish Church of St. Sebastian. It was at that church that he also made his First Communion.\n\nRamírez' initial education was overseen in his local village. He attended high school at the Minor Seminary of St. Aloysius Gonzaga in Elias, Huila. He commenced his formal studies for the priesthood on 4 October 1915 at the seminary of the Diocese of Garzón, where he received minor orders in 1917. Ramirez developed doubts about his vocation, however, and decided to leave the seminary in 1920, seeking an answer to his vocational calling and relief from the frequent headaches from he suffered. He spent the subsequent years working as a choir director in various locations, initially at his former high school, and from 1924 at the village of Alpujarra, Tolima. Through a close and personal relationship with a pious young woman he came to know there, by 1928 he had reassessed his call to serve God and resumed his theological studies, this time at the Seminary of Mary Immaculate of the Diocese of Ibagué, for which he was ordained as a priest on 21 June 1930. He celebrated his First Mass at his home parish in St. Sebastian Church on the following 16 July.\n\nAfter Ramírez' ordination, his superior, Pedro María Rodríguez Andrade, the Bishop of Ibagué, appointed him as the pastor of Chaparral before transferring him to Cunday in 1934 and later to El Fresno in 1943. He was sent to his final parish of Armero circa 1948.\n\nOn 9 April 1948, Ramírez was visiting a patient in the local hospital when the news broke of the assassination of the presidential candidate of the Colombian Liberal Party, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. Ramírez was under the threat of death himself by that afternoon as members of the Liberal Party believed he had instigated the murder. A Sister Miguelina of the Mercedarian Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament who taught at the local school tried to help him and this bought him some time. Some families offered to help him flee during the night so he could remain safe, though the priest refused the offers, refusing to abandon his people during their time of need.\n\nDuring the afternoon on 10 April 1948 a large throng of people broke into the church not long after Ramírez had written his last will, believing that his final hour was at hand. Insurgents burst into the church and convent, accusing him of hiding weapons for the conservatives. His attackers took him to the central square (hurling insults at him en route) where he was lynched at 4:00pm and struck with a machete. His remains were left in the square for a few hours until midnight when his corpse was taken to the local cemetery where it was left in a ditch while refusing the faithful from going near his remains for burial. On 21 April government officials arrived and authorized an autopsy. A month later his parents were able to claim his remains, which they first had taken to his \"alma mater\", Mary Immaculate Seminary in Igabué, after which they were buried in the family plot in La Plata.\n\nThe cause for the canonization was opened in the Diocese of Garzón whereby the bishop of the diocese charged a diocesan tribunal with the collection of documents and testimonies related to Ramírez' life and his murder. The conclusion of this diocesan process saw the diocese send all documents to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See, which accepted the cause for further study on 23 February 1993, which accorded Ramírez the title of Servant of God.\n\nThe congregation validated this process under Pope John Paul II on 1 March 2002, after assessing the documents and approving the investigation's work and issued an official \"nihil obstat\" (\"Let nothing stand against [it]\") to the cause. Historians were assigned to discuss the cause and cleared it on 11 December 2012, after deeming that no historical obstacles existed that would impede it. The congregation then submitted the \"positio\" for theological assessment. The theological experts approved the dossier on 28 May 2016, as did the congregation sometime in mid-2017.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, Pope Francis approved the work of the congregation with its declaration that Ramírez had been killed \"in odium fidei\" (in hatred of the faith) and that he would soon be beatified along with his compatriot, Bishop Jesús Emilio Jaramillo Monsalve executed by leftist guerillas in 1950. The pope himself presided over the beatification in Villavicencio on 8 September 2017, during his apostolic visit to Colombia. Ramírez's remains were exhumed and transferred on 24 August 2017.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is the Trinitarian friar Antonio Sáez de Albéniz, O.Ss.T.\n\nWhen the decision to beatify Ramírez was first announced, a protest against it was issued to Pope Francis by the daughter of the politician whose murder had precipitated his. In her letter to the pope, the daughter, Gloria Gaitán, questioned this step by the Catholic Church, citing how the priest had openly called for her father's death, declaring in the pulpit that to kill him would not be a sin.\n\nPope Francis approved the cause on 7 July 2017 and thus approved the late priest's beatification. Francis himself presided over the beatification during his papal visit to Colombia at an open-air Mass on 8 September 2017 at Catama Field in Villavicencio.\n\n"}
{"id": "881388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881388", "title": "Persian carpet", "text": "Persian carpet\n\nA Persian carpet ( \"farsh\", meaning \"to spread\") or Persian rug (Persian: قالی ايرانى \"qālī-ye īranī\"), also known as Iranian carpet, is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in Iran (historically known as Persia), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art. Within the group of Oriental rugs produced by the countries of the so-called \"rug belt\", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.\n\nPersian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.\n\nCarpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Mashhad, Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.\n\nThe art and craft of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of political unrest, or under the influence of commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.\n\nAlthough the term \"Persian carpet\" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like Kilim, Soumak, and embroidered tissues like Suzani are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.\n\nIn 2010, the \"traditional skills of carpet weaving\" in Fars Province and Kashan were inscribed to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nThe beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as \"flat weaving\". Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as loop weaving. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot.\n\nThe Pazyryk carpet was excavated in 1949 from the grave of a Scythian nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC. This carpet is and has 36 symmetrical knots per cm² (232 per inch²). The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world. Its central field is a deep red color and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 x 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.\n\nThe discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet, Sergei Rudenko, assumed it to be a product of the contemporary Achaemenids. Whether it was produced in the region where it was found, or is a product of Achaemenid manufacture, remains subject to debate. Its fine weaving and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production.\n\nThere are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. Homer, assumed to have lived around 850 BC, writes in Ilias XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a \"splendid carpet\". In Odyssey Book VII and X \"carpets\" are mentioned. Pliny the Elder wrote (nat. VIII, 48) that carpets (\"polymita\") were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the Greek and Latin texts.\n\nFlat-woven kilims dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD were found in Turfan, Hotan prefecture, East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the Lop Nur area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in Dura-Europos in Syria, and from the At-Tar caves in Iraq, dated to the first centuries AD.\n\nThese rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.\n\nPersian carpets were first mentioned around 400 BC, by the Greek author Xenophon in his book \"Anabasis\":\n\n\"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς\", (Xen. anab. VII.3.18)\n\"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν.\" [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]\n\nXenophon describes Persian (lit.: \"barbarian\", meaning: non-Greek) carpets as precious, and worthy to be used as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., flat-weaving, or embroidery, but it is interesting that the very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.\n\nThere are no surviving Persian carpets from the reigns of the Achaemenian (553–330 BC), Seleucid (312–129 BC), and Parthian (ca. 170 BC – 226 AD) kings.\n\nThe Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading powers of its time, alongside its neighbouring Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years. The Sasanids established their empire roughly within the borders set by the Achaemenids, with the capital at Ctesiphon. This last Persian dynasty before the arrival of Islam adopted Zoroastrianism as the state religion.\n\nWhen and how exactly the Persians started weaving pile carpets is currently unknown, but the knowledge of carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: Anatolia, located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare as well as by trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman Antioch. A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on Jan van Eyck's \"Paele Madonna\" painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar.\n\nFlat weaving and embroidery were known during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, where they were used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries. More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution, or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the Silk Road near Turfan. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by the report of the historian Al-Tabari about the Spring of Khosrow carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.\n\nFragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern Afghanistan, reportedly originating from the province of Samangan, have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictions of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in. These fragments are now in the Al-Sabah Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah, Kuwait.\n\nThe carpet fragments, although reliably dated to the early Sasanian time, do not seem to be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating shag on the reverse hints at the need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.\n\nThe Muslim conquest of Persia led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Persia became a part of the Islamic world, ruled by Muslim Caliphates.\n\nArabian geographers and historians visiting Persia provide, for the first time, references to the use of carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the Hudud al-'Alam states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, Al-Muqaddasi refers to carpets in the Qaināt. Yaqut al-Hamawi tells us that carpets were woven in Azerbaijān in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller Ibn Battuta mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari atabeg in Idhej. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.\n\nThe rule of the Caliphs over Persia ended when the Abbasid Caliphate was overthrown in the Siege of Baghdad (1258) by the Mongol Empire under Hulagu Khan. The Abbasid line of rulers recentered themselves in the Mamluk capital of Cairo in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious matters until after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt (1517). Under the Mamluk dynasty in Cairo, large carpets known as \"Mamluk carpets\" were produced.\n\nBeginning at latest with the Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a distinct Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets were found in the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least give us an idea how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.\n\nBetween 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the Mongols. After 1260, the title \"Ilkhan\" was borne by the descendants of Hulagu Khan and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At the end of the thirteenth century, Ghazan Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the floors of his residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.\n\nWith the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. In 1381, Timur invaded Iran and became the founder of the Timurid Empire. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until they had to submit to the \"White Sheep\" Turkmen confederation under Uzun Hassan in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.\n\nIn 1463, the Venetian Senate, seeking allies in the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) established diplomatic relations with Uzun Hassans court at Tabriz. In 1473, Giosafat Barbaro was sent to Tabriz. In his reports to the Senate of Venetia he mentions more than once the splendid carpets which he saw at the palace. Some of them, he wrote, were of silk.\n\nIn 1403-05 Ruy González de Clavijo was the ambassador of Henry III of Castile to the court of Timur, founder and ruler of the Timurid Empire. He described that in Timur's palace at Samarkand, \"everywhere the floor was covered with carpets and reed mattings\". Timurid period miniatures show carpets with geometrical designs, rows of octagons and stars, knot forms, and borders sometimes derived from kufic script. None of the carpets woven before 1500 AD have survived.\n\nIn 1499, a new dynasty arose in Persia. Shah Ismail I, its founder, was related to Uzun Hassan. He is regarded as the first national sovereign of Persia since the Arab conquest, and established Shi'a Islam as the state religion of Persia. He and his successors, Shah Tahmasp I and Shah Abbas I became patrons of the Persian Safavid art. Court manufactories were probably established by Shah Tahmasp in Tabriz, but definitely by Shah Abbas when he moved his capital from Tabriz in northwestern to Isfahan in central Persia, in the wake of the Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18). For the art of carpet weaving in Persia, this meant, as Edwards wrote: \"that in a short time it rose from a cottage \"métier\" to the dignity of a fine art.\"\n\nThe time of the Safavid dynasty marks one of the greatest periods in Persian art, which includes carpet weaving. Later Safavid period carpets still exist, which belong to the finest and most elaborate weavings known today. The phenomenon that the first carpets physically known to us show such accomplished designs leads to the assumption that the art and craft of carpet weaving must already have existed for some time before the magnificent Safavid court carpets could have been woven. As no early Safavid period carpets survived, research has focused on Timurid period book illuminations and miniature paintings. These paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with \"kufic\" border ornaments derived from Islamic calligraphy. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially to \"Holbein carpets\" that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.\n\nBy the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier \"kufic\" border design was replaced by tendrils and arabesques. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p. 170). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what Kurt Erdmann termed the \"carpet design revolution\".\n\nApparently, the new designs were developed first by miniature painters, as they started to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This marks the first time when the \"classical\" design of Islamic rugs was established: The medaillon and corner design (pers.: \"Lechek Torūnj\") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail I employed the miniature painter Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century. As some carpets like the Ardabil carpets have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them:\n\nThe AH year of 946 corresponds to AD 1539-40, which dates the Ardabil carpet to the reign of Shah Tahmasp, who donated the carpet to the shrine of Shaykh Safi-ad-din Ardabili in Ardabil, who is regarded as the spiritual father of the Safavid dynasty.\n\nAnother inscription can be seen on the \"Hunting Carpet\", now at the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan, which dates the carpet to 949 AH/AD 1542–3:\n\nThe number of sources for more precise dating and the attribution of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge Marino Grimani. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the Armenian Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown. Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of \"Polish\" or \"Polonaise\" carpets. The more appropriate type name of \"Shah Abbas\" carpets was suggested by Kurt Erdmann.\n\nA. C. Edwards opens his book on Persian carpets with the description of eight masterpieces from this great period:\n\n\nA distinct group of Safavid carpets can be attributed to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure: Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the front. When the carpets are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, \"tram line\" effect.\n\nThe best known \"vase technique\" carpets from Kirmān are those of the so-called \"Sanguszko group\", named after the House of Sanguszko, whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with Houris, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to mosaic tile spandrels in the Ganjali Khan Complex at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century. Two other \"vase technique\" carpets have inscriptions with a date: One of them bears the date 1172 AH/AD 1758 and the name of the weaver: the Master Craftsman Muhammad Sharīf Kirmānī, the other has three inscriptions indicating that it was woven by the Master Craftsman Mu'min, son of Qutb al-Dīn Māhānī, between 1066-7 AH/AD 1655-6. Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p. 127).\n\nThe end of Shah Abbas II's reign in 1666 marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, a Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan. In 1722, Peter the Great launched the Russo-Persian War (1722-1723), capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including Derbent, Shaki, Baku, but also Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad. In 1722, an Afghan army led by Mir Mahmud Hotaki marched across eastern Iran, and besieged and took Isfahan. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves. With these events, the Safavid dynasty had come to an end.\n\nIran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated the Afghans, and Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of carpet weaving, which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the Afsharid and Zand dynasties.\n\nIn 1789, Mohammad Khan Qajar was crowned king of Persia, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, which provided Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of carpet weaving in Persia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the Revolution. The Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1920, the Iranian government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland.\n\nIn 1925 Rezā Shāh, supported by the British government, deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and founded the Pahlavi dynasty. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state. In order to stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of carpet weaving, often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought carpet weaving under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.\n\nThe Pahlavi dynasty modernized and centralized the Iranian government, and sought effective control and authority over all their subjects. Reza Shah was the first Persian monarch to confront this challenge with modern weapons. Enforced by the army, nomadism was outlawed during the 1930s, traditional tribal dresses were banned, the use of tents and yurts was forbidden in Iran. Unable to migrate, having lost their herds, many nomadic families starved to death. A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia was involved in the Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called White Revolution, despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the Qashqai people, and the traditional way of nomadic life. The centuries-old traditions of nomadic carpet weaving, which had entered a process of decline with the introduction of synthetic dyes and commercial designs in the late nineteenth century, were almost annihilated by the politics of the last Iranian imperial dynasty.\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution, little information could at first be obtained about carpet weaving in Iran. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new interest arose in Europe in Gabbeh rugs, which were initially woven by nomadic tribes for their own use. Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.\n\nIn 1992, the first Grand Persian Conference and Exhibition in Tehran presented for the first time modern Persian carpet designs. Persian master weavers like Razam Arabzadeh displayed carpets woven in the traditional technique, but with unusual, modern designs. As the Grand Conferences continue to take place at regular intervals, two trends can be observed in Iranian carpet weaving today. On the one hand, modern and innovative artistic designs are invented and developed by Iranian manufacturers, who thus take the ancient design tradition forward towards the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the renewed interest in natural dyes was taken up by commercial enterprises, which commission carpets to tribal village weavers. This provides a regular source of income for the carpet weavers. The companies usually provide the material and specify the designs, but the weavers are allowed some degree of creative freedom. With the end of the U.S. embargo on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique Persian carpets acquired at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.\n\nAs commercial household goods, Persian carpets today are encountering competition from other countries with lower wages and cheaper methods of production: Machine-woven, tufted rugs, or rugs woven by hand, but with the faster and less costly loop weaving method, provide rugs in \"oriental\" designs of utilitarian, but no artistic value. Traditional hand woven carpets, made of sheep wool dyed with natural colours are increasingly sought after. They are usually sold at higher prices due to the large amount of manual work associated with their production, which has, essentially, not changed since ancient times, and due to the artistic value of their design. Thus, the Persian carpet retains its ancient status as an object of luxury, beauty, and art.\n\nIn most Persian rugs, the pile is of sheep's wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is \"skin\" wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Higher grades of Persian wool are often referred to as kurk, or kork wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck. Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. Merino wool from New Zealand, because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like Baluch rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.\n\nCotton forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.\n\nSilk is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.\n\nThe fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using spinning wheels or industrial spinning machines to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called \"twist\". Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram). Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or \"plied\" to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. Like nearly all Islamic rugs with the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all Persian rugs use \"Z\" (anti-clockwise) spun and \"S\" (clockwise)-plied wool.\n\nThe dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a mordant. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.\n\nTraditional dyes used in Persian rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist William Henry Perkin invented the first aniline dye, mauveine. A variety of other synthetic dyes were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.\n\nAccording to these analyses, natural dyes used for carpet wool include:\nSome of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed \"(Reseda luteola)\", Yellow larkspur, or Dyer's sumach Cotinus coggygria. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.\n\nIn Iran, traditional dyeing with natural dyes was revived in the 1990s, inspired by the renewed general interest in traditionally produced rugs, but master dyers like Abbas Sayahi had kept alive the knowledge about the traditional recipes.\n\nCarmine dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the Cochineal scale Coccus cacti, and certain Porphyrophora species (Armenian and Polish cochineal). Cochineal dye, the so-called \"laq\" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where Madder (Rubia tinctorum) was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.\n\nWith modern synthetic dyes, nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that without chemical analysis it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.\n\nThe appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish \"abraş\", literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.\n\nThe weaving of pile rugs is a time-consuming process which, depending on the quality and size of the rug, may take anywhere from a few months to several years to complete.\n\nTo begin making a rug, one needs a foundation consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which run through the length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one side to the other are called wefts. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.\n\nWeaving normally begins from the bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.\n\nWhen the rug is completed, the warp ends form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.\n\nLooms do not vary greatly in essential details, but they do vary in size and sophistication. The main technical requirement of the loom is to provide the correct tension and the means of dividing the warps into alternate sets of leaves. A shedding device allows the weaver to pass wefts through crossed and uncrossed warps, instead of laboriously threading the weft in and out of the warps.\n\nThe simplest form of loom is a horizontal; one that can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.\n\nThe technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.\n\nThere are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the Tabriz or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.\n\n\nThe weaver needs a number of essential tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; and a pair of shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.\n\nA variety of additional instruments are used for packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.\n\nA number of different tools may be used to shear the wool depending on how the rug is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when the rug is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.\n\nPersian carpets are mainly woven with two different knots: The symmetrical Turkish or \"Giordes\" knot, also used in Turkey, the Caucasus, East Turkmenistan, and some Turkish and Kurdish areas of Iran, and the asymmetrical Persian, or Senneh knot, also used in India, Turkey, Pakistan, China, and Egypt. The term \"Senneh knot\" is somewhat misleading, as rugs are woven with symmetric knots in the town of Senneh.\n\nTo tie a symmetric knot, the yarn is passed between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled through the center so that both ends emerge between the warps.\n\nThe asymmetric knot is tied by wrapping the yarn around only one warp, then the thread is passed behind the adjacent warp so that it divides the two ends of the yarn. The Persian knot may open on the left or the right.\n\nThe asymmetric knot allows to produce more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, the quality of the design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.\n\nAnother knot frequently used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.\n\nFlat woven carpets are given their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly intertwined with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.\n\nThe most popular of flat-weaves is called the Kilim. Kilim rugs (along with jewellery, clothing and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribes-people. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.\n\nVarious forms of flat-weaves exist including:\n\nIn 2016 Iran had 40 carpet designs that each belong to a different geographical region including 29 designs internationally registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization.\n\n\nNomadic carpets are also known as Gelim (; including \"Zilu\", meaning \"rough carpet\". In this use, Gelim includes both pile rugs and flat weaves (such as kilim and soumak).\n\nRug design can be described by the way the ornaments are arranged within the pile. One basic design may dominate the entire field, or the surface may be covered by a pattern of repeating figures.\n\nIn areas with traditional, time-honoured local designs, such as the Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the specific patterns are part of the family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a \"cartoon\". The weaver weaves a knot for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.\n\nThe surface of the rug is arranged and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field (\"all-over design\"). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is prohibited even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the Quran by Uthman Ibn Affan in 651 AD/19 AH and the Umayyad Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reforms, Islamic art has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called infinite repeat.\n\nDesign elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a medallion, a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common Persian \"Lechek Torūnj\" (medaillon and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental book illuminations in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.\n\nIn contrast to Anatolian rugs, the Persian carpet medaillon represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinate, creating an impression of the medaillon \"floating\" on the field.\n\nIn most Persian rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French Aubusson or Savonnerie weaving designs.\n\nThe corner articulations are a particularly challenging part of rug design. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be \"resolved\", or \"reconciled\". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.\n\nThe field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the boteh is used throughout the \"carpet belt\". Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around Kerman. Rugs from Seraband, Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the Tree of life, or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.\n\nSingle design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:\n\nCommon motifs in Persian carpets\nPersian carpets are best classified by the social context of their weavers. Carpets were produced simultaneously by nomadic tribes, in villages, town and court manufactures, for home use, local sale, or export.\nNomadic, or tribal carpets are produced by different ethnic groups with distinct histories and traditions. As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced settlement policy of the last Persian emperors of the Pahlavi dynasty. By 1970, it was observed that traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes, but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.\n\nTechnical characteristics of Persian nomadic carpets\n\nThe Kurds are an ethnic group, mostly inhabiting the area spanning adjacent parts of southeastern (Turkey), western (Iran), northern (Iraq), and northern (Syria). The large population and the wide geographical distribution of the Kurds account for a varied production spanning a spectre from coarse and naïve nomadic weavings to the most elaborate town manufacture carpets, finely woven like Senneh, or heavy fabrics like Bijar carpets. Although Kurdish rugs represent a traditional part of Persian rug production, they merit separate consideration.\n\nThe city of Sanandij, formerly known as Senneh, is the capital of Persian Kurdistan. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name \"Senneh\". They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/ dm). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine carpets have silk warps dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as \"rainbow warps\" in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours are used in the field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Herati pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Herati patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.\n\nThe town of Bijar lies around northeast of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding areas have been major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, which has led to the distinction between \"city\" and \"village\" Bijar rugs. The Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as \"wet weaving\", with the help of a special tool. Warps, weft and pile are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is consideravly thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/ dm), rarely even over 400 (6200/ dm).\n\nThe colours of Bijar rugs are exquisite, with light and dark blues, and saturated to light, pale madder red. The designs are traditionally Persian, with predominant Herati, but also Mina Khani, Harshang, and simple medallion forms. Frequently the design is more rectilinear, but Bijar rugs are more easily identified by their peculiar, stiff and heavy weaving than by any design. Bijar rugs cannot be folded without risking to damage the foundation. A specific feature is also the lack of outlining, particularly of the smaller patterns. Full-size \"sampler\" carpets showing only examples of field and border designs rather than a fully developed carpet design are called \"vagireh\" by rug traders, and are frequently seen in the Bijar area. New Bijar carpets are still exported from the area, mostly with less elaborate Herati designs and dyed with good synthetic dyes.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, there is not much detailed information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as \"northwest Persian, probably Kurdish\". As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of \"village production\", made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal provenience. A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used \"Kurdish\" design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.\n\nThe early history of the Qashqai people remains obscure. They speak a Turkic dialect similar to that of Azerbaijan, and may have migrated to the Fars province from the north during the thirteenth century, possibly driven by the Mongol invasion. Karim Khan Zand appointed the chief of the Chahilu clan as the first Il-Khan of the Qashqai. The most important subtribes are the Qashguli, Shishbuluki, Darashuri, Farsimadan, and Amaleh. The Gallanzan, Rahimi, and Ikdir produce rugs of intermediate quality. The rugs woven by the Safi Khani and Bulli subtribes are considered among the highest quality rugs. The rugs are all wool, usually with ivory warps, which distinguishes Qashqai from Khamseh rugs. Qashqai rugs use asymmetric knots, while Gabbeh rugs woven by Qashqai more often use symmetric knots. Alternate warps are deeply depressed. Wefts are in natural colours or dyed red. The selvedges are overcast in wool of different colours, creating a \"barber pole\" pattern, and are sometimes adorned with woolen tassels. Both ends of the rug have narrow, striped flat-woven kilims. Workshops were established in the nineteenth century already around the town of Firuzabad. Rugs with repeating boteh and the Herati pattern, medallion, as well as prayer rug designs resembling the millefleurs patterns of Indian rugs were woven in these manufactures. The Herati design may sometimes appear to be disjointed and fragmented. The Qashqai are also known for their flatweaves, and for their production of smaller, pile-woven saddle bags, flat-woven larger bags (\"mafrash\"), and their Gabbeh rugs.\n\nThe Shishbuluki (\"lit.\": \"six districts\") rugs are distinguished by small, central, lozenge-shaped medallions surrounded by small figures aligned in concentric lozenges radiating from the center. The field is most often red, details are often woven in yellow or ivory. Darashuri rugs are similar to those of the Shishbuluki, but not so finely woven.\n\nAs the truly nomadic way of life has virtually come to an end during the twentieth century, most Qashqai rugs are now woven in villages, using vertical looms, cotton warps, or even an all-cotton foundation. They use a variety of designs associated with the Qashqai tradition, but it is rarely possible to attribute a specific rug to a specific tribal tradition. Many patterns, including the \"Qashqai medallion\" previously thought to represent genuine nomadic design traditions, have been shown to be of town manufacture origin, and were integrated into the rural village traditions by a process of stylization.\n\nThe revival of natural dyeing has had a major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in Shiraz during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi, particularly Gabbeh rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from Fars province soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.\n\nThe Khamseh (\"lit.\": \"five tribes\") federation was established by the Persian Qajar government in the nineteenth century, to rival the dominant Qashqai power. Five tribal groups of Arab, Persian and Turkic origin were combined, including the Arab tribe, the Basseri, Baharlu, Ainalu, and Nafar tribes. It is difficult to attribute a specific rug to the Khamseh production, and the label \"Khamseh\" is often used as a term of convenience. Dark woolen warps and borders are associated with Arab Khamseh rugs, warps are rarely depressed, the colour scheme is more subdued. Specifically, a stylized bird (\"murgh\") pattern is often seen on rugs attributed to the confederation, arranged around a succession of small, lozenge shaped medallions. Basseri rugs are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color. The Baharlu are a Turkic-speaking tribe settled around Darab, and few carpets are known from this more agricultural region.\n\nThe Lurs live mainly in western and south-western Iran. They are of Indo-European origin. Their dialect is closely related to the Bakhtiari dialect and to the dialect of the southern Kurds. Their rugs have been marketed in Shiraz. The rugs have a dark wool foundation, with two wefts after each row of knots. Knots are symmetrical or asymmetrical. Small compartment designs of repeating stars are often seen, or lozenge-shaped medallions with anchor-like hooks on both ends.\n\nThe Afshar people are a semi-nomadic group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of Kirman in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and allover patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.\n\nThe Beluch people live in eastern Iran. They weave small-format rugs and a variety of bags with dark red and blue colours, often combined with dark brown and white. Camel hair is also used.\n\nCarpets produced in villages are usually brought to a regional market center, and carry the name of the market center as a label. Sometimes, as in the case of the \"Serapi\" rug, the name of the village serves as a label for a special quality. Village carpets can be identified by their less elaborate, more highly stylized designs.\n\nCriteria suggesting village production include:\n\nVillage rugs are more apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as elaborate and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.\n\nTabriz is the market center for the Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the symmetric knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.\n\nMajor production centers in the West are Hamadan, Saruk with its neighbouring town of Arak, Minudasht also known under the trade name Lilihan and Serabend, Maslaghan, Malayer and Feraghan.\n\n\nSince the mid-twentieth century, commercial production started in the villages of Abadeh and Yalameh. Abadeh rugs adopted traditional Qashqai designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. Yalameh carpets more resemble Khamseh designs with hooked medaillons arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.\n\nThe village of Doroksh is known for its carpet production in Eastern Persia. They are characterized by their use of orange dyes, the boteh motif is often seen. Usually, there is only one border. The knots are asymmetric.\n\nTabriz in the West, Kerman in the South, and Mashhad in the Northeast of Iran, together with the central Iranian towns of Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are the main centers of town manufacture.\n\n\nIran exported $517 million worth of hand woven carpets in 2002. Iran's carpet exports amounted to US$635 million in 2004, according to the figures from the state-owned Iran Carpet Company. In October 2006, National Iranian Carpet Center revealed that hand-woven carpets have ranked first in country's non-oil exports and hold the third position among overall exports. Nearly five million workers are engaged in the Iranian carpet industry, making it one of the biggest enterprises in the country.\n\nIn recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing fakes of the original Persian designs as well as genuine cheaper substitutes. Most of the problems facing this traditional art is due to absence of patenting and branding the products as well as reduced quality of raw materials in the local market and the consistent loss of original design patterns. The absence of modern R&D is causing rapid decline in the size as well as market value of this art.\n\nIn 2008, Iran’s exports of hand-woven carpets was $420 million or 30% of the world's market. There are an estimated 1.2 million weavers in Iran producing carpets for domestic markets and international export. Iran exports carpets to more than 100 countries, as hand-woven rugs are one of its main non-oil export items. United States is the single largest importer of Persian hand woven carpets. In 2011, President Obama signed into law an act that greatly enhanced restrictions on Iranian-origin imports, causing the imports of Iranian carpets to be frozen. In January 2016, the sanctions had been lifted and in the first quarter Iran's exports of carpets had amounted to $60 million. The country produces about five million square metres of carpets annually—79 percent of which are sold in international markets. In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing reproductions of the original Iranian designs as well as cheaper substitutes.\n\nThe designs of Persian carpets are copied by weavers from other countries as well. Iran is also the world's largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets, producing three quarters of the world's total output. Though in recent times, this ancient tradition has come under stiff competition from machine-made products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Psychoactive substances may also play a significant part in the development of religion and religious views as well as in rituals.\n\nIn the book \"Inside the Neolithic Mind\", the authors, archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Pearce argue that hallucinogenic drugs formed the basis of neolithic religion and rock art. Similar practices and images are found in some contemporary \"stone-age\" Indigenous peoples in South America using yaje.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek mystery religions employed entheogen, such as the Kykeon central to the Eleusinian Mysteries, to induce a trance or dream state. Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the Delphic Oracle were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground. Their findings are published in \"Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale\".\n\nIn Buddhism the Right View (' / ') can also be translated as \"right perspective\", \"right outlook\" or \"right understanding\", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains the reasons for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the fetters of the mind. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the Pāli and Chinese canons, it is explained thus:\n\nRight livelihood (\"samyag-ājīva\" / \"sammā-ājīva\"). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:\n\nMore concretely today interpretations include \"work and career need to be integrated into life as a Buddhist,\" it is also an ethical livelihood, \"wealth obtained through rightful means\" (Bhikku Basnagoda Rahula) – that means being honest and ethical in business dealings, not to cheat, lie or steal. As people are spending most of their time at work, it’s important to assess how our work affects our mind and heart. So important questions include \"How can work become meaningful? How can it be a support, not a hindrance, to spiritual practice — a place to deepen our awareness and kindness?\"\n\nThe five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:\n\n\nAccording to the fifth precept of the Pancasila, Buddhists are meant to refrain from any quantity of \"fermented or distilled beverages\" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness. In the Pali Tipitaka the precept is explicitly concerned with alcoholic beverages:\n\"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness.\"\n\n\"Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.\"\nHowever, caffeine and tea are permitted, even encouraged for monks of most traditions, as it is believed to promote wakefulness.\n\nGenerally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an enlightened mind. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions.\n\nMany modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of tantric or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle skillful means:\n\nFor example, as part of the ganachakra \"tsok\" ritual (as well as Homa, abhisheka and sometimes drubchen) some Tibetan Buddhists and Bönpos have been known to ingest small amounts of grain alcohol (called \"amrit\" or \"amrita\") as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as part of the ceremony.\n\nAmrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu \"soma\". (The latter which historians often equate with \"Amanita muscaria\" or other \"Amanita\" psychoactive fungi.) Crowley (1996) states:\n\"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between \"The legend about Chakdor\" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan \"chhang\", \"barley beer\") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for beer?\nConversely, in Tibetan and Sherpa lore there is a story about a monk who came across a woman who told him that he must either:\n\nThe monk thought to himself, \"well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself.\" (In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment as part of their goal.)\n\nSo the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the woman and sleep with the goat, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.\n\nThe Vajrayana teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo Rinpoche has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon taking refuge, that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. Bhikkus and Bhikkunis (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the ten vows as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than pharmaceuticals taken as medicine.\n\nTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, is known as teetotaler and non-smoker.\n\nThere is some evidence regarding the use of deliriant \"Datura\" seeds (known as \"candabija\") in Dharmic rituals associated with many tantras – namely the \"Vajramahabhairava\", \"Samputa\", \"Mahakala\", \"Guhyasamaja\", \"Tara\" and \"Krsnayamari\" tantras – as well as cannabis and other entheogens in minority Vajrayana sanghas. Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, Datura was:\n\n“employed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed \"passion seeds\" (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like hallucinations.”\n\nIn the \"Profound Summarizing Notes on the Path Presented as the Three Continua\" a Sakya Lamdre text, by Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk (1524-1568), the use of Datura in combination with other substances, is prescribed as part of a meditation practice meant to establish that \"All the phenomena included in apparent existence, samsara and nirvana, are not established outside of one's mind.\"\n\nIan Baker writes that Tibetan terma literature such as the Vima Nyingtik describes \"various concoctions of mind altering substances, including datura and oleander, which can be formed into pills or placed directly in the eyes to induce visions and illuminate hidden contents of the psyche.\"\n\nA book titled \"Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics\" (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic.\n\nZen Buddhism is known for stressing the precepts. In Japan, however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and laypeople alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as sake drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of Japanese culture.\n\nThe Japanese Zen monk and abbot, shakuhachi player and poet Ikkyu was known for his unconventional take on Zen Buddhism: His style of expressing dharma is sometimes deemed \"Red Thread Zen\" or \"Crazy Cloud Zen\" for its unorthodox characteristics. Ikkyu is considered both a heretic and saint in the Rinzai Zen tradition, and was known for his derogatory poetry, open alcoholism and for frequenting the services of prostitutes in brothels. He personally found no conflict between his lifestyle and Buddhism.\n\nThere are several koans (Zen riddles) referencing the drinking of sake (rice wine); for instance Mumonkan's tenth koan titled \"Seizei Is Utterly Destitute\":\n'Seizei said to Sozan, \"Seizei is utterly destitute. Will you give him support?\" Sozan called out: \"Seizei!\" Seizei responded, \"Yes sir?!\" Sozan said, \"You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China, and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips!\"'\nAnother monk, Gudo, is mentioned in a koan called \"Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road\" buying a gallon of sake.\n\nJudaism maintains that people do not own their bodies – they belong to God. As a result, Jews are not permitted to harm, mutilate, destroy or take risks with their bodies, life or health with activities such as taking life-threatening drugs. However, there is no general prohibition against drugs in Judaism, as long as they don't interfere with one's ritual duties and don't cause definite harm, though most Rabbis generally prohibit drugs, in order to avoid social, legal and medical problems in their community.\n\nSpiritual use of various alcoholic beverages, sometimes in very large quantities, is common and well known. In some Jewish communities there is a tradition to get drunk on Purim until they forget the difference between the Hebrew phrases \"Cursed is Haman\" and \"Blessed is Mordechai\", which signified reaching the spiritual world Atzilut where all opposites unite. In many Jewish communities it is customary to drink on Simchat Torah as well. Drinking in small quantities as a mind-altering practice is commonly used during the Farbrengens of the Chabad Hasidim. A large body of Chabad literature refers to the spiritual dangers of drinking, but a few anecdotal references refer to the spirutal power of alcohol, when used for the sake of connecting to God and achieving brotherly love among fellows Jews. The Lubavitcher Rebbe forbade his Chassidim under the age of 40 to consume more than 4 small shots of hard liqueurs. Wine plays a prominent role in many Jewish rituals, most notably the kiddush.\nHasidic Jews often engage in a free ceremony called \"Tisch\" in which drinks such as Vodka are drunk in a group. Drinking is accompanied by singing and the study of the Torah.\n\nSome Hasidic Rabbis, e.g. the Ribnitzer Rebbe used to drink large amounts of Vodka on some special occasions, apparently as a powerful mind-altering method. The Ribnitzer Rebbe also practiced severe sleep deprivation, extremely long meditative prayers and a number of ascetic purification rituals. During his life in the USSR he used to immerse himself every day in ice water.\n\nThe spiritual use of caffeine and nicotine as stimulants is well known in the Hasidic communities. Many stories are told about miracles and spiritual journeys performed by the Baal Shem Tov and other famous Tzaddikim with the help of their smoking pipe. Some people suggest that, judging by the nature of these stories, the tobacco was sometimes mixed with strong mind-altering drugs.\n\nA popular Hasidic saying relates coffee to the Psalmic verse \"Hope in God\". The Hebrew word for \"hope\" (\"Kave\") sounds identical to the Yiddish word for coffee. Coffee is believed to have power to awaken the soul to the worship of God.\n\nSome Kabbalists, including Isaac of Acco and Abraham Abulafia, mention a method of \"philosophical meditation\", which involves drinking a cup of \"strong wine of Avicenna\", which would induce a trance and would help the adept to ponder over difficult philosophical questions. The exact recipe of this wine remains unknown; Avicenna refers in his works to the effects of opium and datura extracts.\n\nRabbi Aryeh Kaplan, a prominent researcher of Jewish meditations, suggested that some medieval Kabbalists may have used some psychedelic drugs Indeed, one can find in Kabbalistic medical manuals cryptic references to the hidden powers of mandrake, harmal and other psychoactive plants, though the exact usage of these powers is hard to decipher.\n\nAccording to Aryeh Kaplan, cannabis was an ingredient in the Holy anointing oil mentioned in various sacred Hebrew texts. The herb of interest is most commonly known as \"kaneh-bosem\" (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם) which is mentioned several times in the Old Testament as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in Holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Many Rastafarians, who use cannabis as a sacrament, identify as Jewish.\n\nAccording to Josephus, the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' was modeled upon the capsule of the Hyoscyamus flower, which he calls \"Saccharus\". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means \"intoxicating\".\n\nBenny Shanon, a psychology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, proposed that Moses may have been high on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time he received the Ten Commandments.\n\nMany Christian denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. Many denominations permit the moderate use of socially and legally acceptable drugs like alcohol, caffeine and tobacco. Some Christian denominations permit smoking tobacco, while others disapprove of it. Many denominations do not have any official stance on drug use, some more-recent Christian denominations (e.g. Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah’s Witnesses) discourage or prohibit the use of any of these substances.\n\nBecause Jesus and many Biblical figures drank wine, most Christian denominations do not require teetotalism. In the Eucharist, wine represents (or among Christians who believe in some form of Real Presence, like the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox churches, actually \"is\") the blood of Christ. Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, that the body and blood of Christ are \"truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms.\" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants orally eat and drink the holy body and blood of Christ Himself as well as the bread and wine (cf. Augsburg Confession, Article 10) in this Sacrament. The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as \"the Sacramental Union.\" It has been inaccurately called \"consubstantiation\", a term which is specifically rejected by most Lutheran churches and theologians.\n\nOn the other hand, some Protestant Christian denominations, such as Baptists and Methodists associated with the temperance movement, encourage or require teetotalism. In some Protestant denomination, grape juice or non-alcoholic wine is used in place of wine to represent the blood of Christ.\nThe best known Western prohibition against alcohol happened in the United States in the 1920s, where concerned prohibitionists were worried about its dangerous side effects. However, the demand for alcohol remained and criminals stepped in and created the supply. The consequences of organized crime and the popular demand for alcohol, led to alcohol being legalized again.\n\nIslam prohibits all drugs that are not medically prescribed. Islam's prohibition of drugs stems from two concerns:\n\nThere are numerous verses in the Qur'an and hadith that ban \"khamr\" (intoxicants, including alcohol). Muhammad said:\nEvery intoxicant is like alcohol, and every (type of) alcohol is prohibited. (Muslim)\n\nThe second reason for banning drugs is that they are believed to have a harmful effect on the body. The Qur'an says,\n\n\"And make not your own hands contribute to your destruction.\" Surah, Al-Baqara, 2: 195\n\nThe Muslim nations of Turkey and Egypt were instrumental in banning opium, cocaine, and cannabis when the League of Nations committed to the 1925 International Convention relating to opium and other drugs (later the 1934 Dangerous Drugs Act). The primary goal was to ban opium and cocaine, but cannabis was added to the list, and it remained there largely unnoticed due to the much more heated debate over opium and coca. The 1925 Act has been the foundation upon which every subsequent policy in the United Nations has been founded. Cannabis use and abuse as an intoxicant was largely unknown in the West at that point, but Islamic leaders have been critical of it since the 13th century.\n\nO You who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid (such abominations) that you may prosper. (5:90)\n\nSatan’s plan is to sow hatred and enmity amongst you with intoxicants and gambling, and to hamper you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not give up? (5:91)\n\nThere are no prohibitions in Islam on alcohol for scientific, industrial or automotive use.\n\nIn spite of these restrictions on substance use, tobacco and caffeine are still widely used throughout many Muslim nations.\n\nBahá'ís are forbidden to drink alcohol or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors. Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden. Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.\n\nMany Rastafari believe cannabis, which they call \"ganja,\" \"the herb,\" or \"Kaya,\" is a sacred gift of Jah. It may be used for spiritual purposes to commune with God, but should not be used profanely. The use of other drugs, however, including alcohol, is frowned upon. Many believe that the wine Jesus/Iyesus drank was not an alcoholic beverage, but simply the juice of grapes or other fruits.\n\nWhile some Rastafari suggest that the Bible may refer to marijuana, it is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of Ancient Israel, and those specializing in the lexicography of the Hebrew Bible, that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., John Allegro in relation to Qumran, 1970) have been \"widely dismissed as erroneous\" (Merlin, 2003). The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was Sula Benet (1967), who claimed that the plant \"kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם\" mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis, although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either \"Acorus calamus\" or \"Cymbopogon citratus\".\n\nA \"reasoning\" is a simple event where the Rastas gather, smoke cannabis (\"ganja\"), and discuss. The person honored by being allowed to light the herb says a short sentence beforehand. The ganja is passed in a clockwise fashion (passing 'pon the lef' han' side) except in times of war, when it is passed counterclockwise. It is used to reason with Jah.\n\nA \"groundation\" (also spelled \"grounation\") or \"binghi\" is a holy day; the name \"binghi\" is derived from \"Nyabinghi\" (literally \"Nya\" meaning \"black\" and \"Binghi\" meaning \"victory\"). Binghis are marked by much dancing, singing, feasting, and the smoking of \"ganja\", and can last for several days.\n\n...thou shalt eat the herb of the field.\n\nGenesis 3.18\n\n...eat every herb of the land.\n\nExodus 10:12\n\nBetter is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.\n\nProverbs 15:17\n\nAccording to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, viewing Cannabis as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. Cannabis use is contrasted with the use of alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.\n\nAlcoholic drinks are commonly used during Asatru blots but non-alcoholic drinks can be substituted.\n\n"}

{"id": "35021303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35021303", "title": "Salome of Armenia", "text": "Salome of Armenia\n\nSalome (, ; born sometime after 297, died about 361) was an Armenian princess from the Arsacid dynasty who was married into the Chosroid Dynasty of Iberia. She was a daughter of King Tiridates III of Armenia and Queen Ashkhen. She had a brother called Khosrov III and an unnamed sister who married St. Husik I, one of the earlier Catholicoi of the Armenian Apostolic Church. She has been canonized by the Armenian and Georgian churches. In Georgian tradition, she is referred to as Salome of Ujarma (სალომე უჯარმელი, \"salome ujarmeli\") after a castle where she is credited to have erected a cross.\n\nHer birthplace in Armenia is unknown and little is known on her early life. Salome was born at an unknown date sometime after 297. Her birth name was \"Beoun\" and changed her name to \"Salome\" after she married Rev II of Iberia. Rev II was the first son of King Mirian III of Iberia and his second wife, Queen Nana of Iberia. Mirian III ruled as King of Iberia from 284 until his death in 361. Rev II co-ruled with his father as co-king from 345 until 361.\n\nMirian III established peaceful relations with the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great and Tiridates III, after Constantine declared Christianity as the official head religion of the Roman Empire. In result of Mirian III’s established relations, he arranged for Rev II to marry Salome in 326. Through marriage, Salome became a Queen of Iberia who co-ruled with Rev II and her in-laws from 345 until 361. Salome bore Rev II two sons: Saurmag II and Trdat, also known as Tiridates. Through her sons, Salome and Rev II would have further descendants.\n\nRev II had an appanage at Ujarma where she lived with her husband and their family. Prior to converting to Christianity, Salome was a follower of Zoroastrianism. Salome in 337 played a role in the conversion of Iberia to Christianity. Salome is a contemporary and is associated with the life of Saint Nino. Saint Nino was the woman who converted Iberians to the Christian faith.\n\nSalome along with Perozhavra of Sivnia a noblewoman who was married to the ruler of the Kartli region, were the helpers and closest companions of Saint Nino. Both women while serving in their imperial roles, succeeded in serving Saint Nino. Saint Nino taught Salome and Perozhavra to pray; the women fasted regularly and both women performed good works. As Salome and Perozhavra were women of influential social status they both assisted Saint Nino in spreading the Christian faith.\n\nAfter the whole Iberian royal family were converted to Christianity by Saint Nino from the orders of Mirian III, Salome erected a cross in Ujarma. When Saint Nino fell ill at the village of Bodbe, Salome and Perozhavra stood by Saint Nino’s bed and wept bitterly as she was dying. On her death bed, Saint Nino told Salome and Perozhavra her life story. Saint Nino died sometime between 338-340.\n\nAs a dedication to honor the memory of Saint Nino; as a continuation of the works of Saint Nino and continue the spread of Christianity in Iberia, Salome and Perozhavra wrote a biography on her life titled \"Saint Nino, The Life of Saint Nino, Enlightener of Georgia\".\n\nSalome died at an unknown date about 361, around the same time that her husband died. Salome, along with Perozhavra, are Saints in the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Georgian Orthodox Church. Their feast day is on 15 January, the day following the commemoration of Saint Nino.\n\n\n"}

One of the earliest Buddhist sculptures from the Indian subcontinent, it has been part of the British Museum's collection since 1842.\n\nThe bejewelled figure of the yakshi was originally installed on one of the gateways that surrounded the Great Stupa at Sanchi, which is said to have contained the relics of the Buddha. In the 1st century AD four toranas or large gateways were erected around the stupa, which served as the main entrances to a circular processional walkway that surrounded the holy building. Made of sandstone, the gateways were elaborately decorated with some of the earliest surviving forms of buddhist iconography. The beam of the western gateway was originally supported by this bracket figure. During the preliminary excavations at the site in the early nineteenth century, it came into the possession of a Mrs Tucker, who donated it to the British Museum in 1842. One of the few figures from the site in the West, it remains one of the most important early Buddhist sculptures in the museum's collection.\n\nCarved in white sandstone, the almost nude figure of the yakshi figure is shown clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its trunk. She is weighed down with ornate jewellery around her neck, waist and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an architectural bracket, supporting a long sandstone beam that once ran above the yakshi's head. The Shalabhanjika Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility symbol associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.\n\n"}
{"id": "755049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=755049", "title": "Satguru", "text": "Satguru\n\nSatguru (), or sadguru, means the true guru. However the term is distinguished from other forms of gurus, such as musical instructors, scriptural teachers, parents, and so on. The satguru is a title given specifically only to an enlightened rishi or saint whose life's purpose is to guide the initiated \"shishya\" on the spiritual path, the summation of which is the realization of the Self through realization of God.\n\nA Satguru has some special characteristics that are not found in any other types of Spiritual Guru. The words 'Sant' and 'Satguru' firstly came into existence from the spiritual ideology of “Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib” in the 15th century. Kabir Sahib says \"Satpurush Ko Jansi, Tiska Satguru Naam|\" meaning the one who has seen the supreme lord of truth- Satya Purush is Satguru. \"Devi dewal jagat mein, kotik poojey koye. Satguru ki pooja kiye, sabb ki pooja hoye\". Kabir Sahib says Worship of Satguru includes in it worship of all deities. In other words, Satguru is physical form of God (Sat Pursh).\n\nThe recommendation says that the first and the foremost qualification of the True Master (Satguru) is that he must have known the True Lord (God) himself.\n\nIn one of Kabir's songs the satguru is described as the real sadhu:\n\n<poem>\nHe is the real Sadhu, who can reveal the form of the Formless to the vision of these eyes;\nWho teaches the simple way of attaining Him, that is other than rites or ceremonies;\nWho does not make you close the doors, and hold the breath, and renounce the world;\nWho makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit wherever the mind attaches itself;\nWho teaches you to be still in the midst of all your activities.\nEver immersed in bliss, having no fear in his mind, he keeps the spirit of union in the midst of all enjoyments.\nThe infinite dwelling of the Infinite Being is everywhere: in earth, water, sky, and air;\nFirm as the thunderbolt, the seat of the seeker is established above the void.\nHe who is within is without: I see Him and none else.\n</poem>\n\nVasistha, Rama's guru, was the satguru in the Treta yuga. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha quotes the \"Yoga Vasistha\":\nA real preceptor is one who can produce blissful sensation in the body of the disciple by their sight, touch, or instructions.\n\nAccording to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a Hindu satguru is always a \"sannyasin\", an unmarried renunciate, but not all writers include this stricture. Tukaram, a Hindu satguru, is known to have had a family, and Moinuddin Chishti also had children. Satguru Kabir had a son, Kamal, who was very devout.\n\nIn Sant Mat and Advait Mat, the living Satguru is considered the path to God-realization.\n\nMeher Baba equated worship of the Satguru with worship of God: \"Consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, each and every creature, each and every human being — in one form or the other — strives to assert individuality. But when eventually man consciously experiences that he is Infinite, Eternal and Indivisible, then he is fully conscious of his individuality as God, and as such experiences Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Power and Infinite Bliss. Thus Man becomes God, and is recognized as a Perfect Master, Satguru, or Kutub. To worship this Man is to worship God.\"\n\n"}

He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1904. He fought in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905.\n\nFrom 1924-1926, Itagaki was a military attaché assigned to the Japanese embassy in China. On his return to Japan, he held a number of staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff during 1926–1927 before being given a field command as commanding officer of the IJA 33rd Infantry Brigade based in China. His brigade was attached to the IJA 10th Division from 1927–1928. Itagaki was then transferred to command the IJA 33rd Infantry Regiment in China from 1928–1929, under the aegis of the Kwantung Army.\n\nItagaki rose to become Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Kwantung Army from 1931, in which capacity he helped plan the 1931 Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria. He was subsequently a military advisor to Manchukuo from 1932–1934.\n\nItagaki became Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army from 1934, and Chief of Staff in 1936.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1938 Itagaki was commander of the IJA 5th Division in China during the early part of the Second Sino-Japanese War. His Division took a leading part in the Battle of Beiping-Tianjin, Operation Chahar, and the Battle of Taiyuan. However, in the Battle of Xuzhou his forces were repulsed during the Battle of Taierzhuang in the vicinity of Linyi that prevented them from coming to the aid of Rensuke Isogai's IJA 10th Division.\n\nRecalled to Japan in 1938, Itagaki briefly served as War Minister from 1938-1939. On December 6, 1938, Itagaki proposed a national policy in accordance with \"Hakko Ichiu\" (Expansion) at the Five Ministers Conference, which was the Japanese highest decision making council, and the council made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the Jews in Japan, Manchuria, and China as Japanese national policy.\n\nItagaki returned to China again as chief of staff of the China Expeditionary Army from 1939-1941. However, the defeat of Japanese forces against the Soviet Red Army at Nomonhan in the summer of 1939 was a major blow to his career, and he was reassigned to command the Chosen Army in Korea, then considered a backwater post.\n\nAs the war situation continued to deteriorate for Japan, the Chosen Army was elevated to the Japanese Seventeenth Area Army in 1945, with Itagaki still as commander in chief. He was then reassigned to the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaya in April 1945. He surrendered Japanese forces in Southeast Asia to British Admiral Louis Mountbatten in Singapore on 12 September 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he was taken into custody by the SCAP authorities and charged with war crimes, specifically in connection with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria, his escalation of the war against the Allies during his term as War Minister, and for allowing inhumane treatment of prisoners of war during his term as commander of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. He was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36 and 54 and was condemned to death in 1948 by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Itagaki was hanged on 23 December 1948 at Sugamo Prison, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first excavated from 1951 by Shehata Adam who was working for the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The temple was again excavated in 1996 by an Austrian mission under Manfred Bietak.\n\nThe temple complex has a layout that is typical of the Middle Kingdom temples. It measures 31 × 41.5 m and was built of mudbricks. According to the first excavator Shehata Adam, the temple was built by king Amenemhat I; a stela found here dates to king Senusret III and it seemed likely that the latter expanded the temple during his own reign.\n\nHowever, the Austrian excavations showed that under the temple stretched an older settlement, which could be dated by pottery to the first half of the 12th dynasty. The temple itself was given a new construction date at c. the mid-12th dynasty, probably at year 5 of Senwosret III, as indicated by the above-mentioned stela. The entrance was on the north side, where the walls were stronger and it seems that they formed a brick pylon. The entrance was at one time perhaps framed by inscribed limestone slabs. The proper temple stood within an open courtyard. On the west side behind the main gate there was small temple, while the main one was opposite the north entrance. Behind the entrance of the temple proper stood a courtyard with perhaps eight columns. Some stone column bases were still found. East and west of this courtyard were on either side two smaller chambers, while on the south side were three cult chapels. This temple was placed within a larger complex. On the east side were excavated remains of storage and administrative buildings.\n\nIn the temple several statues of high officials and of kings were found.\n"}

The work is clearly a false account of Ismaili initiation and was written with the intent of denigrating Ismaili beliefs and practices.\n\nThe actual creator of this text is unknown, but evidence reveals that the author constructed this false account of Ismaili initiation rituals as part of a larger anti-Fatimid propaganda campaign initiated by Abbasid supporters in the 10th century.\n\nBy the tenth century, the Fatimid Caliphate posed a dangerous threat to Abbasid hegemony. In response to this threat, the Abbasid Caliph initiated a large-scale propaganda campaign to challenge the legitimacy of Fatimid Caliphs and to present Ismailism as an un-Islamic heresy that is a danger to Muslims. For example, texts such as the Baghdad Manifesto, which was written and signed by Abbasid scholars, claimed that the Fatimid Caliph-Imams were not descendants of ‘Ali. But other texts, like The Book of the Highest Initiation, were created to appear as genuine Ismaili works.\n\nThe full text of The Book of the Highest Initiation does not survive, but scholar S.M. Stern has reconstructed the text of the pamphlet using several sources.\n\nThe text claims to be a letter written by Fatimid Caliph-Imam Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah to his missionaries working to convert people to Ismailism. It is written as an instruction manual, organized into 35 short paragraphs.\n\nThe account begins with instruction about how to attract converts from a multitude of different backgrounds, including Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Manichaeans, philosophers, and Sunni Muslims.\n\nThe pamphlet instructs that initiates must swear an oath before the missionaries begin to reveal more about their beliefs. It goes on to claim that there are 7 grades of initiation, each one moving closer and closer to total sacrilege. At the final stage, the initiate is “dispensed from the religious practices” altogether.\n\nThe goal of this text was to present Ismailism as a system that leads to complete departure from religion. Its depicts the faith as not only foreign to Islam, but also insidiously dangerous to it.\n\nThe contents of this fabricated text do not reflect the beliefs or practices of Ismailis. It is true, however that the Fatimid da’wah system was engaged in recruiting converts to their faith throughout the dar al-Islam. These Da’is were successful in attracting converts from a wide range of background. The author of The Book of the Highest Initiation, clearly threatened by the success of these missions, intentionally demeans the Ismaili mission and accuses it of manipulating its adherents into disbelief and departure from religion.\n\nThis work has had a large influence on the historical depiction and understanding of Ismailism. The idea that there were ‘7 grades of initiation’ had a particularly long afterlife.\n\nBecause authentic Ismaili documents were available to a general readership until recently, slanderous and fabricated works such as this one were thought to be accurate depictions of Ismaili religion.\n\nS.M. Stern relates that even in the beginning of the 20th century, some Western academics thought that this account revealed the “secret doctrine of the Isma’ilis.”\n\nWith the publication and circulation of authentically Ismaili texts, a wide non-Ismaili readership can now recognize the falsity of this text and appreciate the genuine teachings of the Isma’ili da’wah.\n\n"}

Together with Rushdoony's other writings, the book is the basis of Christian Reconstructionism.\n\nRushdoony expounds the Ten Commandments, adopting a theonomic perspective. He maintains that almost all of the Old Testament civil law is normative for civil governments. Rushdoony provides an outline of a program for establishing a Christian theocracy.\n\nThe theologian John Frame gave \"The Institutes of Biblical Law\" a mixed review in \"Westminster Theological Journal\", writing that the book convinced him that \"Rushdoony is one of the most important Christian social critics alive today\", but also criticizing it on various grounds. Frame credited Rushdoony with cogently arguing against attempts to replace scripture with natural law, with showing a broad and deep knowledge of scripture, and with \"a remarkably detailed grasp of the historical background and present condition of human culture.\" However, he found the book \"a bit rough-hewn\", noting that it \"began as a series of lectures\" and in some respects still resembles one, and that it contained \"considerable repetition\".

Its literal meaning is that returning to the origin.\n\nBefore understanding Unsibanbon further, it is recommended that you understand both Cosmic year and Gaebyeok because Unsibanbon can be explained in more detail in the context of Cosmic year.\n\nThe one constant in the universe is change, and at the time of the Autumn Gaebyeok, the direction of that change is returning to the origin. In our lives we often have the desire to return to our origins whether it means returning home after a long journey, discovering our ethnic and cultural roots, seeking the original purpose of our lives, or returning to the origin of life through meditation. The practice of returning to the origin is discovering who we truly are. It can also entail solving a problem at its root. \n\nAccording to the eastern philosophy, everything is changing and it has its own cycle. It is not difficult to find a cycle. Even our planet earth has its own cycle. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. This cycle is divided with four different seasons, but the principle below is always yin and yang. \n\nWhen yang (positive energy) reaches its end, it must return to its origin. Just like a cannonball shot to the sky directly, it goes up to the sky and at a certain point, it returns to the ground. This action of return at the turning point is called Geukjeukban (克卽反). \n\nAs it is explained above, earth's four seasons can be contained in yin and yang. Spring and summer represent yang (positive energy) and autumn and winter represents yin (negative energy). \n\nWhen summer reaches its end (end of positive energy), just like a cannonball reaches its turning point, it returns to its origin from its farther-reached-end.\n\nThis principle is important because Unsibanbon is happening regardless we acknowledge it or not. Also, it is important to accept and do our action with Unsibanbon this time of our life because it is natural like a shot cannonball returning to the ground from the sky. For this reason, many people meditate to be back to their origin.\n\nQuote from Dojeon\n\n"}
{"id": "27409114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27409114", "title": "Votive crown", "text": "Votive crown\n\nA votive crown is a votive offering in the form of a crown, normally in precious metals and often adorned with jewels. Especially in the Early Middle Ages, they are of a special form, designed to be suspended by chains at an altar, shrine or image. Later examples are more often typical crowns in the style of the period, either designed to be placed on the head of a statue, or re-used in this way after donation.\n\nThere were pagan votive crowns in the ancient world, although these are essentially known only from literary references. Vitruvius records that when Hiero II of Syracuse (died 215 BC) suspected his goldsmith of cheating him over the making of a votive crown for a statue in a temple, for which he had supplied the gold to be used, he asked Archimedes to devise a test. This led Archimedes to his famous \"eureka\" moment, after he realized he could test the crown by comparing its displacement of water to that of the same weight of pure gold; in fact the goldsmith had taken some gold and added silver instead. From other references, it seems that in classical times not just statues of the gods, but also living rulers were presented with crowns in the hope of a favourable response to a request.\n\nThe largest number of surviving examples of the Christian Early Medieval suspended type come from 7th century Visigothic Hispania, especially the Treasure of Guarrazar, from near Toledo, which includes no fewer than twenty-six examples in gold, probably hidden as the Muslim invasion drew near. These were excavated in 1859, and are now divided between the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid and the Musée de Cluny in Paris. However the type was originally Roman or Byzantine, and adopted widely across Europe; nearly all these have been lost, as the objects were naturally extremely vulnerable to theft or looting. These could not be worn, as they were too small and also very often had pendilia, or dangling ornaments on chains hanging from the main crown, often with jewels and perhaps formed into letters which spelled a word or phrase. In the example above, the letters on the pendilia spell \"RECCESVINTHVS REX OFFERET\", or \"King Recceswinth offered this\". These royal donations signified the submission of the monarchy to God. Such objects were probably influenced by the thirty suspended gold crowns placed round the main altar of Hagia Sophia by Justinian, now lost, although the Christian practice is at least as old as the 4th century.\n\nThe main body of suspended crowns is usually flat around the top as well as the bottom rim; some are merely an open framework of flexibly linked metal pieces. Such crowns were probably found widely across Christian Europe in this period; the will of 572 of Aredius, a wealthy friend of Gregory of Tours in Gaul, describes a crown that sounds very similar in form to the Spanish examples. The Iron Crown of Lombardy was perhaps originally made as a votive crown, although it was later used for the coronation of monarchs including Napoleon I. Another gold crown was a source of contention in Constantinople; it was given to the Emperor Maurice (r. 582-602) by his wife Constantina and the dowager Empress Sophia for Easter 601, intended to be worn by him. Instead, he had it suspended by chains over the main altar of Hagia Sophia, upsetting the two ladies. It hung there for nearly two centuries, until Emperor Leo IV coveted it and took it for his own use. In a suspiciously neat story, the crown was richly decorated with carbuncles (jewels), and Leo, who was an iconoclast, soon after died of an outbreak of carbuncles (abscesses), allowing the church to draw the obvious conclusion; other stories said his wife had poisoned him. Another Byzantine votive crown, given by Leo VI (r. 886-912) is now in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice, and is decorated with cloisonné enamels.\n\nIn England, a later medieval source says that King Canute gave a, or \"his\", crown to be placed on or over (\"super caput\") the head of the rood, or large crucifix, in Winchester Cathedral (other notables decorated statues with their jewellery or a sword). The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that Hereward the Wake's men looted a solid gold crown from the head of the rood on the main altar of Peterborough Cathedral in 1070. The Romanesque period saw the height of crowned images of Christ, who is often shown wearing a crown on the cross in wood and metal figures, and manuscript illuminations, and also the introduction of crowned images of the Virgin Mary in the West, as the concept of Mary as Queen of Heaven became increasingly prominent.\n\nA very small late medieval crown now in the Treasury of Aachen Cathedral was made for the famously lavish wedding celebrations in 1468 of Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV of England, and later placed on a statue of the Virgin Mary as a votive offering. It was designed to be worn on top of an elaborate headress and hairstyle, or perhaps on a hennin, and is much smaller than a conventional crown for wearing directly on the head. This is now a rare example of a medieval votive crown that has survived above ground. A few years later, in 1487, the crown that had been used by the pretender Lambert Simnel was given to a statue of the Virgin in Dublin.\n\nCrowns designed solely for statues became increasingly elaborate, especially in the Baroque period, and in the Spanish world; they often have a flat radiating \"sunburst\" around them, in the style used for monstrances, as in the example illustrated. Statues of the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus, of the Infant Jesus of Prague type, are among those most commonly crowned. The Crown of the Andes is a votive crown from Colombia in gold with 450 emeralds, apparently made between the late 16th and 18th centuries, perhaps originally as an offering in thanks for the city of Popayán being spared from a plague. It is now in private hands in the US.\n\nVotive crowns have continued to be produced in Catholic countries in modern times. Often such crowns were kept in the church treasury except for special occasions such as relevant feast-days, when they are worn by the statue. Christ and the Virgin Mary are frequently conventionally shown wearing crowns in Christian art, in subjects such as the Coronation of the Virgin, and are the most common figures to be crowned, but other saints may also be given crowns, especially if the saint was royal, or a martyr, as martyrs are promised crowns in heaven by many texts.\n\nIn Greece a \"tama\" or votive offering of, or depicting, two small wedding crowns, as used locally, indicates a request for a good marriage. Actual crowns used in ceremonies were normally retained by the couple.\n\n"}

Besides being a well-established and acclaimed actor in Brazil, he has achieved widespread international fame for his portrayal of Captain (later Colonel) Roberto Nascimento, protagonist of the highly successful film \"Elite Squad\" (2007) and its sequel, \"\" (2010). He also gained recognition globally playing Spider in the sci-fi film \"Elysium\" (2013) and the lead role of Pablo Escobar in the Netflix series \"Narcos\" from 2015 to 2016, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nMoura was born in Salvador, a city located in Northeast Region of Brazil, but grew up in the small town of Rodelas, Bahia. His mother, Alderiva, was a housewife, and his father, José Moura, was a sergeant in the Brazilian Air Force. At the age of 13, he moved back with his family to Salvador, Bahia.\n\nHe graduated in journalism at Federal University of Bahia but decided to become an actor.\n\nIn 1997 he appeared in the film \"Woman on Top\" starring Penélope Cruz.\n\nIn 2007 he played Captain Nascimento, protagonist of the Golden Bear winner in the 2008 Berlin Film Festival, \"Elite Squad\".\n\nDuring the preparation for the first \"Elite Squad\" film, Wagner and part of the cast were subject to realistic special forces training conducted by Paulo Storani, a former captain of BOPE, the elite squad portrayed in the movie.\nDuring training, Storani was asked by the cast director to help \"develop\" Wagner's aggression for the role, which he attempted to do through repeated sessions of moral abuse. After several days, Storani finally got the reaction he was looking for and a little more. He reportedly made a fictional threat to Wagner's family, particularly mentioning Wagner's newborn to which the actor responded with a punch that fractured Storani's nose. \"That's when Captain Nascimento was born\", said Storani.\n\nIn 2010, he starred in the sequel to \"Elite Squad\", \"\". \n\nIn 2013, he played \"Spider\" in the sci-fi film \"Elysium\". He starred in the Netflix original series \"Narcos\" as the famous drug lord Pablo Escobar. Already fluent in Portuguese and English, he learned Spanish to play the part of Escobar. Moura later reprised the role for a cameo appearance in the \"Narcos\" companion series, \"\".\n\nAs of 2017, it is reported that Wagner is beginning his debut as director of the film \"Marighella\" based on novel \"Marighella: The Guerrilla That Burned Down the World\" about the Bahian marxist guerrilla Carlos Marighella written by journalist Mário Magalhães.\n\nBesides his acting career, Moura is a lyricist and the vocalist of a band named \"Sua Mãe\" (\"Your Mum\"). In 2012, he guest performed as lead vocalist for some Legião Urbana tribute shows, featuring surviving members Marcelo Bonfá and Dado Villa-Lobos.\n\nSince 2001, Moura has been married to journalist and photographer Sandra Delgado, with whom he has three sons: Bem, Salvador, and José. He practices Transcendental Meditation. Moura's native language is Portuguese, but he also fluently speaks both English and Spanish. For his portrayal of Pablo Escobar in \"Narcos\", Moura went back to college to take Spanish for foreigners, to perfect his pronunciation as someone who speaks Spanish as a first language. Moura had to gain over 40 pounds to play the role of Pablo Escobar; after production of the second season of Narcos, Moura decided to lose the weight with an all vegan diet.\n"}
