{"id": "251443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251443", "title": "Asherah", "text": "Asherah\n\nAsherah (), in ancient Semitic religion, is a mother goddess who appears in a number of ancient sources. She appears in Akkadian writings by the name of Ašratu(m), and in Hittite as Aserdu(s) or Asertu(s). Asherah is generally considered identical with the Ugaritic goddess ʼAṯirat.\n\nAsherah is identified as the queen consort of the Sumerian god Anu, and Ugaritic El, the oldest deities of their respective pantheons, as well as Yahweh, the god of Israel and Judah. This role gave her a similarly high rank in the Ugaritic pantheon. Despite her association with Yahweh in extra-biblical sources, Deuteronomy 12 has Yahweh commanding the destruction of her shrines so as to maintain purity of his worship. The name \"Dione\", which like \"<nowiki>'Elat</nowiki>\" means \"Goddess\", is clearly associated with Asherah in the \"Phoenician History\" of Sanchuniathon, because the same common epithet (\"<nowiki>'Elat</nowiki>\") of \"the Goddess par excellence\" was used to describe her at Ugarit. The Book of Jeremiah, written circa 628 BC, possibly refers to Asherah when it uses the title \"Queen of Heaven\" in Jeremiah 7:16-18 and Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25.\n\nSources from before 1200 BC almost always credit Athirat with her full title \"rabat ʾAṯirat yammi\", \"Lady Athirat of the Sea\" or as more fully translated \"she who treads on the sea\". This occurs 12 times in the Baʿal Epic alone. The name is understood by various translators and commentators to be from the Ugaritic root \"ʾaṯr\" \"stride\", cognate with the Hebrew root \"ʾšr\", of the same meaning. There she appears to champion Yam, god of the sea, in his struggle with Ba'al.\n\nHer other main divine epithet was \"qaniyatu ʾilhm\" which may be translated as \"the creatrix of the Gods (Elohim)\". In those texts, Athirat is the consort of the god El; there is one reference to the 70 sons of Athirat, presumably the same as the 70 sons of El. \n\nShe is also called Elat, \"Goddess\", the feminine form of El (compare Allat) and Qodesh, \"holiness\". Athirat in Akkadian texts appears as Ashratum (or, Antu), the wife of Anu, the God of Heaven. In contrast, ʿAshtart is believed to be linked to the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar who is sometimes portrayed as the daughter of Anu while in Ugaritic myth, ʿAshtart is one of the daughters of El, the West Semitic counterpart of Anu.\n\nAmong the Hittites this goddess appears as Asherdu(s) or Asertu(s), the consort of Elkunirsa (\"El the Creator of Earth\") and mother of either 77 or 88 sons. Among the Amarna letters a King of the Amorites is named Abdi-Ashirta, \"Servant of Asherah\".\n\nBeginning during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, a Semitic goddess named Qudshu (\"Holiness\") appears prominently. Some think this is Athirat/Ashratu under her Ugaritic name. This Qudshu seems not to be either ʿAshtart or ʿAnat as both those goddesses appear under their own names and with quite different iconography and appear in at least one pictorial representation along with Qudshu.\n\nBut in the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods in Egypt there was a strong tendency towards syncretism of goddesses and Athirat/Ashratum then seems to have disappeared, at least as a prominent goddess under a recognizable name.\n\nBetween the 10th century BC and the beginning of their exile in 586 BC, polytheism was normal throughout Israel; it was only after the exile that worship of Yahweh alone became established, and possibly only as late as the time of the Maccabees (2nd century BC) that monotheism became universal among the Jews. Some biblical scholars believe that Asherah at one time was worshipped as the consort of Yahweh, the national God of Israel. There are references to the worship of numerous gods throughout Kings: Solomon builds temples to many gods and Josiah is reported as cutting down the statues of Asherah in the temple Solomon built for Yahweh (2 Kings 23:14). Josiah's grandfather Manasseh had erected one such statue (2 Kings 21:7).\n\nFurther evidence includes, for example, an 8th-century combination of iconography and inscriptions discovered at Kuntillet Ajrud in the northern Sinai desert where a storage jar shows three anthropomorphic figures and several inscriptions. The inscriptions found refer not only to Yahweh but to El and Baal, and two include the phrases \"Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah\" and \"Yahweh of Teman and his Asherah.\" The references to Samaria (capital of the kingdom of Israel) and Teman (in Edom) suggest that Yahweh had a temple in Samaria, while raising questions about the relationship between Yahweh and Kaus, the national god of Edom. The \"Asherah\" is most likely a cultic object, although the relationship of this object (a stylised tree perhaps) to Yahweh and to the goddess Asherah, consort of El, is unclear. It has been suggested that the Israelites might have considered Asherah as a consort of Baal due to the anti-Asherah ideology which was influenced by the Deuteronomistic History at the later period of Monarchy. In another inscription called \"Yahweh and his Asherah\", there appears a cow feeding its calf. If Asherah is to be associated with Hathor/Qudshu, it can then be assumed that it is the cow that is being referred to as Asherah.\n\nWilliam Dever's book \"Did God Have a Wife?\" adduces further archaeological evidence—for instance, the many female figurines unearthed in ancient Israel, (known as Pillar-Base Figurines)—as supporting the view that in Israelite folk religion of the monarchal period, Asherah functioned as a goddess and consort of Yahweh and was worshiped as the Queen of Heaven, for whose festival the Hebrews baked small cakes.\n\nThe word Asherah is translated in Greek as \"alsos\", grove, or \"alse\", groves, or occasionally by \"dendra\", trees; Vulgate in Latin provided \"lucus\" or \"nemus\", a grove or a wood (thus KJV Bible uses \"grove\" or \"groves\" with the consequent loss of Asherah's name and knowledge of her existence to English language readers of the Bible over some 400 years). The association of Asherah with trees in the Hebrew Bible is very strong. For example, she is found under trees (1K 14:23; 2K 17:10) and is made of wood by human beings (1K 14:15, 2K 16:3-4). Trees described as being an asherah or part of an asherah include grapevines, pomegranates, walnuts, myrtles, and willows (Danby:1933:90,176).\n\nSome scholars have found an early link between Asherah and Eve, based upon the coincidence of their common title as \"the mother of all living\" in Genesis 3:20 through the identification with the Hurrian mother goddess Hebat. Asherah was also given the title \"Chawat\" from which the name \"Hawwah\" in Aramaic and the biblical name Eve are derived.\n\nAsherah poles, which were sacred trees or poles, are mentioned many times in the Hebrew Bible. The Asherah pole was prohibited by the Deuteronomic Code which commanded \"You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the Lord your God\".\n\nA stele, now located at the Louvre, discovered by Charles Huber in 1883 in the ancient oasis of Tema, northwestern Arabia, and believed to date to the time of Nabonidus's retirement there in 549 BC, bears an inscription in Aramaic which mentions Ṣalm of Maḥram, Shingala, and Ashira as the gods of Tema.\n\nThis Ashira might be Athirat/Asherah. Since Aramaic has no way to indicate Arabic \"th\", corresponding to the Ugaritic \"th\" (transliterated as \"ṯ\"), if this is the same deity, it is not clear whether the name would be an Arabian reflex of the Ugaritic \"Athirat\" or a later borrowing of the Hebrew/Canaanite \"Asherah\".\n\nThe Arabic root \"ʼṯr\" is similar in meaning to the Hebrew indicating \"to tread\" used as a basis to explain the name of Ashira as \"lady of the sea\", specially that the Arabic root \"ymm\" also means \"sea\". It has also been recently suggested that the goddess name Athirat might be derived from the passive participle form, referring to \"one followed by (the gods)\", that is, \"pro-genitress or originatress\", corresponding with Asherah's image as 'the mother of the gods' in Ugaritic literature.\n\n\n\n"}

Its official religion is the doctrine of the Twelver Jaafari School. Iran's law against blasphemy derives from Sharia. Blasphemers are usually charged with \"spreading corruption on earth\", or mofsed-e-filarz, which can also be applied to criminal or political crimes. The law against blasphemy complements laws against criticizing the Islamic regime, insulting Islam, and publishing materials that deviate from Islamic standards. The regime uses these laws to persecute religious minorities such as the Sunni, Bahai, Sufi, and Christians and to persecute dissidents and journalists. Persecuted individuals are subject to surveillance by the \"religious police,\" harassment, prolonged detention, mistreatment, torture, and execution. The courts have acquitted vigilantes who killed in the belief that their victims were engaged in un-Islamic activities.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, the singer Mohsen Namjoo was sentenced \"in absentia\" to a five-year jail term for ridiculing the Quran in a song.

The students were associated with a newspaper which had published articles suggesting that no humans were infallible, including Prophet Muhammad.\n\nIn October 2006, Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, a senior Shia cleric who advocates the separation of religion and state, and a number of his followers were arrested and imprisoned after clashes with riot police. He and seventeen of his followers were initially sentenced to death, but the death sentences were later withdrawn. In August 2007, he was sentenced to one year in prison in Tehran followed by another ten years in prison in another part of the country.\n\nIn 2002, Hashem Aghajari, a member of the Shia majority, a history professor, and a veteran who lost a leg in 1980-88 war against Iraq, gave a speech in which he called for political reforms. The authorities arrested Aghajari, charged him with blasphemy, and jailed him. A court convicted Aghajari, and made death the penalty. In June 2004, the Supreme Court substituted a charge of \"insulting religious values\" for the blasphemy charge, and imposed a jail term of three years among other penalties. Aghajari was released on bail on 31 July 2004.\n\nIn 1999, Iran put on trial for “insulting the Prophet, his descendants, and the Ayatollah Khomeini,” and for other charges, Abdollah Nouri, the former Minister of the Interior in the Rafsanjani and Khatami cabinets. In 1999, Nouri was the publisher of a daily newspaper that discussed the limits on the Supreme Leader's powers, the rights of unorthodox clerics and groups to air their views, the right of women to divorce, and whether laughing and clapping were un-Islamic. On 27 November 1999, the Special Court for the Clergy found Nouri guilty, and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment and a fine.

{"id": "786558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786558", "title": "Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism", "text": "Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism\n\nCapital and corporal punishment in Judaism has a complex history which has been a subject of extensive debate. While the Bible and the Talmud specify capital and corporal punishments, including death by stoning, decapitation, burning, and strangulation for some crimes, these punishments were substantially modified during the rabbinic era, primarily by adding additional requirements for conviction. According to Talmudic law, the competence to apply capital punishment ceased with the destruction of the Second Temple. The Mishnah states that a sanhedrin that executes one person in seven years — or seventy years, according to Eleazar ben Azariah — is considered bloodthirsty. During the Late Antiquity, the tendency of not applying the death penalty at all became predominant in Jewish courts. In practice, where medieval Jewish courts had the power to pass and execute death sentences, they continued to do so for particularly grave offenses, although not necessarily the ones defined by the law. While it was recognized that the use of capital punishment in the post-Second Temple era went beyond the biblical warrant, the Rabbis who supported it believed that it could be justified by other considerations of Jewish law. Whether Jewish communities ever practiced capital punishment according to rabbinical law and whether the Rabbis of the Talmudic era ever supported its use even in theory has been a subject of historical and ideological debate.\n\nThe 12th-century Jewish legal scholar Maimonides stated that \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\" Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice.\" Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.\n\nThe position of Jewish Law on capital punishment often formed the basis of deliberations by Israel's Supreme Court. It has been carried out by Israel's judicial system only once, in the case of Adolf Eichmann.\n\nWarrants for the infliction of capital punishment, as opposed to private retribution or vengeance, are found in the Pentateuchal codes for the commission of any one of the following crimes: adultery (Lev. xx. 10; Deut. xxii. 22); bestiality (Ex. xxii. 18 [A. V. 19]; Lev. xx. 15); blasphemy (Lev. xxiv. 16); false evidence in capital cases (Deut. xix. 16-19); false prophecy (Deut. xiii. 6, xviii. 20); idolatry, actual or virtual (Lev. xx. 2; Deut. xiii. 7-19, xvii. 2-7); incestuous or unnatural connections (Lev. xviii. 22, xx. 11-14); insubordination to supreme authority (Deut. xvii. 12); kidnapping (Ex. xxi. 16; Deut. xxiv. 7); licentiousness of a priest's daughter (Lev. xxi. 9); murder (Ex. xxi. 12; Lev. xxiv. 17; Num. xxxv. 16 et seq.); rape committed on a betrothed woman (Deut. xxii. 25); striking or cursing a parent, or otherwise rebelling against parental authority (Ex. xxi. 15, 17; Lev. xx. 9; Deut. xxi. 18-21); Sabbath-breaking (Ex. xxxi. 14, xxxv. 2; Num. xv. 32-36); witchcraft and augury (Ex. xxii. 17; Lev. xx. 27).\n\nOnly in comparatively few instances is the particular mode of death incurred by the commission of a crime prescribed. Blasphemy, idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, witchcraft, prostitution by a betrothed virgin, or deceiving her husband at marriage as to her chastity (Deut. xxii. 21), and the rebellious son are, according to the Pentateuchal laws, to be punished with death by stoning; bigamous marriage with a wife's mother and the prostitution of a priest's daughter are punished by burning; communal apostasy is punished by the sword. With reference to all other capital offenses, the law ordains that the perpetrator shall die a violent death, occasionally adding the expression, \"His (their) blood shall be upon him (them).\" This expression, as we shall see presently, post-Biblical legislation applies to death by stoning. The Bible speaks also of hanging (Deut. xxi. 22), but, according to the rabbinical interpretation, not as a mode of execution, but rather of exposure after death (Sanh. vi. 4, 75b).\n\nThe harshness of the death penalty indicated the seriousness of the crime. Jewish philosophers argue that the whole point of corporal punishment was to serve as a reminder to the community of the severe nature of certain acts. This is why, in Jewish law, the death penalty is more of a principle than a practice. The numerous references to a death penalty in the Torah underscore the severity of the sin rather than the expectation of death. This is bolstered by the standards of proof required for application of the death penalty, which has always been extremely stringent (Babylonian Talmud Makkoth 7b). The \"Mishnah\" (tractate Makkoth 1:10) outlines the views of several prominent first-century CE Rabbis on the subject:\n\"A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called a murderous one. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says 'Or even once in 70 years.' Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiba said, 'If we had been in the Sanhedrin no death sentence would ever have been passed'; Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: 'If so, they would have multiplied murderers in Israel.'\"\nThe Sanhedrin stopped issuing capital punishment either after the Second Temple was destroyed in 70 CE or alternatively, according to passages in the Talmud and New Testament, in 30 CE when the Sanhedrin were moved out of the Hall of Hewn Stones. Other sources such as Josephus and other passages in the New Testament disagree. The issue is highly debated because of the relevancy to the New Testament trial of Jesus. Ancient rabbis did not like the idea of capital punishment, and interpreted the texts in a way that made the death penalty virtually non-existent. The idea of killing someone for a crime they commit is frowned upon in the Jewish tradition.\n\nIt was almost impossible to inflict the death penalty because the standards of proof were so high. As a result, convictions for capital offense were rare in Judaism. The standards of evidence in capital cases include:\n\nThe following is a list by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah (Hilchoth Sanhedrin Chapter 15) of which crimes carry a capital punishment.\n\n\nRabbinical courts have given up the ability to inflict any kind of physical punishment, and such punishments are left to the civil court system to administer. The modern institution of the death penalty, at least as practiced in the United States, is opposed by the major rabbinical organizations of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism.\n\nOrthodox Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan wrote: \"In practice, ... these punishments were almost never invoked, and existed mainly as a deterrent and to indicate the seriousness of the sins for which they were prescribed. The rules of evidence and other safeguards that the Torah provides to protect the accused made it all but impossible to actually invoke these penalties ... the system of judicial punishments could become brutal and barbaric unless administered in an atmosphere of the highest morality and piety. When these standards declined among the Jewish people, the Sanhedrin ... voluntarily abolished this system of penalties.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, in a letter to then New York Governor Hugh Carey states:\n\"One who murders because the prohibition to kill is meaningless to him and he is especially cruel, and so too when murderers and evil people proliferate they [the courts] would [should?] judge [capital punishment] to repair the issue [and] to prevent murder – for this [action of the court] saves the state.\"\n\nIn Conservative Judaism the death penalty was the subject of a responsum by its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which has gone on record as opposing the modern institution of the death penalty: \"The Talmud ruled out the admissibility of circumstantial evidence in cases which involved a capital crime. Two witnesses were required to testify that they saw the action with their own eyes. A man could not be found guilty of a capital crime through his own confession or through the testimony of immediate members of his family. The rabbis demanded a condition of cool premeditation in the act of crime before they would sanction the death penalty; the specific test on which they insisted was that the criminal be warned prior to the crime, and that the criminal indicate by responding to the warning, that he is fully aware of his deed, but that he is determined to go through with it. In effect this did away with the application of the death penalty. The rabbis were aware of this, and they declared openly that they found capital punishment repugnant to them… There is another reason which argues for the abolition of capital punishment. It is the fact of human fallibility. Too often we learn of people who were convicted of crimes and only later are new facts uncovered by which their innocence is established. The doors of the jail can be opened, in such cases we can partially undo the injustice. But the dead cannot be brought back to life again. We regard all forms of capital punishment as barbaric and obsolete.\"\n\nSince 1959, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) and the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) have formally opposed the death penalty. The CCAR resolved in 1979 that \"both in concept and in practice, Jewish tradition found capital punishment repugnant\" and there is no persuasive evidence \"that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime.\"\n\n\n"}

According to psychical researchers the correspondences when put together convey intelligible messages either from spirits of the dead or telepathy.\n\nSkeptics have written the correspondences can be explained by chance or self-delusion and is a case of researchers looking for connections in random or meaningless data.\n\nMary Catherine Lyttleton fell in love with Arthur James Balfour in 1875, but fell ill and died on Palm Sunday, 21 March 1875, before Balfour could declare his intent. According to the SPR, in the next 30 years thousands of fragmentary messages from numerous mediums, when considered as a whole, seem to indicate Lyttleton was trying to communicate with Balfour, aided by members of the SPR Edmund Gurney, Henry Sidgwick and Frederic W. H. Myers.\n\nIn 1891, Myers wrote a message on a piece of paper then sealed it in an envelope. Myers gave the envelope to Oliver Lodge with instructions to open it before witnesses after his death if the message from the paper should be received through a medium. Myers died in 1901, and various mediums were organised into concurrent sittings at locations very far apart, and notes were made of the words and phrases, and the automatic writings thus obtained. The messages were unintelligible individually and to individual mediums, but over a long period and many seances, it was claimed by the SPR that there was purpose in the correspondences, indicating an intelligent entity was behind them. The principal recipients of the messages included Mrs Margaret Verrall and her daughter Helen; Mrs Winifred Coombe Tennant, who practised as a medium under the name \"Mrs Willett\" and Mrs Alice Fleming, sister of Rudyard Kipling, who practised as \"Mrs Holland\".\n\nIt was alleged Myer's spirit communicated through Mrs Verrall on 13 July 1904 by producing a manuscript which made reference to Myers' message. When the manuscript was examined the message was incorrect and it also referred to the place where the envelope was kept which was completely wrong. On 13 December 1904, Oliver Lodge arranged a meeting for members for the Society for Psychical Research. The contents of the envelope were made known to those present. A report was published by the Society's journal in 1905 which stated, \"It has, then, to be reported that this one experiment has completely failed and it cannot be denied that the failure is disappointing.\"\n\nOther mediums involved in cross-correspondences have included Mina Crandon, Leonora Piper and George Valiantine. Both Crandon and Valiantine were exposed as frauds.\n\nThe psychologist Amy Tanner examined the cross-correspondences in detail. Tanner noted that whilst the cross-correspondences were taking place, the SPR allowed Mrs Verrall and her daughter to frequent sittings with Mrs Piper and this was a possible source of sensory leakage. She concluded that the psychical researchers had not taken into account the association of ideas, ignored the similarity between English and Latin and had used any interpretation to make a meaning out of the words.\n\nThe psychical researcher Eric Dingwall wrote that the Society for Psychical Research refused outside investigation with relation to the cross-correspondences and researchers not connected with the case could not examine the original documents. The identity of some of the mediums was kept secret and the public was only permitted to know who Mrs. Willett was after she had died.\n\nEdward Clodd wrote that the explanation for the cross-correspondences was the subconscious mind of the medium not spirits. According to Clodd many of the messages were \"inconsequential rubbish\". Mrs Verrall was a well-educated classicist who had studied Latin and Greek with her husband. Clodd suggested that Mrs Willet had communicated with Verrall and looked up references in classical lore.\n\nIvor Lloyd Tuckett noted that \"in practically every cross-correspondence, there is vagueness and incorrectness of detail, allowing plenty of room for biased interpretation.\" Criticism of the cross-correspondences also came from the psychiatrist Charles Arthur Mercier. He studied two cases and noted they could \"be twisted into any appearance \nof referring to the same thing, or of emanating from the same source.\"\n\nIn 1986, the magician John Booth who examined the cross-correspondences suggested that they could be explained by chance, law of averages, deliberate fraud or self-delusion.\n\nSkeptical author John Grant commenting in 2015 did not find the cross-correspondences as reliable evidence for an afterlife, and warned readers of falling into the trap of \"intellectual pareidolia\".\n\n"}

He is all-forgiving and all-merciful.\" Another verses about this word are the 36th verse of Ar-Rum, 49th of Fussilat, and 28th verse of Ash-Shura.\n"}

He was son of Diwan Sawan Mal who was appointed as governor of the city of Multan by the Sikh Emperor, Maharaja Ranjit Singh. His territory included Southern Punjab region of Jhang. After the annexation of Lahore palace by the British, the Sikh Army fought valiantly in the two Anglo-Sikh wars. Diwan Mulraj was part of the last Sikh stand against the British and was supported by Sikh Saint Bhai Maharaj Singh, Sikh Sardars from West Punjab, and Punjabi Muslims. After British captured Multan, Diwan Mulraj was imprisoned and died in a jail near Calcutta, India.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh conquered Multan. The Afghan ruler of Multan, \"Muzaffar Khan Saddozai\" was defeated and killed. His death marked the end of Afghan rule in Multan. Maharaja Ranjit Singh appointed Diwan Sawan Mal, a Punjabi Khatri, who was known to be one of the most able administrator of the Sikh empire. He is well known for agricultural reforms and spread of Sikhism in Multan. His first son, Mulraj, became the Governor of Multan, after the assassination of Sawan Mal at the hands of Afghans.\n\nOn 18 April, Vans Agnew and another officer, Lieutenant Anderson from the East India Company's Bombay Army, arrived outside Multan with a small escort of Gurkhas to take control of Multan from the Sikhs. The next day, Mulraj was to present the keys of the city to the two British officers. As the two officers began to ride out of the citadel, a soldier from Mulraj's army attacked Vans Agnew. This may have been the sign for a concerted attack, as a mob surrounded and attacked them. Mulraj's troops either stood by, or joined the mob. Both officers were wounded, and took refuge in a Mosque outside the city, where Anderson wrote a plea for help. Mulraj had probably not been a party to the conspiracy among his own troops. He nevertheless regarded himself as committed to rebellion by their actions. The poet Hakim Chand recites, \"Then the mother of Mulraj spoke to him reminding him of the Sikh Gurus and martyrs: \"I will kill myself leaving a curse on your head. Either lead your men to death or get out of my sight; (and) I shall undertake the Khalsa army and go to the battle ...\". She tied a bracelet on his wrist and sent him to the battle. Next morning, the mob hacked the two British officers to death. Mulraj presented Vans Agnew's head to Khan Singh and told him to take it back to Currie at Lahore.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulraj was reinforced by several other regiments of the Khalsa, the former army of the Sikh kingdom, which rebelled or deserted. A Sikh saint Maharaj Singh played a key role in directing deserted Khalsa soldiers to Multan in support of Mulraj. He also took other measures to strengthen his defences, digging up guns which had previously been buried and enlisting more troops.\n\nIn early June, Edwardes began to lead an army against Multan. On 18 June, his leading troops (Pashtun irregulars) crossed the Chenab River on a ferry boat. They were engaged by Mulraj's artillery and forced to take cover for several hours. Mulraj's infantry and cavalry began to advance but Edwardes was reinforced by two regiments under Colonel Van Cortlandt[disambiguation needed], an Anglo-Indian soldier of fortune. Van Cortlandt's artillery caused heavy losses among the Multani troops and Edwardes's Pashtuns counter-attacked. Mulraj's forces retreated to Multan, having suffered 500 casualties and lost six guns.\n\nThe East India Company's Bengal Army under General Whish began the siege of Multan. but it was too small to encircle the city, Currie decided to reinforce them with a substantial detachment of the Khalsa under Sher Singh Attariwalla. Sher Singh's father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, was openly preparing to revolt in Hazara to the north of the Punjab. On 14 September, Sher Singh also rebelled against the East India Company and joined the revolt. However, Dewan Mulraj and Sher Singh could not agree to combine their forces and fought separately against the British.\n\nOn 27 December, Whish ordered four columns of troops to attack the suburbs of the city. Mulraj's forces were driven back into the city, and Whish's force set up batteries 500 yards from the city walls causing great damage in the city. On 30 December, the main magazine in the citadel exploded, killing 800 of the defenders. Mulraj nevertheless maintained his fire and sent a defiant message to Whish, stating that he still had enough powder to last a year. He attempted to mount a sortie against the besiegers on 31 December but this was driven back. \n\nWhish ordered a general assault on 2 January 1849. The attackers successfully scaled the breaches, and the battle became a bloody house-to-house fight in the city, in which many defenders and civilians were killed indiscriminately. Mulraj offered to surrender if his life was spared, but Whish insisted on unconditional surrender, and on 22 January, Mulraj gave himself up, with 550 men. The British gained vast quantities of loot. Mulraj's treasury was worth three million pounds, a huge sum for the time. There was also much looting in the town, by both British and Indian soldiers. With the fall of Multan, Whish's army was able to reinforce the main Bengal Army force under Sir Hugh Gough. Whish's heavy guns were decisive at the Battle of Gujarat, which effectively broke Sher Singh's and Chattar Singh's armies and ended the Second Anglo-Sikh War.\n\nMulraj was placed on trial for the murders of Vans Agnew and Anderson. He was cleared of premeditated murder, but was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact that he had rewarded the murderers and openly used the deaths as pretext for rebellion. Mulraj was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to exile for life. He died in the Buxor jail near Calcutta, Bengal from an ailment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13941961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13941961", "title": "History of Shaktism", "text": "History of Shaktism\n\nThe roots of Shaktism – a Hindu denomination that focuses worship upon \"Shakti\" or \"Devi\", the Hindu Divine Mother – penetrate deeply into India's prehistory. From the Devi's earliest known appearance in Indian Paleolithic settlements more than 20,000 years ago, through the refinement of her cult in the Indus Valley Civilization, her partial eclipse during the Vedic period, and her subsequent resurfacing and expansion in Sanskrit tradition, it has been suggested that, in many ways, \"the history of the Hindu tradition can be seen as a reemergence of the feminine.\"\n\nShaktism as it exists today began with the literature of the Vedic Age, further evolved during the formative period of the Hindu epics, reached its full flower during the Gupta Age (300-700 CE), and continued to expand and develop thereafter. Devi Mahatmya, an important text in Shaktism, was composed around fifth or sixth century CE. Here, for the first time, \"the various mythic, cultic and theological elements relating to diverse female divinities were brought together in what has been called the 'crystallization of the Goddess tradition.'\" Other important texts include the \"Lalita Sahasranama\", the \"Devi Gita\", Adi Shankara's \"Saundaryalahari\" and the Tantras.\n\nRecent developments related to Shaktism include the emergence of Bharat Mata (\"Mother India\") symbolism, the increasing visibility of Hindu female saints and gurus, and the prodigious rise of the \"new\" goddess Santoshi Mata following release of the Indian film \"Jai Santoshi Maa\" (\"Hail to the Mother of Satisfaction\") in 1975. As one commentator notes:\n\n\"Today just as 10,000 years ago, images of the Goddess are everywhere in India. You'll find them painted on the sides of trucks, pasted to the dashboards of taxis, postered on the walls of shops. You'll often see a color painting of the Goddess prominently displayed in Hindu homes. Usually the picture is hung high on the wall so you have to crane your neck backward, looking up toward her feet. [...] In India, Goddess worship is not a 'cult,' it's a religion, [...] an extraordinarily spiritually and psychologically mature tradition. Millions of people turn every day with heartfelt yearning to the Mother of the Universe.\"\nTo date, the earliest Mother Goddess figurine unearthed in India (near Allahabad) belongs to the Upper Paleolithic, and carbon-dates to approximately 20,000 - 23,000 BCE. Also belonging to that period are some collections of colorful stones marked with natural triangles. Discovered near Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, they are similar to stones still worshiped as Devi by tribal groups in the area. Moreover, they \"may demonstrate connections to the later Tantric use of \"yantras\", in which triangles manifest a vital symbolism connected with fertility.\"\nThousands of female statuettes dated as early as c. 5500 BCE have been recovered at Mehrgarh, one of the most important Neolithic sites in world archeology, and a precursor to the great Indus Valley Civilization. In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, major cities of the Indus valley civilization, female figurines were found in almost all households indicating the presence of cults of goddess worship. Most figurines are naked and have elaborate coiffures. Some figurines have ornaments or horns on the head and a few are in poses that expose the genitals. Several small circular objects with holes in middle, possibly representing yoni, were also found. The objects and images found suggest that the goddess cults of Indus valley civilization were associated with fertility. A seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle. It probably suggests an association between the female figure and crops, and possibly implies a ritual sacrifice where the blood of the victim was offered to the goddess for ensuring agricultural productivity.\n\nBhattacharya links the archaeological discoveries of Indus valley civilization to present-day Shaktism of later Hindu religion. Other scholars like David Kinsley and Lynn Foulston acknowledge some similarities between the cult of goddess in Indus valley civilization and Shaktism, but think that there is no conclusive evidence that proves a link between them.\n\nAccording to Bhattacharya: \n\nThe later Indus Valley population centers of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (c. 3300 - 1600 BCE) \"sheltered a mixed population, the major section of which came from the adjacent villages to seek their fortune in the great cities. They also brought with them their own cults and rituals, the Female Principle of the agricultural communities, which formed the basis of Harappan [i.e., Indus Valley] religion. Some of the cults and rituals of the simpler peoples were adopted by the higher, but probably not in the original, unsophisticated form. They were given an aristocratic colour [that reflected their worshipers' more] elevated position in the society.\"\nAs these philosophies and rituals evolved in the northern reaches of the subcontinent, additional layers of Goddess-focused tradition were expanding outward from the sophisticated Dravidian civilizations of the south. The \"cult of the Female Principle was a major aspect of Dravidian religion,\" Bhattacharyya notes. \"The concept of Shakti was an integral part of their religion and their female deities eventually came to be identified with the Puranic Parvati, Durga or Kali. [...] The cult of the \"Sapta Matrika\", or Seven Divine Mothers, which is an integral part of the Shakta religion, may [also] be of Dravidian inspiration.\"\n\nShaktism as we know it began with the literature of the Vedic Age; further evolved during the formative period of the Hindu epics; reached its full flower during the Gupta Age (300-700 CE), and continued to expand and develop thereafter.\n\nAs the Indus Valley Civilization slowly declined and dispersed, its peoples mixed with other groups to eventually give rise to the Vedic Civilization (c. 1500 - 600 BCE). Female divinity continued to have a place in belief and worship, but generally in a more subordinate role, with goddesses serving principally as consorts to the great gods.\n\nThe most important of the female deities mentioned in the Vedas is Ushas. Number of hymns in the Vedas are dedicated exclusively to her. The three divine mothers mentioned in the Rig Veda from whom the Vedic gods took their birth are Aditi, Prithvi and Saraswati. Prithvi continued to exist in later Hinduism as Bhudevi (goddess of the earth). According to Bhattacharyya, \"it may be said that Aditi was the most ancient mother of the gods, whose features [had already become] obscure even in the Vedic Age. [...] The Harappan [Mother Goddess] was probably reflected in [the Vedic] conception of Aditi, thought to be a goddess of yore even in the \"Rigveda\" itself.\" Indeed, Vedic descriptions of Aditi are vividly reflected in the countless so-called \"Lajja Gauri\" idols (depicting a faceless, lotus-headed goddess in birthing posture) that have been worshiped throughout India for millennia:\n\n\"In the first age of the gods, existence was born from non-existence. The quarters of the sky were born from she who crouched with legs spread. The earth was born from she who crouched with legs spread, and from the earth the quarters of the sky were born.\"\nThe historically recurrent theme of the Devi's all-encompassing, pan-sexual nature arises explicitly for the first time in such declarations as: \"Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the air, Aditi is all gods. [...] Aditi is the Mother, the Father, and the Son. Aditi is whatever shall be born.\"\n\nAlso significant is the appearance, in the famous Rig Vedic hymn \"Devi Sukta\", of two of Hinduism's most widely known and beloved goddesses: \"Vāc\", identified with the present-day Saraswati; and \"Srī\", now better known as Lakshmi. In the hymn, still recited by thousands of Hindus each day, the Goddess unambiguously declares:\n\n\"I am the Sovereign Queen; the treasury of all treasures; the chief of all objects of worship; whose all-pervading Self manifests all gods and goddesses; whose birthplace is in the midst of the causal waters; who in breathing forth gives birth to all created worlds, and yet extends beyond them, so vast am I in greatness.\"\n\nThe great Kena Upanishad (c. 750-500 BCE) tells an early tale in which the Devi appears as the \"shakti\", or essential power, of the Supreme Brahman. It begins with the Vedic trinity of Agni, Vayu and Indra boasting and posturing in the flush of a recent victory over a demon hoard – until they suddenly find themselves bereft of divine power in the presence of a mysterious \"yaksha\", or forest spirit. When Indra tries to approach and question the \"yaksha\", it disappears, replaced by the Devi in the form of a \"highly adorned\" \"yakshini\":\n\n\"It was Uma, the daughter of Himavat. Indra said to her, 'Who was that yaksha?' She replied, 'It is Brahman. It is only through the victory of Brahman that you have thus become great.' After that Indra and the \"devas\" realized the Truth [...] having known Brahman through such direct experience.\" \nSignificantly, Bhattacharyya notes that \"a study of the extant \"yaksha\" and \"yakshini\" images [of this period] shows that the later images of the gods and goddesses were shaped after them.\"\n\nThe canonical \"Shakta Upanishads\" are much more recent, most dating between the 13th and 18th centuries, and generally relate to sectarian matters of Srividya worship. While their archaic Sanskrit usages \"tend to create the impression that [they] belong to a hoary past, not one of the verses cast in the Vedic mold can be traced to a Vedic source.\"\n\nWhile \"no goddess of a purely Shakta character\" is mentioned in the great Vaishnava epic \"Ramayana\" (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE), the \"Mahabharata\" (c. 400 BCE - 400 CE) is full of references that confirm the ongoing vitality of Shakta worship.\nDevi is also mentioned in Devyatharva sookta ,Triporopanishad,and there are many verses in vedas regarding various forms of goddess. The main Goddess of the pantheon held as Durga the central goddess. Mahabharat The Great Epic thus refers to the goddess residing in the Vindhyas, the goddess who is fond of wine and meat (\"\") and worshiped by the hunting peoples.\" The ongoing process of Goddess-worshiping indigenous peoples \"coming into the fold of the caste system [also brought with it] a religious reflex of great historical consequence.\"\nHowever, it is in the Epic's \"Durga Stotras\" that \"the Devi is first revealed in her true character, [comprising] numerous local goddesses combined into one [...] all-powerful Female Principle.\" Meanwhile, the great Tamil epic, \"Silappatikaram\" (c. 100 CE) was one of several literary masterpieces amply indicating \"the currency of the cult of the Female Principle in South India\" during this period – and, once again, \"the idea that Lakshmi, Saraswati, Parvati, etc., represent different aspects of the same power.\"\n\nTaken together with the Epics, the vast body of religious and cultural compilations known as the Puranas (most of which were composed during the Gupta period, c. 300 - 600 CE) \"afford us greater insight into all aspects and phases of Hinduism – its mythology, its worship, its theism and pantheism, its love of God, its philosophy and superstitions, its festivals and ceremonies and ethics – than any other works.\"\n\nSome of the more important Shakta-oriented Puranas include the \"Devi Purana\" and the \"Kalika Purana\", in which Devi is described as \"the supramental \"Prakriti\"\" to whom the world owes its origin, \"while she does not owe her origin to anything.\" By far, however, the most important Puranas from the Shakta standpoint are the \"Markandeya Purana\", the \"Brahmanda Purana\", and the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\", from which the key Shakta scriptures are drawn.\n\nBy far, the most important text of Shaktism is the Devi Mahatmya (also known as the \"Durga Saptashati\", \"Chandi\" or \"Chandi-Path\"), found in the \"Markandeya Purana\". Composed some 1,600 years ago, the text \"wove together the diverse threads of already ancient memory and created a dazzling verbal tapestry that remains even today the central text of the Hindu Goddess.\" Here, for the first time, \"the various mythic, cultic and theological elements relating to diverse female divinities were brought together in what has been called the 'crystallization of the Goddess tradition.'\"\n\nAs the earliest Hindu scripture \"in which the object of worship is conceptualized as Goddess, with a capital G\", the \"Devi Mahatmya\" also marks the birth of \"independent Shaktism\"; i.e. the cult of the Female Principle as a distinct philosophical and denominational entity.\n\n\"The influence of the cult of the Female Principle [had already] placed goddesses by the sides of the gods of all systems as their consorts, and symbols of their energy or \"shakti\". But the entire popular emotion centering round the Female Principle was not exhausted. So need was felt for a new system, entirely female-dominated, as system in which even the great gods like Vishnu or Shiva would remain subordinate to the goddess. This new system – containing vestiges of hoary antiquity, varieties of rural and tribal cults and rituals, and strengthened by newfangled ideas of different ages – came to be known as Shaktism.\"\nWithin the Hindu genre of \"Sahasranamas\" (literally, \"thousand-name\" hymns, extolling the names, deeds and associations of a given deity), the \"Sri Lalita Sahasranama Stotra\", or \"Hymn to the Thousand Names of the Auspicious Goddess Lalita\", is \"a veritable classic, widely acknowledged for its lucidity, clarity and poetic excellence.\"\n\nThe \"Lalita Sahasranama\" is part of the \"Brahmanda Purana\", but its specific origins and authorship are lost to history. Based upon textual evidence, it is believed to have been composed in South India not earlier than the 9th or later than the 11th century CE. The text is closely associated with another section of the \"Brahmanda Purana\" entitled \"Lalitopakhyana\" (\"The Great Narrative of Lalita\"), which extols the deeds of the Goddess in her form as \"Lalita-Tripurasundari\", in particular her slaying of the demon \"Bhandasura\".\n\nThe text operates on a number of levels, containing references not just to the Devi's physical qualities and exploits but also an encoded guide to philosophy and esoteric practices of \"kundalini yoga\" and \"Srividya\" Shaktism. In addition, every name and group of names within the \"Sahasranama\" is considered to have high mantric value independent of its content, and are often prescribed in \"sadhanas\" or \"prayogas\" to accomplish particular purposes.\n\nThe late Puranic age saw the beginnings of \"Bhakti\" – \"new religious movements of personalistic, theistic devotionalism\" that would come to full fruition between 1200 and 1700 CE, and still in many ways define the mainstream of Hindu religious practice. The \"Devi Gita\" is an important milestone, as the first major Shakta \"theistic work [to be] steeped in \"bhakti\".\"\n\nThe \"Devi Gita\" is the final and best-known portion of the vast 11th-century scripture known as the \"Devi Bhagavata Purana\", a text exclusively dedicated to the Devi \"in her highest iconic mode, as the supreme World-Mother \"Bhuvaneshvari\", beyond birth, beyond marriage, beyond any possible subordination to Shiva.\" Indeed, the Purana's \"most significant contribution to the Shakta theological tradition is the ideal of a Goddess both single and benign.\"\nThe \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\" retells the tales of the \"Devi Mahatmya\" in much greater length and detail, embellishing them with Shakta philosophical reflections, while recasting many classic tales from other schools of Hinduism (particularly Vaishnavism) in a distinctly Shakta light:\n\n\"The \"Devi-Bhagavata\" was intended not only to show the superiority of the Goddess over various male deities, but also to clarify and elaborate on her nature on her own terms. [...] The Goddess in the \"Devi-Bhagavata\" becomes less of a warrior goddess, and more a nurturer and comforter of her devotees, and a teacher of wisdom. This development in the character of the Goddess culminates in the \"Devi Gita\", which \"repeatedly stresses the necessity of love for the goddess, with no mention of one's gender, as the primary qualification,\" a view \"inspired by the devotional ideals of Shaktism.\"\n\nAs the first millennium wound to an end, \"religious movements of the South began to exert tremendous influence on the North\" – and the Southern contribution to Shaktism's emergence was significant:\n\n\"\"Korravai\", the Tamil goddess of war and victory, was easily identified with \"Durga\", [who] was also identified with the \"Bhagavati\" of Kerala and the eternal virgin enshrined in \"Kanyakumari\". She was invoked in one or another of her nine forms, \"Navadurga\", or as \"Bhadrakali\". The Tamil tradition also associates her with \"Saraswati\" or \"Vāc\", as also with \"Srī\" and \"Lakshmi\". Thus in Durga the devotee visualised the triple aspects of power, beneficence and wisdom. In addition, many southern temples included shrines to the \"Sapta Matrika\" and \"from the earliest period the South had a rich tradition of the cult of the village mothers, concerned with the facts of daily life.\"\nThe dualistic metaphysics of Tantric traditions indicates the influence of Samkhya on Tantra. Dasgupta speculates that the Tantric image of a wild Kali standing on a slumbering Shiva was inspired from the Samkhyan conception of Prakriti as a dynamic agent and Purusha as a passive witness. Shakta philosophy also elaborated Samkhya theory on the phases of cosmic evolution (\"tattvas\") by expanding the number of phases from 25 to 36 tattvas. \"It is worthy of note that this scheme of \"tattvas\" enables the Shakta philosophy to solve the conundrum ... as to how the changeless \"Brahman\" becomes the changing universe, and how the One can become the Many. In the Shakta cosmogony the central idea is that Shakti issues out of the Absolute and is not different from \"Brahman\", being [rather] the kinetic aspect of Brahman.\"\n\nIn most schools of Shaktism, the \"Tantras\" – a large genre of ritual manuals dating from as early as the 7th century CE and as late as the 19th century – are central scriptures. The Tantras \"devised two main \"margas\" (paths of \"sadhana\") to reach the same goal\":\n\n\nThe proper path is generally determined by the guru based upon a given devotee's personal nature – i.e., as a tamasic \"pasu\" (i.e., an ordinary person not particularly given to spiritual pursuits, and mainly preoccupied with worldly matters); a rajasic \"vira\" (an active and vigorous spiritual seeker, qualified to \"heroically\" engage more intensive forms of \"sadhana\"); or a sattvic \"divya\" (a holy-natured person, having already achieved an extremely high level of spiritual maturity) – and various other factors.\n\nAround 800 CE, Adi Shankara, the legendary sage and preceptor of the Advaita Vedanta system, implicitly recognized Shakta philosophy and Tantric liturgy as part of mainstream Hinduism in his powerful (and still hugely popular) hymn known as \"Saundaryalahari\" or \"Waves of Beauty\". Shankara, while \"not a Shakta in the sectarian sense, [...] had a soft corner for Shakta religion, perhaps due to its popularity among the masses.\" Another important Shakta text often attributed to Shankara is the hypnotically exquisite \"Mahishasura Mardini Stotra\", a 21-verse hymn derived from the \"Devi Mahatmya\" that constitutes \"one of the greatest works ever addressed to the supreme feminine power.\"\n\nBy the thirteenth century, \"the Tantras had assimilated a very large number of cults of various origins – regional, tribal and sectarian – [and] had assumed a completely Shakta character.\" From the fourteenth century onward, \"the Shakta-Tantric cults had [...] become woven into the texture of all the religious practices current in India,\" their spirit and substance infusing regional and sectarian vernacular as well as Sanskrit literature.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, \"a good number of Shakta-Tantric works were composed\" that \"attempted to make the Tantric ideas popular among the masses.\" Notable examples include the \"Mahanirvana Tantra\", characterized by its \"special modernism\" and \"liberal outlook, especially towards women.\" Works of the prolific and erudite Bhaskararaya, the most \"outstanding contributor to Shakta philosophy,\" also belong to this period and remain central to \"\" practice even today.\n\nThe great Tamil composer Muthuswami Dikshitar (1775–1835), a Srividya adept, set one of that tradition's central mysteries – the majestic \"Navavarana Puja\" – to music in a Caranatic classical song cycle known as the \"Kamalamba Navavarna Kritis\". \"Dikshitar thus [threw] open the doors of [Srividya] to all those who are moved to approach the Divine Mother through devotional music.\" In the meantime an even greater wave of popular Shaktism was swelling in eastern India with the passionate Shakta lyrics of Ramprasad Sen (1720–1781), which \"opened not only a new horizon of the Shakti cult but made it acceptable to all, irrespective of caste or creed.\" More than 80 Shakta poets appeared in Bengal after Ramprasad [and] by 1900 the number of Shakta lyrics exceeded 4,000. And the tradition still survives.\"\n\nFrom this point onward, \"Shaktism was evolving as a liberal, universal religion\" that touched nearly every aspect of Indian life. The evolution \"achieved a completeness\" in the great Shakta saint Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836–1886), \"who held from his Shakta experience that the aim of all religions was the same and that the difference between the personal and the impersonal god was no more than that between ice and water.\"\n\nAnother major advocate of Shaktism in this period was Sir John Woodroffe (1865–1936), a High Court judge in British India and \"the father of modern Tantric studies,\" whose vast oeuvre \"bends over backward to defend the Tantras against their many critics and to prove that they represent a noble, pure, ethical system in basic accord with the Vedas and Vedanta.\" His complete works are still in print and remain influential to this day.\n\nRamakrishna's chief disciple Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) \"inherited from Ramakrishna the Shakta-oriented, synthetic outlook which insisted on the cult of Shakti in the programme of national regeneration,\" and in fact \"regarded the country as the living image of the Divine Mother\" – an image that resonated throughout India's struggle for independence.\n\nAnother of India's great nationalists, Sri Aurobindo (1872–1950), later reinterpreted \"the doctrine of Shakti in a new light\" by drawing on \"the Tantric conception of transforming the mortal and material body into [something] pure and divine,\" and setting a goal of \"complete and unconditional surrender to the will of the Mother.\"\n\nIn certain regards, Bhattacharyya notes, Shaktism has so infused mainstream Hinduism that it has \"ceased to be a sectarian religion,\" and presents \"no difficulty for anyone to accept its essence.\" \n\nShakta-oriented temples and pilgrimage sites draw ever-growing crowds and recognition. For example, in 2004 the monumental Meenakshi Amman Temple was shortlisted in the \"New Seven Wonders of the World\" competition. Meanwhile, the Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu and Kashmir attracts record numbers of pilgrims – five million in the 2007 as of September.\n\nThe Indian film industry turns out scores of Shakta devotional films, perhaps none more famous than 1975's \"Jai Santoshi Maa\" (\"Hail to the Mother of Satisfaction\"), a low-budget box-office phenomenon that propelled a previously unknown deity, \"Santoshi Mata\", to dizzying heights of devotional fervor. A 36-episode television miniseries in 2003 and a successful 2006 remake of the original film suggest that this \"new\" goddess's following continues to expand.\n\n\"As her film brought her to life, \"Santoshi Ma\" quickly became one of the most important and widely worshiped goddesses in India, taking her place in poster-art form in the altar rooms of millions of Hindu homes. [...] Yet it is hard to conceive that Santoshi Ma could have granted such instant satisfaction to so many people had she not been part of a larger and already well-integrated culture of the Goddess. Her new devotees could immediately recognize many of her characteristic moods and attributes, and feel them deeply, because she shared them with other goddesses long since familiar to them.\"\n\nSome scholars also identify a Shakta influence in the increasing visibility of Hindu female saints and gurus \"through Web sites, world tours, ashrams and devotional groups across the globe, devotional publications and videos.\" While some of these teachers represent conservative and patriarchal lineages of mainstream Hinduism, Pechilis notes that others – for example Mata Amritanandamayi and Mother Meera – operate in a strongly \"feminine mode\" that is distinctly \"bhaktic\" and Shakta in nature. She observes:\n\n\"Female gurus are understood by Hindu tradition and by their followers alike to be manifestations of the Goddess; that is, as perfect embodiments of \"shakti\". [...] The nature, presence, and teaching of the Hindu female gurus is universal. As gurus, they distinctively blend the formality and authority of classical tradition with the spontaneity of interactive encounter, harmonizing personal experience and the ultimate.\"\n"}

Despite being a non-secular province with a Catholic Archbishop as the head of the state, Salzburg has a long record of Jewish history.\n\nThe first Jewish settlers arrived in the city when it was still under Roman rule and called Juvavum as a provincial town. After the decay of Juvavum and the foundation of a diocese in the city now called Salzburg, Bishop Arno of Salzburg (785-871) referred to a \"medicum judaicum\", or Jewish doctor.\n\nDocuments from the 12th century report the presence of a Jewish quarter and a street called \"Judengasse\" (\"Jews alley\"), an alley near the Cathedral that is still called by that name. There is record of a synagogue in the 13th century.\n\nBy 1492, Jews of Salzburg were publicly burned and Jewish settlers expelled from the city. This ban prevented the development of a Jewish community until well into the 19th century, by then Salzburg had become part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Many central figures of Salzburg's intellectual and cultural life from the late 19th century until Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 were Jewish or of Jewish origin, such as Stefan Zweig, Max Reinhardt, Theodor Herzl or Carl Zuckmayer.\n\nAfter 1938, the synagogue and Jewish cemetery in Aigen were closed and many Jews either left Salzburg or were deported to concentration camps. Salzburg's Jewish community never fully recovered from those years. Today, it consists of about 100 members. The synagogue was re-opened after the war and is still the center of Jewish culture and worship in Salzburg.\n\n\n"}

The horse was seen as divine, as a sacred animal associated with a particular deity, or as a totem animal impersonating the king or warrior. Horse cults and horse sacrifice were originally a feature of Eurasian nomad cultures. While horse worship has been almost exclusively associated with Indo-European culture, by the Early Middle Ages it was also adopted by Turkic peoples.\n\nHorse worship still exists today in various regions of South Asia.\n\nIn India, Horse worship in the form of worship of \"Hayagriva\" dates back to 2000 BC, when the Indo-Aryan people started to migrate into the Indus valley. The Indo-Aryans worshipped the horse for its speed, strength, and intelligence. To this day, the worship of Hayagriva exists among the followers of Hinduism.\n\nThe Uffington White Horse in the United Kingdom, is dated to the Iron Age (800 BC–AD 100) or the late Bronze Age (1000–700 BC) in Britain; deposits of fine silt removed from the horse's 'beak' were scientifically dated to the late Bronze Age. \n\nThe French archaeologist Patrice Méniel has demonstrated, based on examination of animal bones from many archaeological sites, a lack of \"hippophagy\" (horse eating) in ritual centres and burial sites in Gaul, although there is some evidence for hippophagy from earlier settlement sites in the same region.\n\nHorse oracles are also attested in later times (see Arkona below). \n\nThere is some reason to believe that Poseidon, like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a horse. In Greek art, Poseidon rides a chariot that was pulled by a hippocampus or by horses that could ride on the sea, and sailors sometimes drowned horses as a sacrifice to Poseidon to ensure a safe voyage.\n\nIn the cave of Phigalia Demeter was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized corn-spirit bore this form. Her priests were called Poloi (Greek for \"colts\") in Laconia.\n\nThis seems related to the archaic myth by which Poseidon once pursued Demeter; She spurned his advances, turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses; he saw through the deception and became a stallion and captured her. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech.\n\nThis bears some resemblance to the Norse mythology reference to the gender-changing Loki having turned himself into a mare and given birth to Sleipnir, \"the greatest of all horses\". \n\nTacitus (Germania) mentions the use of white horses for divination by the Germanic tribes:\n\nIn Gallo-Roman times, the worship of Epona was widespread in the north-western portions of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Welsh legend of Rhiannon and the Irish legend of Macha, although first recorded in Christian times, may indicate memories of horse worship. The white horse of Rhiannon is another example of cultic use of white horses, which seems to be an Indo-European phenomenon.\n\nThe temple fortress of Arkona, at Cape Arkona on the German island of Rügen, was the religious centre of the Slavic Rani in the Early Middle Ages. The temple, dedicated to the deity Svantevit, housed an important horse oracle in Slavic times, where the behaviour of a white stallion could decide peace or war - recalling the above account by Tacitus.\n\nSimilar horse oracles have been reported from medieval temples in Pomeranian Stettin and Lutitian Rethra and in temples in the Ming Dynasty Tombs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270403", "title": "Iddah", "text": "Iddah\n\nIn Islam, iddah or iddat (; \"period of waiting\") is the period a woman must observe after the death of her spouse or after a divorce, during which she may not marry another man. Its purpose is to ensure that the male parent of any offspring produced after the cessation of a nikah (marriage) would be known.\nThe length of \"iddah\" varies according to a number of circumstances.\n\nThe iddah of a woman divorced by her husband is three monthly periods, unless she is pregnant in which case the ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth, or unless the marriage was not consummated in which case there is no `iddah, or unless she does not menstruate, in which case \"the scholars say that she should observe an ‘iddah of a full year, nine months for pregnancy and three months for ‘iddah.\"\n\nFor a woman whose husband has died, the `iddah is four lunar months and ten days after the death of their husbands, whether or not the marriage was consummated. \n\nIslamic scholars consider this directive to be a balance between mourning of husband's death and protecting the widow from criticism that she might be subjected to from remarrying too quickly after her husband’s death. This is also to ascertain whether a woman is pregnant or not, since four and a half months is half the length of a normal pregnancy.\n\nHusbands should make a will in favor of their wives for the provision of one year’s residence and maintenance, unless the wives themselves leave the house or take any other similar step.\n\nThe directive of the Qur'an regarding the waiting period of a widow, is as under.\n\nThe following is a summary of the main directives entailed in these verses:\n\n\nThese are the basic directives of the Sharia regarding the waiting period of a widow. It is also clear from another directive of the Qur'an that during this waiting period, the woman should not be turned out of her house.\n\nQuran states:\n\nIn surah Al-Ahzab it is stated:\n\nThe Quran surah (Chapter) 65, entitled \"At-Talaq\" meaning \"The Divorce\" states\n\nThe following is a summary of the main directives entailed in these verses:\n\nCommentaries of the Quran, including the most respected Sunni commentary, ibn Kathir's Tafsir/exegesis/commentary: -\n\nImam Suyuti's commentary, Tafsir al-Jalalayn: -And as for those of your women who read allā’ī or allā’i in both instances no longer expect to menstruate if you have any doubts about their waiting period their prescribed waiting period shall be three months and also for those who have not yet menstruated because of their young age their period shall also be three months — both cases apply to other than those whose spouses have died; for these latter their period is prescribed in the verse they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days.Rulings from Islamic scholars (\"fatwas\"): -\n\nMuslim jurists and thinkers have generally construed this additional purpose entailed in the prescription of the waiting period for widows to be that of the widow's 'mourning' her deceased husband. The prescription of a specified 'waiting' or 'mourning' period is for the purpose of safeguarding the woman against defamation, slander and ill-repute in society.\nIn Pakistan waiting period for divorcee is 90 days. And for widow is 130 days. However pregnant divorcee or widow have to wait until pregnancy or miscarriage.\n\nIt is specifically for this purpose that others are directed against making a 'secret' commitment of marriage with the widow or deciding about the time and place of the marriage-contract, during the prescribed period. It is reported that Muhammad advised widows to be extra modest in their appearance and to even refrain from wearing any fragrance, during this period. All these directives and advice seem to point to the fact that a woman should not only be but also appear to be in a state of mourning so that her social circles do not get a chance to say a negative word about her.\n\nNo other restrictions apply to a widow during her waiting period.\n\n"}

Thus \"Koshintō\" literally means the \"Ancient Way of the Gods\". The term Shinto itself originated in the 6th century (to distinguish it from continental ideas such as Buddhism and Taoism then being introduced).\n\nThe following is deduced from studying the language of the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" which does not appear in any Chinese philosophy:\n\nIn Koshintō, the present world or \"utsushiyo\" is put in contrast to the eternal world or \"tokoyo\". All individuals possess a \"tamashii\", meaning a mind, heart, or soul. A \"tamashii\" without a body is called a \"mitama\". Those whose \"tamashii\" has the nature of \"kami\" are called \"mikoto\".\n\nIn the Age of the Kami, or \"Kamiyo\", the Earth was ruled by \"kami\", whose forms were akin to humans, but had pure hearts and spoke in the language of kotodama.\n\nThere are no records of \"pure\" Koshintō in early Japanese literature. By the time Japan was producing literature, its native religion had already intermixed with Taoism and Buddhism. Medieval development meant that Shinto was integrated into Buddhist symbology.\n\nKoshintō research began at the same time as examinations into Early Buddhism. In this era, Japan's shrine rituals were being \"purified\" of their religious nature and turned into national forms, a process called State Shinto today. Religionists began looking for the origin of these forms in a primitive \"nature religion\". Early folklorists such as Kunio Yanagita were also seeking a purely Japanese tradition.\n\nOnisaburo Deguchi, the founder of Oomoto, was an extremely influential Koshinto researcher in the Imperial period. He influenced nearly all modern Koshinto lines except for that of Takuma Hisa. Such research continues today and is often connected with aikido and other martial arts.\n\n\n\n"}

Under the name Azrael Visconti is an past officer of the Thelemic organisation Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) in London, and scholar of the occult works of English author Aleister Crowley, the founder of the philosophy and religion of Thelema. Italian science-fiction author Francesco Dimitri pays tribute to Visconti’s underground persona through his signature character Dagon in \"La Ragazza dei miei Sogni,\" of which a film adaptation was released in 2017, with Visconti-inspired character played by renowned actor Nicolas Vaporidis.\n\nVisconti was born in Rome, Italy. He studied Political Science at LUISS Guido Carli, Religious Anthropology at La Sapienza University in Rome, and Audio Engineering at SAE Institute Milano.\n\nVisconti has been involved in the occult since the 1990s. He was initiated into the Minerval degree of Ordo Templi Orientis at Khem Lodge in Rome, Italy. During the next few years, he advanced through the \"Man of Earth\" degrees of O.T.O., completing the Triad at AMeTh Lodge in London, UK, where he moved in early 2013, and serving as the Lodge's Treasurer (one of the 3 permanent Officer roles) for several years. In 2015 he war ordained a Deacon in the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica. However, following months of heated debate about alleged abuse in the Order perpetrated at every level of the organisation, Visconti decided to resign from it, telling his version of the story on his own website, in a diary-like blog called \"The Wasteland\".\n\nVisconti is a Freemason belonging to the United Grand Lodge of England and several successive orders, such as the Holy Royal Arch and the Ancient and Accepted Rite for England and Wales and its Districts and Chapters Overseas.\n\nIn the early 2000s he collaborated with Labirinto Stellare, a small independent press, to translate the works of Michael Bertiaux and Kenneth Grant in Italian.\n\nA member of gothic metal band Morgana’s Kiss sometime during the late ’90s, in 2001 Visconti formed XP8, an electronic band drawing inspiration by genres such as EBM, synthpop and hard dance. Other members of the band included Marko Resurreccion and Paul Toohill. In 2006, Visconti joined two other projects, Unter Null (this partnership will only last few months), and Grendel, as member of the live lineup of each band. 2007 is the year that saw him playing for VNV Nation on their \"Judgement World Tour\". A year later, in 2008, he started working with Faderhead, as well as becoming a staple to the live lineup; while in 2009 Visconti ended his collaboration with Grendel, to focus only on XP8 and Faderhead.\n\nHe continued writing music for the XP8’s songs as well as working on band’s synth production and arrangements till the band's split in 2014, when everything came to a grinding halt. Quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that \"“[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn’t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.”\" - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again.\n\nAfter the split of XP8, Visconti continued working as a DJ until April 2015, when he decided to go on hiatus from the music scene after a final set at Sheffield's Resistanz Festival.\n\n"}
{"id": "355242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355242", "title": "Maya Hero Twins", "text": "Maya Hero Twins\n\nThe Maya Hero Twins are the central figures of a narrative included within the colonial K'iche' document called Popol Vuh, and constituting the oldest Maya myth to have been preserved in its entirety. Called Hunahpu and Xbalanque in the K’iche’ language, the Twins have also been identified in the art of the Classic Mayas (200–900 AD). The twins are often portrayed as complementary forces. The complementary pairings of life and death, sky and earth, day and night, sun and moon, among multiple others have been used to represent the twins. The duality that occurs between male and female is often seen in twin myths, as a male and female twin are conceptualized to be born to represent the two sides of a single entity (Miller and Taube 1993: 81).\n\nThe Twin motif recurs in many Native American mythologies; the Maya Twins, in particular, could be considered as mythical ancestors to the Maya ruling lineages.\n\nThe sources on the Hero Twins are both written (Popol Vuh, early Spanish historians), and iconographic. Classic Maya iconography clearly demonstrates that the earlier Twin narratives must have diverged considerably from the 16th-century Popol Vuh myth; to what extent is a matter of dispute.\n\nMany versions of the Twin Myth must have circulated among the Mayas, but the only one that survives in a written form is the Classical K'iche' version in the Popol Vuh. According to this version, the Hero Twins were Xbalanque and Hunahpu (Modern K'iche': \"Xb‘alanke\" and \"Junajpu\") who were ballplayers like their father and uncle, \"Hun Hunahpu\" and \"Vucub Hunahpu\".\n\nSummoned to Xibalba by the Lords of the Underworld, the father and uncle were defeated and sacrificed. Two sons were conceived, however, by the seed of the dead father. The pregnant mother fled from Xibalba. The sons—or 'Twins'—grew up to avenge their father, and after many trials, finally defeated the lords of the Underworld in the ballgame. The Popol Vuh features other episodes involving the Twins as well (see below), including the destruction of a pretentious bird demon, Vucub-Caquix, and of his two demonic sons. The Twins also turned their half-brothers into the Howler monkey gods, who were the patrons of artists and scribes. The Twins were finally transformed into sun and moon, signaling the beginning of a new age.\n\nIt has been noted that in the upper world scenes of the Popol Vuh, Hunahpu has the dominant role, whereas, in the underworld, Xbalanque takes the initiative. Bartolomé de las Casas described Xbalanque as having entered the underworld as a war leader. His description refers to the Kekchi town of Carcha. Xbalanque is also the name given to the male protagonist in earlier variants of the Kekchi myth of Sun and Moon, where he is hunting for deer (a metaphor for making captives), and capturing the daughter of the Earth Deity. In these cases, Hunahpu has no role to play.\n\nAnother main source for Hero Twin mythology is much earlier and consists of representations found on Maya ceramics until about 900 AD and in the Dresden Codex some centuries later. Clearly recognizable are the figures of Hunahpu, Xbalanque, and the howler monkey scribes and sculptors. Hunahpu is distinguished by black spots on his skin, which are probably those of a corpse, thus marking him out as one who descended into the underworld. On the Preclassic murals from San Bartolo (Maya site), the king, marked with a black spot on the cheek, and drawing blood from his genitals in the four corners of the world, appears to personify the hero Hunahpu. Xbalanque—the 'War Twin'—is more animal-like, in that he is distinguished by jaguar patches on his skin and by whiskers or a beard.\n\nCertain iconographic scenes are suggestive of episodes in the Popol Vuh. The Twins' shooting of a steeply descending bird (the 'Principal Bird Deity') with blowguns may represent the defeat of Vucub-Caquix, whereas the principal Maya maize god rising from the carapace of a turtle in the presence of the Hero Twins may visualize the resurrection of the Twins' father, Hun-Hunahpu. This second scene has also been explained differently, however. In any case, the Twins are often depicted together with the main maize god, and these three semi-divinities were obviously felt to belong together. Therefore, it is probably no coincidence that in the Popol Vuh, the Twins are symbolically represented by two maize stalks.\n\nThe name \"Xbalanque\" (pronounced ) has been variously translated as 'Jaguar Sun' (\"x-balam-que\"), 'Hidden Sun' (\"x-balan-que\"), and 'Jaguar Deer' (\"x-balam-quieh\"). The initial sound may stem from \"yax\" (precious), since in Classical Maya, a hieroglyphic element of this meaning precedes the pictogram of the hero (although it has also been suggested to be the female prefix \"ix-\"). For the combination of prefix and pictogram, a reading as \"Yax Balam\" has been proposed. The name \"Hunahpu\" (pronounced ) is usually understood as \"Hun-ahpub\" 'One-Blowgunner', the blowgun characterizing the youthful hero as a hunter of birds.\n\nThe head of Hunahpu is used as a variant sign for the 20th day in the day count or tzolkin, which in these cases may actually have been read as '(Hun)ahpu', rather than 'Ahau' (Lord or King). The 20th day is also the concluding day of all vigesimal periods, including the katun and baktun. The head of Xbalanque is used as a variant for the number nine (\"balan\" being similar to \"bolon\" 'nine').\n\nThe following is a detailed summary of the Popol Vuh Twin Myth, on from the death of the heroes' father and uncle.\n\nHunahpu and his brother were conceived when their mother Xquic, daughter of one of the lords of Xibalba, spoke with the severed head of their father Hun. The skull spat upon the maiden's hand, which caused the twins to be conceived in her womb. Xquic sought out Hun Hunahpu's mother, who begrudgingly took her as a ward after setting up a number of trials to prove her identity.\n\nEven after birth, Hunahpu and Xbalanque were not well treated by their grandmother or their older half-brothers, One Howler Monkey and One Artisan. Immediately after their births, their grandmother demanded they be removed from the house for their crying, and their elder brothers obliged by placing them on an anthill and among the brambles. Their intent was to kill their younger half-brothers out of jealousy and spite, for the older pair had long been revered as fine artisans and thinkers and feared the newcomers would steal from the attention they received.\n\nThe attempts to kill the young twins after birth were a failure, and the boys grew up without any obvious spite for their ill-natured older siblings. During their younger years, the twins were made to labor, going to hunt birds which they brought back for meals. The elder brothers were given their food to eat first, in spite of the fact they spent the day singing and playing while the younger twins were working.\n\nHunahpu and Xbalanque demonstrated their wit at a young age in dealing with their older half brothers. One day, the pair returned from the field without any birds to eat and were questioned by their older siblings. The younger boys claimed that they had indeed shot several birds but that they had gotten caught high in a tree and were unable to retrieve them. The older brothers were brought to the tree and climbed up to get the birds when the tree suddenly began to grow even taller, and the older brothers were caught. This is also the first instance in which the twins demonstrate supernatural powers, or perhaps simply the blessings of the greater gods; the feats of power are often only indirectly attributed to the pair.\n\nHunahpu further humiliated his older brethren by instructing them to remove their loincloths and tie them about their waists in an attempt to climb down. The loincloths became tails, and the brothers were transformed into monkeys. When their grandmother was informed that the older boys had not been harmed, she demanded they be allowed to return. When they did come back to the home, their grandmother was unable to contain her laughter at their appearance, and the disfigured brothers ran away in shame.\n\nAt a point in their lives not specified in the Popol Vuh, the twins were approached by the god Huracan regarding an arrogant god named Seven Macaw (Vucub Caquix). Seven Macaw had built up a following of worshipers among some of the inhabitants of the Earth, making false claims to be either the sun or the moon. Seven Macaw was also extremely vain, adorning himself with metal ornaments in his wings and a set of false teeth made of gemstones.\n\nIn a first attempt to dispatch the vain god, the twins attempted to sneak up on him as he was eating his meal in a tree, and shot at his jaw with a blowgun. Seven Macaw was knocked from his tree but only wounded, and as Hunahpu attempted to escape, his arm was grabbed by the god and torn off.\n\nIn spite of their initial failure, the twins again demonstrated their clever nature in formulating a plan for Seven Macaw's defeat. Invoking a pair of gods disguised as grandparents, the twins instructed the invoked gods to approach Seven Macaw and negotiate for the return of Hunahpu's arm. In doing so, the \"grandparents\" indicated they were but a poor family, making a living as doctors and dentists and attempting to care for their orphaned grandchildren. Upon hearing this, Seven Macaw requested that his teeth be fixed since they had been shot and knocked loose by the blowgun, and his eyes cured (it is not specifically said what ailed his eyes). In doing so, the grandparents replaced his jeweled teeth with white corn and plucked the ornaments he had about his eyes, leaving the god destitute of his former greatness. Having fallen, Seven Macaw died, presumably of shame.\n\nSeven Macaw's sons, Zipacna and Cabrakan, inherited a large part of their father's arrogance, claiming to be the creators and destroyers of mountains, respectively. The elder son Zipacna was destroyed when the twins tricked him with the lure of a fake crab, burying him beneath a mountain in the process.\n\nThe Maya god Huracan again implored the young twins for help in dealing with Seven Macaw's younger son, Cabrakan, the Earthquake. Again, it was primarily through their cleverness that the pair were able to bring about the downfall of their enemy, having sought him out and then using his very arrogance against him; they told the story of a great mountain they had encountered that kept growing and growing. Cabrakan prided himself as the one to bring down the mountains, and upon hearing such a tale, he predictably demanded to be shown the mountain. Hunahpu and Xbalanque obliged, leading Cabrakan toward the non-existent mountain. Being skilled hunters, they shot down several birds along the way, roasting them over fires and playing upon Cabrakan's hunger. When he asked for some meat, he was given a bird that had been prepared with plaster and gypsum, a poison to the god. Upon eating it, he was weakened and the boys were able to bind him and cast him into a hole in the earth, burying him forever.\n\nSometime after the expulsion of their older siblings, the twins used their special powers or abilities to expedite their gardening chores for their grandmother—a single swing of the axe would do a full day's worth of clearing, for example. The pair covered themselves in dust and wood chippings when their grandmother approached to make it seem they had been hard at work, in spite of the fact they spent the whole day relaxing. However, the next day they returned to find their work undone by the animals of the forest. Upon completion of their work, they hid and lay in wait, and when the animals returned, they attempted to catch or scare them off.\n\nMost animals eluded their capture. The rabbit and the deer they caught by the tail, but these tails broke off, thus giving all future generations of rabbits and deer short tails. The rat, however, they did capture, singeing his tail over the fire in revenge for the act. In exchange for mercy, the rat revealed an important piece of information: the gaming equipment of their father and uncle was hidden by their grandmother in her grief, for it was playing ball that was directly responsible for the deaths of her sons.\n\nAgain, a ruse was devised to get their equipment, the twins once more relying upon trickery to meet their goals. The pair snuck the rat into their home during dinner and had their grandmother cook a meal of hot chili sauce. They demanded water for their meal, which their grandmother went to retrieve. The jar of water, however, had been sabotaged with a hole, and she was unable to return with the water. When their mother left to find out why and the pair were alone in the home, they sent the rat up into the roof to gnaw apart the ropes that held the equipment hidden and were able to retrieve the equipment their father and uncle had used to play ball. It had long been a favorite past-time for their father, and soon would become a favored activity for them as well.\n\nHunahpu and Xbalanque played ball in the same court that their father and his brother had played in long before them. When One Hunahpu and his brother had played, the noise had disturbed the Lords of Xibalba, rulers of the Maya Underworld. The Xibalbans summoned them to play ball in their own court.\n\nWhen the twins began to play ball in the court, once again the Lords of Xibalba were disturbed by the racket, and sent summons to the boys to come to Xibalba and play in their court. Fearing they would suffer the same fate, their grandmother relayed the message only indirectly, telling it to a louse which was hidden in a toad's mouth, which was in turn hidden in the belly of a snake in a falcon. Nevertheless, the boys did receive the message, and much to their grandmother's dismay, set off to Xibalba.\n\nWhen their father had answered the summons, he and his brother were met with a number of challenges along the way which served to confuse and embarrass them before their arrival, but the younger twins would not fall victim to the same tricks. They sent a mosquito ahead of them to bite at the Lords and uncover which were real and which were simply mannequins, as well as uncovering their identities. When they arrived at Xibalba, they were easily able to identify which were the real Lords of Xibalba and address them by name. They also turned down the Lords' invitation to sit on a bench for visitors, correctly identifying the bench as a heated stone for cooking. Frustrated by the twins' ability to see through their traps, they sent the boys away to the Dark House, the first of several deadly tests devised by the Xibalbans.\n\nTheir father One Hunahpu and his brother had suffered embarrassing defeats in each of the tests, but again Hunahpu and Xbalanque demonstrated their prowess by outwitting the Xibalbans on the first of the tests, surviving the night in the pitch black house without using up their torch. Dismayed, the Xibalbans bypassed the remaining tests and invited the boys directly to the game. The twins knew that the Xibalbans used a special ball that had a blade with which to kill them, and instead of falling for the trick, Hunahpu stopped the ball with a racquet and spied the blades. Complaining that they had been summoned only to be killed, Hunahpu and Xbalanque threatened to leave the game.\n\nAs a compromise, the Lords of Xibalba allowed the boys to use their own rubber ball, and a long and proper game ensued. In the end, the twins allowed the Xibalbans to win the game, but this was again a part of their ruse. They were sent to Razor House, the second deadly test of Xibalba, filled with knives that moved of their own accord. The twins, however, spoke to the knives and convinced them to stop, thereby ruining the test. They also sent leafcutting ants to retrieve petals from the gardens of Xibalba, a reward to be offered to the Lords for their victory. The Lords had intentionally chosen a reward they thought impossible, for the flowers were well guarded, but the guards did not take notice of the ants and were killed for their inability to guard the flowers.\n\nThe twins played a rematch with the Xibalbans and lost by intent again and were sent to Cold House, the next test. This test they defeated, as well. In turn, Hunahpu and Xbalanque by purpose lost their ballgames so that they might be sent to the remaining tests, Jaguar House, Fire House, Bat House, and in turn defeat the tests of the Xibalbans. The Lords of Xibalba were dismayed at the twins success until the twins were placed in Bat House. Though they hid inside their blowguns from the deadly bats, Hunahpu peeked out to see if daylight had come, and was decapitated by the bat god Camazotz.\n\nThe Xibalbans were overjoyed that Hunahpu had been defeated. Xbalanque summoned the beasts of the field, however, and fashioned a replacement head for Hunahpu. Though his original head was used as the ball for the next day's game, the twins were able to surreptitiously substitute a squash or a gourd for the ball, retrieving Hunahpu's real head and resulting in an embarrassing defeat for the Xibalbans.\n\nEmbarrassed by their defeat, the Xibalbans still sought to destroy the twins. They had a great oven constructed and once again summoned the boys, intending to trick them into the oven and to their deaths. The twins realized that the Lords had intended this ruse to be the end of them, but nevertheless, they allowed themselves to be burned in the oven, killed and ground into dust and bones. The Xibalbans were elated at the apparent demise of the twins and cast their remnants into a river. This was, however, a part of the plan devised by the boys, and when cast into the river their bodies regenerated, first as a pair of catfish, and then as a pair of young boys again.\n\nNot recognizing them, the boys were allowed to remain among the Xibalbans. Tales of their transformation from catfish spread, as well as tales of their dances and the way they entertained the people of Xibalba. They performed a number of miracles, setting fire to homes and then bringing them back whole from the ashes, sacrificing one another and rising from the dead. When the Lords of Xibalba heard the tale, they summoned the pair to their court to entertain them, demanding to see such miracles in action.\n\nThe boys answered the summons and volunteered to entertain the Lords at no cost. Their identities remained secret for the moment, claiming to be orphans and vagabonds, and the Lords were none the wiser. They went through their gamut of miracles, slaying a dog and bringing it back from the dead, causing the Lords' house to burn around them while the inhabitants were unharmed, and then bringing the house back from the ashes. In a climactic performance, Xbalanque cut Hunahpu apart and offered him as a sacrifice, only to have the older brother rise once again from the dead.\n\nEnthralled by the performance, One Death and Seven Death, the highest lords of Xibalba, demanded that the miracle be performed upon them. The twins obliged by killing and offering the lords as a sacrifice, but did not bring them back from the dead. The twins then shocked the Xibalbans by revealing their identities as Hunahpu and Xbalanque, sons of One Hunahpu whom they had slain years ago along with their uncle Seven Hunahpu. The Xibalbans despaired, confessed to the crimes of killing the brothers years ago, and begged for mercy. As a punishment for their crimes, the realm of Xibalba was no longer to be a place of greatness, and the Xibalbans would no longer receive offerings from the people who walked on the Earth above. All of Xibalba had effectively been defeated.\n\nWith Xibalba defeated and the arrogant gods disposed of, Hunahpu and Xbalanque had one final act to accomplish. They returned to the Xibalban ballcourt and retrieved the buried remains of their father, Hun Hunahpu. \n\nThen finished, the pair departed Xibalba and climbed back up to the surface of the Earth. They did not stop there, however, and continued climbing straight on up into the sky. One became the Sun, the other became the Moon.\n\nMany Native American cultures in the United States have traditions of two male hero twins. \nFor instance, in the creation myth of the Navajo (called the Diné Bahaneʼ) the hero twins Monster Slayer and Born for Water (sons of Changing Woman) acquire lightning bolt arrows from their father, the Sun, in order to rid the world of monsters that prey upon the people.\n\nHo-Chunk and other Siouan-speaking peoples have a tradition of Red Horn's Sons. The mythology of Red Horn and his two sons have some interesting analogies with the Maya Hero Twins mythic cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "428262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428262", "title": "Patricia Krenwinkel", "text": "Patricia Krenwinkel\n\nPatricia Dianne Krenwinkel (born December 3, 1947) is an American murderer and a former member of Charles Manson's \"Family\". During her time with Manson's group, she was known by various aliases such as Big Patty, Yellow, Marnie Reeves and Mary Ann Scott, but to The Family she was most commonly known as Katie.\n\nFollowing the 2009 death of fellow Manson gang member, Susan Atkins, Krenwinkel is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system.\n\nPatricia Krenwinkel was born in Los Angeles, California, to an insurance-salesman father and a homemaker mother. She attended University High School and then Westchester High School, both in the Los Angeles area. Patricia was often bullied at school by other students, suffered from low self-esteem, and was frequently teased for being overweight and for an excessive growth of body hair caused by an endocrine condition.\n\nAfter her parents divorced, seventeen-year-old Krenwinkel remained in Los Angeles with her father until she graduated from Westchester High School. For a time she taught Catechism (Roman Catholic religious instruction) and considered becoming a nun. She decided to attend the Jesuit college, Spring Hill College, in Mobile, Alabama. Within one semester, however, Patricia dropped out and moved back to California. Moving into her half-sister's apartment in Manhattan Beach, she found an office job as a processing clerk.\n\nShe met Charles Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967, along with Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner, who were already known as \"Charlie's Girls\". In later interviews, Krenwinkel stated that she had slept with Manson the first night they met, and that he was the first person who told her she was beautiful. Mesmerized by Manson's charisma and starved for attention, she decided to go to San Francisco with him and the other two girls, leaving behind her apartment, car, and last paycheck. \n\nAs the Manson Family grew, Katie (as Krenwinkel was now known) and the others went on a drug- and sex-filled 18-month tour of the American west in an old school bus. She would later recount an idealized version of The Family's early days: \"We were just like wood nymphs and wood creatures. We would run through the woods with flowers in our hair, and Charles would have a small flute\". In the summer of 1968, Krenwinkel and fellow Family member, Ella Bailey, were hitchhiking around Los Angeles when Beach Boys founding member and drummer, Dennis Wilson, picked them up. After being invited to his home while he continued on to a recording session, Krenwinkel and Bailey were able to contact the Family and tell them of their new \"crash pad\". When Wilson returned later that evening, he found Manson and the rest of the Family eating his food, sleeping in his bedrooms, and partying inside and outside his home. After causing Wilson financial problems, Manson and the rest of the Family left his mansion. \n\nAfter the hippie movement wound down in 1969, Krenwinkel and the Family decided to live in isolation from the rest of society. They persuaded the blind and elderly George Spahn to allow them to live on his property, and converged on Spahn's Ranch in the hills above the San Fernando Valley. Krenwinkel acted as a mother figure to the Family's several children and was seen as an intense and devoted follower of Charles Manson.\n\nKrenwinkel was a participant in the infamous murders on August 9, 1969 at 10050 Cielo Drive, home of actress Sharon Tate and her husband director Roman Polanski. Tate was more than eight months pregnant. After fellow Family member Charles \"Tex\" Watson shot and killed teenager Steven Parent in his car in the estate's driveway, Watson, Susan Atkins, and Krenwinkel entered the house, surprising all inside. When mayhem ensued, Krenwinkel dragged coffee heiress Abigail Folger from her bedroom to the living room, fought with her, and stabbed her. When Folger tried to escape following the first round of stabbing, Patricia chased Folger as she ran outside screaming. According to Patricia, she pinned Folger to the ground and further stabbed her; the victim pleaded with her to stop by saying, \"Stop, I'm already dead.\" Krenwinkel continued to stab Folger so brutally that Folger's white nightgown appeared red to police investigators the following day. After stabbing Folger, Krenwinkel went back inside and summoned Watson, who also stabbed Folger. During her trial, Krenwinkel said, \"...I stabbed her and I kept stabbing her.\" When asked how it felt, Krenwinkel replied: \"Nothing, I mean, what is there to describe? It was just there, and it was right.\"\n\nOn Manson's orders, Krenwinkel participated willingly in more killing the following night. Krenwinkel recounted during her December 29, 2016 parole hearing the events of the night of August 10, 1969. Along with Manson, Watson, Atkins, Steve Grogan, Leslie Van Houten, and Linda Kasabian, Krenwinkel went to the home of Southern California grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, on Waverly Drive in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. After Manson and Watson tied up the couple, Manson left, giving orders to Van Houten and Krenwinkel to go with Watson and to do whatever he said. Watson told Krenwinkel and Van Houten to take Mrs. LaBianca into a bedroom and kill her. Leaving Manson, Atkins, Grogan and Kasabian in the car outside, the trio proceeded to kill the couple. \n\nKrenwinkel retrieved a knife from the kitchen drawer. She and Van Houten tied up Mrs. LaBianca with a lamp cord and put a pillowcase over her head. Mrs. LaBianca, who was being held in the master bedroom, could hear the screams and struggling of her husband who was being held in the living room as Watson began stabbing him while he pleaded for his life. She began to struggle. Van Houten ran for Watson in the other room; he told her \"to do something.\" Krenwinkel got a fork from the kitchen and stabbed Mr. LaBianca with it. She used a rag to dip in his blood and wrote on the walls. Once again wielding the knife, Krenwinkel stabbed Rosemary LaBianca while Van Houten held her down. However, the knife bent and she was unable to actually stab the struggling woman. She and Van Houten called to Watson, who came into the master bedroom and gave Van Houten a knife. Van Houten and Watson stabbed her to death. According to testimony from the Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, Mr. LaBianca suffered 26 stab wounds and 14 puncture wounds.\n\nAccording to Watson's book, \"Will You Die for Me?\", he carved the word \"WAR\" on the abdomen of Leno LaBianca's corpse, although the act is sometimes attributed to Krenwinkel. Watson further claims that while he was washing off the LaBianca's blood in the couple's shower, Krenwinkel repeatedly stabbed the already dead Leno LaBianca and left a carving fork embedded in his abdomen and a small steak knife protruding from his neck. In an interview, Krenwinkel admitted to stabbing Mr. LaBianca with the fork and leaving it in his abdomen. Both utensils were taken from the kitchen. Krenwinkel then wrote \"DEATH TO PIGS\" in blood on the wall, and \"HeaLter Skelter\" [sic] on the refrigerator.\n\nWhen later questioned, Krenwinkel claimed the only thing going through her mind at the time was that \"Now he won't be sending any of his children off to war.\" Before hitchhiking back to Spahn Ranch, the trio stayed a while in the LaBianca home — eating food, showering, and playing with the LaBiancas' two dogs. Meanwhile, Manson, Atkins, Kasabian, and Grogan reportedly drove around Los Angeles looking for someone else to kill, to no avail.\n\nWhile the Los Angeles police were busy investigating any leads they could find, back at Spahn Ranch rumors of the involvement of Krenwinkel and the others in the now-famous murders began to circulate. Due to an unrelated investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, parts of stolen cars were spotted in and around the ranch by helicopter. One week after the murders on August 16, 1969, Krenwinkel, Manson and other Family members were rounded up by police and arrested on suspicion of auto theft. Because of a date error, the search warrant was later ruled invalid and the group was released. Following this incident, the Family started to lose members one by one, due to the raid, the possible involvement of the Family in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and the newly-rumored murder of Spahn Ranch hand Donald \"Shorty\" Shea.\n\nBecause of the August 16th raid, Manson decided to move his \"Family\" to another ranch, this time near Death Valley. Barker Ranch now became home for the Family, including Krenwinkel. During their stay from August through October, the group spent its time converting cars it had stolen into dune buggies, but it didn't take long for law enforcement to catch up with Manson and his followers. On October 10, 1969, the group was once again arrested. This time, Patricia's father bailed her out of jail, but she immediately returned to Barker Ranch. Upon her return, Manson (who was not present at the October 10 raid), ordered her to go to Alabama and live with her mother until he sent word for her to come home. The orders to return never came, however, because of Manson's subsequent arrest on October 12 at Barker Ranch.\n\nMeanwhile, still in jail, Susan Atkins began to tell all about their involvement in the Tate-LaBianca murders to cellmates Virginia Graham and Veronica \"Ronnie\" Howard. Because of Atkins' confessions and Howard's disclosure, Krenwinkel was arrested near her aunt's home in Mobile, Alabama on December 1, 1969. The following day, Krenwinkel was indicted for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. After her arrest, Krenwinkel claimed that she had gone to Alabama because she feared Manson would find her and kill her, hence her attempt to fight extradition to California. Finally in February 1970, she waived extradition proceedings and voluntarily returned to California to stand trial with defendants Manson, Van Houten, and Atkins. Watson was tried separately at a later date after unsuccessfully fighting extradition from his home state of Texas.\n\nKrenwinkel's trial attorney, Paul Fitzgerald, suggested that although her fingerprints were found inside the Tate home, she might just have been \"an invited guest or friend.\" Seemingly unfazed by the possibility of a guilty verdict and a death sentence, Krenwinkel reportedly spent much of the trial drawing doodles of devils and other satanic figures. All during the trial, she remained loyal to Manson and the Family. Demonstration of this unity included walking hand-in-hand with Atkins and Van Houten, singing songs written by Manson, as well as shaving their heads and carving an \"X\" in their foreheads, just as Manson was doing.\n\nAt the end of the nine-month trial, Krenwinkel was convicted of all counts and sentenced to death on March 29, 1971. She and the other two women were transferred from Los Angeles to the California Institution for Women (CIW) near Corona, California.\n\nKrenwinkel arrived onto California's death row on April 28, 1971. She received a death sentence for seven counts of first-degree murder for the August 9, 1969, deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski and Jay Sebring and the August 10, 1969, deaths of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. She was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. The death sentence imposed on Krenwinkel (as well as Manson, Watson, Atkins, and Van Houten) was automatically commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court's \"People v. Anderson\" decision invalidated all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. At the beginning of her new life in prison, Krenwinkel remained loyal to Manson and the Family, but in time began to break away from them. In distancing herself from Manson, she has maintained a perfect prison record, and received a Bachelor's degree in Human Services from the University of La Verne. She is active with prison programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and along with these involvements, she has also taught illiterate prisoners how to read. Reportedly, Krenwinkel writes both poetry and music, plays the guitar, plays on a prison volleyball team and gives dance lessons.\n\nKrenwinkel, still incarcerated, is now at the California Institution for Women in Chino, California. In an interview conducted by Diane Sawyer in 1994, Krenwinkel stated: \"I wake up every day knowing that I'm a destroyer of the most precious thing, which is life; and I do that because that's what I deserve, is to wake up every morning and know that.\" During that same interview, Patricia expressed the most remorse for what she did to Folger, telling Diane Sawyer, \"That was just a young woman that I killed, who had parents. She was supposed to live a life and her parents were never supposed to see her dead.\" In that same interview, she said that Manson was \"absolutely lying\" about not ordering the murders. She said, \"There wasn't one thing done--that was even allowed to be done--without his express permission.\"\n\nKrenwinkel's initial parole consideration hearing was held on July 17, 1978.\n\nDuring a 2004 parole hearing, when asked who she would place at the top of the list of people she has harmed, Patricia Krenwinkel responded, \"Myself.\" She was denied parole following that hearing because, according to the panel, Krenwinkel still posed an \"unacceptable risk to public safety\". At her January 2011 hearing, the two-member parole board said that the 63-year-old Krenwinkel would not be eligible for parole again for seven years. The panel said they were swayed by the memory of the crimes, along with 80 letters which came from all over the world urging Patricia Krenwinkel's continued incarceration.\n\nIn Krenwinkel's parole hearing on December 29, 2016, the decision was postponed to investigate the defense claim that Krenwinkel was suffering from battered woman syndrome at the hands of Manson during the time of the murders. Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate said how Krenwinkel \"...totally minimised her action and blamed everything on other people the whole hearing,\" she goes on to talk about how Krenwinkel was not a victim because she chose to participate in the murders and stay with the family so she should be accountable for her actions. The parole hearing resumed on June 22, 2017 when the 69-year-old Krenwinkel was denied parole. She will be eligible to have another parole suitability hearing in five years. \nAfter her 2017 review, Krenwinkel has been denied parole fourteen times.\n\nPatricia Krenwinkel was portrayed by actress Christina Hart in the made-for-TV film \"Helter Skelter\" (1976), and 28 years later in the film's remake by actress Allison Smith. She was also portrayed by Leslie Orr in the 2003 film \"The Manson Family\", by Kaniehtiio Horn in \"Leslie, My Name Is Evil\" (2009), by Vanessa Zima in \"Manson Girls\" (2013) and Serena Lorien in \"House of Manson\" (2014). Olivia Klaus made a documentary short film on Krenwinkel, \"Life After Manson.\" The film was shown at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and included her first interview in 20 years. On television, Madisen Beaty portrayed Krenwinkel in the 2015–16 series \"Aquarius\", while Leslie Grossman portrayed her in the 2017 season of .\n\nIn Gilmore Girls season 2, episode 12, \"Richard in Stars Hallow\" Patricia Krenwinkel is referenced by Lorelai Gilmore while arguing with her father Richard Gilmore by saying if Rory Gilmore was saying she was going to \"spend the weekend with Patricia Krenwinkel, and I say 'OK well grab a sweater,' you'll just have to deal!\" This is met with confusion by her father, Richard, who does not seem to know who Patricia Krenwinkel is.\n\n"}

Nampillai's disciple was Sri Vadakku Thiruveethippillai. Out of great affection for his acharya, Vadakku Thiruveethippillai named his first son as Pillai Lokacharya (\"anbAl anna thiru nAmaththai Athariththu mannu pugazh maintharkku sARRukaiyAl\").\n\nOnce Nampillai asked Vadakkuth Thiruveethip pillai's mother Ammi about her welfare. She told him that she was sad as her family was not being furthered because her son was staying away from his wife and was not having a child. Nampillai asked her to bring her daughter-in-law to his presence. When she did, he told her daughter-in-law that she would give birth to a son just like himself. He then called his disciple Vadakkuth Thiruveethippillai and told him to follow proper gruhastAsrama and that it would not cause any damage to his vairAgya.\n\nVadakkuth Thiruveethippillai obeyed his acharya's words and in time a son was born to him; he named him Pillai Lokacharya out of respect for his acharya. While worshipping Lord Renganatha with his disciple's son on his Apthapoorthi day, Lord commanded Sri Nampillai to bless Sri Vadakku Thiruveethippillai to have another son like Lord himself. The second son was named Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Nayanar, after Lord Renganatha. Sri Pillai Lokacharya was born as the amsam of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal in the month of Aippasi under the star Thiruvonam, in the year 1205 CE.\n\nIn their youth, both brothers learned everything from their acharya Nampillai as well as from their father. They grew up like Sri Rama and Sri Lakshmana.\n\nIn foreword to his vyakhyanam of Sri Vacana Bhushanam, Manavala Mamunigal tells of the following event. Once upon a time Kanchi Devaraja Perumal out of His nirhEduka krupa selected one Manarpakkam Nambi, and appearing in his dream taught him some special rahasya meanings. He also advised him to go live in Srirangam and wait for Him there where He will teach him in further detail those meanings. Manarpakkam Nambi moved to Srirangam, built a small temple and quietly lived there worshipping Him and keeping the meanings revealed by Him to himself. One day Pillai Lokacharya came to that temple with his close disciples and seeing the quiet nature of the place began teaching them the meanings of rahasyas. Nambi listening from inside noted that these meanings were the same as taught by Lord Varadaraja to him. He then came out and bowing at Pillai Lokacharya's feet, asked him \"AvarO neer?\" – Are you the one (the same as Devaraja)?. Pillai Lokacharya replied \"(aam aavadhen?) \"Yes, what for that?\". Manarpakkam Nambi explained his dream to him. This is the avatara rahasyam of Pillai Lokacharya.\n\nPillai Lokacharya then took him as his disciple and taught him the meanings of the rahasyas. Nambi then told him that Lord Varadaraja had asked him to request Pillai Lokacharya to collect these meanings as a book. The book thus written is Sri Vacana Bhushanam. Manavala Mamunigal speaks of the greatness of this work in several pasurams in his UpadesaratthinamAlai. Mamunigal also says that this is the greatest of Pilla Lokacharya's works (\"innaruLAl seytha kalai yAvaiyilum\").\n\nBoth Sri Pillai Lokacharya and Sri Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Nayanar remained as Brahmachaaris to make sure that their vyraakyam is not hindered. Because of this only, they were boldly able to advise that for a Sri Vaishnava, leading a marriage life even with his wife is not good.\n\nPillai Lokacharya's primary disciples were Sri Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Nayanar, Koorakuloththama Dasa, Manarpakkam Nambi, Kollikavala Dasa (Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Pillai), KotturilaNNar and Vilanjsolai Pillai.\n\nAlso at a young age Srisailesa (Thiruvaymozhi Pillai) and Thirunaaveerudaiyapiran DaatharaNNar became his disciples. The former is the acharya of Sri Manavala Mamunigal and the latter is his father. Mamunigal's father was Kollikavala Dasa's disciple at Sikkil Kidaram and married his daughter. Thiruvaymozhi Pillai learned everything from Koorakuloththama Dasa. Thus, Mamunigal gained the great wealth of sambandham with Pillai Lokacharya through his acharya (Srisailesa), his father and his maternal grandfather.\n\nWhile Pillai Lokacharya lived in Srirangam heading Emperumanar's Darsanam, the Islamic invasion of the city occurred. To save the temple and Periya Perumal, His sannidhi was covered with brick stones and a different vigraha was kept in front by Sri Pillai Lokacharya. Pillai Lokacharya left Srirangam along with Namperumal and Nacchimaars ahead of the invasion. While going through a forest they were attacked by thieves who stole all the jewellery and vessels of Namperumal. Pillai Lokacharya gave them everything he had and even rejected the items when they returned them to him. Happy that they left Namperumal with him, he continued on. They then reached a small town called Jyothishkudi, near othakadai, Madurai. Here Pillai Lokacharya fell ill due to a fall from a nearby hill (today known as Yanamalai) and reached His lotus feet. The year was 1311 CE and the day was jyEshtha suddha dvAdasi. At his death bed he advised his disciples such as Koorakuloththama Dasa and Vilanjsolai Pillai that Srisailesa was working for the king at Madurai and that they should bring him back into the Srivaishnava fold so that he could lead the darsanam. His Samadhi temple still exists, 1 km from the Narasimha temple at Othakadai, near Madurai.\n\nWhile Swamy was about to leave this world and reach Achaaryan's Lotus feet, he started touching the ants and other such insects near him. (All such animals will get to reach Sri Vaikunta if they have been touched by a Sri Vaishnava.) Such was Sri Pillai Lokacharya's Karunya towards the living beings. Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Nayanar reached Achaaryan's lotus feet at his 65th year. Pillai Lokacharya lived to the age of 106 years.\n\nSri Pillai Lokacharya authored Ragasya Granthas with mercy in His heart towards the samsaaris. He has authored the following 18 Ragasya Granthas, collectively known as Astaadasa Ragasya.\n\nAll these works are done in Manipravaalam (a mix of Tamil and Sanskrit languages).\n\nVilanjsolai Pillai has praised Pillai Lokacharya's work Sri Vachana Booshanam by singing \"Saptha Kaathai\" and Sri Vedanta Desikan sung \"Lokacharya Panchaasat\" (citation needed) in praise of Sri Pillai Lokacharya.\n\n\n"}

Swahili speakers on the Swahili Coast may also use it for president. It is translated as \"president\" in Arabic, and as \"boss\" in Persian. In Urdu, the word \"Rais\" is also used similarly to the English term \"old money,\" as the opposite or antonym of nouveau riche, a person who has accummulated considerable wealth within his or her generation. \n\nFrom Arabic, via Persian, this word came into Ottoman Turkish as Reis, and into Urdu as \"raees\", which means a person belonging to the aristocracy of noble distinction. When the book \"The Pleasure of Philosophy\" by Will Durant was translated into Urdu, by Syed Abid Ali Abid, he translated the word aristocracy with the Urdu word \"raisiyyat\" (). \n\nIn the rural areas of the Punjab, the word is also used for the head of an ancient tribe or a person belonging to old landed aristocracy. The adjective 'Azam' great, is also added to mean 'the great rais'. This term, as well as the term יושב-ראש (Chairman), are used by Israeli media to refer to the President of the Palestinian National Authority, as opposed to נשיא (President).\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed, commentator Bret Stephens referred to Palestinian late leader Yasir Arafat as \"the rais.\"\n\nIn British India the landed gentry in Muslim societies often used the word \"rais\" to describe their aristocratic position held in society. The term \"rais\" was also often used by Muslims when making deed of endowments in their community. Although, the word meant 'chief' or 'leader' legal documents used it in the context of 'landlords' or landowners. Other terms such as \"malik\" or \"Zamindar\" also appeared as 'landlords' or ‘landowners’, even though these titles implied that the individual who bore them was more ruler than proprietor.\n\nHowever, when describing any aspect of the management of their holdings 'rais or zamindars' employed regal terminology. The \"rais\" sat upon a throne (\"masand or gaddi\"). Riayat, whom British preferred to call tenants or cultivators were literally subjects. When a \"rais\" met with his \"riayat\" he described himself as holding court (\"darbar\"). The money which \"riayat\" paid his lord was tribute (\"nazrana\") not rent. The place where he paid the tribute was called a \"kachari\", just as government revenue office, and the clerks who collected, kept accounts and ensured tributes kept coming on time where known by their Mughal courtly styles of (\"dewans\") and (\"sipahis\" – a horse trooper).\n"}

Scott, also of the MCI. During the initial years of his doctoral research in the 1970s, it was Arvind P. Nirmal, CNI (the proponent of Dalit theology) who supervised and enabled Yesurathnam to push through his doctoral studies.\n\nProfessor Jutta Sperber, of the University of Münster, Germany, in a work about Dialogical Theology with special reference to the activities of the World Council of Churches and its unit on Dialogue, has quoted the work of Yesurathnam on the Christian-Muslim dialogue. Similarly, Sonia Calza while researching on interfaith dialogue with reference to Hinduism and Christianity, referred to Yesurathnam's work on Dialogical Theology while writing about the contribution of Henri Le Saux.\n\nYesurathnam, also wrote on the work on the concept of Avatara, which has been cited by other scholars. Bob Robinson noted this work with special emphasis on the relationship to Christianity and Steven Tsoukalas quoted Yesurathnam's work on the forms of Avatara.\n\nInter-disciplinary writings by Yesurathnam have struck new ground in inculturation as espoused by Swamy Amalorananda and the New Testament Scholar Suppogu Joseph, STBC (2007) had made a sustained research exploring possibilities for the Gospel to adapt itself to the multi-religious ethos of India. Earlier proponents who experimented with Contextualization, emphasizing on the presentation of Christ adapting to the Indian culture, were Robert de Nobili, SJ, E. Stanley Jones, MCI, and B. V. Subbamma, AELC, who together were known for their contribution to the Christian Ashram Movement in India.\n\nYesurathnam's definition of Contextualization has been acknowledged by scholars as a resourceful addition. Charles E. Van Engen and Akintunde E. Akinade refer to the word \"contextualization\" as defined by Yesurathnam.\n\nYesurathnam cautioned the Church against falling into traditionalism. During the Golden Jubilee of the founding of the Uniting church, the CSI held in Chennai in 1997, Yesurathnam spoke on the ills befalling the Church in India,\n\nFrom his youth, Yesurathnam was inspired by the work of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Christian missions in Telangana. He entered the ministry of the Catholic Church through the Diocese of Medak, becoming a ministerial candidate during the bishopric of Frank Whittaker, the first Bishop-in-Medak. He studied at a seminary in Bangalore for spiritual formation and was ordained in 1967 by Bishop Eber Priestley, the then Bishop-in-Medak.\n\nAfter initial schooling at the mission schools founded by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS) in Telangana, Yesurathnam decided to take up priesthood. Bishops Frank Whittaker and Eber Priestley, successively, became his Spiritual Confessors and led him to take up spiritual studies at the United Theological College, Bangalore during 1963-1967. He was awarded a B. D. degree.\n\nIn 1969, Yesurathnam was recalled from parish work and sent to the Protestant Regional Theologiate in Bangalore for further spiritual studies that lasted until 1972 and resulted in the award of a Master of Theology degree after research under Joshua Russell Chandran of the CSI.\n\nAfter a five-year teaching ministry that began in 1974 at the Andhra Christian Theological College, Secunderabad, Yesurathnam qualified to undertake doctoral level research in 1978 and was granted a five-year study leave. Yesurathnam's Bishop during that period, B. G. Prasada Rao, made efforts to ensure that Yesurathnam was able to join his \"alma mater\", the United Theological College, Bangalore, where he was able to take up research in the discipline of systematic theology under the guidance of Arvind P. Nirmal, CNI. Yesurathnam also came under the tutelage of Stanley Jedidiah Samartha, a leading authority on Dialogical Theology. During the research period between 1978-1982, Yesurathnam was also sent to the University of Birmingham, England, in 1979 for a two-year research exposure through the efforts of Gordon Shaw who ensured his overseas travel and stay in England at Kingsmead College under the Selly Oak Colleges, where he was supervised by Walter Jacob Hollenweger, a leading authority on Pentecostalism.\n\nBy 1981, Yesurathnam returned to the United Theological College and began shaping his doctoral dissertation under the guidance of David C. Scott and by 1982, he rejoined the Andhra Christian Theological College, which by then was being led by the New Testament scholar, K. David, CBCNC and took up his teaching role in systematic theology, but was able to submit his doctoral thesis to the university through his supervisor at the United Theological College and finally in 1987, much before nearing a decade of registering with the university, it awarded the degree of Doctor of Theology.\n\nThough Yesurathnam sought permission from the Senate of Serampore College to publish his doctoral work nearly two decades later, in 2006. His thesis was already being referred by research scholars on works relating to the contribution of Swami Abhishiktananda.\n\nYesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Priestley, then Bishop-in-Medak, and was assigned ministerial functions in the parishes falling under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak and served in Sangareddy and other towns shepherding congregations for nearly a decade until he was recalled in 1974 by then Bishop, H. D. L. Abraham, and reassigned the role of a Spiritual Formator.\n\nIn 1992, when Victor Premasagar vacated the bishopric of Medak on attaining superannuation, the ensuing Sede vacante was contested among whom Yesurathnam stood in the fray for the vacant bishopric, which was overseen by Ryder Devapriam, then Moderator of the Church of South India Synod and a former colleague of Yesurathnam at the Protestant Regional Theologiate. However, the sudden death of Devapriam on 4 September 1992 while in Germany turned the tides for those in fray, resulting in the appointment and subsequent consecration of B. P. Sugandhar.\n\nThe Andhra Christian Theological College (ACTC) relocated from Rajahmundry to Secunderabad. Yesurathnam was invited to join the college in 1974, during the Principalship of Victor Premasagar. In 1993 he was appointed guest professor at the Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal/Bethel in Germany, where he taught until 1994. He then returned to ACTC and was appointed principal under the institution's policy of rotating that office between the various constituent churches in four-year cycles.\n\nYesurathnam took a year's sabbatical leave in 1998 to the Overseas Ministries Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut to continue his research pursuits and rejoined the Theologiate in Secunderabad to teach for two more years until 2001.\n\nWhen the Council for World Mission (CWM) sought missionaries from the CSI, Yesurathnam moved to the International University of the Caribbean, Kingston, Jamaica, where he began his sojourn in the New millennium and served as a theological educator for nearly a decade until his death on 8 August 2011 at the Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.\n\nYesurathnam's works are available in nearly 35 research institutes, comprising seminaries, state universities and research academies across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.\n\n\n"}

On his arrival Telegonus began plundering the island, thinking it was Corcyra (Corfu). Odysseus and his oldest son, Telemachus, defended their city and Telegonus accidentally killed his father with the spine of a stingray. He brought the body back to Aeaea and took Penelope, Odysseus' widow, and Telemachus, Odysseus' son, with him. Circe made them immortal and married Telemachus, while Telegonus made Penelope his wife. With Penelope, he was the father of Italus.\nThis is the story told in the \"Telegony\", an early Greek epic that does not survive except in a summary, but which was attributed to Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene and written as a sequel to the \"Odyssey\". Variants of the story are found in later poets: for example, in a tragedy by Sophocles, \"Odysseus Acanthoplex\" (which also does not survive), Odysseus finds out from an oracle that he is doomed to be killed by his son. He assumes that this means Telemachus, whom he promptly banishes to a nearby island. When Telegonus arrives on Ithaca, he approaches Odysseus' house, but the guards do not admit him to see his father; a commotion arises, and Odysseus, thinking it is Telemachus, rushes out and attacks. In the fighting, he is killed by Telegonus.\n\nIn Italian and Roman mythology, Telegonus became known as the founder of Tusculum, a city just to the southeast of Rome, and sometimes also as the founder of Praeneste, a city in the same region (modern Palestrina). Ancient Roman poets regularly used phrases such as \"walls of Telegonus\" (e.g. Propertius 2.32) or \"Circaean walls\" to refer to Tusculum.\n\nAnother Telegonus was a king of Egypt who was sometimes said to have married the nymph Io.\n\nAnother character of the same name was the son of the sea god Proteus who wrestled with Heracles and lost his life in the battle.

It was made as part of a pair of paintings (the other being \"The Crossing of the Red Sea\") commissioned by Amadeo dal Pozzo, Marchese di Voghera of Turin, a cousin to Cassiano dal Pozzo, Poussin's main sponsor in Rome. By 1685 the pair had passed to the Chevalier de Lorraine and in 1710 they were bought by Benigne de Ragois de Bretonvillers. In 1741 they were bought from Samuel by Sir Jacob Bouverie, whose son William became the first Earl of Radnor. The Earls of Radnor owned the pair from then until 1945, when it was split for the first time and \"The Adoration of the Golden Calf\" bought by the National Gallery in London for £10,000, half of which was contributed by the Art Fund. (\"The Crossing of the Red Sea\" was bought in the same 1945 sale by the National Gallery of Victoria.) It now hangs in Room 19 of the National Gallery, where it and Poussin's \"The Adoration of the Shepherds\" were vandalised with red spray paint on 17 July 2011.\n\n"}

As of 2016 it had a verified circulation of 50,000 and an estimated readership of 150,000; it is the largest Jewish weekly outside New York City. TRIBE Media Corp. also produces the monthly \"TRIBE\" magazine, distributed in Santa Barbara, Malibu, Conejo, Simi and West San Fernando Valleys.\n\nThough independently incorporated, the paper was initially distributed in part by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. The first issue appeared on February 28, 1986. The editor was Gene Lichtenstein, who served until 2000, and the first art director was Katherine Arion, a Romanian-born artist who came to the United States in 1981. After becoming completely independent from the Jewish Federation in 2005, it went through difficulties and its circulation shrunk. Circulation has recovered to 50,000 since then, and the paper has undertaken new initiatives, including expanded internet offerings, live events, a branding and marketing division, JJ Branding, \"TRIBE\" magazine, launched in December 2009, and Jewish Insider. The Jewish Journal, like other news media, faced financial pressures (cutting staff positions and salaries during 2009, though since it has resumed growth in both areas), but it strengthened its financial situation in May 2010, when it received commitments from a group of local Jewish philanthropists for additional funding intended to assure its continuing financial viability.\n\n\"The Jewish Journal\" is recognized as the major Jewish paper in Los Angeles, which has the second-largest Jewish population in the United States. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called \"The Jewish Journal\" \"an influential weekly.\" It has received a number of awards from the Los Angeles Press Club over the years.\n\nThe Jewish Journal's internet presence has increased its profile as a national and worldwide news source. In 2015, the Jewish Journal underwrote the first independent, non-partisan poll of American Jewish opinion regarding the Iran nuclear deal. The poll showed most American Jews favored the deal, and its results received worldwide coverage. In the wake of the Iran deal controversy, a White House press release called the Jewish Journal, “One of the most widely read Jewish publications online.”\n\nIn 2015, Tribe Media Corp. acquired Jewish Insider, a daily news service based in Washington, D.C., started by Max Neuberger. Jewish Insider’s curated newsletter is delivered each morning to a network of top business and political leaders in America, many of whom happen to be Jewish.\n\nJewishjournal.com is ranked by Statcounter, Google Analytics, and Compete.com as having the most monthly unique users of any American Jewish news web site. The web site is notable for its many blogs covering all aspects of Jewish life, including A Jew, by Michael Berenbaum, Foodaism by Rob Eshman, HollywoodJew by Danielle Berrin and Keeping the Faith and Keeping It Real by Ilana Angel. As of May 2016 the site reported about 4 million unique users per month.\n\nDavid Suisssa is the current editor-in-chief and president of the Journal.. Contributing columnists include Ben Shapiro, Karen Lehrman Bloch, Judea Pearl, Tabby Rafael and Jonathan Kirsch, who also serves as Book Editor. Shmuel Rosner is Senior Political Correspondent.\n\nIn the wake of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" terrorist attack, the issue of January 16–22, 2015 was renamed \"Jewish Hebdo\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40001773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40001773", "title": "The Transhumanist Wager", "text": "The Transhumanist Wager\n\nThe Transhumanist Wager is a 2013 science fiction novel by American author Zoltan Istvan. The novel follows the life of Jethro Knights, a philosopher whose efforts to promote transhumanism ultimately lead to a global revolution. It was a first place winner in visionary fiction at the International Book Awards.\n\nProtagonist Jethro Knights studies philosophy and sails around the world to promote indefinite life extension, desiring to live eternally through medicine, science, and technology. Love-interest and physician Zoe Bach, while sharing Knights' philosophical transhumanism, challenges him with her absolute belief in the afterlife, insisting that death is a part of life. Meanwhile, in America, transhumanists are being targeted and killed by Christian terrorists in cahoots with the popular anti-transhumanist Reverend Belinas.\n\nAfter his sailing trip, Knights suffers a devastating personal tragedy at the hands of Christian fundamentalists. At the same time, the United States Government becomes more theocratic and criminalizes transhumanist research, prompting Knights to build an independent floating city and sovereign state, Transhumania, so research can be continued. Governments around the world eventually grow afraid of the radical science being created on Transhumania, and attack the seasteading city. Transhumania successfully defends itself, and Knights attempts to establish a transhuman-inspired civilization.\n\nAppraisals of the novel have been mostly positive. Additionally, the subject matter has been enthusiastically received by sites focusing on topics such as the singularity, artificial intelligence, and futurist issues. Reviewers have compared protagonist Jethro Knights to the character John Galt, from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. Others have compared Istvan's book to Robert Pirsig's philosophical novel \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\" or to Robert A. Heinlein's works.\n\n\"The Transhumanist Wager\" has been widely debated among futurists and has helped popularize transhumanism.\n\nThe book has also been criticized by some transhumanists as being overtly libertarian, anti-egalitarian, and totalitarian, while agreeing with the aim of life extension and admiring the power of the protagonist. Istvan himself admits that in some ways Jethro arguably goes too far, and that a main purpose of writing the book was to start a discussion in the general public about life extension and transhumanism.\n\nThe book introduces the philosophy TEF (Teleological Egocentric Functionalism), Istvan's Three Laws of Transhumanism, and the concept of making a Transhumanist Wager. TEF aims to establish a nonreligious and stronger moral system in people and society needed to successfully contend with coming technological change. Istvan states:\nIstvan's Three Laws of Transhumanism are:\n\n"}

{"id": "142106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142106", "title": "Zoidberg", "text": "Zoidberg\n\nDr. John A. Zoidberg (referred to only by his last name Zoidberg) is a fictional character in the television series \"Futurama\". He is a Decapodian, a crustacean-like species of alien, who works as the staff doctor for \"Planet Express\", despite his poor understanding of human physiology and allusions to his questionable credentials. His character parodies the supposed wealth and automatic respect of modern doctors—for example, his incompetence at human medicine makes him extremely poor despite his profession, and he is implied to be frequently homeless when not at work. The Decapod (named after the actual Decapoda order of ten-footed crustaceans) are an extended parody on Yiddish culture—the bigger joke being that shellfish are not kosher. The writing riffs on the marine theme in a playfully absurd way, with just about any marine Arthropoda or Mollusca being implied to be akin to Zoidberg. Zoidberg is voiced by Billy West, who performs the character with a Yiddish-inflected accent inspired by actors George Jessel and Lou Jacobi.\n\nZoidberg is named after an Apple II game that series writer David X. Cohen created in high school called \"Zoid\", similar to the game \"Qix\". The game was rejected by Brøderbund. One of Cohen's inspirations for the character of Dr. Zoidberg was the fact that \"\" character Leonard McCoy, the ship's doctor, frequently administered medical treatment to aliens such as Spock, so Cohen wished human characters in \"Futurama\" to be in the uneasy situation of being treated by an alien doctor.\n\nDuring the first season, jokes surrounding Zoidberg usually focused on his incompetence as a doctor, his poor understanding of human anatomy, and the fact that all of his co-workers hate him. His incompetence is aggravated by the fact that he believes himself to be an expert on human anatomy, and will blithely attempt to treat human patients as he would his own species. One of his running traits is his pronunciation of the word \"robot\", pronouncing it \"RO-bət\". His use of English grammar and idioms resembles the stereotypical speech of Jewish people living in the northeastern United States, and elements of Jewish humour, and playful reversals on it, are a theme. As the series progressed, writers gradually introduced the themes that Zoidberg is also poor, homeless, friendless, smelly, undignified, and repulsive—comically opposite the idea that a doctor stereotypically occupies a respectable, wealthy, and romantically desirable role. Regardless of these traits, Zoidberg is often sweet-natured, and will help the crew when the situation calls for it. Zoidberg also generally attempts to make himself look refined, successful and important in front of others, though this illusion is quickly dashed when pointed out.\n\nStanding 5 ft. 8 in. (173 cm), Zoidberg is the company doctor at Planet Express. Although he claims expertise in human medicine, particularly internal medicine, his knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is poor. He has been shown as unable to tell the difference between robots and humans (or human males and females), believes food is digested in the heart, and that humans have multiple mouths and a dorsal fin. His only knowledge of humans seems to come from television advertisements, although his skills as a physician generally vary: in \"Put Your Head on My Shoulders\" he manages to successfully transplant Fry's head onto Amy's body after Fry's body incurs massive trauma in a vehicular accident that requires extensive repair, but in \"Into the Wild Green Yonder\" he incorrectly declares Fry dead only for him to wake up a few seconds later. In \"Bender's Big Score\", he performs several limb reattachments to moderate success. It may be assumed that advances in medical technology have made limb and head reattachment a simple process, as in \"Bender's Big Score\" head reattachment is shown to be little more than applying a paste to the area and placing the head back on (a process that works even if the head is on backwards, as shown). In \"Parasites Lost\", due to his incompetence as a physician, he comes to the conclusion that Fry, who is frequently injured, is a hypochondriac, an accusation he makes when Fry sits before Zoidberg with a pipe through his chest. He claims to be an M.D., but states in \"A Clone of My Own\" that he lost his medical degree in a volcano. However, he later states in \"The Duh-Vinci Code\" that his doctorate is in art history (as opposed to medicine). Other intimations to his dubious medical training include the episode \"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\", in which he comments, \"I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could really use a lozenge.\"\n\nDespite his career as a physician, Zoidberg is repeatedly identified as living in poverty, lonely and desperate for friendship and attention. The crew are often disgusted by his foul habits, such as squirting ink or eating from trash cans, though he is mostly oblivious to their true feelings about him, having referred to Hermes Conrad and Bender as friends. Hermes seems to have the most intense dislike of Zoidberg, seeing him as even more expendable than the rest of the crew. However, when Fry reads Hermes' mind in \"Into the Wild Green Yonder\", it is revealed that Hermes sees him as \"pathetic but lovable\". Zoidberg briefly becomes a hero when he saves Earth from enslavement to his own kind in \"A Taste of Freedom\". Fry and Professor Farnsworth are usually the only ones to refer to Zoidberg as a friend, and in \"Bender's Big Score\", in which Zoidberg says, \"He was the only one of you who never struck me!\" while attending Fry's memorial. Zoidberg has ambitions to be a stand-up comedian, but he is entirely unsuccessful at this endeavor. In one episode, his uncle, the silent hologram star Harold Zoid (a parody of Harold Lloyd), advises him to give up on comedy and finance a film whose script Zoid is writing.\n\nThe reason that the Professor continues to employ Zoidberg as the staff physician, despite his apparent incompetence is revealed in the eighth-season episode, \"The Tip of the Zoidberg\". The Professor is under the impression that he had been infected with the fatal disease hyper-malaria, contracted during a covert quasi-military mission for Mom. The Professor had asked Zoidberg to promise to kill him when the latent disease manifested itself, and Zoidberg agreed. In that episode it is also explained that Zoidberg is, in fact, a very competent physician \"for all other races except humans\". Planet Express' main competitor, Mom, whom Zoidberg knows on a first name basis as \"Carol\", states that Zoidberg is \"the best in the business\" when it comes to alien anatomy; \"at his price level\". Unlike all of the other characters, Mom addresses Zoidberg with great respect and admiration. Mom tells Zoidberg that he could have been a millionaire with his own research lab if he had worked for her. Mom also asks Zoidberg why he has stayed with Farnsworth through the years; Zoidberg replied that it is because Farnsworth is his friend.\n\nWhen frightened or fleeing from danger or trouble, Zoidberg makes a high-pitched whooping sound, similar to Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, or squirts ink at his attacker. It is revealed in \"The Cryonic Woman\" that one of Zoidberg's fantasies is to become a grandmother. \"A Taste of Freedom\" and \"Bender's Game\" indicate that Zoidberg harbored a childhood dream of working in show business as a comedian or song-and-dance man, but that his parents pushed him to become a doctor.\n\nZoidberg is depicted as being ignorant of human customs, and socially inept, to the point of inspiring great aggravation in others. In \"Where the Buggalo Roam\", during his stay at the ranch of Amy Wong's parents, he bathes in their champagne, breaks their television, fertilizes the caviar before Amy's father eats it, draws mustaches on several portraits around the house, tears up their couch, fills their pool with brine shrimp, and refers to the ranch as \"Rancho Zoidberg\", enraging the Wongs.\n\nZoidberg's race, the Decapodians—from the sandy, beach-like planet Decapod 10—are crustaceans, generally lobster-like in appearance—though they have been called squids, crabs or crawdads—with lobster-like claws, mouth tentacles, a hard exoskeleton, a fleshy, boneless interior, a fin that appears atop their heads during mating season or extreme anger, an ink pouch, two stomachs (one saltwater and one freshwater), four hearts, gonopores, a gland that stinks when Decapodians are bored and a complex system of internal organs, \"most of which are either redundant or unnecessary.\" He is not fazed when one of his hearts is removed by an alien autopsy team of human doctors, saying \"Take it, take it, I have four of them!\" in \"Roswell That Ends Well\", and loses various other useless organs in that episode during the autopsy. Zoidberg has been depicted as able to consume things not considered food by humans, such as fish bones, wood, and chess pieces. Decapodians are able to molt their shell, like a lobster, leaving behind a whole exoskeleton - a trait which Zoidberg has used to fake his own death on occasion. In the episode \"Bendin' in the Wind\", Zoidberg produces tie-dye blue pearls after consuming large amounts of dirt. Zoidberg also habitually eats clothing and once, an Earth flag. Given that he refers to clothes as food and considers them a kind of delicacy, it may be that Decapodians themselves consume clothes. In \"Möbius Dick\", it is revealed that Zoidberg spontaneously grows hair in moments of extreme fright. At one point in all Decapodians' lives, they enter a mating phase, or \"The Frenzy\" as they call it, which causes them to behave in a neurotic and manic way. During this chaotic time, their behavior is dictated by the tiny brain located in their rumps. They also develop incredible super strength, their head fin comes out for mating displays, their stink glands increase production and the males become saturated with male jelly as the females become engorged with eggs. In the episode \"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\", it is indicated that once Decapodians mate, they die, but this could only be from the frenzy, as Zoidberg's parents were still alive after his conception.\n\nThe episode \"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\" indicates that young Decapodians progress through various crustacean, invertebrate, and fish-like larval forms before reaching their adult form such as coral, a starfish, a sea sponge, and clam. However, in the episode \"A Taste of Freedom\", a young Zoidberg is seen with his typical humanoid form.\n\nDr. Zoidberg is also a skilled theremin player, and is the only person ever seen in the series to be 'good' enough to receive a present from Robot Santa. He is an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters, and a talented hand-to-claw combatant; he severs Fry's arm in an honor-duel (\"Claw-Plach\") and eventually fights and defeats the dangerous robot Clamps.\n\nDr. Zoidberg finally finds happiness in the episode \"Stench and Stenchibility\" when he meets and starts dating a flower merchant named Marianne, who suffers from anosmia. He performs a \"nose transplant\" to give her a sense of smell, though he is afraid that once she smells him, she will immediately reject him. Serendipitously, Marianne turns out to abhor the smell of flowers, instead vastly \"preferring\" Zoidberg's aroma. She becomes a waste collector and the two continue dating.\n\nBy the end of the series, Zoidberg has largely corrected his medical blind spot concerning human anatomy, as demonstrated by Marianne's transplant and his earlier complete re-assembling of Hermes's body from cast-off parts.\n"}
