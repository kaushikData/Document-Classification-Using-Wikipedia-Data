She also mentions their great compassionate help for humanity and such lesser powers of the adept as being able to take active control of elemental spirits as well as the physical and astral (conditions of non-adepts.\n\nIn Alice Bailey's body of writing she outlines a hierarchy of spiritual evolution and an initiatory path along which an individual may choose to advance. In her works an Adept is defined as a being who has taken five of the seven initiations.\n\nVarious occult organizations have steps in which an initiate may ascend in their own magical system. Some call these steps degrees or grades.\n\nIn the initiatory system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an adept is one who has taken the oath of the 5=6 grade and has been granted the title Adeptus Minor. Symbolically this degree represents a spiritual aspirant who, having mastered the union of the four elements under an upright and balanced spirit, is allowed passage from the \"Portal of the Vault of the Adepti\" into the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz in the center of the Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation, Abiegnus, at the center of the universe. The grade of Adeptus Minor and subsequent grades, Adeptus Major, and Adeptus Exemptus form the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, also called the Rosæ Rubeæ et Aureæ Crucis (The Ruby Rose and Golden Cross). These grades correspond to the kabbalistic sephirah of Tiphereth, Geburah, and Chesed respectively.\n\nThe oath of the Adeptus Minor includes a provision to \"unite myself with my higher and Divine Genius\", a process which is more commonly referred to (by way of Aleister Crowley) as Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. To undertake this process the Adeptus Minor must reconfirm the work of earlier grades (Zelator through Philosophus) with their newfound knowledge before passing to the Adeptus Major degree, as a full-fledged adept.\n\nAleister Crowley, who formed the A∴A∴, restructured the Golden Dawn system. This system still holds to three forms of adept.\n\n\nThe Temple of Set calls their steps degrees, and places adept second. Its system is as follows:\n\n\nAlso distinguished as degrees, the Illuminates of Thanateros, is a newer style of magic called chaos magic, which places adept closer to the top of their system.\n\n\nThose who practice esoteric arts such as theurgy, and Kabbalah are familiar with the word \"adept\". In the traditions of esoteric Christianity and ritual magic, an adept is one who is skilled or profound, but not a master in these arts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "89728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89728", "title": "Akhenaten", "text": "Akhenaten\n\nAkhenaten (; also spelled Echnaton, Akhenaton,\nIkhnaton,\nand Khuenaten;\nmeaning \"Effective for Aten\"), known before the fifth year of his reign as Amenhotep IV (sometimes given its Greek form, \"Amenophis IV\", and meaning \"Amun Is Satisfied\"), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty who ruled for 17 years and died perhaps in 1336 BC or 1334 BC. He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten, which is sometimes described as monolatristic, henotheistic, or even quasi-monotheistic. An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars, and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god, giving the solar deity a status above mere gods.\n\nAkhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt's traditional religion, but the shifts were not widely accepted. After his death, his monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from the king lists. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as \"the enemy\" or \"that criminal\" in archival records.\n\nHe was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at Amarna. Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh, and a mummy found in the tomb KV55, which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton, is likely that of Akhenaten. DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun, but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned.\n\nModern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun (even though Tutankhamun's mother was not Nefertiti, but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady), partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish.\n\nThe future Akhenaten was a younger son of Amenhotep III and Chief Queen Tiye. The eldest son Crown Prince Thutmose was recognized as the heir of Amenhotep III but he died relatively young and the next in line for the throne was a prince named Amenhotep.\n\nThere is much controversy around whether Amenhotep IV succeeded to the throne on the death of his father Amenhotep III or whether there was a coregency (lasting as long as 12 years according to some Egyptologists). Current literature by Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, Peter Dorman and other scholars comes out strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favour of either no coregency or a brief one lasting one to two years at the most. Other literature by Donald Redford, William Murnane, Alan Gardiner and more recently by Lawrence Berman in 1998 contests the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.\n\nIn February 2014, the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities announced what it called conclusive evidence that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least 8 years. The evidence came from the inscriptions found in the Luxor tomb of Vizier Amenhotep-Huy. A team of Spanish archeologists has been working at this tomb.\nAmenhotep IV was crowned in Thebes and there he started a building program. He decorated the southern entrance to the precincts of the temple of Amun-Re with scenes of his worshiping Re-Harakhti. He soon decreed the construction of a temple dedicated to the Aten in Eastern Karnak. This Temple of Amenhotep IV was called the Gempaaten (\"The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten\"). The Gempaaten consisted of a series of buildings, including a palace and a structure called the Hwt Benben (named after the Benben stone) which was dedicated to Queen Nefertiti. Other Aten temples constructed at Karnak during this time include the Rud-menu and the Teni-menu, which may have been constructed near the Ninth Pylon. During this time he did not repress the worship of Amun, and the High Priest of Amun was still active in the fourth year of his reign. \nThe king appears as Amenhotep IV in the tombs of some of the nobles in Thebes: \nKheruef (TT192), Ramose (TT55) and the tomb of Parennefer (TT188).\n\nIn the tomb of Ramose, Amenhotep IV appears on the west wall in the traditional style, seated on a throne with Ramose appearing before the king. On the other side of the doorway, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are shown in the window of appearance, with the Aten depicted as the sun disc. In the Theban tomb of Parennefer, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are seated on a throne with the sun disk depicted over the king and queen.\n\nAmong the latter-known documents referring to Amenhotep IV are two copies of a letter from the Steward Of Memphis Apy (or Ipy) to the pharaoh. The documents were found in Gurob and are dated to regnal year 5, third month of the Growing Season, day 19.\n\nOn day 13, Month 8, in the fifth year of his reign, the king arrived at the site of the new city Akhetaten (now known as Amarna). A month before that Amenhotep IV had officially changed his name to Akhenaten. Amenhotep IV changed most of his 5 fold titulary in year 5 of his reign. The only name he kept was his prenomen or throne name of Neferkheperure.\n\nAkhenaton placed much emphasis on the worship of the Egyptian sun which can be seen from many artistic depictions of a connection between the Pharoh and his family. Some debate has focused on the extent to which Akhenaten forced his religious reforms on his people. Certainly, as time drew on, he revised the names of the Aten, and other religious language, to increasingly exclude references to other gods; at some point, also, he embarked on the wide-scale erasure of traditional gods' names, especially those of Amun. Some of his court changed their names to remove them from the patronage of other gods and place them under that of Aten (or Ra, with whom Akhenaten equated the Aten). Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose (\"child of the moon god\", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous Nefertiti bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called Thutmose (\"child of Thoth\"). An overwhelmingly large number of faience amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the National Museum of Scotland) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.\n\nFollowing Akhenaten's death, change was gradual at first. Within a decade a comprehensive political, religious and artistic reformation began promoting a return of Egyptian life to the norms it had followed during his father's reign. Much of the art and building infrastructure created during Akhenaten's reign was defaced or destroyed in the period following his death, particularly during the reigns of Horemheb and the early 19th Dynasty kings. Stone building blocks from Akhenaten's construction projects were later used as foundation stones for subsequent rulers' temples and tombs.\n\nStyles of art that flourished during this short period are markedly different from other Egyptian art. In some cases, representations are more naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals and plants, of commoners, and in a sense of action and movement for both non-royal and royal people. However, depictions of members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are extremely stylized, with elongated heads, protruding stomachs, heavy hips, thin arms and legs, and exaggerated facial features. Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family are shown taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, and being caught in mid-action (in traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility). The depictions of action may correspond to the emphasis on the active, creative nurturing of the Aten emphasized in the \"Great Hymn to the Aten\" and elsewhere. \nNefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone (or with her daughters), in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, suggesting that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.\n\nWhy representations of Akhenaten depict him in a bizarre, strikingly androgynous way, remains a vigorously debated question. Religious reasons have been suggested, such as to emulate the creative nature of the Aten, who is called in Amarna tomb texts \"mother and father\" of all that is. Or, it has been suggested, Akhenaten's (and his family's) portraiture exaggerates his distinctive physical traits. Until Akhenaten's mummy is positively identified, such theories remain speculative. Some scholars do identify Mummy 61074, found in KV55, an unfinished tomb in the Valley of the Kings, as Akhenaten's. If so, or if the KV 55 mummy is that of his close relative, Smenkhkare, its measurements tend to support the theory that Akhenaten's depictions exaggerate his actual appearance. Though the mummy consists only of disarticulated bones, the skull is long and has a prominent chin, and the limbs are light and long. In 2007, Zahi Hawass and a team of researchers made CT Scan images of Mummy 61074. They have concluded that the elongated skull, cheek bones, cleft palate, and impacted wisdom tooth suggest that the mummy is the father of Tutankhamun, and thus is Akhenaten.\n\nAs Amenhotep IV, Akhenaten was married to Nefertiti at the very beginning of his reign, and six daughters were identified from inscriptions. Recent DNA analysis has revealed that with one of his biological sisters, the \"Younger Lady\" mummy, Akhenaten fathered Tutankhaten (later Tutankhamen). The parentage of Smenkhkare, his successor, is unknown, and Akhenaten and an unknown wife have been proposed to be his parents.\n\nA secondary wife of Akhenaten named Kiya is known from inscriptions. Some have theorized that she gained her importance as the mother of Tutankhamen, Smenkhkare, or both.\n\nThis is a list of Akhenaten's children (known and theoretical) with suggested years of birth:\n\n\nHis known consorts were:\n\nIt has been proposed that Akhenaten may have taken some of his daughters as sexual consorts, to attempt to father a male heir by them, but this is very debatable. It does seem certain that like his father, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten named at least one daughter as Great Royal Wife, but this does not necessarily indicate she was his sexual consort as the position was also an important ceremonial position.\n\nTwo other lovers have been suggested, but are not widely accepted:\n\n\nThe Amarna Letters, a cache of diplomatic correspondence discovered in modern times at el-Amarna (the modern designation of the site of Akhetaten), have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. This correspondence comprises a priceless collection of incoming messages on clay tablets sent to Akhetaten from various subject rulers through Egyptian military outposts and from the foreign rulers (recognized as \"Great Kings\") of the kingdom of Mitanni, of Babylon, of Assyria, and of Hatti. The governors and kings of Egypt's subject domains also wrote frequently to plead for gold from the pharaoh, and also complained that he had snubbed and cheated them.\n\nEarly in his reign, Akhenaten had conflicts with Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price which Tushratta received for letting his daughter Tadukhepa marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten. Amarna letter EA 27 preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:\n\"I...asked your father Mimmureya for statues of solid cast gold, one of myself and a second statue, a statue of Tadu-Heba [Tadukhepa], my daughter, and your father said, 'Don't talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.' Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. Your father himself recast the statues [i]n the presence of my messengers, and he made them entirely of pure gold...He showed much additional gold, which was beyond measure and which he was sending to me. He said to my messengers, 'See with your own eyes, here the statues, there much gold and goods beyond measure, which I am sending to my brother.' And my messengers did see with their own eyes! But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. Any day that I hear the greetings of my brother, that day I make a festive occasion... May my brother send me much gold. [At] the kim[ru fe]ast...[...with] many goods [may my] brother honor me. In my brother's country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honor me.\" (EA 27)\n\nWhile Akhenaten was certainly not a close friend of Tushratta, he was evidently concerned at the expanding power of the Hittite Empire under its powerful ruler Suppiluliuma I. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in Canaan, particularly in a struggle for power between Labaya of Shechem and Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching Medjay troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal Rib-Hadda of Byblos — whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of Amurru under Abdi-Ashirta and later Aziru, son of Abdi-Ashirta — despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: \"You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors\" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124. What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire. Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother Ilirabih is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.\n\nWilliam L. Moran notes that the Amarna corpus of 380+ letters counters the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. Several letters from Egyptian vassals notify the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions:\n\nTo the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky: Message of Yapahu, the ruler of Gazru, your servant, the dirt at your feet. I indeed prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun...7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back. I am indeed guarding the place of the king, my lord, the Sun of the sky, where I am, and all the things the king, my lord, has written me, I am indeed carrying out — everything! Who am I, a dog, and what is my house... and what is anything I have, that the orders of the king, my lord, the Sun from the sky, should not obey constantly?\" (EA 378)\n\nWhen the loyal but unfortunate Rib-Hadda was killed at the instigation of Aziru, Akhenaten sent an angry letter to Aziru containing a barely veiled accusation of outright treachery on the latter's part. Akhenaten wrote:\nSay to Aziru, ruler of Amurru: Thus the king, your lord [Akhenaten], saying: The ruler of Gubla [Byblos], whose brother had cast him away at the gate, said to you, \"Take me and get me into the city. There is much silver, and I will give it to you. Indeed there is an abundance of everything, but not with me [here].\" Thus did the ruler [Rib-Hadda] speak to you. Did you not write to the king, my lord saying, \"I am your servant like all the previous mayors [i.e., vassals] in his city\"? Yet you acted delinquently by taking the mayor whose brother had cast him away at the gate, from his city.\n\nHe [Rib-Hadda] was residing in Sidon and, following your own judgment, you gave him to [some] mayors. Were you ignorant of the treacherousness of the men? If you really are the king's servant, why did you not denounce him before the king, your lord, saying, \"This mayor has written to me saying, 'Take me to yourself and get me into my city'\"? And if you did act loyally, still all the things you wrote were not true. In fact, the king has reflected on them as follows, \"Everything you have said is not friendly.\"\n\nNow the king has heard as follows, \"You are at peace with the ruler of Qidsa. (Kadesh) The two of you take food and strong drink together.\" And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler whom the king is fighting? And even if you did act loyally, you considered your own judgment, and his judgment did not count. You have paid no attention to the things that you did earlier. What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? Consider the people that are training you for their own advantage. They want to throw you into the fire...If for any reason whatsoever you prefer to do evil, and if you plot evil, treacherous things, then you, together with your entire family, shall die by the axe of the king. So perform your service for the king, your lord, and you will live. You yourself know that the king does not fail when he rages against all of Canaan. And when you wrote saying, 'May the king, my Lord, give me leave this year, and then I will go next year to the king, my Lord [i.e., to Egypt]. If this is impossible, I will send my son in my place' — the king, your lord, let you off this year in accordance with what you said. Come yourself, or send your son [now], and you will see the king at whose sight all lands live. (EA 162)\nThis letter shows that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of his vassals in Canaan and Syria. Akhenaten commanded Aziru to come to Egypt and proceeded to detain him there for at least one year. In the end, Akhenaten was forced to release Aziru back to his homeland when the Hittites advanced southwards into Amki, thereby threatening Egypt's series of Asiatic vassal states, including Amurru. Sometime after his return to Amurru, Aziru defected to the Hittite side with his kingdom. While it is known from an Amarna letter by Rib-Hadda that the Hittites \"seized all the countries that were vassals of the king of Mitanni\" (EA 75) Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt's control over the core of her Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful Hittite Empire of Suppiluliuma I. Only the Egyptian border province of Amurru in Syria around the Orontes river was permanently lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites. Finally, contrary to the conventional view of a ruler who neglected Egypt's international relations, Akhenaten is known to have initiated at least one campaign into Nubia in his regnal Year 12, where his campaign is mentioned in Amada stela CG 41806 and on a separate companion stela at Buhen.\n\nThe last dated appearance of Akhenaten and the Amarna family is in the tomb of Meryra II, and dates from second month, year 12 of his reign. After this the historical record is unclear, and only with the succession of Tutankhamun is somewhat clarified.\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that a Year 16 III Akhet day 15 inscription dated explicitly to Akhenaten's reign which mentions, in the same breath, the presence of a living Queen Nefertiti, was found in a limestone quarry at Deir el-Bersha just north of Amarna. The text refers to a building project in Amarna, and establishes that Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still a royal couple just a year before Akhenaten's death.\n\nAkhenaten planned to relocate Egyptian burials on the east side of the Nile (sunrise) rather than on the west side (sunset) to the Royal Wadi in Akhetaten. His body was removed after the court returned to Thebes, and recent genetic tests have confirmed that the body found buried in tomb KV55 was the father of Tutankhamun, and is therefore \"most probably\" Akhenaten, The tomb contained numerous Amarna era objects, including a royal funerary mask which had been deliberately destroyed. His sarcophagus was destroyed but has been reconstructed and now sits outside in the Cairo Museum.\n\nSimilarly, although it is accepted that Akhenaten himself died in Year 17 of his reign, the question of whether Smenkhkare became co-regent perhaps two or three years earlier or enjoyed a brief independent reign is unclear. If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole pharaoh, he likely ruled Egypt for less than a year. The next successor was Neferneferuaten, a female pharaoh who reigned in Egypt for two years and one month. She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten (later, Tutankhamun), with the country being administered by the chief vizier, and future pharaoh, Ay. Tutankhamun was believed to be a younger brother of Smenkhkare and a son of Akhenaten, and possibly Kiya although one scholar has suggested that Tutankhamun may have been a son of Smenkhkare instead. DNA tests in 2010 indicated Tutankhamun was indeed the son of Akhenaten. It has been suggested that after the death of Akhenaten, Nefertiti reigned with the name of Neferneferuaten but other scholars believe this female ruler was rather Meritaten. The so-called Coregency Stela, found in a tomb in Amarna possibly shows his queen Nefertiti as his coregent, ruling alongside him, but this is not certain as the names have been removed and recarved to show Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten.\n\nWith Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded fell out of favor: at first gradually, and then with decisive finality. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign (1332 BC) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten, which eventually fell into ruin. His successors Ay and Horemheb disassembled temples Akhenaten had built, including the temple at Thebes, using them as a source of easily available building materials and decorations for their own temples.\n\nFinally, Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, and Ay were excised from the official lists of pharaohs, which instead reported that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. This is thought to be part of an attempt by Horemheb to delete all trace of Atenism and the pharaohs associated with it from the historical record. Akhenaten's name does not appear on any of the king lists compiled by later pharaohs and it was not until the late 19th century that his identity was re-discovered and the surviving traces of his reign were unearthed by archaeologists.\n\nThe Inscription of Mes document which dates to Ramesside times refers to Akhenaten himself as \"the enemy of Akhetaton\" as Egyptians had fully rejected his revolution by this time and the crisis which it sparked.\n\nIn the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV lived at Thebes with Nefertiti and his six daughters. Initially, he permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue but near the Temple of Karnak (Amun-Ra's great cult center), he erected several massive buildings including temples to the Aten. Aten was usually depicted as a sun disk with rays extending with long arms and tiny human hands at each end.\nThese buildings at Thebes were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aton building here were revealed which preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.\nIn Year 5 of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt: the pharaoh \"disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods...and diverted the income from these [other] cults to support the Aten\". To emphasize his complete allegiance to the Aten, the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten or 'Living Spirit of Aten.' Akhenaten's fifth year also marked the beginning of construction on his new capital, Akhetaten or 'Horizon of Aten', at the site known today as Amarna. Very soon afterwards, he centralized Egyptian religious practices in Akhetaten, though construction of the city seems to have continued for several more years. In honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt. In these new temples, Aten was worshipped in the open sunlight rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. Akhenaten is also believed to have composed the Great Hymn to the Aten.\n\nInitially, Akhenaten presented Aten as a variant of the familiar supreme deity Amun-Re (itself the result of an earlier rise to prominence of the cult of Amun, resulting in Amun's becoming merged with the sun god Ra), in an attempt to put his ideas in a familiar Egyptian religious context. However, by Year 9 of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god, and that he, Akhenaten, was the only intermediary between Aten and his people. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed.\n\nAten's name also is written differently after Year 9 to emphasize the radicalism of the new regime, which included a ban on images, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation.\n\nArchaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.\n\nAs the Egytologist Nicholas Reeves writes:\nSuch displays of frightening self-censorship and toadying loyalty are ominous indicators of the paranoia which was beginning to grip the country. Not only were the streets [of Akhetaten] filled with the pharaoh's soldiers; it seems the population now had to contend with the danger of malicious informers.\n\nIn the end, Akhenaten's revolution collapsed from within after his death since the massive costs of founding a new capital city at El-Amarna and the closing of the Amun temples choked off the growth of the Egyptian economy. A notable result of Akhenaten's centralisation tendencies was the appearance of large-scale corruption among the king's state officials who held unprecedented control over all the wealth and produce of Egypt. This was a tendency that the last 18th Dynasty pharaoh Horemheb was compelled to deal with by threatening to cut off the nose of any officials who were found to be involved in state corruption or abuses in a major stela erected near the 10th pylon of Karnak. Nicolas Grimal states that Akhenaten's closure or limitations on the activities of non-Aten temples and his confiscation of priestly goods for the benefit of the state directly led:\nto an increase in centralization of both the administration and its executive arm, the army. The neglect of local government increased the problems of maintaining an effective administration and introduced a whole new [state] system characterized by corruption and arbitrariness... The construction of the new capital [at Akhetaten] and new temples was to the detriment of the economy in general and the temple-based economy in particular: the system of divine estates was, from a centralizing viewpoint, harmful, but its abandonment in the Amarna period led to the ruination of a whole [economic] system of production and distribution without providing any new structure to replace it.\n\nAkhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much speculation, ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic fringe theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten monolatry, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but the Aten while expecting the people to worship not Aten but him.\n\nThe idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. One of the first to mention this was Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in his book \"Moses and Monotheism\". Basing his arguments on a belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve. Following his book, the concept entered popular consciousness and serious research.\n\nFreud commented on the connection between Adonai, the Egyptian Aten and the Syrian divine name of Adonis as a primeval unity of language between the factions; in this he was following the argument of Egyptologist Arthur Weigall. Jan Assmann's opinion is that 'Aten' and 'Adonai' are not linguistically related.\n\nIt is widely accepted that there are strong stylistic similarities between Akhenaten's Great Hymn to the Aten and the Biblical Psalm 104, though this form is found widespread in ancient Near Eastern hymnology both before and after the period.\n\nOthers have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, of Jesus Christ with God, particularly in interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than henotheistic. Donald B. Redford has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. \"After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'.\" James Henry Breasted likened him to Jesus, Arthur Weigall saw him as a failed precursor of Christ and Thomas Mann saw him \"as right on the way and yet not the right one for the way\".\n\nRedford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time had claimed the same relationship and priestly role. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as \"thy son who came forth from thy limbs\", \"thy child\", \"the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc\", and \"thine only son that came forth from thy body\". The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of \"his father\", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth, and as Akhenaten is king on earth, his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Because only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.\n\nRedford concluded:\nBefore much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development — one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.\n\nThe rather strange and eccentric portrayals of Akhenaten, with a sagging stomach, thick thighs, large breasts, and long, thin face — so different from the athletic norm in the portrayal of pharaohs — have led certain Egyptologists to suppose that Akhenaten suffered some kind of genetic abnormality. Various illnesses have been put forward. On the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance, Cyril Aldred, following up earlier arguments of Grafton Elliot Smith and James Strachey, suggested he may have suffered from Froelich's Syndrome. However, this is unlikely because this disorder results in sterility and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. These children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence — at least six daughters by Queen Nefertiti, well known as the King and Queen's six princesses of Amarna, as well as his successor Tutankhamun by a minor wife.\n\nAnother suggestion by Burridge is that Akhenaten may have suffered from Marfan's Syndrome. Marfan's syndrome, unlike Froelich's, does not result in any lack of intelligence or sterility. It is associated with a sunken chest, long curved spider-like fingers (arachnodactyly), occasional congenital heart difficulties, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and a highly curved cornea or dislocated lens of the eye, with the requirement for bright light to see well. Marfan's sufferers tend towards being taller than average, with a long, thin face, and elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves. Marfan's syndrome is a dominant characteristic, and sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. All of these symptoms arguably sometimes appear in depictions of Akhenaten and of his children. Recent CT scans of Tutankhamun report a cleft palate and a fairly long head, as well as an abnormal curvature of the spine and fusion of the upper vertebrae, a condition associated with scoliosis, all conditions associated with Marfan's syndrome. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun, in 2010, proved negative for Marfan Syndrome. More recently, Homocystinuria was suggested as a possible diagnosis. Patients suffering from homocystinuria have Marfan habitus. However, as an autosomal recessive disease, it seems to fit better into Akhenaten's family tree — Akhenaten's parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, were probably healthy, and Marfan Syndrome was ruled out following DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010.\n\nHowever, Dominic Montserrat in \"Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt\" states that \"there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten's physical portrayal... are not to be read literally\". Montserrat and others argue that the body-shape relates to some form of religious symbolism. Because the god Aten was referred to as \"the mother and father of all humankind\" it has been suggested that Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the god. This required \"a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself\", which will \"display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions\". Akhenaten did refer to himself as \"The Unique One of Re\", and he may have used his control of artistic expression to distance himself from the common people, though such a radical departure from the idealized traditional representation of the image of the pharaoh would be truly extraordinary.\nAnother unfounded claim was made by Immanuel Velikovsky, who hypothesized an incestuous relationship with his mother, Tiye. Velikovsky also posited that Akhenaten had swollen legs. Based on this, he identified Akhenaten as the history behind the Oedipus myth, Oedipus being Greek for \"swollen feet\", and moved the setting from the Greek Thebes to the Egyptian Thebes. As part of his argument, Velikovsky uses the fact that Akhenaten viciously carried out a campaign to erase the name of his father, which he argues could have developed into Oedipus killing his father.\n\nIn 2012, Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, published research into the early death of Akhenaten and the premature deaths of other 18th Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Thutmose IV). He identifies that their early deaths were probably a result of a Familial Temporal Epilepsy. This would account for the untimely death of Akhenaten, his abnormal endocrine body shape on sculptures and can also explain Akhenaten's religious conviction due to this type of epilepsy's association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity. However, because there is currently no definitive genetic test for epilepsy, the theory remains impossible to prove.\n\nVarious uninscribed and damaged stelae depict Akhenaten with what appears to be a coregent wearing a king's crown in familiar if not intimate settings (even naked). Since Smenkhkare was known to be a male, this led to the speculation that Akhenaten was homosexual. These notions were discarded once the coregent was identified as a female, most likely his wife.\n\nIn the 1970s, John Harris identified the figure pictured alongside Akhenaten as Nefertiti, arguing that she may have actually been elevated to coregent and perhaps even succeeded temporarily as an independent ruler, changing her name to Smenkhkare.\n\nNicholas Reeves and other Egyptologists contend that Smenkhkare was the same person as Neferneferuaten, who ruled together with Akhenaten as coregent for the final one or two years of Akhenaten's reign. On several monuments, the two are shown seated side by side. More recent research by James Allen and Marc Gabolde has led to \"a fair degree of consensus\" that Neferneferuaten was a female ruler apart from Smenkhkare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Church of Satan and the religion of LaVeyan Satanism. He authored several books, including \"The Satanic Bible\", \"The Satanic Rituals\", \"The Satanic Witch\", \"The Devil's Notebook\", and \"Satan Speaks!\" In addition, he released three albums, including \"The Satanic Mass\", \"Satan Takes a Holiday\", and \"Strange Music\". He played a minor on-screen role and served as technical advisor for the 1975 film \"The Devil's Rain\" and served as host and narrator for Nick Bougas' 1989 mondo film \"Death Scenes\".\n\nLaVey was the subject of numerous articles in news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as \"Look\", \"McCall's\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Time\", and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as \"The Joe Pyne Show\", \"Donahue\" and \"The Tonight Show\", and in two feature-length documentaries: \"Satanis\" in 1970 and \"\" in 1993. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including \"The Devil's Avenger\" by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974, and \"The Secret Life of a Satanist\" by Blanche Barton, published in 1990. \n\nHistorian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as a \"born showman\", with anthropologist Jean La Fontaine describing him as a \"colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism\". Academic scholars of Satanism Per Faxneld and Jesper Aa. Petersen described LaVey as \"the most iconic figure in the Satanic milieu\". LaVey was labeled many things by journalists, religious detractors and Satanists alike, including \"The Father of Satanism\", the \"St. Paul of Satanism\", \"The Black Pope\", and the \"evilest man in the world\".\n\nLaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Michael Joseph Levey (1903–1992), from Chicago, Illinois, married LaVey's mother, the former Gertrude Augusta Coultron, who was born to a Russian father and mother, who had immigrated to Ohio in 1893; both became naturalized American citizens in 1900. LaVey's family moved to California, where he spent his early life in the San Francisco Bay Area. His parents supported his musical interests, as he tried a number of instruments; his favorites were keyboards such as the pipe organ and the calliope. He did covers of instrumentals like \"Harlem Nocturne\" by Earle Hagen.\n\nHe attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, until the age of 16. LaVey claimed he left high school to join a circus and later carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy in an act with the big cats, then as a musician playing the calliope. LaVey later claimed to have seen that many of the same men attended both the bawdy Saturday night shows and the tent revival meetings on Sunday mornings, which reinforced his increasingly cynical view of religion. In the foreword to the German language edition of \"The Satanic Bible\", he cites this as the impetus to defy Christian religion as he knew it. He explains why church-goers employ double moral standards. However, journalist Lawrence Wright investigated LaVey's background and found no evidence LaVey ever worked in a circus either as a musician or a cage boy.\n\nHis \"genius\" on keyboards later garnered him work as an organist in bars, lounges and nightclubs. While playing organ in Los Angeles burlesque houses, he allegedly had a brief affair with then-unknown Marilyn Monroe, when she was a dancer at the Mayan Theater. This is challenged by those who then knew Monroe, as well as the manager of the Mayan, Paul Valentine, who said she had never been one of his dancers, nor had the theater ever been used as a burlesque house.\n\nAccording to his biography, LaVey moved back to San Francisco, where he worked for three years as a photographer for the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He dabbled as a psychic investigator, looking into \"800 calls\" referred to him by SFPD. Later biographers questioned whether LaVey ever worked with the SFPD, as there are no records substantiating the claim. During this period, LaVey was friends with a number of writers associated with \"Weird Tales\" magazine; a picture of him with George Haas, Robert Barbour Johnson and Clark Ashton Smith appears in Blanche Barton's biography \"The Secret Life of a Satanist\".\n\nIn 1950, LaVey met Carole Lansing, and they married the following year. Lansing gave birth to LaVey's first daughter, Karla LaVey, born in 1952. They divorced in 1960, after LaVey became entranced by Diane Hegarty. Hegarty and LaVey never married; however, she was his companion for 25 years and mothered his second daughter, Zeena Galatea Schreck (\"nee\" LaVey), in 1963. At the end of their relationship, Hegarty sued for palimony.\n\nBecoming a local celebrity through his paranormal research and live performances as an organist, including playing the Wurlitzer at the Lost Weekend cocktail lounge, he attracted many San Francisco notables to his parties. Guests included Carin de Plessin, Michael Harner, Chester A. Arthur III, Forrest J Ackerman, Fritz Leiber, Cecil E. Nixon and Kenneth Anger. LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later evolved into the governing body of the Church of Satan. According to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church of Satan represented \"the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent Satanic discourse\".\n\nLaVey began presenting Friday night lectures on the occult and rituals. A member of this circle suggested that he had the basis for a new religion. According to LaVey himself, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, he ritualistically shaved his head, allegedly \"in the tradition of ancient executioners\", declared the founding of the Church of Satan and proclaimed 1966 as \"the Year One\", Anno Satanas-the first year of the Age of Satan (it was later demonstrated that LaVey in fact shaved his head because he lost a bet and made up the \"ancient executioners\" story after the fact). LaVey's image has been described as \"Mephistophelian\". Media attention followed the subsequent Satanic wedding ceremony of journalist John Raymond to New York City socialite Judith Case on February 1, 1967. \"The Los Angeles Times\" and \"San Francisco Chronicle\" were among the newspapers that printed articles dubbing him \"The Black Pope\". LaVey performed Satanic baptisms (including the first Satanic baptism in history for his three-year-old daughter Zeena, dedicating her to Satan and the Left-Hand Path, which garnered world-wide publicity and was originally recorded on \"The Satanic Mass\" LP) and Satanic funerals (including one for naval machinist-repairman third-class Edward Olsen, complete with a chrome-helmeted honor guard), and released a record album entitled \"The Satanic Mass\".\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, LaVey melded ideological influences from Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, H. L. Mencken, and Social Darwinism with the ideology and ritual practices of the Church of Satan. He wrote essays introduced with reworked excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard's \"Might Is Right\" and concluded with \"Satanized\" versions of John Dee's \"Enochian Keys\" to create books such as \"The Complete Witch\" (re-released in 1989 as \"The Satanic Witch\"), and \"The Satanic Rituals\". The latter book also included rituals drawing on the work of H. P. Lovecraft. \"The Satanic Bible\" included excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard's \"Might Is Right\" and concluded with \"Satanized\" versions of John Dee's \"Enochian Keys\".\nAdmitting his use of \"Might is Right\", LaVey stated that he did so in order to \"immortalize a writer who had profoundly reached me\".\n\nIn 1972, the public work at LaVey's Black House in San Francisco was curtailed and work was continued via sanctioned regional \"grottoes\". In early 1975 LaVey announced that higher degrees of initiation could be given in return for a financial contribution. In June 1975, editor of the Church's newsletter, Michael Aquino, left the Church of Satan and formed the theistic Temple of Set claiming to take an unknown number of dissenters with him. The Church maintains this policy announcement was designed to \"clean house\" of members who didn't understand Satanic philosophy. \n\nIn July 1984, Hegarty issued a restraining order against LaVey, which he did not contest. LaVey's third and final companion was Blanche Barton. On November 1, 1993, Barton gave birth to Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey. Barton succeeded LaVey as the head of the Church after his death and has since stepped down from that role and handed it to Magus Peter H. Gilmore.\n\nAnton LaVey died on October 29, 1997, in St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco of pulmonary edema. He was taken to St. Mary's, a Catholic hospital, because it was the closest available. A secret Satanic funeral, attended by invitation only, was held in Colma, after which LaVey's body was cremated.\n\nThree months after his death, his estranged daughter Zeena Schreck and her husband Nikolas Schreck published a nine-page \"fact sheet\", in which they endorsed Wright's earlier allegations and claimed that many more of LaVey's stories about his life had been false.\n\nLaVey included references to other esoteric and religious groups throughout his writings, claiming for instance that the Yezidis and Knight's Templar were carriers of a Satanic tradition that had been passed down to the twentieth-century. Scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld believed that these references were deliberately tongue-in-cheek and ironic, however he noted that many Satanists who had read LaVey's writings had taken them to be literal historical claims about the past. Although he regularly derided older esotericists, LaVey also relied upon their work; for instance making use of John Dee's Enochian system in \"The Satanic Bible\". Faxneld therefore believed that there was a tension in LaVey's thought between his desire to establish prestigious Satanic predecessors and his desire to be seen as the founder of the first real Satanic society.\n\nDyrendel argued that LaVey partook in conspiracy culture as he grew older, for he was greatly concerned with modern society's impact on individual agency. LaVey was conservative in his attitude to law and order, and was opposed to drug use. He supported eugenics and believed that it would be a necessity in the future. LaVey hated rock and metal music, with or without \"Satanic\" lyrics, and often expressed his distaste for it.\n\nHistorian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as \"A born showman\", with anthropologist Jean La Fontaine describing him as \"A colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism\". Medway contrasted LaVey from the likes of Jim Jones, David Koresh, and Charles Manson, noting that whereas the latter were the charismatic leaders of apocalyptic communes, within the Church of Satan, \"No one hung onto [LaVey's] every word, and church members [were] allowed considerable autonomy.\"\n\nAcademic scholars of Satanism Per Faxneld and Jesper Aa. Petersen described LaVey as \"the most iconic figure in the satanic milieu\", while Asbjo/rn Dyrendel described him as \"the founder of modern Satanism\".\nIn his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist James R. Lewis noted that, to his surprise, his findings \"consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey's influence on modern Satanism\". As a result he \"concluded that - despite his heavy dependence on prior thinkers - LaVey was directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious (as opposed to a purely literary) movement\".\n\nHis books \"The Satanic Bible\" and \"The Satanic Rituals\", have been cited as having \"an influence far beyond\" the Church of Satan's membership. In 1995, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that although the Church had no organized presence in Britain, LaVey's writings were widely accessible in British bookshops.\n\nDue to increasing visibility through his books, LaVey was the subject of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as \"Look\", \"McCall's\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Time\", and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as \"The Joe Pyne Show\", \"Donahue\" and \"The Tonight Show\", and in a feature-length documentary called \"Satanis\" in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film \"Rosemary's Baby\", which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued that none of this was true. In an article published in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about his life had been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including \"The Devil's Avenger\" by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and \"The Secret Life of a Satanist\" by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is some assertion that he is the same as Apollophanes the physician who lived at the court of Antiochus.\n\nApollophanes' natural philosophy is similar to Poseidonius', that the world is one and finite, having a spherical form with a vacuum around it.\n\nAmong the Stoics, there was much discussion concerning the number of virtues and parts of the soul. On the number of virtues Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Antipater suggest that there are many; Poseidonius suggests that there are four; traditional Stoics suggest that there are three (the logical, the natural, and the ethical); Panaetius teaches that there are only two (the speculative and the practical); while Apollophanes taught that there is only one virtue - prudence. On the parts of the soul Plato divided it into two parts; Zeno into three; Panaetius into five or six; Soranus into seven; Chrysippus into as many as eight; Apollophanes into as many as nine; while other Stoics declared as many as twelve parts in the soul.\n\nAccording to Athenaeus of Naucratis, Apollophanes had written a book about his master, Aristo of Chios, entitled \"Ariston\".

The religion is known as \"Assianism\" among its Russian adherents, and as \"Uatsdin\" (Уацдин, literally \"True Faith\") by Ossetians in their own language. It started to be revived in a conscious and organised way in the 1980s, as an ethnic religion among the Ossetians, who have since largely embraced it. Scythian religious groups are also present in Ukraine.\n\nThe religion has been incorporated by some organisations, chiefly the \"Atsætæ\" Church (Ossetian: Ацæтæ; Russian: Асата, \"Asata\") based in North Ossetia–Alania. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the East Slavs, and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Among Russians, Assianism is advocated as a religion for all Slavs, Indo-Europeans, or even as a worldwide spiritual heritage.\n\nIn 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of Moscow State University, led by philosopher Alexander Dugin, a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the \"Atsætæ\" Church. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the \"Atsætæ\" Church was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\". Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".\n\nAssianism has a monistic theory, expressed by three concepts:\n\nOn the plane of the phenomenon, God's universal mind-spirit manifests as:\n\nA further distinction is established between:\n\nAccording to Assian theory, human nature is the same as all being's nature; in other words, man is a microcosm within a macrocosm, or larger context, and the same applies to all other beings. In all contexts, \"Uas\" is the foundation of nobility and pure reason; \"daujita\" form both worlds and men according to this universal law, while \"uayguyta\" counter-act gods' action, and are the causes of illness and death. These forces manifest in humanity's power of consciousness and action; a man may take the side of gods or demons, and this choice manifests in this man's life and activity. If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the \"Uas\", or its receptacle (Уасдан → \"Uasdan\", good-spell receptacle), a wise or noble who perceives the will of God and higher spirits and receives their energy. On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by material ends, \"Dalimon\" and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness.\n\nScythian Native Faith is popular in Russia and Ukraine among Cossacks, especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of Rodnovery, the general \"Slavic Native Faith\". Assianism is also practised without connection to Cossack ethnicism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is home to the annual Baalbeck International Festival.\n\nA few miles from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the (\"Source of the Two Rivers\"), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.\n\nHeliopolis is the latinisation of the Greek \"Hēlioúpolis\" (), meaning \"Sun City\" in reference to the solar cult there. It is the earlier attested of the two names, appearing under the Seleucids and Ptolemies. Ammianus Marcellinus, however, does note that earlier \"Assyrian\" names of Levantine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the successors of Alexander. In Greek religion, Helios was both the sun in the sky and its personification as a god. The local Semitic god Baʿal Haddu was more often equated with Zeus or Jupiter or simply called the \"Great God of Heliopolis\", but the name may refer to the Egyptians' association of Baʿal with their great god Ra. It was sometimes described as or Coelesyria ( or ') to distinguish it from its namesake in Egypt. In Catholicism, its titular see is distinguished as , from its former Roman province Phoenice. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name Biḳāʿ al-ʿAzīz borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it references an earlier solar deity and not later men, named Aziz. In Greek and Roman antiquity, it was known as Heliopolis. It still possesses some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon, including one of the largest temples of the empire. The gods that were worshipped there (Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus) were equivalents of the Canaanite deities Hadad, Atargatis. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, as they vary from the classic Roman design.\nThe name is first attested in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a geographic epithet for a kind of garlic, \"shum ba'albeki\" (שום בעלבכי). Two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a translation of Eusebius's \"Theophania\" and a life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as \"Baʿlabakka\" or \"Baʿlabakku\" () in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as \"Baʿlabak\" or \"Baʿlabekk\" () or \"Bʿalbik\" (), the latter of which is pronounced in Lebanese Arabic.\n\nThe etymology of Baalbek has been debated indecisively since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean \"Baʿal (Lord) of the Beka\" and Donne as \"City of the Sun\". Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of \"Baʿal Nebeq\" (\"Lord of the Source\" of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of \"Lord Bacchus\", from the classical temple complex.\n\nOn the basis of its similar name, several 19th-century Biblical archaeologists attempted to connect Baalbek to the \"Baalgad\" mentioned in the Hebrew Scripture's Book of Joshua, the Baalath listed among Solomon's cities in the First Book of Kings, the Baal-hamon where he had a vineyard, and the \"Plain of Aven\" in Amos.\n\nThe hilltop of Tell Baalbek, part of a valley to the east of the northern Beqaa Valley (), shows signs of almost continual habitation over the last 8–9000 years. It was well-watered both from a stream running from the \"Rās-el-ʿAin\" spring SE of the citadel and, during the spring, from numerous rills formed by meltwater from the Anti-Lebanons. Macrobius later credited the site's foundation to a colony of Egyptian or Assyrian priests. The settlement's religious, commercial, and strategic importance was minor enough, however, that it is never mentioned in any known Assyrian or Egyptian record, unless under another name. Its enviable position in a fertile valley, major watershed, and along the route from Tyre to Palmyra should have made it a wealthy and splendid site from an early age. During the Canaanite period, the local temples were largely devoted to the Heliopolitan Triad: a male god (Baʿal), his consort (Ashtart), and their son (Adon). The site of the present Temple of Jupiter was probably the focus of earlier worship, as its altar was located at the hill's precise summit and the rest of the sanctuary raised to its level.\n\nIn Islamic mythology, the temple complex was said to have been a palace of Solomon's which was put together by \"djinn\" and given as a wedding gift to the Queen of Sheba; its actual Roman origin remained obscured by the citadel's medieval fortifications as late as the 16th-century visit of the Polish prince Radziwiłł.\n\nFollowing Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia in the 330s , Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the Diadochi kingdoms of Egypt & Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The settlers of the Roman colony Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of the 5th and 8th Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. From 15  to  193, it formed part of the territory of Berytus. It is mentioned in Josephus, Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy and on coins of nearly every emperor from Nerva to Gallienus. The 1st-century Pliny did not number it among the Decapolis, the \"Ten Cities\" of Coelesyria, while the 2nd-century Ptolemy did. The population likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Indian monsoon and caravans to the coast and interior.\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the city's temple to Baʿal Haddu was conflated first with the worship of the Greek sun god Helios and then with the Greek and Roman sky god under the name \"Heliopolitan Zeus\" or \"Jupiter\". The present Temple of Jupiter presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation; it was constructed during the mid-1st century and probably completed around  60. His idol was a beardless golden god in the pose of a charioteer, with a whip raised in his right hand and a thunderbolt and stalks of grain in his left; its image appeared on local coinage and it was borne through the streets during several festivals throughout the year. Macrobius compared the rituals to those for Diva Fortuna at Antium and says the bearers were the principal citizens of the town, who prepared for their role with abstinence, chastity, and shaved heads. In bronze statuary attested from Byblos in Phoenicia and Tortosa in Spain, he was encased in a pillarlike term and surrounded (like the Greco-Persian Mithras) by busts representing the sun, moon, and five known planets. In these statues, the bust of Mercury is made particularly prominent; a marble stela at Massilia in Transalpine Gaul shows a similar arrangement but enlarges Mercury into a full figure. Local cults also revered the Baetylia, black conical stones considered sacred to Baʿal. One of these was taken to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus, a former priest \"of the sun\" at nearby Emesa, who erected a temple for it on the Palatine Hill. Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st century  until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century. (The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a \"wonder of the world\", credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius, but it is uncertain how reliable his account is on the point.) By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Baʿal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon or Seimios). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.\n\nThe emperor Trajan consulted the site's oracle twice. The first time, he requested a written reply to his sealed and unopened question; he was favorably impressed by the god's blank reply as his own paper had been empty. He then inquired whether he would return alive from his wars against Parthia and received in reply a centurion's vine staff, broken to pieces. In  193, Septimius Severus granted the city \"ius Italicum\" rights. His wife Julia Domna and son Caracalla toured Egypt and Syria in  215; inscriptions in their honour at the site may date from that occasion; Julia was a Syrian native whose father had been an Emesan priest \"of the sun\" like Elagabalus.\n\nThe town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity. Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In  297, the actor Gelasinus converted in the middle of a scene mocking baptism; his public profession of faith provoked the audience to drag him from the theater and stone him to death. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised. Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess' temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals' ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. Bar Hebraeus also credited him with ending the locals' continued practice of polygamy. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. They reäcted violently again under the freedom permitted to them by Julian the Apostate. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment. The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The \"Easter Chronicle\" states he was also responsible for destroying all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400, Rabbula, the future bishop of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex's Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537. Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin II (560s & 570s), and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens.\n\nBaalbek was occupied by the Muslim army in  634 ( 13), in 636, or under Abu ʿUbaidah following the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk in 637 ( 16), either peacefully and by agreement or following a heroic defense and yielding of gold, of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords. The ruined temple complex was fortified under the name ( \"The Fortress\") but was sacked with great violence by the Damascene caliph Marwan II in 748, at which time it was dismantled and largely depopulated. It formed part of the district of Damascus under the Umayyads and Abbasids before being conquered by Fatimid Egypt in 942. In the mid-10th century, it was said to have \"gates of palaces sculptured in marble and lofty columns also of marble\" and that it was the most \"stupendous\" and \"considerable\" location in the whole of Syria. It was sacked and razed by the Byzantines under John I in 974, raided by Basil II in 1000, and occupied by Salih ibn Mirdas, emir of Aleppo, in 1025.\n\nIn 1075, it was finally lost to the Fatimids on its conquest by Tutush I, Seljuk emir of Damascus. It was briefly held by Muslim ibn Quraysh, emir of Aleppo, in 1083; after its recovery, it was ruled in the Seljuks' name by the eunuch Gümüshtegin until he was deposed for conspiring against the usurper Toghtekin in 1110. Toghtekin then gave the town to his son Buri. Upon Buri's succession to Damascus on his father's death in 1128, he granted the area to his son Muhammad. After Buri's murder, Muhammad successfully defended himself against the attacks of his brothers Ismaʿil and Mahmud. Following his brothers' murders, Muhammad was able to take Damascus in 1138 and gave Baalbek to his vizier Unur. In July 1139, Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo and stepfather of Mahmud, besieged Baalbek with 14 catapults. The outer city held until October 10 and the citadel until the 21st, when Unur surrendered upon a promise of safe passage. Unur himself was permitted to return to Damascus but Zengi slaughtered most of his men. In December, Zengi negotiated with Muhammad, offering to trade Baalbek or Homs for Damascus, but Unur convinced the atabeg to refuse. Zengi strengthened its fortifications and bestowed the territory on his lieutenant Ayyub, father of Saladin. Upon Zengi's assassination in 1146, Ayyub surrendered the territory to Unur, who was acting as regent for Muhammad's son Abaq. It was granted to the eunuch Ata al-Khadim, who also served as viceroy of Damascus. In December 1151, it was raided by the garrison of Banyas as a reprisal for its role in a Turcoman raid on Banyas. Following Ata's murder, his nephew Dahhak, emir of the Wadi al-Taym, ruled Baalbek. He was forced to relinquish it to Nur ad-Din in 1154 after Ayyub had successfully intrigued against Abaq from his estates near Baalbek. Ayyub then administered the area from Damascus on Nur ad-Din's behalf. In the mid-12th century, Idrisi mentioned Baalbek's two temples and the legend of their origin under Solomon; it was visited by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela in 1170.\n\nBaalbek's citadel served as a jail for Crusaders taken by the Zengids as prisoners of war. In 1171, these captives successfully overpowered their guards and took possession of the castle from its garrison. Muslims from the surrounding area gathered, however, and entered the castle through a secret passageway shown to them by a local. The Crusaders were then massacred.\n\nThree major earthquakes occurred in the 12th century, in 1139, 1157, and 1170. The one in 1170 ruined Baalbek's walls and, though Nur ad-Din repaired them, his young heir Ismaʿil was made to yield it to Saladin by a 4-month siege in 1174. Having taken control of Damascus on the invitation of its governor Ibn al-Muqaddam, Saladin rewarded him with the following the Ayyubid victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175. Baldwin, the young leper king of Jerusalem, came of age the next year, ending the Crusaders' treaty with Saladin. His former regent, Raymond of Tripoli, raided the Beqaa Valley from the west in the summer, suffering a slight defeat at Ibn al-Muqaddam's hands. He was then joined by the main army, riding north under Baldwin and Humphrey of Toron; they defeated Saladin's elder brother Turan Shah in August at Ayn al-Jarr and plundered Baalbek. Upon the deposition of Turan Shah for neglecting his duties in Damascus, however, he demanded his childhood home of Baalbek as compensation. Ibn al-Muqaddam did not consent and Saladin opted to invest the city in late 1178 to maintain peace within his own family. An attempt to pledge fealty to the Christians at Jerusalem was ignored on behalf of an existing treaty with Saladin. The siege was maintained peacefully through the snows of winter, with Saladin waiting for the \"foolish\" commander and his garrison of \"ignorant scum\" to come to terms. Sometime in spring, Ibn al-Muqaddam yielded and Saladin accepted his terms, granting him Baʿrin, Kafr Tab, and al-Maʿarra. The generosity quieted unrest among Saladin's vassals through the rest of his reign but led his enemies to attempt to take advantage of his presumed weakness. He did not permit Turan Shah to retain Baalbek very long, though, instructing him to lead the Egyptian troops returning home in 1179 and appointing him to a sinecure in Alexandria. Baalbek was then granted to his nephew Farrukh Shah, whose family ruled it for the next half-century. When Farrukh Shah died three years later, his son Bahram Shah was only a child but he was permitted his inheritance and ruled til 1230. He was followed by al-Ashraf Musa, who was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail, who received it in 1237 as compensation for being deprived of Damascus by their brother al-Kamil. It was seized in 1246 after a year of assaults by as-Salih Ayyub, who bestowed it upon Saʿd al-Din al-Humaidi. When as-Salih Ayyub's successor Turan Shah was murdered in 1250, al-Nasir Yusuf, the sultan of Aleppo, seized Damascus and demanded Baalbek's surrender. Instead, its emir did homage and agreed to regular payments of tribute.\n\nThe Mongolian general Kitbuqa took Baalbek in 1260 and dismantled its fortifications. Later in the same year, however, Qutuz, the sultan of Egypt, defeated the Mongols and placed Baalbek under the rule of their emir in Damascus. Most of the city's still-extant fine mosque and fortress architecture dates to the reign of the sultan Qalawun in the 1280s. By the early 14th century, Abulfeda the Hamathite was describing the city's \"large and strong fortress\". The revived settlement was again destroyed by a flood on 10 May 1318, when water from the east and northeast made holes wide in walls thick. 194 people were killed and 1500 houses, 131 shops, 44 orchards, 17 ovens, 11 mills, and 4 aqueducts were ruined, along with the town's mosque and 13 other religious and educational buildings. In 1400, Timur pillaged the town and there was further destruction from a 1459 earthquake.\n\nIn 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the rest of Syria by the Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim. In recognition of their prominence among the Shiites of the Beqaa Valley, the Ottomans awarded the sanjak of Homs and local \"iltizam\" concessions to Baalbek's Harfush family.Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfushes’ oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma‘luf family of Zahlé (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century.What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite ‘Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.\n\nFrom the 16th century, European tourists began to visit the colossal and picturesque ruins. Donne hyperbolised \"No ruins of antiquity have attracted more attention than those of Heliopolis, or been more frequently or accurately measured and described.\" Misunderstanding the temple of Bacchus as the \"Temple of the Sun\", they considered it the best-preserved Roman temple in the world. The Englishman Robert Wood's 1757 \"Ruins of Balbec\" included carefully measured engravings that proved influential on British and Continental Neoclassical architects. For example, details of the Temple of Bacchus's ceiling inspired a bed and ceiling by Robert Adam and its portico inspired that of St George's in Bloomsbury.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the western approaches were covered with attractive groves of walnut trees, but the town itself suffered badly during the 1759 earthquakes, after which it was held by the Metawali, who again feuded with other Lebanese tribes. Their power was broken by Jezzar Pasha, the rebel governor of Acre, in the last half of the 18th century. All the same, Baalbek remained no destination for a traveller unaccompanied by an armed guard. Upon the pasha's death in 1804, chaos ensued until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt occupied the area in 1831, after which it again passed into the hands of the Harfushes. In 1835, the town's population was barely 200 people. In 1850, the Ottomans finally began direct administration of the area, making Baalbek a kaza under the Damascus Eyalet and its governor a kaymakam.\n\nEmperor Wilhelm II of Germany and his wife passed through Baalbek on November 1, 1898, on his way to Jerusalem. He noted both the magnificence of the Roman remains and the drab condition of the modern settlement. It was expected at the time that natural disasters, winter frosts, and the raiding of building materials by the city's residents would shortly ruin the remaining ruins. The archaeological team he dispatched began work within a month. Despite finding nothing they could date prior to Baalbek's Roman occupation, Puchstein and his associates worked until 1904 and produced a meticulously researched and thoroughly illustrated series of volumes. Later excavations under the Roman flagstones in the Great Court unearthed three skeletons and a fragment of Persian pottery dated to the 6th–4th centuries . The sherd featured cuneiform letters. In 1977, Jean-Pierre Adam made a brief study suggesting most of the large blocks could have been moved on rollers with machines using capstans and pulley blocks, a process which he theorised could use 512 workers to move a block. \"Baalbek, with its colossal structures, is one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee\", UNESCO reported in making Baalbek a World Heritage Site in 1984. When the committee inscribed the site, it expressed the wish that the protected area include the entire town within the Arab walls, as well as the southwestern extramural quarter between Bastan-al-Khan, the Roman site and the Mameluk mosque of Ras-al-Ain. Lebanon's representative gave assurances that the committee's wish would be honoured. Recent cleaning operations at the Temple of Jupiter discovered the deep trench at its edge, whose study pushed back the date of Tell Baalbek's settlement to the PPNB Neolithic. Finds included pottery sherds including a spout dating to the early Bronze Age. In the summer of 2014, a team from the German Archaeological Institute led by Jeanine Abdul Massih of the Lebanese University discovered a sixth, much larger stone suggested to be the world's largest ancient block. The stone was found underneath and next to the Stone of the Pregnant Woman (\"Hajjar al-Hibla\") and measures around . It is estimated to weigh .\n\nBaalbek was connected to the DHP, the French-owned railway concession in Ottoman Syria, on 19 June 1902. It formed a station on the standard-gauge line between Riyaq to its south and Aleppo (now in Syria) to its north. This Aleppo Railway connected to the Beirut–Damascus Railway but—because that line was built to a 1.05-meter gauge—all traffic had to be unloaded and reloaded at Riyaq. Just before the First World War, the population was still around 5000, about 2000 each of Sunnis and Shia Mutawalis and 1000 Orthodox and Maronites. The French general Georges Catroux proclaimed the independence of Lebanon in 1941 but colonial rule continued until 1943. Baalbek still has its railway station but service has been discontinued since the 1970s, originally owing to the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nThe 2006 Lebanon War began with a July 12 cross-border raid (\"Operation Truthful Promise\") that killed 8 Israel soldiers. Another two—Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev—were believed to have been abducted alive but were later killed and then refrigerated. By this time, Baalbek was a Hezbollah stronghold: aerial bombardment on July 17 destroyed a dairy processing plant, gas stations, and Hezbollah offices. Having been warned by the IDF prior to air strikes, the vast majority of the population subsequently fled in expectation of further attacks. On the evening of August 1, hundreds of IDF soldiers raided Baalbek and the Dar al-Hikma or Hikmeh Hospital in Jamaliyeh to its north (\"Operation Sharp and Smooth\"). They were transported by helicopter and supported by Apache helicopters and unmanned drones, The Israeli Defense Forces was acting on information that Goldwasser and Regev were at the hospital while al-Jazeera and other sources claimed the IDF was attempting to capture senior Hezbollah officials, particularly Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek. The hospital had been empty for four days, the most unwell patients having been transferred and the rest sent home. No Israelis were killed; Five civilians were abducted and interrogated by the Israelis, presumably because one shared his name with Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah; they were released on August 21. Another 9 civilians were killed on August 7 by a strike in the middle of Brital, just south of Baalbek, and by the subsequent attack on the car leaving the scene for the hospital. On August 14, just before the ceasefire took effect, two Lebanese police and five Lebanese soldiers were killed by a drone strike while driving their van around the still-damaged road through Jamaliyeh.\n\nConservation work at Lebanon's historic sites began in October. The ruins at Baalbek were not directly hit but the effects of blasts during the conflict toppled a block of stones at the Roman ruins and existing cracks in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus were feared to have widened. Frederique Husseini, director-general of Lebanon's Department of Antiquities, requested $550,000 from Europeans to restore Baalbek's souk and another $900,000 for repairs to other damaged structures.\n\nThe Tell Baalbek temple complex, fortified as the town's citadel during the Middle Ages, was constructed from local stone, mostly white granite and a rough white marble. Over the years, it has suffered from the region's numerous earthquakes, the iconoclasm of Christian and Muslim lords, and the reuse of the temples' stone for fortification and other construction. The nearby Qubbat Duris, a 13th-century Muslim shrine on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek. Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal. As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns out of an original 58; there were only nine before the 1759 earthquakes and six today.\n\nThe complex is located on an immense raised plaza erected over an earlier T-shaped base consisting of a podium, staircase, and foundation walls. These walls were built from about 24 monoliths, at their lowest level weighing approximately each. The tallest retaining wall, on the west, has a second course of monoliths containing the famous \"Three Stones\" (, \"Trílithon\"): a row of three stones, each over long, high, and broad, cut from limestone. They weigh approximately each. A fourth, still larger stone is called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman: it lies unused in a nearby quarry from the town. Its weight, often exaggerated, is estimated at . A fifth, still larger stone weighing approximately lies in the same quarry. This quarry was slightly higher than the temple complex, so no lifting was required to move the stones. Through the foundation there run three enormous passages the size of railway tunnels.\nThe temple complex was entered from the east through the Propylaeum (, \"propýlaion\") or Portico, consisting of a broad staircase rising to an arcade of 12 columns flanked by 2 towers. Most of the columns have been toppled and the stairs were entirely dismantled for use in the nearby later wall, but a Latin inscription remains on several of their bases stating that Longinus, a lifeguard of the 1st Parthian Legion, and Septimius, a freedman, gilded their capitals with bronze in gratitude for the safety of Septimius Severus's son Antoninus Caracalla and empress Julia Domna.\n\nImmediately behind the Propylaeum is a hexagonal forecourt reached through a threefold entrance that was added in the mid-3rd century by the emperor Philip the Arab. Traces remain of the two series of columns which once encircled it, but its original function remains uncertain. Donne reckoned it as the town's forum. Badly preserved coins of the era led some to believe this was a sacred cypress grove, but better specimens show that the coins displayed a single stalk of grain instead.\n\nThe rectangular Great Court to its west covers around and included the main altar for burnt offering, with mosaic-floored lustration basins to its north and south, a subterranean chamber, and three underground passageways wide by high, two of which run east and west and the third connecting them north and south, all bearing inscriptions suggesting their occupation by Roman soldiers. These were surrounded by Corinthian porticoes, one of which was never completed. The columns' bases and capitals were of limestone; the shafts were monoliths of highly polished red Egyptian granite high. Six remain standing, out of an original 128. Inscriptions attest that the court was once adorned by portraits of Marcus Aurelius's daughter Sabina, Septimius Severus, Gordian, and Velius Rufus, dedicated by the city's Roman colonists. The entablature was richly decorated but now mostly ruined. A westward-facing basilica was constructed over the altar during the reign of Theodosius; it was later altered to make it eastward-facing like most Christian churches.\n\nThe Temple of Jupiter—once wrongly credited to Helios—lay at the western end of the Great Court, raised another on a platform reached by a wide staircase. Under the Byzantines, it was also known as the \"Trilithon\" from the three massive stones in its foundation and, when taken together with the forecourt and Great Court, it is also known as the Great Temple. The Temple of Jupiter proper was circled by a peristyle of 54 unfluted Corinthian columns: 10 in front and back and 19 along each side. The temple was ruined by earthquakes, destroyed and pillaged for stone under Theodosius, and 8 columns were taken to Constantinople (Istanbul) under Justinian for incorporation into the Hagia Sophia. Three fell during the late 18th century. 6 columns, however, remain standing along its south side with their entablature. Their capitals remain nearly perfect on the south side, while the Beqaa's winter winds have worn the northern faces almost bare. The architrave and frieze blocks weigh up to each, and one corner block over , all of them raised to a height of above the ground. Individual Roman cranes were not capable of lifting stones this heavy. They may have simply been rolled into position along temporary earthen banks from the quarry or multiple cranes may have been used in combination. They may also have alternated sides a little at a time, filling in supports underneath each time. The Julio-Claudian emperors enriched its sanctuary in turn. In the mid-1st century, Nero built the tower-altar opposite the temple. In the early 2nd century, Trajan added the temple's forecourt, with porticos of pink granite shipped from Aswan at the southern end of Egypt.\n\nThe Temple of Bacchus—once wrongly credited to Jupiter—may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s, as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter. It is the best preserved of the sanctuary's structures, as the other rubble from its ruins protected it. It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity. The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns—8 along each end and 15 along each side—nearly in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood, but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column.The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake. The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps. The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune, Triton, Arion and his dolphin, and other marine figures but these have been lost. The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications, although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688. Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate, but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria's governor Rashid Pasha. Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof.\n\nThe Temple of Venus—also known as the Circular Temple or Nymphaeum—was added under Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century but destroyed under Constantine, who raised a basilica in its place. Jessup considered it the \"gem of Baalbek\". It lies about from the southeast corner of the Temple of Bacchus. It was known in the 19th century as \"El Barbara\" or \"Barbarat el-Atikah\" (St Barbara's), having been used as a Greek Orthodox church into the 18th century.\n\nThe ancient walls of Heliopolis had a circumference of a little less than . Much of the extant fortifications around the complex date to the 13th century reconstruction undertaken by the Mamluk sultan Qalawun following the devastation of the earlier defenses by the Mongol army under Kitbuqa. This includes the great southeast tower. The earliest round of fortifications were two walls to the southwest of the Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus. The original southern gateway with two small towers was filled in and replaced by a new large tower flanked by curtains, probably under Buri or Zengi. Bahram Shah replaced that era's southwest tower with one of his own in 1213 and built another in the northwest in 1224; the west tower was probably strengthened around the same time. An inscription dates the barbican-like strengthening of the southern entrance to around 1240. Qalawun relocated the two western curtains nearer to the western tower, which was rebuilt with great blocks of stone. The barbican was repaired and more turns added to its approach. From around 1300, no alterations were made to the fortifications apart from repairs such as Sultan Barkuk's restoration of the moat in preparation for Timur's arrival.\n\nMaterial from the ruins is incorporated into a ruined mosque north of downtown and probably also in the Qubbat Duris on the road to Damascus. In the 19th century, a \"shell-topped canopy\" from the ruins was used nearby as a mihrab, propped up to show locals the direction of Mecca for their daily prayers.\n\nUnder a white dome further towards town is the tomb of Kholat, daughter of Hussein and granddaughter of Ali, who died in Baalbek while Husayn's family was being transported as prisoners to Damascus.\n\nHeliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric Heliopolis in Augustamnica) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it was wiped out by Islam.\n\nIn 1701, Eastern Catholics (Byzantine Rite) established anew an Eparchy of Baalbek, which in 1964 was promoted to the present Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek.\n\nIn the Latin rite, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal Titular bishopric, promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis in Phoenicia.\n\nIt is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting ranks (Archi- or Episcopal) at the time :\n\n\nBaalbek has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Csa\") with significant continental influences.\n\nBaalbek is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Named for the Bezalel Art School, predecessor of the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, it has been described as \"a fusion of oriental art and Jugendstil.\"\n\nThe Bezalel school artists blended varied strands of surroundings, tradition and innovationin paintings and craft objects that invoked biblical themes, Islamic design and European traditions in their effort to carve out a distinctive style of Jewish art for the new nation planned in the ancient Jewish homeland.\nThe works of art created by the group contributed significantly to the creation of a distinctive Israeli national culture.\n\nThe founder of the school was Boris Schatz, who left his position as head of the Royal Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria, to make aliyah 1906 and established an academy for Jewish arts in Jerusalem. The artists were Zionist immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, with all the psychological and social upheaval that this implies. The movement developed a distinctive style combining Biblical and Zionist subjects with art nouveau, symbolism and traditional Persian and Syrian artistry.\n\nThe Bezalel School produced decorative art objects in a wide range of materials: silver, leather, wood, brass and fabric. While the artists and designers were European-trained, the craftsmen who executed the works were often members of the Yemenite Jewish community, which had a long tradition of craftsmanship in precious metals, and began to make aliyah about 1880. In Yemen, filigree jewelry making was a respected profession among the Jews, with cultural as well as religious applications. Yemenite Jewish silversmiths worked primarily with silver, creating pieces by hand using traditional methods. Yemenite immigrants wearing colorful traditional costumes were also frequent subjects of Bezalel School artists.\n\nLeading members of the school were Boris Schatz, E. M. Lilien, Ya'akov Stark, Meir Gur-Aryeh, Ze'ev Raban, Jacob Eisenberg, Jacob Steinhardt, Shmuel Ben David, and Hermann Struck.\n\nThe artists produced not only paintings and etchings, but objects sold as Judaica and souvenirs. In 1915, \"The New York Times\" praised the “Exquisite examples of filigree work, copper inlay, carving in ivory and in wood,” in a touring exhibit.\n\nIn the metalwork Moorish patterns predominated, and the damascene work, in particular, showed both artistic feeling and skill in execution.\n\n\n\n"}

It shows the epiphany of the triumphant Dionysus.\n\nThe ancient site, with significant excavations and an archaeological museum, is located just outside the modern village of Dion in the Greek region of Central Macedonia in the coastal plain at the foot of Mount Olympus, about 15 km from Katerini and about 17 km from the ancient city of Leivithra.\n\nIn the center of the large mosaic, Dionysus is depicted in a chariot. Next to him stands a mature Silenus, who is more a helper of the god than a driver. The carriage is drawn by two panthers, two centaurs hold their reins. One of the two centaurs is a mature, bearded man carrying a vessel (crater) that probably contains wine. The other Kentauer carries on his shoulder a closed vessel in which presumably the sacred symbols of the Dionysus cult are located. The light background highlights the figure of Dionysus.\n\nThe mosaic artist used mosaic stones (tesserae) of different sizes and several dozens of shades of color to show details. He thereby gave his work the character of a painting. Surely he was inspired to his work by an important Hellenistic painting.\nOf high quality are also the masks under and above the central mosaic. Three on the eastern and three on the western side.\n\nThe middle of the three masks of the lower (eastern) side shows Dionysus with long curls. The mask to his left shows a mature satyr with a snub nose.\n\nThe mask to the right of him shows a barbarian. The eyes sting, his eyes are lowered. Probably it is Lycurgus, King of Thrace, and an enemy of Dionysus. He pursued the young god, who threw himself into the sea and was saved by Thetis.\n\nThe masks above (west) of the Dionysosmosa form a young Satyr on the left and an older Silenius on the right. The mask in between shows the face of a woman with blue eyes and curly hair. This may be the nymph Thetis, the savior of Dionysus.\n\nThe central mosaic of the epiphany of Dionysus has the dimensions of 220 cm by 150 cm; The entire mosaic has a floor area of approximately 100 m².\n\nIn the summer of 1987 archaeologists found the most important mosaic of the extensive excavation site (, excavations are still under way). Protected by the covering soil layer it is almost completely preserved.\n\nOf course this precious find had to be protected but should also be accessible to the public. The archaeologists decided to name the place where the mosaic was unearthed \"Villa of Dionysus\". For over 20 years, the mosaic was sheltered under a roof structure. In order to be able to see the work from all sides, a footbridge was built, on which visitors could orbit it. The roof helped against the rays of the sun, but it was powerless against water and general decay. From year to year the condition became worse: single mosaic stones dissolved from the ground, plants grew in the cracks, it was only a matter of time before this mosaic, which had remained largely intact for nearly two millennia, would be destroyed.\n\nIt was decided to create a special building for this work of art. It is located just west of the museum, the Archaiothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the \"Villa of Dionysos\". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In order to be able to divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special adhesive fabric and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several belt tensioners, the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500 kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaiothiki.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Archaiothiki, a precise image of the entire mosaic was spread on the ground. It was made on a scale of 1:1 to show the restorers where to place each single part. In order to stabilize the mosaic stones, in the next step, the carrier layer under the mosaic was removed and replaced by mortar. With steam, the curators dissolved the special adhesive fabric and removed the attached protective materials. In June 2017 the works had been finished.\n\n"}

She recorded an extensive spiritual journal in which she recorded appearances from Jesus Christ as well as saints such as Gemma Galgani and John Bosco. Carboni also experienced demonic experiences and was said to possess the stigmata.\n\nThe cause for beatification commenced in 1968 though she was accorded the title of Servant of God on 29 April 1994. Pope Francis titled her as Venerable on 4 May 2017 upon the confirmation of her life of heroic virtue. Francis later confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession in late 2018 and she is to be beatified in her native Sardinia sometime in 2019.\n\nEdvige Carboni was born in Sassari on the evening of 2 May 1880 as the second of six children to Giovanni Battista Carboni (d. 1937) and Maria Domenica Pinna (d. 1910); her sister was Paulina (b. 1895) and she also had four brothers (including Galdino (15 April 1889 – 7 March 1977)) and at least one other sister. Carboni received her baptism on the following 4 May 1880 from the vice-parish priest Sanna. She received her Confirmation in 1884 from Mgr. Eliseo Giordano and made a vow to remain chaste in 1885. She started school in 1886 and finished three grades of education.\n\nHer mother recalled Edvige's birth and told her that on that occasion she had seen a luminous host in the monstrance and would tell her daughter this because: \"If I die, you must receive Holy Communion every day and you should be very good, because Jesus, a few moments after you were born, showed me a host, as I have told you\". Another odd phenomenon that took place after her birth was a supernatural branding of the Cross on her breast formed from her own flesh.\n\nHer mother taught her embroidery as a child and she would work with her father in the embroidery business. She also spent time in the convent of the Sisters of Saint Vincent in Alghero where the nuns led a course in embroidery. Her mother's frail health saw her tend to the education and care of her younger siblings as well as other domestic duties.\n\nCarboni made her First Communion in 1891. She wanted to become a nun in 1895 but her mother disapproved of it and she took this disapproval as a sign of the will of God. In 1895 her sister Paulina was born; at that point she had brothers and no sister. From 1896 her visions of Jesus and Mary became ever more frequent. She became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis in 1906 and belonged to an association known as the Friends of Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus; she began recording her thoughts in a spiritual journal. Her mother died in 1910 and her responsibilities tripled.\n\nIn her grandmother's home remained a replica of Raphael's painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Infant Jesus: she would climb a chair to reach the image and would say to the Blessed Mother: \"My mother, I love you. Give me your child so that I can play with Him\". Carboni was required to do the shopping due to her mother's ill health despite being fearful of having to shop in the evening. But her guardian angel appeared to her and told her: \"Don't be afraid. I am with you and I keep you good company\".\n\nShe attended her brother Galdino's marriage to Penelope Gerundini (8 May 1899 – 31 December 1979).\n\nHer spiritual gifts included levitation and the reading of hearts as well as the discernment of spirits and frequent visits from the souls in Purgatory. She also had several visions of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and on their first encounter he asked her: \"Do you know me?\" to which she replied that she did not. Gonzaga said: \"I am Saint Aloysius Gonzaga. I have come to tell you that I love you very much and that you should love Jesus always\".\n\nCarboni noted in her spiritual journal on 16 November 1938 how she received the stigmata – for she wanted to suffer for the glory of God – while she recorded in her journal on 12 June 1941 her first encounter with Saint John Bosco. Bosco even invited her to enroll as a Salesian in an appearance on 25 September 1941. Carboni also received the transverberation and recorded a case of demonic encounter in December 1941. Her experiences with the Devil became more aggressive as time progressed. On one occasion she was kicked in the legs and on another her gold fillings were stolen. She once was confined to her bed for a while after a hammer hit her in the knees.\n\nCarboni experienced a number of visions from saints:\nCarboni also had visits from Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina in her visions despite the fact that the priest was in fact alive. Padre Pio knew of Carboni and referred to her as a \"saint\". She also knew Saint Luigi Orione.\n\nShe began to experience bilocation in 1925 and this grew greater during World War II. In 1929 her sister Paulina found a job as a teacher in Marcellina Scalo – a small town between Rome and Tivoli. Her father did not want Paulina to leave so the entire family relocated from Sardinia to the mainland. In 1934 she moved to Albano Laziale until the death of her father in 1937 and she finally settled in Rome in 1938. From 1941 she became part of the Confraternity of the Passion of Scala Santa in Rome. On 11 August 1941 she wrote of Jesus allowing her a view of Heaven.\n\nCarboni spent the last fourteen years of her life living with her sister Paulina in Rome. Her final spiritual director was the Passionist priest Ignacio Parmeggiani. Her time in Rome saw her teach catechism while tending to the poor and the ill. She received praise for her piety from the Servant of God Giovanni Battista Manzella and priests such as Ernesto Maria Piovella and Felice Cappello.\n\nOn 17 February 1952 she got up in the morning to attend Mass and came home for a meal before going back to church to hear Father Lombardi preach a sermon. She and her sister arrived home via train at 8:30pm when she complained that she did not feel well. Her sister summoned a doctor and two priests from their parish who gave her the Last Rites. Carboni died of angina pectoris at 10:30pm and was buried in Albano Laziale. Her grave was with that of her brother Galdino and his wife.\n\nHer remains from a white coffin were exhumed in October 2015 for canonical inspection as part of the canonization cause. Her remains were relocated as a result of this.\n\nThe beatification process opened in the Diocese of Rome in a diocesan process that opened in December 1968 and concluded sometime later after having taken all of the available documents and interrogatories – this also included her spiritual journal.\n\nOn 29 April 1994 she became a Servant of God – under Pope John Paul II – with the formal commencement of the cause following the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granting the \"nihil obstat\" ('nothing against') to the cause.\n\nThe second process opened on 18 October 1999 and concluded on 1 June 2001 after which the C.C.S. validated the process on 1 March 2002. The postulation submitted the Positio in 2008 while theologians could not come up with conclusive approval the cause on 10 October 2013 after debating the extent of her mysticism and the depth of her spiritual writings with some aspects still requiring greater investigation; the theologians met again and provided their definitive approval to the cause on 29 November 2016. The C.C.S. approved her cause on 2 May 2017; Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue on 4 May 2017 and named her as Venerable.\n\nThe miracle required for her beatification was investigated in the place of its origin and received C.C.S. validation on 6 October 2000. Medical examiners inspected and approved the documents pertaining to this alleged miracle on 23 November 2017. Theologians later confirmed the miracle on 26 April 2018 and the C.C.S. members meet and approved this healing on 6 November 2018. Pope Francis approved this miracle in a decree on 7 November 2018 which allows for Carboni's beatification; it shall be held in her native Sardinia in 2019.\n\nThe current postulator assigned to the cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.\n\n"}

After the end of World War II in 1948, due to the communist regime, they had to close their school and flee to Switzerland, where they founded a new yoga school.\n\nIn her best known book, \"Initiation\", Haich describes early experiences of her life in Hungary, as well as details of her supposed past life during which she claimed to have been initiated as a priestess of Ra by her supposed uncle, Ptahhotep, in what she refers to as ancient Egypt. The book also describes a little of a more recent claimed previous life in which she was a washing-woman, was abandoned by her lover, lost contact with her daughter, and ended up a beggar on the streets.\n\nHer book \"The Wisdom of the Tarot\" is based on the Oswald Wirth deck's images (but some colors are different, for some details), and it is about the archetypes of human development, each Tarot card identifying one archetype and its meaning.\n\nHer book \"Sexual Energy & Yoga\" identifies how sexual energy, when contained, builds among one's chakras, boiling the ignorance resident among them, eventually awakening them, and making possible enlightenment.\n\nElisabeth Haich claimed to have attained \"ego-death\". It was described by her followers (mentioned in the introductions to her book) as visible in her gaze: \"her gaze wasn't the gaze of a person, it was the gaze of infinity, and it wasn't blind to one's unconsciousness or ignoring: a gaze that cut right through one's unconsciousness, a gaze very difficult to bear.\"\n\n\n"}

While studying she met Castaneda and worked with him on developing his thinking.\nIn addition to working on Castaneda's books, she has written several books about indigenous healing, sorcery and lucid dreaming.\n\nIn 1982 Florinda Donner published a book, \"Shabono: A Visit to a Remote and Magical World in the South American Rain Forest\", named after the Yanomami word for shelter, a narrative of her life among the Yanomami Indians in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nWhile initially praised as a compelling account of Yanomami culture, in 1983 controversy broke out when an article in \"American Anthropologist\" accused the book of not being based on original ethnographic work, but instead being a patchwork made of previously published ethnographic accounts. Rebecca De Holmes, the author of the critique, stated that it was unlikely that Donner had spent any amount of time among the Yanomami. Particularly she criticized Donner for having plagiarized the biographical account of the Brazilian woman Helena Valero, who grew up as a captive among the Yanomami, without acknowledging having borrowed large parts of her life-story. Another critical review, by Dr. Debra Picchi, argues that the book was invalid as social science because of the author's auto-biographical focus on her personal development and experience, rather than on describing the Yanomami people. One critic suspected that Donner might have worked from the many ethnographic movies about the Yanomami and argued that in that case her book could be considered an interpretive study of the visual documentary data.\n\nThe validity of De Holmes' critique was largely accepted by the anthropological community. Even though Donner did not anywhere claim that her book was based on having actually lived among the Yanomami, she was roundly criticized for having used the ethnographic writing genre without her work in fact being based on anthropological methods. Eventually her former doctoral committee at UCLA published a letter in the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, in which they expressed their disbelief in Donner's account, stating that she was present in Los Angeles during the period in which she supposedly lived among the Yanomami. When the book was published they were not aware that the author was their former student, due to her having changed her name in the meantime.\n\nSome scholars later wondered why her book was criticized for being unscientific, even though it never made any explicit claims to scientific authority. Combined with the controversy generated by the writings of Carlos Castaneda, the controversy about Donner's book contributed to sparking the ethnography \"crisis of representation\" of the 1980s, represented by the \"Writing Culture\" movement. The book is now generally considered \"anthropologically-inspired fiction\".\n\n"}
{"id": "322699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322699", "title": "Freedom of religion in Malaysia", "text": "Freedom of religion in Malaysia\n\nFreedom of religion is enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution. First, Article 11 provides that every person has the right to profess and to practice his or her religion and (subject to applicable laws restricting the propagation of other religions to Muslims) to propagate it. Second, the Constitution also provides that Islam is the religion of the country but other religions may be practised in peace and harmony (Article 3).\n\nThe status of freedom of religion in Malaysia is a controversial issue. Questions including whether Malaysia is an Islamic state or secular state remains unresolved. In recent times, there has been a number of contentious issues and incidents which has tested the relationship between the different religious groups in Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia has a population of just over 27 million. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices Islam; 19.8 percent Buddhism; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 1.3 percent traditional Chinese religions. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism, Baha'i and other belief systems. However, these figures may be misleading as professing the religion of Islam is a requirement for being a Malay in the sense of the Malaysian Constitution. Moreover, Muslims who wish to leave Islam face strong disincentives.\n\nThe nation maintains two parallel justice systems in the country (see: Courts of Malaysia). One is the secular justice system based upon laws gazetted by Parliament. The other is sharia (syariah, Islamic law). Ostensibly Syariah Courts only have jurisdiction over persons who declare themselves to be Muslims. Consequently, this results in non-Muslims not having legal standing in Syariah Courts.\n\nWhere decisions of the syariah court affect a non-Muslim, he or she can seek recourse in the secular courts which, in theory, overrule the syariah courts as the Syariah courts are limited in their jurisdiction by Article 121 of the Federal constitution. In 2006 a judge ruled that Article 121 limited the federal courts from ruling on matters ruled on by the Syariah court when it touches Islamic matters. This was seen as a misinterpretation of the article by some, and the case is under appeal in the court of appeals.\n\nThe rules of sharia are set by the various sultans of the states. Historically a sultan had absolute authority over the state. Prior to independence, Tunku Abdul Rahman managed to convince the sultans to cede some states' powers to the federal government. One of the terms of this agreement is that the sultans still are the ultimate authority of Islamic law in their respective states. The same arrangement was long held even during British colonial rule. In Selangor, the Selangor Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Among Muslims) Enactment 1988 was signed by the Sultan of Selangor into law forbidding non-Muslims from using the word \"Allah\"\n\nConstitutionally (in Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia), one of the four tests for entitlement to the privileges accorded to a Malaysian Malay is that one must be a Muslim. The rationale for this is that Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, which culturally and historically is ruled by a Sultan who is a Muslim. Another test is that one must follow the Malay culture. Controversially, court rulings have assumed that all ethnic Malays must automatically satisfy this constitutional definition of a Malaysian Malay, and have therefore concluded that they must satisfy all of its requirements, so they have to be Muslim.\n\nOn 29 September 2001, the then Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad declared that the country was an Islamic state (\"negara Islam\"). The opposition leader at the time, Lim Kit Siang, is now actively seeking support to declare Mahathir's move as unconstitutional by repeatedly clarifying that Malaysia is a secular state with Islam as its official religion as enshrined in the Constitution. However, the coalition government headed by Mahathir at the time held more than two-thirds of the seats in parliament. A two-thirds majority vote in Parliament is required for constitutional amendments in Malaysia.\n\nGovernment in general supports Islamic religious establishment and it is the official policy to \"infuse Islamic values\" into the administration of the country.\n\nHowever, Sunday which is the Christian traditional holiday is the official weekend holiday in the Federal Territories and ten out of thirteen states, unlike practices in Middle Eastern Muslim countries. The exception are the states of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu, where the weekend falls on Friday and Saturday. Most Muslims in Malaysia accept this, although some have expressed disquiet since the most holy period in a Muslim's week is between Thursday evening and Friday afternoon, when the congregational Jumaat prayer is held. The practice of having Sunday as the weekend holiday is a departure from traditional Islamic practices, dating to British colonial days when the British started bringing in non-Muslim immigrants into the country.\n\nIn May 2001, the government decided not to approve the Falun Gong Preparatory Committee's application to register as a legal organisation. This action is believed to be more related to the government's wish to improve relations with China rather than an attempt to undermine the Falun Gong in favour of Islam. The government has not prevented Falun Gong members from carrying out their activities in public.\n\nFor Muslim children, religious education according to a government-approved curriculum is compulsory in public schools. There are no restrictions on homeschooling, although primary school is compulsory. However, private schools and colleges do have some legal requirements.\n\nSeveral religious holidays are recognised as official holidays, including Hari Raya Puasa (Muslim), Hari Raya Haji (Muslim), the Prophet's birthday (Muslim), Wesak Day (Buddhist), Deepavali (Hindu), Thaipusam (Hindu), Christmas (Christian), and, in Sabah and Sarawak, Good Friday (Christian).\n\nJudaism is not a recognized religion in Malaysia and movements within the religion which incorporate Zionism or prayers for the state of Israel or even the rebuilding of Jerusalem as found in the Amidah in Traditional or Orthodox Judaism which may not necessarily be political or Zionist but an expression of a [spiritual connection to Jerusalem] are outrightly illegal. The same law applies to non Jews who organize prayer gatherings for the same reason who would then also be accused of promoting \"Jewish culture\". Individuals who express support for the state of Israel openly can be charged under Section 4(1)(a) of the Sedition Act. The sedition law prescribes a maximum fine of RM5,000 or a jail sentence of three years for a convicted first-time offender, or both, and raises the jail term to five years for subsequent offenses. The use of Jewish symbols is seen as being insensitive in a multi-racial country and therefore prohibited. This is especially true for the Menorah (Chanukiah) because it also commemorates the re-dedication of the holy temple in Jerusalem. Even Jewish prayer items such as a Torah scroll delivered into the country may be confiscated by customs [if it was made known to them that its purpose was for the observance of Judaism]; thus (in reality) the practice of Judaism be it Zionist or not is forbidden. In an interview with Al-Jazeera in 2016 Tun Dr Mahathir Muhamad (current prime minister) conflated all Jews with the State of Israel and reaffirmed his statement that Jews rule the world by proxy. In a sermon prepared by the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department (JAWI) it was stated that Jews are to be regarded as the main enemy of Muslims. In 1984 the New York Philharmonic Orchestra had to cancel its visit to Malaysia after the Malaysian Information Minister demanded that a composition by American-Jewish composer Ernest Bloch, be eliminated from their program. That incident had nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; only a rejection of all things Jewish. \n\nIn April 2002, the Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) initiated an interfaith dialogue aimed at promoting better understanding and respect among the country's different religious groups. Participants included representatives from the Malaysian Islamic Development Department, the Malaysian Ulama Association, and the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism (MCCBCHS).\n\nIn early 2005, much debate was stirred up by a proposed Inter-Faith Commission put forward by various individuals, some of which included academics and lawyers from the Bar Council.\n\nThe steering committee behind the proposal for a draft bill for the commission organised a national conference that saw about 200+ people from all religious backgrounds attending it. There they hashed out the framework for a commission that could advise the relevant parties on the many interfaith issues that arise in pluralistic Malaysia such as conversion from Islam to another faith, which is deemed as apostasy in Malaysia.\n\nPAS, member of parliament Dzulkefly Ahmad, stated that he is against religious pluralism saying that it has \"relativised\" truth claims, by implying that Islam is the same as other religions. Dr. Ahmad went on to make a distinction between promoting relativism of religions and co-operation with people in a \"multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual\" society, and that the latter was necessary to build a strong country.\n\nAfter much coverage in the local newspapers, the draft bill was put on hold by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, due to the controversy surrounding it.\n\nA non-Muslim person who wishes to marry a Muslim person must convert to Islam before the marriage can be recognised as legally valid. A marriage between two non-Muslims (civil law marriages), however, will not become void after one spouse subsequently converts to Islam.\n\nIn 2006, T. Saravanan, a Muslim convert, sought to dissolve his marriage with his non-Muslim wife via the Syariah Court. His wife, R. Subashini, applied to Kuala Lumpur High Court for an injunction against her husband seeking divorce in the Syariah Court. The High Court dismissed her application. This was affirmed in the Court of Appeal, where the court also ordered Subashini to take her case to the Syariah Court. As of September 2007, their case is pending in the Federal Court after an appeal by Subashini. Subashini is also seeking to stop or declare void the conversion of their children. As of 27 December 2007, R. Subashini failed in an attempt to stop her husband from divorcing her in an Islamic court. She also failed to persuade the federal court her husband should be banned from converting their four-year-old son to Islam. The appeal was rejected on a technicality but court added that she would be able to try again in a few months.\n\nConversion to other faiths is allowed in Malaysia once one has reached an age of majority. A minor may not convert to another faith without explicit permission of his or her guardian as described in the Guardianship of Infants Act (1961) and the Federal Constitution (Articles 11 (1) and 12 (3) and (4)).\n\nThis case was tested by Teoh Eng Huat vs Kadhi mot of Pasir Mas Kelantan in 1986. Teoh Eng Huat's daughter was a ward of the state. She married a Muslim. Hence then a minor, converted to Islam. The high court ruled that the father's right to decide the religion and upbringing of the infant is allowed \"subject to the condition that it does not conflict with the principles of the infant's choice of religion guaranteed to her under the Federal Constitution\". Through the proceedings, Susie Teoh never appeared in court to testify.\n\nThe decision was over-ruled on appeal to the Supreme Court, who held \"in all the circumstances and in the wider interests of the nation no infant shall have the automatic right to receive instruction relating to any other religion other than (her) own without the permission of the parent or guardian\".\n\nThe Supreme Court further held that this was \"only of academic interest\" as Susie Teoh was no longer a minor at the time of hearing.\n\nIn response several states (Islamic laws are passed by individual states) passed laws providing for conversion by 15 (defined as \"baligh\" in Islam or the age of puberty). Federal law still provides for the age of majority as 18.\n\nThe state of Selangor passed a legal amendment in 1989 that if an adult converts to Islam, any infant children become converted at the same moment. This passed over the opposition of the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Democratic Action Party, and became law. However, after public outcry, it was quietly removed by its non-inclusion in future amendments of the state bill.\n\nIn the case of Chang Ah Mee v Jbt. Hal Ehwal Agama Islam (2003) heard in the Sabah High Court, the father converted to Islam and converted the child to Islam without consent or knowledge of the mother, Chang Ah Mee, on 28 July 1998. The mother gained custody of the child on 13 November 1998 and subsequently sued to declare the conversion void.\n\nThe court determined that as a state court, it had jurisdiction over all state matters even those concerning Islam. Further, based upon the Federal Constitution (article 12), The Guardianship of Infants Ordinance (Sabah) 1999, The Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act, 1976 and The Administration of Islamic Law Enactment 1992 (Sabah) determined the conversion of a two-year-old child to be void.\n\nIn 2003, this issue became prominent again in the case of Shamala Sathiyaseelan v Dr. Jeyaganesh C. Mogarajah. In the first hearing before the High Court, Shamala Sathiyaseelan sought (1) to bring committal proceedings against the father of the infants for breach of the interim custody order of the High Court of 17 April 2003, and (2) to declare that she was not bound by any decisions, order or proceedings of the syariah court.\n\nEarlier the High Court had granted custody to Shamala Sathiyaseelan with access for the father. He failed to return the children to her on 25 May 2003. Shamala and Jeyaganesh were married under Hindu rites registered under the jurisdiction of the Law Reform Act. The husband converted to Islam on 19 November 2002. On 25 November 2002 he converted the children without the mother's knowledge or consent. They were still not divorced at the time.\n\nWithout knowledge of Shamala he then obtained a custody order in the syariah court on 30 January 2003.\nThe High Court ruled that the custody order issued by the syariah court \"did not change the interim civil court order\". They ruled that the syariah court order \"is not binding on the plaintiff wife who is non-Muslim\". The interim custody order of the High Court and proceedings were binding on the now Muslim husband as matters arising out of the Hindu marriage registered under the Law Reform Act. As his Hindu wife did not file for divorce, she remains \"his unconverted wife\" under this law.\n\nOn 13 April 2004 Shamala once again went to the high court. This time to seek an order that the conversion of the infants was void. As in Chang Ah Mee, she cited the Federal Constitution (Article 12), the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 and the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act, 1993.\n\nThe Guardianship of Infants Act for the Federal Territories differed from that of Sabah in one aspect as it used the term \"parent or guardian\" and not \"both parents or a guardian\" as in AMLE Sabah.\n\nIn this case the High Court ruled that only the consent of one parent is required in the conversion to Islam of a person below 18 in the Federal Territories.\n\nArticle 12(4) of the Federal Constitution reads \"For the purposes of cl. (3) the religion of a person under the age of eighteen years shall be decided by his parent or guardian.\"\n\nThe High Court interpreted the term parent to mean father. The equality of rights granted to both parents under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1961 was held inapplicable on the Muslim father.\n\nIn its judgement the High Court held the fatwa or the Mufti of the Federal Territory as persuasive (legal term). The Mufti stated that the father had the right to unilaterally convert the infants to Islam.\n\nShamala once again went to the high court on 20 July 2004 to apply inter alia for custody, care and control of the infants. The court awarded it with access for the father. In its judgement, it stated that \"the right of religious practice of the two infant children shall be exercised equally by both parents\" based on the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961. This was in spite of the earlier ruling that this act does not apply to Jeyaganesh who was now a Muslim.\n\nThe court also held that the applicable law at the time of conversion was civil law. It even ruled that the infants were \"still Hindus at the time of conversion\" and that the father should have consulted the mother before converting the infants.\n\nHowever the court explicitly cautioned the mother from \"influencing the infants'\nreligious belief by teaching them her articles of faith or by making them eat pork\" or she would risk losing her children. The rationale given was that the court \"cannot run away from the fact that the two infant children are now muallaf\" (converts to Islam).\n\nAs the case has gained prominence various religious organisations, human rights organisations and women's issues organisations have registered watching briefs. En. Haris Bin Mohamed Ibrahim has registered a watching brief on behalf of the Women's Aid Organisation, (WAO), All Women's Action Society (AWAM), Women's Center for Change, Penang (WCC) and Sisters in Islam (SIS). A. Kanesalingam, held watching brief for the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism (MCCBCHS). Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Bar Council are also holding watching briefs for this case. The various organisations holding watching brief in this case now call themselves loosely Article 11 after the article of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion.\n\nIn 2014, the Seremban High Court over-ruled a Shariah Court, granting custody of Muslim children to their Hindu mother over that of their father who converted to Islam. However the father Izwan Viran Abdullah abducted the son from the mother after the ruling, and in which the police refused to help the mother retrieve the son citing the original Shariah custody ruling. The police inaction was criticised by Women's Aid Organisation and both governing and opposition politicians.\n\nMuslims who wish to convert from Islam face severe obstacles. For Muslims, particularly ethnic Malays, the right to leave the Islamic faith and adhere to another religion is a controversial question. The legal process of conversion is also unclear; in practice it is very difficult for Muslims to change their religion legally.\n\nIn 1999 the High Court ruled that secular courts have no jurisdiction to hear applications by Muslims to change religions. According to the ruling, the religious conversion of Muslims lies solely within the jurisdiction of Islamic courts.\n\nThe issue of Muslim apostasy is very sensitive. In 1998 after a controversial incident of attempted conversion, the Government stated that apostates (i.e., Muslims who wish to leave or have left Islam for another religion) would not face government punishment so long as they did not defame Islam after their conversion. However, whether the very act of conversion was an \"insult to Islam\" was not clarified at the time. The Government opposes what it considers deviant interpretations of Islam, maintaining that the \"deviant\" groups' extreme views endanger national security. In 2005 international media attention focused on the Sky Kingdom sect whose founder Ayah Pin claimed to be God, and whose members – mostly Malays – were accordingly charged with religious \"deviancy\" and \"humiliating Islam.\"\n\nIn the past, the Government imposed restrictions on certain Islamic groups, primarily the small number of Shi'a. The Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'a minority.\n\nIn April 2000, the state of Perlis passed a sharia law subjecting Islamic \"deviants\" and apostates to 1 year of \"rehabilitation\" (under the Constitution, religion, including sharia law, is a state matter). Leaders of the opposition Islamic party, PAS, have stated the penalty for apostasy – after the apostates are given a period of time to repent and they do not repent – is death.\n\nMany Muslims who have converted to Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and other religions lead \"double lives\", hiding their new faith from friends and family.\n\nGeneral interpretation about the freedom of religion as described in the constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion \"at a whim and fancy\". For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only wants to change the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation of the situation is that only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.\n\nThe Lina Joy case challenged this view of the situation by taking the problem of apostasy to the Federal Court in 2007. Lina Joy lost the case and was denied identification as a Christian on her identification card. This cleared the situation about the overlapping areas of jurisdiction between the Islamic and the secular courts in Malaysia.\n\nAs Malaysia is a federation, certain matters, such as religion, are handled by state governments. There is subsequently some amount of divergence between different states in the treatment of converts from Islam.\n\nStatistics indicate that Negeri Sembilan has the largest number of converts, with 840 applications made to officially renounce Islam in 2005, 62 of which succeeded. An academic has suggested that this is because Negeri Sembilan is the only state which (officially) permits conversion. A convert must first apply to the Shariah Court for a declaration that he or she is no longer a Muslim; the convert will then be counselled for about a year by a Mufti. If, after this period, the convert still wants to convert, the judge may permit the application. This process is unique to the state; no other state allows Muslims to officially convert. In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Court also permitted Wong Ah Kiu, a convert from Islam to Buddhism legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, to be buried in the Buddhist fashion, although her conversion had not been legally recognised while she was still alive. The case marked the first time non-Muslims had testified in a Shariah court in Malaysia.\n\nIn five states (Perak, Pahang, Malacca, Sabah, and Terengganu) conversion is a crime punishable by a fine or imprisonment. In Pahang, conversion can also be punished with up to six strokes of the cane.\n\nLina Joy, who was born Azalina Jailani, converted from Islam to Christianity, arguing that it came under her right to freedom of religion under Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia. She first approached the National Registration Department (NRD) in February 1997, seeking permission to change her name to Lina Joy, and also her religious status. The application was rejected in August 1997 on the grounds that the Syariah Court had not granted permission for her to renounce Islam. In 1998, the NRD allowed the name change, but refused to change the religious status on her identity card.\n\nJoy appealed against this decision in the High Court, arguing that she should not be subject to sharia law, having converted to Christianity. In April 2001, Judge Datuk Faiza Tamby Chik ruled that she could not change her religious identity, because ethnic Malays are defined as Muslims under the Constitution. Joy then took her case to the Court of Appeal. On 19 September 2005, the court ruled in a 2–1 majority decision against Joy. Justice Abdul Aziz and Justice Arifin Zakaria agreed that the NRD was correct in rejecting Joy's application and said it was up to the Syariah Court to settle the issue (Justice Gopal Sri Ram said it was null and void. ). Joy further appealed to the Federal Court of Malaysia, the highest court and the court of last resort in Malaysia. The Federal Court heard the appeal in July 2006, and it was presided by the Chief Justice of Malaysia Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Richard Malanjum, and Federal Court Judge Alauddin Sheriff.\n\nOn 30 May 2007, the Federal Court, in a 2–1 decision, dismissed Joy's appeal. The Court's panel ruled that only the Syariah Court had the power to allow Joy to remove her religious designation of Islam from her national identity card. Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim and Federal Court judge Justice Alauddin Mohd Sheriff delivered the majority decision dismissing her appeal. Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Justice Richard Malanjum dissented.\n\nRevathi Massosai is a Malaysian woman who was raised as a Hindu but her identity card designates her as a Muslim. She has declared her religion to be Hindu and has petitioned unsuccessfully to have the word \"Islam\" removed from her identity card. Massosai married a Hindu man, but her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because of the religion issue. Massosai was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion.\nRevathi was denied the guardianship of her new born baby and was not allowed to meet her Hindu husband.\n\nThere have been a few high-profile incidences and accounts of persecution of people from Muslim backgrounds attempting to convert from the Islamic faith. Some notable cases include:\nHilmy Mohd Noor, in his book \"Circumcised Heart\", describes his experiences during his detention under the Internal Security Act of Malaysia in what he described as resulting from religious persecution by Malaysian authorities. In the book, he also mentioned incidences of lobbying by some Muslims in his place of employment—a multinational oil company—to get his job terminated.\n\n\nIn 2016 a court in Sarawak state allowed a Muslim to convert back to Christianity since he had become a Muslim when he was underage.\n\nProselytising of Muslims by members of other religions is not prohibited by federal law, even though Muslims may proselytise. It is however prohibited in 10 of the 13 states (i.e. excepting Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) and can lead to lengthy jail sentences and many strokes of the \"rotan\" (whipping). Most Christian and a few other religious groups in Malaysia put a standard disclaimer on literature and advertisements stating \"For non-Muslims only\".\n\nIn 2002 the government banned the Bible in Malay (Alkitab) and in Iban (Bup Kudus). The Kudus uses the term \"Allah Taala\" for God. The ban has since been rescinded. Abdullah Badawi, when in office as Home Minister, claimed it was the work of an overzealous bureaucrat and he had the ban repealed personally.\n\nSome states have laws that prohibit the use of Malay-language religious terms such as usage of the term \"Allah\" for God by Christians, but the authorities do not enforce them actively.\n\nDistribution of other materials such as books or tapes translated into Bahasa Melayu (local Malay) or Indonesian is also discouraged. However, Malay-language Christian materials are available. Prior to the banning of the Bup Kudus in 2002, the distribution of Malay-language Christian materials faced few restrictions in East Malaysia.\n\nIn recent years, visas for foreign clergy no longer are restricted, and most visas were approved during the period covered by this report. Beginning in March 2000, representative non-Muslims were invited to sit on the immigration committee that approves such visa requests.\n\nAccording to government figures there are about 40,000 Shiites living in Malaysia, however there are unofficial figures such as that ballooning to 100,000. Shiites are subjected to persecutions and raids by various state religious authorities in Malaysia. In 1996, a decree by the National Fatwa Council was issued that called for curbs on the Shia minority's right to practise their faith, causing many Shias to practice their religion underground.\n\nIn April 2009, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council of Malaysia issued a letter which forbade members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to offer Friday prayers at their central mosque with immediate effect. Moreover, its failure by the Ahmadis to comply with the terms of the order will result in imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine up to 3000 Malaysian ringgit. A large notice has been place outside the mosque which states \"Qadiani Bukan Agama Islam\" which translates to \"Qadiani [Ahmadiyyat] is not an Islamic Religion.\"\n\nThe state has come under criticism from human rights organisations for its discrimination against atheists. In August 2017, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Shahidan Kassim declared that \"atheism is against the Constitution and the basic human rights\" in Malaysia since \"there is no provision on atheism\" in the Constitution. Shahidan wanted atheists and atheist groups like the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Atheist Republic to be identified and hunted down. He also stated that \"we need to restore the faith back in them, especially for Muslims. Actually they don't really want to be an atheist, but they lack knowledge about religion and that is why they are easily swayed to the new age teaching\". Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Islamic affairs, stated that the group Atheist Republic will be investigated.\n\nThe government generally respects non-Muslims' right of worship; however, state governments carefully control the building of non-Muslim places of worship and the allocation of land for non-Muslim cemeteries. Approvals for such permits sometimes are granted very slowly.\n\nThe Catholic Society of Shah Alam had been lobbying the state government for a permit to build a church in that city for more than 10 years. It was not until recently that the permit was finally granted. The church opened its doors on 10 September 2005.\n\nThe new pre-planned capital of Malaysia, Putrajaya, features a grand mosque as a prominent feature of the planned community. On 16 November 2005, Archbishop Murphy Pakiam announced that the Malaysian government had generously allocated a parcel of land in Putrajaya to the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur for building a Catholic church-run community centre. The Putrajaya Catholic Church Building Committee was set up on 3 October 2005. According to the committee, \"The architectural planning and design will conform to the Liturgical requirements complimenting the ambience of Putrajaya's lush greenery and landscape. We envisage the Putrajaya church to be a hallmark of the Catholic community in Malaysia and showcase the rich heritage of the Malaysian Catholics.\"\n\nApproximately nine percent of the population of Malaysia are Indians, of whom nearly 90 percent are practising Hindus. Indian settlers came to Malaysia from India in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAfter a violent conflict in Penang between Hindus and Muslims in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate. In April 2006, local authorities demolished several Hindu temples to make way for developmental projects. Their excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land.\n\nBetween April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus. On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.\n\nThe president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.\n\nOn 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from Kuala Lumpur forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus. The \"Hindu Rights Action Force\", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister. Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built \"illegally\". However, several of the temples are centuries old.\n\nAccording to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a Hindu temple is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.\n\nMalaysian Muslims have also grown more anti-Hindu over the years. In response to the proposed construction of a temple in Selangor, Muslims chopped off the head of a cow to protest, with leaders saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in Shah Alam.\n\nLaws in the country, especially those concerning religious identity, are generally slanted towards compulsion into converting to Islam.\n\nThe first Islamic call to prayer or Azan (also spelt Adhan), known as \"subuh\" (or dawn), occurs between as early as 4.30 AM to as late as 6.15 AM (depending on which region, city and state) with the exact time drifting throughout the year. Most Malaysian businesses start work as early as 7 AM up till as late as 9 AM. Many mosques amplify the early prayer call by way of loud speakers, and while in some cases only a few neighbouring homes are affected, some large mosques (for example the State Mosque of Selangor which has speakers on its minarets) have prayer calls which can be heard in a large surrounding area.\n\nIn 2004 the Bar Council of Malaysia journal \"Infoline\" carried an article which questioned the need for the Azan as it was disturbing to non-Muslims and not needful. The article was condemned because Azan is a religious requirement.\n\nIn December 2004, Minister of Culture, Arts and Heritage Datuk Seri Utama Dr Rais Yatim mentioned in an interview that the Azan may be disturbing. He stated \"...the Muslim call for Subuh (dawn) prayer may disturb the sleep of non-Muslims but they have accepted this as a fundamental part of Islam. But how loud the volume of the PA system in the mosque should be, is another matter.\"\n\nExcessive noise however is common matter of uneasiness among some Malaysians because non-Muslims also often practise rituals that cause much discomfort to others (Muslims and non-Muslims alike). Among these are Chinese funeral processions that are often accompanied by drums and cymbals, and other rituals not exclusive to the Chinese.\n\nA local daily, The Star reported that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw to regulate the Azan so that it will not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims caused a stir in the Dewan Rakyat. Muslim MPs accused him of being insensitive and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz blasted the DAP member for allegedly trying to destroy the multi-religious tolerance in the country.\n\nIn Malaysia, there is a rebate in income tax for money paid to the government in form of \"zakat\", or the obligatory alms Muslims must give to the poor. However, money paid to other causes in the name of other religions under similar circumstances is given only income tax relief, and such relief is given only if the particular beneficiary has obtained approved status from the Malaysian Government, which is difficult in practice. Money donated to such approved beneficiary is only deducted from the income on which the amount of tax is based, while zakat is deducted from the amount of tax itself. For example, suppose a person earning RM 50,000 owes a tax of RM 3,000 and donates RM 1,000 to zakat, the whole of the RM 1,000 is directly deducted from the RM 3,000, whereas donations to other approved beneficiary would permit only a deduction of the RM 1,000 against the RM 50,000. The former being a tax credit and the latter being a tax deduction.\n\nZakat (or tithe) monies, however, are paid by Muslims directly to official organisations run by state governments. Receipts are issued out and must be submitted to apply for tax relief.\nThe zakat organisations themselves are governed by specific Islamic rulings defining the categories of people who qualify to receive the alms as well as the amount to be paid out by Muslims based on their income.\n\nIn contrast, charities in Malaysia are run privately by voluntary organisations, collecting voluntary donations from the general public, not compulsory tithes – thus the difference in treatment by the government.\n\nAdditionally, income tax relief granted to companies for donation made to tax exempt charities is restricted to 5% of the aggregate income of the company. Not all non-Muslim charities are granted tax exempt status, it is only given to registered and approved charities, partly to prevent abuse. There are stringent requirements to gain this advantage. Having earned this advantage these charities are further disadvantage in that their prospective donors are discouraged from donating monies to these charities because the donors are given tax relief for up to 5% of their aggregate income only.\n\nUpon the death of a Muslim, his or her estate shall be distributed according to sharia law. This is called the \"Faraid\" or the Islamic law of Inheritance. A Muslim is allowed to make a will, called a \"wasiat\", but only one-third of his estate shall be disposed of according to the will. Furthermore, the requirement under sharia law is that disposition according to wills shall not benefit any person opposed to Islam as a religion. This situation applies throughout Peninsula Malaysia and Sabah. In Sarawak, a Muslim testator may dispose one-third of his property to anyone he or she wishes.\n\nMovies which depict people considered prophets in Islam are generally censored or banned as the depiction of prophets is considered \"haraam\" (not allowed) under Islam. One notable case was the banning of \"The Prince of Egypt\" when its producers would not accept censorship of the character Moses (Musa in Islam).\n\nHowever, in a more recent case, \"The Passion of the Christ\" was allowed, after the intervention of the Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, under strict conditions restricting its viewership to Christians with sales of tickets being carried out by various churches and para-church organisations.\n\nIn 2004, Yasmin Ahmad's (herself a Malaysian Muslim) film \"Sepet\" was rejected by censors who asked that scenes be removed. 10 scenes were objectionable. Among objectionable material queried in the movie was why the movie did not depict any attempt to convert Jason (the Chinese non-Muslim main character) to Islam after he had fallen in love with a Malay girl.\n\nIn 2014 the biblical film Noah was banned by the Malaysian authorities reasoning that the film was un-Islamic.\n\nOn 10 December 2007, Malaysian authorities banned the Malay-language section of a Catholic weekly newspaper, The Catholic Herald due to its use of the word Allah, the name for God which Christians had used for hundreds of years in the country. Their reasoning is that the word Allah by Christians would confuse Malay Muslims. The Herald meanwhile, filed suit at the beginning of December following warnings that its permit could be revoked if it did not cease use of the word \"Allah\" in the Malay language section of its newspaper. Countering the Herald's suit, the Malaysian security authorities on 30 December, warned its printing permit would not be renewed if it continued using the word \"Allah,\" which the government continued to say can only be used by Muslims.\n\nThe Catholic Church began its challenge of the government gag order prohibiting it from using the word \"Allah\" in its Herald-The Catholic Weekly- through a judicial review. The government had earlier argued that the church's application is frivolous and had urged the court to throw it out but Madam Justice Lau Bee Lan disagreed and allowed the application by the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Murphy Pakiam, for leave to sue the government regarding the use of the word \"Allah\" to proceed. Three points that were raised in the lawsuit. The first is for the court to declare that the government's action in prohibiting The Herald from using the word \"Allah\" is illegal and null and void. The second is for a court declaration that the Archbishop as publisher of The Herald is entitled to use the word \"Allah\" and lastly, that the court should declare that the word \"Allah\" is not exclusive to the religion of Islam.\n\n\nUnder subsection 48(3) and (4) of the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment 2004, the Mufti of Penang state is allowed to pass legally binding religious rulings, or \"fatwa\". In 2010, this power was used to pass a fatwa which would penalize non-Muslims for using the following words, or to write or publish them, in any form, version or translation in any language or for use in any publicity material in any medium:\n\"\"Allah\", \"Firman Allah\", \"Ulama\", \"Hadith\", \"Ibadah\", \"Kaabah\", \"Qadhi'\", \"Illahi\", \"Wahyu\", \"Mubaligh\", \"Syariah\", \"Qiblat\", \"Haji\", \"Mufti\", \"Rasul\", \"Iman\", \"Dakwah\", \"Wali\", \"Fatwa\", \"Imam\", \"Nabi\", \"Sheikh\", \"Khutbah\", \"Tabligh\", \"Akhirat\", \"Azan\", \"Al Quran\", \"As Sunnah\", \"Auliya'\", \"Karamah\", \"Syahadah\", \"Baitullah\", \"Musolla\", \"Zakat Fitrah\", \"Hajjah\", \"Taqwa\" and \"Soleh\".\" This ruling caused uproar, particularly in the Sikh community, as Sikh religious texts use the term \"Allah\", with members of the community calling the law unconstitutional. The ban was overturned in 2014, as Penang lawmakers decreed that the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment law only gave the Mufti permission to pass \"fatwas\" for the Muslim community, and that these bans were not enforceable on non-Muslim individuals.\n\nOn 5 November 2006, a group of Muslims gathered outside the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, in the town of Ipoh, Perak to protest an alleged conversion of Muslim Malays out of Islam. The allegation was spread via a text message that claimed the church would baptise a group of Muslim Malays. The message proved to be false as the church celebrated only a Holy Communion service for 110 Indian children. The message further alleged that a famous Malaysian sportsman Azhar Mansor was leaving Islam to embrace Christianity. The police had traced the message to a lady who had met Harussani Zakaria, mufti of the state of Perak in a meeting. He has stated that the message was to remain within the confines of the meeting but had made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the message nor report it to the police as converting Muslims is illegal under Malaysian law. On 17 November, Azhar Mansor declared that he had not renounced Islam, and Umno president Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that there should now be an end to the speculation.\n\nThe Metro Tabernacle, an Assemblies of God church in Desa Melawati, Kuala Lumpur was set on fire on 8 January 2010. While in Malacca, black paint was splashed on the outer wall of the Malacca Baptist Church in Durian Daun.\n\nThere were also incidences of attacks being made onto Muslim places of worship. In January 2010, two separate prayer halls (surau) in Muar became targets of arson attacks. And as recent as August 2010, another prayer hall in Seremban was subjected to vandalism. The prayer hall was defaced by red paint and littered with alcohol bottles.\n\n"}

Many Indians were recruited as indentured servants throughout the British Empire, settling mainly in the British colonies of Southern and Eastern Africa. The descendants of these settlers often chose to remain in Africa after the end of colonial rule, developing Indo-African communities that remain to this day.\n\nHinduism is non-proselytizing religion and was usually not propagated to the same lengths or through the same means as Christianity and Islam. As such, it has mostly been confined to practise by the Indo-African communities of these countries. However, in post-colonial Africa, a small-scale movement for Hinduism and its propagation \"outside\" the Indo-African community has occurred, spearheaded by such individuals as Swami Ghanananda, the first Hindu swami of Ghana. Today, Lagos, Nigeria, which did not receive an original influx of Indian migrants as did countries such as South Africa and Uganda, is home to over 25,000 Hindus, mostly local converts and more recent, post-independence Indian immigrants. This was primarily the work of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) missionaries.\n\nWhile Hinduism has been cited as possessing many parallels to traditional African religions, it has received opposition from the entrenched Christian elites and Muslim minorities of these countries. The Swaminarayan faith has a sizable following in Africa. Several temples belonging to the faith have been built in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nHinduism is a recent phenomenon in West Africa most notably Ghana where it is said to be the fastest growing religion. However the Hindu presence in other West African states is limited to South Asian people residing in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\nAccording to the PEW Research Centre, there are more than 100,000 Hindus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Eastern region of Africa is home to many migrant communities from India. This region is home to various Hindu temples mainly in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. The country of Mauritius, retaining a Hindu majority is found in Eastern Africa.\n\nThe largest concentration of Hindus in the continent can be found in the Southern region of Africa. South Africa is home to more than 500,000 Hindus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "365645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365645", "title": "La Llorona", "text": "La Llorona\n\nIn Mexican folklore, La Llorona (, \"The Weeping Woman\") is a ghost of a woman who lost her children and now cries while looking for them in the river, often causing misfortune to those who are near, or who hear her. There is no credible source or evidence to the events that inspired the tale/legend of La Llorona.\n\nThe legend is said that in a rural village there lived a young woman named Maria. Maria came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman traveled through her village. He stopped in his tracks when he saw Maria. Maria was charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Maria's family was thrilled that she was marrying into a wealthy family, but the nobleman's father was extremely disappointed that his son was marrying into poverty. Maria and her new husband built a house in the village to be away from his disapproving father. Eventually Maria gave birth to twins: a boy and a girl. Her husband was always traveling, and stopped spending time with his family. When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and Maria knew her husband was falling out of love with her. One day, he left and never returned. Years later, as Maria and her twins were walking by a river, she saw a familiar carriage with a younger, beautiful woman next to her husband. Maria was so angry and confused that, without thinking, she picked up her two children and threw them into the river, drowning them. Only after she saw their bodies floating in the river did she realize what she had done and she then jumped into the river, hoping to die with her children. Now she spends eternity looking for her children around that river. It is said that if you hear her crying, you are to run the opposite way. If you hear her cries, they could bring misfortune or even death. Many parents in Mexico and Guatemala use this story to scare their children from staying out too late.\n\nAt the gates of heaven, she was challenged over the whereabouts of her children, and not permitted to enter the afterlife until she found them. Llorona is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring. She constantly weeps, hence her name \"La Llorona.\" She is caught between the living world and the spirit world.\n\nIn some versions of the tale, La Llorona kidnaps wandering children who resemble her missing children, asks them for forgiveness, then kills them to take the place of her own. People who claim to have seen her say she appears at night or in the late evening by rivers or lakes. Some believe those who hear the wails of La Llorona are marked for death but those who escape in time are not, as in the Gaelic banshee legend. Amongst her wails she is noted as crying \"¡Ay mis hijos!\" which translates to \"Oh my children!\" In the Guatemalan version of the legend, it is said that when her wails sounds near she is actually far and when she sounds distant- she is actually very near. \n\nIt should be noted that the folklore will vary dependent on the location as it is not specific to any one region and is known throughout numerous Latin American countries.\n\nLa Llorona is also sometimes identified with La Malinche, the Nahua woman who served as Cortés' interpreter and mistress who bore his children and who some say was betrayed by the Spanish conquistadors. In one folk story of La Malinche, she became Hernán Cortés' mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that La Malinche killed her children). Aztec pride drove La Malinche to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the New World and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with La Llorona's loss.\n\nThe Chumash of Southern California have their own connection to La Llorona. Chumash mythology mentions La Llorona when explaining nunašɨš (creatures of the other world) called the \"maxulaw\" or \"mamismis.\" Mythology says the Chumash believe in both the nunašɨš and La Llorona and specifically hear the maxulaw cry up in the trees. The maxulaw cry is considered an omen of death. The Maxulaw is described as looking like a cat with skin of rawhide leather.\n\nOutside the Americas, La Llorona bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek tale of the demonic demigodess Lamia. Hera, Zeus' wife, learned of his affair with Lamia and, out of anger, killed all the children Lamia had with Zeus. Out of jealousy over the loss of her own children, Lamia steals other women's children. In Greek mythology, Medea killed the two children fathered by Jason (one of the Argonauts) after he left her for another woman.\n\nAuthor Ben Radford's investigation into the legend of La Llorona, published in \"Mysterious New Mexico\", traced elements of the story back to a German folktale dating from 1486..\n\nThe legend of La Llorona persists in areas where mountain lions are active. The \"Audubon Field Guide to North American Mammals\" notes that the mountain lion's \"blood curdling mating call has been likened to a woman's scream.\"\n\nThe plot of the 1961 Mexican film \"The Curse of the Crying Woman\" \"(La maldición de la llorona)\" involves the resurrection of the spirit of La Llorona.\n\nLa Llorona appeared as the \"monster of the week\" in the NBC TV series \"Grimm\", in the ninth episode of the second season which first aired on October 2012. In this storyline, she is a ghost-like creature (her exact origin and nature is undefined) who appears in different cities at yearly intervals around Halloween, always luring three children to a point where three rivers meet, attempting to 'sacrifice' these children to regain her own. In the episode, series protagonist Nick Burkhardt and his partner Hank Griffin work with \"wesen\" detective Valentina Espinosa, who lost her nephew to La Llorana some years ago, and manage to save her latest victims, although La Llorana simply vanishes into the water.\n\nLa Llorona appeared as the first antagonist in the 2005 pilot episode of the TV series \"Supernatural\". Sarah Shahi portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character Sam Winchester destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona briefly appears in the 1973 Mexican film \"Leyendas macabras de la colonia\". La Llorona is mentioned and appears in several episodes of \"El Chavo del Ocho\" and \"El Chapulín Colorado\", both comic series written by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, aka Chespirito.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film \"La Leyenda de la Llorona\". Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright Josefina Lopez wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn Nancy Farmer's 2002 science fiction novel, \"The House of the Scorpion\", and its 2013 sequel book, \"The Lord of Opium\", the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nLa Llorona is mentioned in the 2003 film \"Chasing Papi\" starring Sofía Vergara, Roselyn Sánchez, Jaci Velasquez, and Eduardo Verástegui. Her screams can be heard when Thomas (Eduardo) is under stress or confronted by the three women in his life. La Llorona's image is shown a few times in the film too.\n\nThe song \"She Turned Into Llorona\" appears on the 2003 Manic Hispanic album \"Mijo Goes to Jr. College\".\n\n2006 Mexican horror film \"Kilometer 31\" is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story,\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of Universal Studios's haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, Halloween Horror Nights (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).\n\nThe story of La Llorona has been turned into a short comic book story by \"Love and Rockets\" writer/artist Gilbert Hernandez. La Llorona is also one of the various names used by Hopey and Terry's punk band in Jaime Hernandez's \"Mechanics \"series.\n\nLa Llorana appeared as a ghost in \"Batwoman #1\" (Volume 2) in November 2011. \n\n\"La Llorona\" is the ninth episode of Season 2 of Grimm and the thirty-first episode overall. It first aired on October 26, 2012 on NBC. In the episode, La Llorona steals two boys and one girl once a year and drowns them in a river right at midnight on Halloween. While drowning them she asked her dead children to appear and asks them for forgiveness and drowns the other children to take their place. The legend told in the episode is that La Llorona drowned her children after her husband left her for a younger woman. She cries in a river and appears to be killing herself and when someone jumps in to save her, she steals their child. The episode ends with her vanishing in the river while Detective Nick Burnhardt tries to drown her. \n\nLa Llorona appears in Josh Walker's 2014 novel, Luke Coles and the Flower of Chiloe where the Llorona is the mark of one of Luke's hunts.\n\nLa Llorona also is a short film which was released in 2015.\n\nLa Llorona is the basis for the \"monster of the week\" in the fifth episode of the second season of \"Sleepy Hollow\" entitled \"The Weeping Lady\".\n\nMorgana, a playable character in \"League of Legends\", has a skin called \"Ghost Bride\" (named \"La Llorona\" in Spanish). She has different voiceover lines in the Latin American regions (North and South) and the skin was released as a way to celebrate the launch of Latin American servers.\n\nThe sixteenth track of the Frida Soundtrack is titled \"La Llorona\". It is sung by Chavela Vargas.\n\nThe twelfth track from the self-titled album by the Latina punk band FEA is \"La Llorona\", and is based on the legend, with the cry/lyrics in the chorus of \"mis hijos, mis hijos!\".\n\nThe song “La Llorona” is featured in the 2017 Disney-Pixar film \"Coco\", sung by Imelda Rivera (voiced by Alanna Ubach) during the sunrise concert as she attempts to evade Ernesto de la Cruz who sings the song in duet with her (voiced by Benjamin Bratt with his singing voice provided by Marco Antonio Solís).\n\nIn the 2000 Sci-Fi series, \"The Invisible Man\", La Llorona is the code-name for a Chrysalis' agent modified to be able to consume large amounts of water and spew them out forcibly and at-will.\n\nThe debut studio album of Lhasa de Sela is called \"La Llorona\".\n\nOn March 7, 2018 Primero Soy Mexicana by Angela Aguilar was released on which \"La Llorona\" is the 7th track. \n\nJames Wan and Gary Dauberman are producing a film about La Llorona, titled \"The Curse of La Llorona\". It is scheduled to be released on April 19, 2019 by New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures. The film will be directed by Michael Chaves and star Linda Cardellini, Raymond Cruz, and Patricia Velasquez.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is characterised by its lack of a clear majority ethnic group, and is the location of Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory. The eminence of manifold minority groups, to some degree, constitutes an ethno-linguistic barrier in the country and draws a separation between the principally Islamic North and the mainly Christian south.\n\nThe region is a convergence of these cultural domains and maintains a tremendous degree of ethno-linguistic diversity. Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, and Niger–Congo languages are all spoken, which are three of the primary African language families.\n\nMinorities in Nigeria tend to be dominated by the three largest ethnic groups, the Hausa of North, the Yoruba of the Southwest and Igbo of the Southeast. Surrounded by divergent religious, economic, and cultural histories, the middle belt has been the melting pot where small and large ethno-religious groups in Nigeria have long coexisted, but where they have also increasingly collided over land, resources, identity and political power.\n\nThe result is a mixture of recurring conflicts and occasional political unity and solidarity amongst these highly differentiated peoples. An example for the latter was the United Middle Belt Congress that emerged following Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960.\n\nIn particular, Jos city in Plateau State has been a centre for ethno-religious disputes and violence since the 1990s. The Jos Forum Inter-Communal Dialogue process spanned 16 months from August 2013 - December 2014, and refers to a peace process undertaken by communities living in Jos that concluded in a “Declaration of Commitment to Peace”.\n\nIn 2018 violence escalated, with battles for scarce resources leading to over 500 deaths and 50 towns being destroyed. The clashes were largely between Muslim Fulani pastoralists and Christian Berom farmers. Over 300,000 people have been displaced by the violence.\n\nAreas of Nigeria which are generally referred to as belonging to the Middle Belt are: Kwara State, Kogi State, Benue State, Taraba State, Plateau State, Nasarawa State, Niger State, Adamawa State, the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja), as well as the southern parts of Kaduna State, Kebbi State, Bauchi State, Gombe State, Yobe State and Borno State.\n\nThe definition of the Middle Belt areas are subject to great debate due to the presence of significant number of ethnic Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri groups. In addition, the Yoruba of Kwara and Kogi have a strong affinity with the larger Yoruba body and frequently prefer not to be associated with the Middle Belt identity.\nThe population of the middle belt is estimated to be over 35 million or more who are predominantly Christians and some few Muslim converts. The area also has a very large significant number of the Hausa-Fulanis who are roughly 20% percent of the population.\nThe Christians make about 70-75% of the population while the Muslims constitute 25-30% of the population.\n"}

Mt. Sembrano is situated about east by road from the capital city of Manila.\nMount Sembrano lies between the boundaries of the towns of Jalajala and Pililla in Rizal province and the town of Pakil in Laguna. The mountain sits at the helm of Jalajala peninsula along the shore of Laguna de Bay and is surrounded by the lake on three sides. Along with Talim Island, the mountain forms the southeastern rim of the Laguna Caldera.\n\nOnce a haven of New People's Army insurgents, the mountain is now a popular hiking destination offering a commanding view of Laguna de Bay, Talim Island, and the Tagalog provinces of Rizal and Laguna. \"Mount Susong Dalaga\" (Maiden's breast Mountain), a conical hill resembling the female breast which is the highest peak of neighboring Talim Island, is best observed from Mt. Sembrano. Other mountains visible from the summit are Mount Banahaw, Mount Makiling and the Sierra Madre Mountains.\n\nThe most common starting point for the climb up the mountain is from the Barangay Hall in Brgy. Malaya in Pililla, Rizal where climbers must register themselves. The hike to the grassy summit which is fully exposed to the sun, takes about three to four hours. Another trail starts from the Laguna side of the mountain in the town of Pakil, but is rarely used.\n\nMount Sembrano is considered sacred by some people and known for the legend of the miraculous discovery of the icon of Our Lady of Maulawin. In 1909, a group of loggers climbed Mt. Sembrano to cut logs. Felipe Reyno was the one who cut a \"maulawin\" tree. The 5 logs was sold in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. In 1910, when an intended shelter for cows was started, the posts was prepared first. A carpenter took the \"maulawin\" log (molave) but his saw broke because not only it was young, it was also very hard. He borrowed another saw to continue the cutting, he was completely amazed to see an image of the Virgin Mary imprinted in it. It was completely supernatural because resembling like lead in a pencil, any part of the log if cut it has the same image even to the trunks and branches. Two chops of wood is now enshrined at the Aglipayan church of Santa Cruz in Laguna, one in the side altar and another in an adjacent chapel dedicated for her. A small chapel is placed on the site where the image was discovered.\n\nAnother point along the trail is a big boulder referred to as the \"Simbahan\" (Church) where pilgrims leave candles on the huge rock where footprints imprinted on top are supposedly left by the Virgin Mary.\n\nFive minutes off the trail is the small Manggahan waterfall, located left of the campsite if you are on your way up.

Since the 15th century many boats out of Bilbao have carried the name, \"Virgin of Begoña\" or simply \"Begoña\". In 1779 Captain Jaun Bautista de Ajeo and two other Bilbao merchants owned a ship, with a capacity of fifty tons, known as \"Nuestra Senora de Begoña\". Votives left by sailors indicate that Our Lady of Begoña is believed to have helped seamen in distress, who then offered thanks for their safe deliverance.\n\nTradition tells of an apparition to the people of Bilbao at the site of the present Basilica. Work began on the basilica in 1511. Behind the high altar is what is referred to as \"the Virgin's chamber\". She is credited with helping to stem the cholera epidemic of 1855.\n\nThe image, made of linden wood, depicts the Blessed Mother seated in an armless chair wearing a crown, and holding the Child Jesus on her knees, with a red rose in her right hand. Christ is giving a blessing with his right hand and holds and open book in his left. The statue appears to be from the early 14th century, and may have been donated the church by Diego Lopez de Haro, Lord of Biscay, or one of his predecessors.\n\nIn 1900 Our Lady of Begoña received a gold crown during a Pontifical Mass attended by the Apostolic Delegate. In 1903 Pius X declared her the patron saint of Biscay. In 1908 Pius X raised the shrine of Our Lady of Begona to a minor Basilica.\n\nThe annual Feria de Nuestra Senora de Begoña has been an important August stop for \"toreros\" for a long time.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, when many of Spain's politicians attended religious services invoking Mary under various titles, for help with the country's deepening economic crisis, Mayor of Bilbao, Inaki Azkuna, prayed to Our Lady of Begona. \"“Those of us who are believers continue to believe that we could be given some help and that we need it. All of society, and not only politicians, is going to have to make a tremendous effort,” he added.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "23056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23056", "title": "Pope", "text": "Pope\n\nThe pope ( from \"pappas\", \"father\"), also known as the supreme pontiff (from Latin \"pontifex maximus\" \"greatest priest\"), is the Bishop of Rome and \"ex officio\" leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. Since 1929, the pope has also been head of state of Vatican City, a city-state entirely enclaved within Rome, Italy. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.\n\nWhile his office is called the papacy, the episcopal see and ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the Holy See. It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity of international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State, established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. The primacy of the Bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, giving him the Keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the church would be built. \n\nThe apostolic see of Rome was founded by Saint Peter and Saint Paul in 1st century, according to Catholic tradition. The papacy is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in world history. In ancient times the popes helped spread Christianity, and intervened to find resolutions in various doctrinal disputes. In the Middle Ages, they played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs. Currently, in addition to the expansion of the Christian faith and doctrine, the popes are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of human rights.\n\nIn some periods of history, popes, who originally had no temporal powers, accrued wide secular powers rivalling those of temporal rulers. However, in recent centuries the temporal authority of the papacy has declined and the office is now almost exclusively focused on religious matters. By contrast, papal claims of spiritual authority have been increasingly firmly expressed over time, culminating in 1870 with the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for rare occasions when the pope speaks \"ex cathedra\"—literally \"from the chair (of Saint Peter)\"—to issue a formal definition of faith or morals. Still, the Pope is considered one of the world's most powerful people because of his extensive diplomatic, cultural, and spiritual influence on 1.3 billion Catholics and beyond, as well as the official representative of the Catholic Church being the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world, with a vast international network of charities.\n\nThe word \"pope\" derives from Greek πάππας meaning \"father\". In the early centuries of Christianity, this title was applied, especially in the east, to all bishops and other senior clergy, and later became reserved in the west to the Bishop of Rome, a reservation made official only in the 11th century. The earliest record of the use of this title was in regard to the by then deceased Patriarch of Alexandria, Pope Heraclas of Alexandria (232–248). The earliest recorded use of the title \"pope\" in English dates to the mid-10th century, when it was used in reference to Pope Vitalian in an Old English translation of Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\".\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the pastoral office, the office of shepherding the Church, that was held by the apostles, as a group or \"college\" with Saint Peter as their head, is now held by their successors, the bishops, with the bishop of Rome (the pope) as their head. Thus, is derived another title by which the pope is known, that of \"Supreme Pontiff\".\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that Jesus personally appointed Peter as leader of the Church, and the Catholic Church's dogmatic constitution \"Lumen gentium\" makes a clear distinction between apostles and bishops, presenting the latter as the successors of the former, with the pope as successor of Peter, in that he is head of the bishops as Peter was head of the apostles. Some historians argue against the notion that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, noting that the episcopal see in Rome can be traced back no earlier than the 3rd century. The writings of the Church Father Irenaeus who wrote around AD 180 reflect a belief that Peter \"founded and organized\" the Church at Rome. Moreover, Irenaeus was not the first to write of Peter's presence in the early Roman Church. Clement of Rome wrote in a letter to the Corinthians, \"c.\" 96, about the persecution of Christians in Rome as the \"struggles in our time\" and presented to the Corinthians its heroes, \"first, the greatest and most just columns\", the \"good apostles\" Peter and Paul. St. Ignatius of Antioch wrote shortly after Clement and in his letter from the city of Smyrna to the Romans he said he would not command them as Peter and Paul did. Given this and other evidence, such as Emperor Constantine's erection of the \"Old St. Peter's Basilica\" on the location of St. Peter's tomb, as held and given to him by Rome's Christian community, many scholars agree that Peter was martyred in Rome under Nero, although some scholars argue that he may have been martyred in Palestine.\n\nThe New Testament offers no proof that Jesus established the papacy, nor even that he established Peter as the first bishop of Rome. Some theologians argue, using Peter's own words, that Christ intended himself—and not Peter—as the foundation of the church. Others have argued that the church is indeed built upon Jesus and faith, but also on the disciples as the roots and foundations of the church on the basis of Paul's teaching in Romans and Ephesians, though not primarily Peter.\n\nFirst-century Christian communities would have had a group of presbyter-bishops functioning as leaders of their local churches. Gradually, episcopacies were established in metropolitan areas. Antioch may have developed such a structure before Rome. In Rome, there were many who claimed to be the rightful bishop, though again Irenaeus stressed the validity of one line of bishops from the time of St. Peter up to his contemporary Pope Victor I and listed them. Some writers claim that the emergence of a single bishop in Rome probably did not occur until the middle of the 2nd century. In their view, Linus, Cletus and Clement were possibly prominent presbyter-bishops, but not necessarily monarchical bishops.\n\nDocuments of the 1st century and early 2nd century indicate that the bishop of Rome had some kind of pre-eminence and prominence in the Church as a whole, as even a letter from the bishop, or patriarch, of Antioch acknowledged the Bishop of Rome as \"a first among equals\", though the detail of what this meant is unclear.\n\nIt seems that at first the terms \"episcopos\" and \"presbyter\" were used interchangeably. The consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the 1st and 2nd centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable. Some say that there was probably \"no single 'monarchical' bishop in Rome before the middle of the 2nd century...and likely later.\" Other scholars and historians disagree, citing the historical records of St. Ignatius of Antioch (d 107) and St. Irenaeus who recorded the linear succession of Bishops of Rome (the popes) up until their own times. They also cite the importance accorded to the Bishops of Rome in the ecumenical councils, including the early ones.\n\nIn the early Christian era, Rome and a few other cities had claims on the leadership of worldwide Church. James the Just, known as \"the brother of the Lord\", served as head of the Jerusalem church, which is still honored as the \"Mother Church\" in Orthodox tradition. Alexandria had been a center of Jewish learning and became a center of Christian learning. Rome had a large congregation early in the apostolic period whom Paul the Apostle addressed in his Epistle to the Romans, and according to tradition Paul was martyred there. \n\nDuring the 1st century of the Church (c. 30–130), the Roman capital became recognized as a Christian center of exceptional importance. Clement I, at the end of the 1st century, wrote an epistle to the Church in Corinth intervening in a major dispute, and apologizing for not having taken action earlier. However, there are only a few other references of that time to recognition of the authoritative primacy of the Roman See outside of Rome. In the Ravenna Document of 13 October 2007, theologians chosen by the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches stated: \"41. Both sides agree ... that Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch, occupied the first place in the \"taxis\", and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the \"protos\" among the patriarchs. Translated into English, the statement means \"first among equals\". What form that should take is still a matter of disagreement, just as it was when the Catholic and Orthodox Churches split in the Great East-West Schism. They also disagree on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the Bishop of Rome as \"protos\", a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\" \n\nIn the late 2nd century AD, there were more manifestations of Roman authority over other churches. In 189, assertion of the primacy of the Church of Rome may be indicated in Irenaeus's \"Against Heresies\" (3:3:2): \"With [the Church of Rome], because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree ... and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition.\" In AD 195, Pope Victor I, in what is seen as an exercise of Roman authority over other churches, excommunicated the Quartodecimans for observing Easter on the 14th of Nisan, the date of the Jewish Passover, a tradition handed down by John the Evangelist (see Easter controversy). Celebration of Easter on a Sunday, as insisted on by the pope, is the system that has prevailed (see computus).\n\nThe Edict of Milan in 313 granted freedom to all religions in the Roman Empire, beginning the Peace of the Church. In 325, the First Council of Nicaea condemned Arianism, declaring trinitarianism dogmatic, and in its sixth canon recognized the special role of the Sees of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch. Great defenders of Trinitarian faith included the popes, especially Pope Liberius, who was exiled to Berea by Constantius II for his Trinitarian faith, Damasus I, and several other bishops.\n\nIn 380, the Edict of Thessalonica declared Nicene Christianity to be the state religion of the empire, with the name \"Catholic Christians\" reserved for those who accepted that faith. While the civil power in the Eastern Roman Empire controlled the church, and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, the capital, wielded much power, in the Western Roman Empire, the Bishops of Rome were able to consolidate the influence and power they already possessed. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, barbarian tribes were converted to Arian Christianity or Catholicism; Clovis I, king of the Franks, was the first important barbarian ruler to convert to Catholicism rather than Arianism, allying himself with the papacy. Other tribes, such as the Visigoths, later abandoned Arianism in favour of Catholicism.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the pope served as a source of authority and continuity. Pope Gregory I (\"c\" 540–604) administered the church with strict reform. From an ancient senatorial family, Gregory worked with the stern judgement and discipline typical of ancient Roman rule. Theologically, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook; his popular writings are full of dramatic miracles, potent relics, demons, angels, ghosts, and the approaching end of the world.\n\nGregory's successors were largely dominated by the Exarch of Ravenna, the Byzantine emperor's representative in the Italian Peninsula. These humiliations, the weakening of the Byzantine Empire in the face of the Muslim conquests, and the inability of the emperor to protect the papal estates against the Lombards, made Pope Stephen II turn from Emperor Constantine V. He appealed to the Franks to protect his lands. Pepin the Short subdued the Lombards and donated Italian land to the papacy. When Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne (800) as Roman Emperor, he established the precedent that, in Western Europe, no man would be emperor without being crowned by a Pope.\n\nThe low point of the papacy was 867–1049. This period includes the Saeculum obscurum, the Crescentii era, and the Tusculan Papacy. The papacy came under the control of vying political factions. Popes were variously imprisoned, starved, killed, and deposed by force. The family of a certain papal official made and unmade popes for fifty years. The official's great-grandson, Pope John XII, held orgies of debauchery in the Lateran Palace. Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor had John accused in an ecclesiastical court, which deposed him and elected a layman as Pope Leo VIII. John mutilated the Imperial representatives in Rome and had himself reinstated as pope. Conflict between the Emperor and the papacy continued, and eventually dukes in league with the emperor were buying bishops and popes almost openly.\n\nIn 1049, Leo IX became pope, at last a pope with the character to face the papacy's problems. He traveled to the major cities of Europe to deal with the church's moral problems firsthand, notably simony and clerical marriage and concubinage. With his long journey, he restored the prestige of the papacy in Northern Europe.\n\nFrom the 7th century it became common for European monarchies and nobility to found churches and perform investiture or deposition of clergy in their states and fiefdoms, their personal interests causing corruption among the clergy. This practice had become common because often the prelates and secular rulers were also participants in public life. To combat this and other practices that had corrupted the Church between the years 900 and 1050, centres emerged promoting ecclesiastical reform, the most important being the Abbey of Cluny, which spread its ideals throughout Europe. This reform movement gained strength with the election of Pope Gregory VII in 1073, who adopted a series of measures in the movement known as the Gregorian Reform, in order to fight strongly against simony and the abuse of civil power and try to restore ecclesiastical discipline, including clerical celibacy. The conflict between popes and secular autocratic rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Henry I of England, known as the Investiture Controversy, was only resolved in 1122, by the Concordat of Worms, in which Pope Callixtus II decreed that clerics were to be invested by clerical leaders, and temporal rulers by lay investiture. Soon after, Pope Alexander III began reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law.\n\nSince the beginning of the 7th century, the Caliphate had conquered much of the southern Mediterranean, and represented a threat to Christianity. In 1095, the Byzantine emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, asked for military aid from Pope Urban II in the ongoing Byzantine–Seljuq wars. Urban, at the council of Clermont, called the First Crusade to assist the Byzantine Empire to regain the old Christian territories, especially Jerusalem.\n\nWith the East–West Schism, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church split definitively in 1054. This fracture was caused more by political events than by slight divergences of creed. Popes had galled the Byzantine emperors by siding with the king of the Franks, crowning a rival Roman emperor, appropriating the Exarchate of Ravenna, and driving into Greek Italy.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, popes struggled with monarchs over power.\n\nFrom 1309 to 1377, the pope resided not in Rome but in Avignon. The Avignon Papacy was notorious for greed and corruption. During this period, the pope was effectively an ally of the Kingdom of France, alienating France's enemies, such as the Kingdom of England.\n\nThe pope was understood to have the power to draw on the Treasury of Merit built up by the saints and by Christ, so that he could grant indulgences, reducing one's time in purgatory. The concept that a monetary fine or donation accompanied contrition, confession, and prayer eventually gave way to the common assumption that indulgences depended on a simple monetary contribution. The popes condemned misunderstandings and abuses, but were too pressed for income to exercise effective control over indulgences.\n\nPopes also contended with the cardinals, who sometimes attempted to assert the authority of Catholic Ecumenical Councils over the pope's. Conciliarism holds that the supreme authority of the church lies with a General Council, not with the pope. Its foundations were laid early in the 13th century, and it culminated in the 15th century. The failure of Conciliarism to gain broad acceptance after the 15th century is taken as a factor in the Protestant Reformation.\n\nVarious Antipopes challenged papal authority, especially during the Western Schism (1378–1417). In this schism, the papacy had returned to Rome from Avignon, but an antipope was installed in Avignon, as if to extend the papacy there.\n\nThe Eastern Church continued to decline with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, undercutting Constantinople's claim to equality with Rome. Twice an Eastern Emperor tried to force the Eastern Church to reunify with the West. First in the Second Council of Lyon (1272–1274) and secondly in the Council of Florence (1431–1449). Papal claims of superiority were a sticking point in reunification, which failed in any event. In the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire captured Constantinople.\n\nProtestant Reformers criticized the papacy as corrupt and characterized the pope as the antichrist.\n\nPopes instituted a Catholic Reformation (1560–1648), which addressed the challenges of the Protestant Reformation and instituted internal reforms. Pope Paul III initiated the Council of Trent (1545–1563), whose definitions of doctrine and whose reforms sealed the triumph of the papacy over elements in the church that sought conciliation with Protestants and opposed papal claims.\n\nGradually forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.\n\nIn 1870, the First Vatican Council proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility for those rare occasions the pope speaks \"ex cathedra\" when issuing a solemn definition of faith or morals.\n\nLater the same year, Victor Emmanuel II of Italy seized Rome from the pope's control and substantially completed the Italian unification.\n\nIn 1929, the Lateran Treaty between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See established Vatican City as an independent city-state, guaranteeing papal independence from secular rule.\n\nIn 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as dogma, the only time that a pope has spoken \"ex cathedra\" since papal infallibility was explicitly declared.\n\nThe Petrine Doctrine is still controversial as an issue of doctrine that continues to divide the eastern and western churches and separate Protestants from Rome.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that, within the Christian community, the bishops as a body have succeeded to the body of the apostles (\"apostolic succession\") and the Bishop of Rome has succeeded to Saint Peter.\n\nScriptural texts proposed in support of Peter's special position in relation to the church include:\n\nThe symbolic keys in the Papal coats of arms are a reference to the phrase \"the keys of the kingdom of heaven\" in the first of these texts. Some Protestant writers have maintained that the \"rock\" that Jesus speaks of in this text is Jesus himself or the faith expressed by Peter. This idea is undermined by the Biblical usage of \"Cephas,\" which is the masculine form of \"rock\" in Aramaic, to describe Peter. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" comments that \"the consensus of the great majority of scholars today is that the most obvious and traditional understanding should be construed, namely, that rock refers to the person of Peter\".\n\nThe pope was originally chosen by those senior clergymen resident in and near Rome. In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. The electors are now limited to those who have not reached 80 on the day before the death or resignation of a pope. The pope does not need to be a Cardinal Elector or indeed a Cardinal; however, since the pope is the Bishop of Rome, only those who can be ordained a bishop can be elected, which means that any male baptized Catholic is eligible. The last to be elected when not yet a bishop was Pope Gregory XVI in 1831, and the last to be elected when not even a priest was Pope Leo X in 1513, and the last to be elected when not a cardinal was Pope Urban VI in 1378. If someone who is not a bishop is elected, he must be given episcopal ordination before the election is announced to the people.\n\nThe Second Council of Lyon was convened on 7 May 1274, to regulate the election of the pope. This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope's death, and that they must remain in seclusion until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year \"sede vacante\" following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors. \n\nTraditionally, the vote was conducted by Acclamation, by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote.\nThe election of the pope almost always takes place in the Sistine Chapel, in a sequestered meeting called a \"conclave\" (so called because the cardinal electors are theoretically locked in, \"cum clave\", i.e., with key, until they elect a new pope). Three cardinals are chosen by lot to collect the votes of absent cardinal electors (by reason of illness), three are chosen by lot to count the votes, and three are chosen by lot to review the count of the votes. The ballots are distributed and each cardinal elector writes the name of his choice on it and pledges aloud that he is voting for \"one whom under God I think ought to be elected\" before folding and depositing his vote on a plate atop a large chalice placed on the altar. For the Papal conclave, 2005, a special urn was used for this purpose instead of a chalice and plate. The plate is then used to drop the ballot into the chalice, making it difficult for electors to insert multiple ballots. Before being read, the ballots are counted while still folded; if the number of ballots does not match the number of electors, the ballots are burned unopened and a new vote is held. Otherwise, each ballot is read aloud by the presiding Cardinal, who pierces the ballot with a needle and thread, stringing all the ballots together and tying the ends of the thread to ensure accuracy and honesty. Balloting continues until someone is elected by a two-thirds majority. \nOne of the most prominent aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from Saint Peter's Square. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound to create black smoke, or \"fumata nera\". (Traditionally, wet straw was used to produce the black smoke, but this was not completely reliable. The chemical compound is more reliable than the straw.) When a vote is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (\"fumata bianca\") through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope. Starting with the Papal conclave, 2005, church bells are also rung as a signal that a new pope has been chosen. \n\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals then asks two solemn questions of the cardinal who has been elected. First he asks, \"Do you freely accept your election as Supreme Pontiff?\" If he replies with the word \"Accepto\", his reign begins at that instant. If he replies \"not\", his reign begins at the inauguration ceremony several days afterward. The Dean asks next, \"By what name shall you be called?\" The new pope announces the regnal name he has chosen. If the Dean himself is elected pope, the Vice Dean performs this task. \n\nThe new pope is led through the \"Door of Tears\" to a dressing room where three sets of white papal vestments (\"immantatio\") await: small, medium, and large. Donning the appropriate vestments and reemerging into the Sistine Chapel, the new pope is given the \"Fisherman's Ring\" by the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, whom he first either reconfirms or reappoints. The pope assumes a place of honor as the rest of the cardinals wait in turn to offer their first \"obedience\" (\"adoratio\") and to receive his blessing. \n\nThe Senior Cardinal Deacon announces from a balcony over St. Peter's Square the following proclamation: \"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum! Habemus Papam!\" (\"I announce to you a great joy! We have a pope!\"). He announces the new pope's Christian name along with his newly chosen regnal name. \n\nUntil 1978 the pope's election was followed in a few days by the Papal coronation, which started with a procession with great pomp and circumstance from the Sistine Chapel to St. Peter's Basilica, with the newly elected pope borne in the \"sedia gestatoria\". After a solemn Papal Mass, the new pope was crowned with the \"triregnum\" (papal tiara) and he gave for the first time as pope the famous blessing \"Urbi et Orbi\" (\"to the City [Rome] and to the World\"). Another renowned part of the coronation was the lighting of a bundle of flax at the top of a gilded pole, which would flare brightly for a moment and then promptly extinguish, as he said, \"Sic transit gloria mundi\" (\"Thus passes worldly glory\"). A similar warning against papal hubris made on this occasion was the traditional exclamation, \"Annos Petri non videbis\", reminding the newly crowned pope that he would not live to see his rule lasting as long as that of St. Peter. According to tradition, he headed the church for 35 years and has thus far been the longest-reigning pope in the history of the Catholic Church. \n\nA traditionalist Catholic belief that lacks reliable authority claims that a Papal Oath was sworn, at their coronation, by all popes from Pope Agatho to Pope Paul VI and that it was omitted with the abolition of the coronation ceremony.\n\nThe Latin term, \"sede vacante\" (\"while the see is vacant\"), refers to a papal interregnum, the period between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor. From this term is derived the term sedevacantism, which designates a category of dissident Catholics who maintain that there is no canonically and legitimately elected pope, and that there is therefore a \"sede vacante\". One of the most common reasons for holding this belief is the idea that the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, and especially the reform of the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Paul VI, are heretical and that those responsible for initiating and maintaining these changes are heretics and not true popes.\n\nFor centuries, from 1378 on, those elected to the papacy were predominantly Italians. Prior to the election of the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II in 1978, the last non-Italian was Pope Adrian VI of the Netherlands, elected in 1522. John Paul II was followed by election of the German-born Pope Benedict XVI, who was in turn followed by Argentine-born Pope Francis, who is the first non-European after 1272 years and the first Latin American, despite having an Italian ancestry. \n\nThe current regulations regarding a papal interregnum—that is, a \"sede vacante\" (\"vacant seat\")—were promulgated by Pope John Paul II in his 1996 document \"Universi Dominici Gregis\". During the \"sede vacante\" period, the College of Cardinals is collectively responsible for the government of the Church and of the Vatican itself, under the direction of the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church; however, canon law specifically forbids the cardinals from introducing any innovation in the government of the Church during the vacancy of the Holy See. Any decision that requires the assent of the pope has to wait until the new pope has been elected and accepts office. \n\nIn recent centuries, when a pope was judged to have died, it was reportedly traditional for the Cardinal Camerlengo to confirm the death ceremonially by gently tapping the pope's head thrice with a silver hammer, calling his birth name each time. This was not done on the deaths of popes John Paul I and John Paul II. The Cardinal Camerlengo retrieves the Ring of the Fisherman and cuts it in two in the presence of the Cardinals. The pope's seals are defaced, to keep them from ever being used again, and his personal apartment is sealed. \n\nThe body lies in state for several days before being interred in the crypt of a leading church or cathedral; all popes who have died in the 20th and 21st centuries have been interred in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-day period of mourning (\"novendialis\") follows the interment.\n\nIt is highly unusual for a pope to resign. The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, \"If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.\" Benedict XVI, who vacated the Holy See on 28 February 2013, was the most recent to do so since Gregory XII's resignation in 1415.\n\nPopes adopt a new name on their accession, known as papal or pontifical name. Officially, the Pope is given an Italian name by virtue of his Vatican citizenship and a Latin name by virtue of his status as Bishop of the Holy See of Rome. Currently, after a new pope is elected and accepts the election, he is asked \"By what name shall you be called?\". The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known from that point on. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or Cardinal Protodeacon, then appears on the balcony of Saint Peter's to proclaim the new pope by his birth name, and announce his papal name in Latin. It's costumary when referring to popes to translate the regnal name into all local languages. Thus, for example, Papa Franciscus is Papa Francesco in Italian, but he is also known as Papa Francisco in his native Spanish, Pope Francis in English, etc.\n\nThe official list of titles of the pope, in the order in which they are given in the \"Annuario Pontificio\", is:\n\nThe best-known title, that of \"Pope\", does not appear in the official list, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures. Thus Pope Paul VI signed as \"Paulus PP. VI\", the \"PP.\" standing for \"papa pontifex\" (\"pope and pontiff\").\n\nThe title \"Pope\" was from the early 3rd century an honorific designation used for \"any\" bishop in the West. In the East, it was used only for the Bishop of Alexandria. Pope Marcellinus (d. 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title \"Pope\" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome. From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome. \n\nIn Eastern Christianity, where the title \"Pope\" is used also of the Bishop of Alexandria, the Bishop of Rome is often referred to as the \"Pope of Rome\", regardless of whether the speaker or writer is in communion with Rome or not. \n\n\"Vicar of Jesus Christ\" (\"Vicarius Iesu Christi\") is one of the official titles of the Pope given in the \"Annuario Pontificio\". It is commonly used in the slightly abbreviated form \"Vicar of Christ\" (\"Vicarius Christi\"). While it is only one of the terms with which the pope is referred to as \"Vicar\", it is \"more expressive of his supreme headship of the Church on Earth, which he bears in virtue of the commission of Christ and with vicarial power derived from him\", a vicarial power believed to have been conferred on Saint Peter when Christ said to him: \"Feed my lambs...Feed my sheep\" ().\n\nThe first record of the application of this title to a Bishop of Rome appears in a synod of 495 with reference to Pope Gelasius I. But at that time, and down to the 9th century, other bishops too referred to themselves as vicars of Christ, and for another four centuries this description was sometimes used of kings and even judges, as it had been used in the 5th and 6th centuries to refer to the Byzantine emperor. Earlier still, in the 3rd century, Tertullian used \"vicar of Christ\" to refer to the Holy Spirit sent by Jesus. Its use specifically for the pope appears in the 13th century in connection with the reforms of Pope Innocent III, as can be observed already in his 1199 letter to Leo I, King of Armenia. Other historians suggest that this title was already used in this way in association with the pontificate of Pope Eugene III (1145–1153).\n\nThis title \"Vicar of Christ\" is thus not used of the pope alone and has been used of all bishops since the early centuries. The Second Vatican Council referred to all bishops as \"vicars and ambassadors of Christ\", and this description of the bishops was repeated by Pope John Paul II in his encyclical \"Ut unum sint,\" 95. The difference is that the other bishops are vicars of Christ for their own local churches, the pope is vicar of Christ for the whole Church.\n\nOn at least one occasion the title \"Vicar of God\" (a reference to Christ as God) was used of the pope.\n\nThe title \"Vicar of Peter\" (\"Vicarius Petri\") is used only of the pope, not of other bishops. Variations of it include: \"Vicar of the Prince of the Apostles\" (\"Vicarius Principis Apostolorum\") and \"Vicar of the Apostolic See\" (\"Vicarius Sedis Apostolicae\"). Saint Boniface described Pope Gregory II as vicar of Peter in the oath of fealty that he took in 722. In today's Roman Missal, the description \"vicar of Peter\" is found also in the collect of the Mass for a saint who was a pope.\n\nThe term \"pontiff\" is derived from the , which literally means \"bridge builder\" (\"pons\" + \"facere\") and which designated a member of the principal college of priests in ancient Rome. The Latin word was translated into ancient Greek variously: as , , , (hierophant), or (archiereus, high priest) The head of the college was known as the Pontifex Maximus (the greatest pontiff).\n\nIn Christian use, \"pontifex\" appears in the Vulgate translation of the New Testament to indicate the High Priest of Israel (in the original Koine Greek, ). The term came to be applied to any Christian bishop, but since the 11th century commonly refers specifically to the Bishop of Rome, who is more strictly called the \"Roman Pontiff\". The use of the term to refer to bishops in general is reflected in the terms \"Roman Pontifical\" (a book containing rites reserved for bishops, such as confirmation and ordination), and \"pontificals\" (the insignia of bishops).\n\nThe \"Annuario Pontificio\" lists as one of the official titles of the pope that of \"Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church\" (). He is also commonly called the Supreme Pontiff or the Sovereign Pontiff (). \n\n\"Pontifex Maximus\", similar in meaning to \"Summus Pontifex\", is a title commonly found in inscriptions on papal buildings, paintings, statues and coins, usually abbreviated as \"Pont. Max\" or \"P.M.\" The office of Pontifex Maximus, or head of the College of Pontiffs, was held by Julius Caesar and thereafter, by the Roman emperors, until Gratian (375–383) relinquished it. Tertullian, when he had become a Montanist, used the title derisively of either the pope or the Bishop of Carthage. The popes began to use this title regularly only in the 15th century.\n\nAlthough the description \"servant of the servants of God\" () was also used by other Church leaders, including Augustine of Hippo and Benedict of Nursia, it was first used extensively as a papal title by Pope Gregory I, reportedly as a lesson in humility for the Patriarch of Constantinople, John the Faster, who had assumed the title \"Ecumenical Patriarch\". It became reserved for the pope in the 12th century and is used in papal bulls and similar important papal documents.\n\nFrom 1863 until 2005, the \"Annuario Pontificio\" also included the title \"Patriarch of the West\". This title was first used by Pope Theodore I in 642, and was only used occasionally. Indeed, it did not begin to appear in the pontifical yearbook until 1863. On 22 March 2006, the Vatican released a statement explaining this omission on the grounds of expressing a \"historical and theological reality\" and of \"being useful to ecumenical dialogue\". The title Patriarch of the West symbolized the pope's special relationship with, and jurisdiction over, the Latin Church—and the omission of the title neither symbolizes in any way a change in this relationship, nor distorts the relationship between the Holy See and the Eastern Churches, as solemnly proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council.\n\nOther titles commonly used are \"His Holiness\" (either used alone or as an honorific prefix \"His Holiness Pope Francis\"; and as \"Your Holiness\" as a form of address), \"Holy Father\". In Spanish and Italian, \"\"Beatísimo/Beatissimo Padre\" (Most Blessed Father) is often used in preference to \"Santísimo/Santissimo Padre\" (Most Holy Father). In the medieval period, \"Dominus Apostolicus\"\" (\"the Apostolic Lord\") was also used.\n\nPope Francis signs some documents with his name alone, either in Latin (\"Franciscus\", as in an encyclical dated 29 June 2013) or in another language. Other documents he signs in accordance with the tradition of using Latin only and including, in the abbreviated form \"PP.\", for the Latin \"Papa Pontifex\" (\"Pope and Pontiff\"). Popes who have an ordinal numeral in their name traditionally place the abbreviation \"PP.\" before the ordinal numeral, as in \"Benedictus PP. XVI\" (Pope Benedict XVI), except in bulls of canonization and decrees of ecumenical councils, which a pope signs with the formula, \"Ego N. Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae\", without the numeral, as in \"Ego Benedictus Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae\" (I, Benedict, Bishop of the Catholic Church). The pope's signature is followed, in bulls of canonization, by those of all the cardinals resident in Rome, and in decrees of ecumenical councils, by the signatures of the other bishops participating in the council, each signing as Bishop of a particular see.\n\nPapal bulls are headed \"N. Episcopus Servus Servorum Dei\" (\"Name, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God\"). In general, they are not signed by the pope, but Pope John Paul II introduced in the mid-1980s the custom by which the pope signs not only bulls of canonization but also, using his normal signature, such as \"Benedictus PP. XVI\", bulls of nomination of bishops. \n\nIn heraldry, each pope has his own personal coat of arms. Though unique for each pope, the arms have for several centuries been traditionally accompanied by two keys in saltire (i.e., crossed over one another so as to form an \"X\") behind the escutcheon (shield) (one silver key and one gold key, tied with a red cord), and above them a silver \"triregnum\" with three gold crowns and red \"infulae\" (lappets—two strips of fabric hanging from the back of the triregnum which fall over the neck and shoulders when worn). This is blazoned: \"two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or\". The 21st century has seen departures from this tradition. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, while maintaining the crossed keys behind the shield, omitted the papal tiara from his personal coat of arms, replacing it with a mitre with three horizontal lines. Beneath the shield he added the pallium, a papal symbol of authority more ancient than the tiara, the use of which is also granted to metropolitan archbishops as a sign of communion with the See of Rome. Although the tiara was omitted in the pope's personal coat of arms, the coat of arms of the Holy See, which includes the tiara, remained unaltered. In 2013, Pope Francis maintained the mitre that replaced the tiara, but omitted the pallium. He also departed from papal tradition by adding beneath the shield his personal pastoral motto: \"Miserando atque eligendo\". \n\nThe flag most frequently associated with the pope is the yellow and white flag of Vatican City, with the arms of the Holy See (blazoned: \"Gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or\") on the right-hand side (the \"fly\") in the white half of the flag (the left-hand side—the \"hoist\"—is yellow). The pope's escucheon does not appear on the flag. This flag was first adopted in 1808, whereas the previous flag had been red and gold. Although Pope Benedict XVI replaced the triregnum with a mitre on his personal coat of arms, it has been retained on the flag. \n\nPope Pius V (reigned 1566–1572), is often credited with having originated the custom whereby the pope wears white, by continuing after his election to wear the white habit of the Dominican order. In reality, the basic papal attire was white long before. The earliest document that describes it as such is the \"Ordo XIII\", a book of ceremonies compiled in about 1274. Later books of ceremonies describe the pope as wearing a red mantle, mozzetta, camauro and shoes, and a white cassock and stockings. Many contemporary portraits of 15th and 16th-century predecessors of Pius V show them wearing a white cassock similar to his.\n\nThe status and authority of the Pope in the Catholic Church was dogmatically defined by the First Vatican Council on 18 July 1870. In its Dogmatic Constitution of the Church of Christ, the Council established the following canons:\n\nIf anyone says that the blessed Apostle Peter was not established by the Lord Christ as the chief of all the apostles, and the visible head of the whole militant Church, or, that the same received great honour but did not receive from the same our Lord Jesus Christ directly and immediately the primacy in true and proper jurisdiction: let him be anathema.\n\nIf anyone says that it is not from the institution of Christ the Lord Himself, or by divine right that the blessed Peter has perpetual successors in the primacy over the universal Church, or that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in the same primacy, let him be anathema.\n\nIf anyone thus speaks, that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate, or over the churches altogether and individually, and over the pastors and the faithful altogether and individually: let him be anathema.\n\nWe, adhering faithfully to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith, to the glory of God, our Saviour, the elevation of the Catholic religion and the salvation of Christian peoples, with the approbation of the sacred Council, teach and explain that the dogma has been divinely revealed: that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and teacher of all Christians by his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, through the divine assistance promised him in blessed Peter, operates with that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer wished that His church be instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals; and so such definitions of the Roman Pontiff from himself, but not from the consensus of the Church, are unalterable. But if anyone presumes to contradict this definition of Ours, which may God forbid: let him be anathema.\n\nIn its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (1964), the Second Vatican Council declared:\n\nOn 11 October 2012, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council 60 prominent theologians, (including Hans Küng), put out a Declaration, stating that the intention of Vatican II to balance authority in the Church has not been realised. \"Many of the key insights of Vatican II have not at all, or only partially, been implemented . . . A principal source of present-day stagnation lies in misunderstanding and abuse affecting the exercise of authority in our Church.\"\n\nThe pope's official seat or cathedral is the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, and his official residence is the Apostolic Palace. He also possesses a summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, situated on the site of the ancient city of Alba Longa. Until the time of the Avignon Papacy, the residence of the pope was the Lateran Palace, donated by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. \n\nThe pope's ecclesiastical jurisdiction (the Holy See) is distinct from his secular jurisdiction (Vatican City). It is the Holy See that conducts international relations; for hundreds of years, the papal court (the Roman Curia) has functioned as the government of the Catholic Church. \n\nThe names \"Holy See\" and \"Apostolic see\" are ecclesiastical terminology for the ordinary jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (including the Roman Curia); the pope's various honors, powers, and privileges within the Catholic Church and the international community derive from his Episcopate of Rome in lineal succession from the Apostle Saint Peter (see Apostolic succession). Consequently, Rome has traditionally occupied a central position in the Catholic Church, although this is not necessarily so. The pope derives his pontificate from being Bishop of Rome but is not required to live there; according to the Latin formula \"ubi Papa, ibi Curia\", wherever the pope resides is the central government of the Church, provided that the pope is Bishop of Rome. As such, between 1309 and 1378, the popes lived in Avignon, France (see Avignon Papacy), a period often called the Babylonian captivity in allusion to the Biblical narrative of Jews of the ancient Kingdom of Judah living as captives in Babylonia.\n\nThough the pope is the diocesan Bishop of the Diocese of Rome, he delegates most of the day-to-day work of leading the diocese to the Cardinal Vicar, who assures direct episcopal oversight of the diocese's pastoral needs, not in his own name but in that of the pope. The current Cardinal Vicar is Agostino Vallini, who was appointed to the office in June 2008. \n\nThough the progressive Christianisation of the Roman Empire in the 4th century did not confer upon bishops civil authority within the state, the gradual withdrawal of imperial authority during the 5th century left the pope the senior imperial civilian official in Rome, as bishops were increasingly directing civil affairs in other cities of the Western Empire. This status as a secular and civil ruler was vividly displayed by Pope Leo I's confrontation with Attila in 452. The first expansion of papal rule outside of Rome came in 728 with the Donation of Sutri, which in turn was substantially increased in 754, when the Frankish ruler Pippin the Younger gave to the pope the land from his conquest of the Lombards. The pope may have utilized the forged Donation of Constantine to gain this land, which formed the core of the Papal States. This document, accepted as genuine until the 15th century, states that Constantine the Great placed the entire Western Empire of Rome under papal rule. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish ruler Charlemagne as Roman Emperor, a major step toward establishing what later became known as the Holy Roman Empire; from that date onward the popes claimed the prerogative to crown the Emperor, though the right fell into disuse after the coronation of Charles V in 1530. Pope Pius VII was present at the coronation of Napoleon I in 1804 but did not actually perform the crowning. As mentioned above, the pope's sovereignty over the Papal States ended in 1870 with their annexation by Italy.\n\nPopes like Alexander VI, an ambitious if spectacularly corrupt politician, and Pope Julius II, a formidable general and statesman, were not afraid to use power to achieve their own ends, which included increasing the power of the papacy. This political and temporal authority was demonstrated through the papal role in the Holy Roman Empire (especially prominent during periods of contention with the Emperors, such as during the Pontificates of Pope Gregory VII and Pope Alexander III). Papal bulls, interdict, and excommunication (or the threat thereof) have been used many times to increase papal power. The Bull \"Laudabiliter\" in 1155 authorized Henry II of England to invade Ireland. In 1207, Innocent III placed England under interdict until King John made his kingdom a fiefdom to the Pope, complete with yearly tribute, saying, \"we offer and freely yield...to our lord Pope Innocent III and his catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom of Ireland with all their rights and appurtenences for the remission of our sins\". The Bull \"Inter caetera\" in 1493 led to the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which divided the world into areas of Spanish and Portuguese rule. The Bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\" in 1570 excommunicated Elizabeth I of England and declared that all her subjects were released from all allegiance to her. The Bull, \"Inter gravissimas\", in 1582 established the Gregorian calendar.\n\nUnder international law, a serving head of state has sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries, though not from that of international tribunals. This immunity is sometimes loosely referred to as \"diplomatic immunity\", which is, strictly speaking, the immunity enjoyed by the \"diplomatic representatives\" of a head of state.\n\nInternational law treats the Holy See, essentially the central government of the Catholic Church, as the juridical equal of a state. It is distinct from the state of Vatican City, existing for many centuries before the foundation of the latter. (It is common for publications and news media to use \"the Vatican\", \"Vatican City\", and even \"Rome\" as metonyms for the Holy See.) Most countries of the world maintain the same form of diplomatic relations with the Holy See that they entertain with other states. Even countries without those diplomatic relations participate in international organizations of which the Holy See is a full member.\n\nIt is as head of the state-equivalent worldwide religious jurisdiction of the Holy See (not of the territory of Vatican City) that the U.S. Justice Department ruled that the pope enjoys head-of-state immunity. This head-of-state immunity, recognized by the United States, must be distinguished from that envisaged under the United States' Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which, while recognizing the basic immunity of foreign governments from being sued in American courts, lays down nine exceptions, including commercial activity and actions in the United States by agents or employees of the foreign governments. It was in relation to the latter that, in November 2008, the United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati decided that a case over sexual abuse by Catholic priests could proceed, provided the plaintiffs could prove that the bishops accused of negligent supervision were acting as employees or agents of the Holy See and were following official Holy See policy.\n\nIn April 2010, there was press coverage in Britain concerning a proposed plan by atheist campaigners and a prominent barrister to have Pope Benedict XVI arrested and prosecuted in the UK for alleged offences, dating from several decades before, in failing to take appropriate action regarding Catholic sex abuse cases and concerning their disputing his immunity from prosecution in that country. This was generally dismissed as \"unrealistic and spurious\". Another barrister said that it was a \"matter of embarrassment that a senior British lawyer would want to allow himself to be associated with such a silly idea\".\n\nThe pope's claim to authority is either disputed or not recognised at all by other churches. The reasons for these objections differ from denomination to denomination.\n\nOther traditional Christian churches (Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Independent Catholic churches, etc.) accept the doctrine of Apostolic succession and, to varying extents, papal claims to a primacy of honour, while generally rejecting the pope as the successor to Peter in any other sense than that of other bishops. Primacy is regarded as a consequence of the pope's position as bishop of the original capital city of the Roman Empire, a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of \"universal immediate jurisdiction\", or to claims of papal infallibility. Several of these churches refer to such claims as \"ultramontanism\".\n\nProtestant denominations of Christianity reject the claims of Petrine primacy of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. These denominations vary from simply not accepting the pope's claim to authority as legitimate and valid, to believing that the pope is the Antichrist from 1 John 2:18, the Man of Sin from 2 Thessalonians 2:3–12, and the Beast out of the Earth from Revelation 13:11–18.\n\nThis sweeping rejection is held by, among others, some denominations of Lutherans: Confessional Lutherans hold that the pope is the Antichrist, stating that this article of faith is part of a \"quia\" (\"because\") rather than \"quatenus\" (\"insofar as\") subscription to the Book of Concord. In 1932, one of these Confessional churches, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), adopted \"A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod\", which a small number of Lutheran church bodies now hold. The Lutheran Churches of the Reformation, the Concordia Lutheran Conference, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Illinois Lutheran Conference all hold to the \"Brief Statement\", which the LCMS places on its website. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), another Confessional Lutheran church that declares the Papacy to be the Antichrist, released its own statement, the \"Statement on the Antichrist\", in 1959. The WELS still holds to this statement.\n\nHistorically, Protestants objected to the papacy's claim of temporal power over all secular governments, including territorial claims in Italy, the papacy's complex relationship with secular states such as the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and the autocratic character of the papal office. In Western Christianity these objections both contributed to and are products of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nGroups sometimes form around antipopes, who claim the Pontificate without being canonically and properly elected to it.\n\nTraditionally, this term was reserved for claimants with a significant following of cardinals or other clergy. The existence of an antipope is usually due either to doctrinal controversy within the Church (heresy) or to confusion as to who is the legitimate pope at the time (schism). Briefly in the 15th century, three separate lines of popes claimed authenticity (see Papal Schism). Even Catholics do not all agree whether certain historical figures were popes or antipopes. Though antipope movements were significant at one time, they are now overwhelmingly minor fringe causes.\n\nIn the earlier centuries of Christianity, the title \"Pope\", meaning \"father\", had been used by all bishops. Some popes used the term and others did not. Eventually, the title became associated especially with the Bishop of Rome. In a few cases, the term is used for other Christian clerical authorities.\n\nIn English, Catholic priests are still addressed as \"father\", but the term \"pope\" is reserved for the head of the church hierarchy.\n\n\"Black Pope\" is a name that was popularly, but unofficially, given to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus due to the Jesuits' importance within the Church. This name, based on the black colour of his cassock, was used to suggest a parallel between him and the \"White Pope\" (since the time of Pope Pius V the popes dress in white) and the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (formerly called the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), whose red cardinal's cassock gave him the name of the \"Red Pope\" in view of the authority over all territories that were not considered in some way Catholic. In the present time this cardinal has power over mission territories for Catholicism, essentially the Churches of Africa and Asia, but in the past his competence extended also to all lands where Protestants or Eastern Christianity was dominant. Some remnants of this situation remain, with the result that, for instance, New Zealand is still in the care of this Congregation.\n\nSince the papacy of Heraclas in the 3rd century, the Bishop of Alexandria in both the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria continues to be called \"Pope\", the former being called \"Coptic Pope\" or, more properly, \"Pope and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle\" and the latter called \"Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa\".\n\nIn the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church and Serbian Orthodox Church, it is not unusual for a village priest to be called a \"pope\" (\"поп\" \"pop\"). However, this should be differentiated from the words used for the head of the Catholic Church (Bulgarian \"папа\" \"papa\", Russian \"папа римский\" \"papa rimskiy\").\n\nSome new religious movements within Christianity, especially those that have disassociated themselves from the Catholic Church yet retain a Catholic hierarchical framework, have used the designation \"pope\" for a founder or current leader. Examples include the African Legio Maria Church and the European Palmarian Catholic Church in Spain. The Cao Dai, a Vietnamese faith that duplicates the Roman Catholic hierarchy, is similarly headed by a pope.\n\nAlthough the average reign of the pope from the Middle Ages was a decade, a number of those whose reign lengths can be determined from contemporary historical data are the following:\n\n\nDuring the Western Schism, Avignon Pope Benedict XIII (1394–1423) ruled for 28 years, seven months and 12 days, which would place him third in the above list. However, since he is regarded as an anti-pope, he is not mentioned in the list above.\n\nThere have been a number of popes whose reign lasted about a month or less. In the following list the number of calendar days includes partial days. Thus, for example, if a pope's reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.\n\nStephen (23–26 March 752) died of stroke three days after his election, and before his consecration as a bishop. He is not recognized as a valid pope, but was added to the lists of popes in the 15th century as \"Stephen II\", causing difficulties in enumerating later popes named Stephen. The Holy See's \"Annuario Pontificio\", in its list of popes and antipopes, attaches a footnote to its mention of Stephen II (III):\n\nPublished every year by the Roman Curia, the \"Annuario Pontificio\" attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding Pope Leo VIII, Pope Benedict V and some mid-11th-century popes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211235", "title": "Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria", "text": "Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria\n\nThe Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, a faith with ancient Christian roots in Egypt. The current holder of this position is Pope Tawadros II, who was selected as the 118th pope on November 18, 2012.\n\nFollowing the traditions of the church, the pope is chairman and head of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria as a first among equals. The Holy Synod is the highest authority in the Church of Alexandria, which has between 12 and 18 million members worldwide, 10 to 14 million of whom are in Egypt. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organization, faith, and order. The pope is also the chairman of the church's General Congregation Council.\n\nAlthough historically associated with the city of Alexandria, the residence and Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria has been located in Cairo since 1047. The pope is currently established in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, inside a compound which includes the Patriarchal Palace, with an additional residence at the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.\n\nAfter the death of Shenouda III on March 17, 2012 the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church voted. The names of the three candidates who received most votes were put in a glass chalice. The name then picked became the new Patriarch of Alexandria. It is believed the name is picked by 'Divine Choice', by a blindfolded boy. He is believed to be guided by the hand of God.\n\nThe liturgy of the Altar Ballot took place on November 4, 2012. The 60-year-old Bishop Tawadoros, Auxiliary Bishop of Beheira, assistant to Metropolitan Pachomios of Beheira, was chosen as the 118th Pope of Alexandria. He then chose the name of Theodoros II. He was formally enthroned on November 18, 2012.\n\nThe early Christian Church recognized the special significance of several cities as leaders of the worldwide \"catholic\" (universal) Church. The Church of Alexandria is one of these original patriarchates, but the succession to the role of patriarch in Alexandria is still disputed after the separation which followed the Council of Chalcedon.\n\nThe later development of the \"Pentarchy\" also granted secular recognition to these religious leaders. Because of this split, the leadership of this church is not part of this system.\n\nMembers of the church recognize its head as a successor of Mark the Evangelist, considered the first Bishop of Alexandria, who founded the Church in the 1st century, and therefore marked the beginning of Christianity in Africa.\n\nThe leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is known as \"Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle\". The Successor of St. Mark the Evangelist, Holy Apostle and Martyr, on the Holy Apostolic Throne of the Great City of Alexandria.\n\nHis full title is:\n\nThat is:\n\nIn being so, he is considered to be:\n\nHonorary titles attributed to the Hierarch of the Alexandrine Throne are:\n\n“Pope and Lord Archbishop of the Great City of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Holy See of St. Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle”.\n\nThe appellation of \"pope\" has been attributed to the Bishop of Alexandria since the episcopate of Heraclas, the thirteenth Bishop of Alexandria. All the clergy of Alexandria and Lower Egypt honored him with the appellation \"papas\", which means \"father\", as the senior and elder bishop among all bishops, within the Egyptian province, who are under his jurisdiction, three centuries before it was assumed by Pope John I Bishop of Rome (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this ecclesiastical fact.\n\nSince Alexandria was the capital of the province, the preaching center and the place of martyrdom of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, the title “Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle\". also known as “Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa” in short, was that of the Bishop of Alexandria.\n\nThe appellation of \"pope\" became recognized as a title, but this did not mean that it represented a title different or higher than the title of \"patriarch\". Only the Patriarch of Alexandria, however, has the double title of Pope and Patriarch among the Oriental Orthodox and the Eastern Orthodox thrones.\n\nPope (, \"papa\") has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of Egypt, and the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclessiastic title is, Papa Abba, the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the West to Constantinople in the East, to his guidance.\n\nHistorically, this office has held the title of Papa, Father in Coptic, since Papa Heracleus, 13th Alexandrine Patriarch (232–249 AD) was first to associate with the title three centuries before it was assumed by John I, the Bishop of Rome (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's Pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this. In the Roman Catholic viewpoint, this title does not have the same meaning as that of the Bishop of Rome, who was the only Primate in the West to be given the title of \"Pope\" in the beginning of the 5th century. The Pope of Rome is considered by the Roman Catholic Church as the \"Supreme Pontiff\", holding the office of the Roman See (being one of the successors of Saint Peter). On the other hand, both the Oriental Orthodox and Byzantine Orthodox Churches respond by saying that their respective heads are equal with Rome and also note that Rome has deviated too much already from their original understanding.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church considers that the Pope of Rome ranks higher than the four other popes and patriarchs of the Major Apostolic Thrones (Alexandria, Constantinople, Antioch and Jerusalem). This viewpoint is not accepted by the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nThe title \"patriarch\" means the head or the leader of a tribe or a community. Ecclesiastically it means the head of the fathers (bishops) and their congregation of faithful. This title is historically known as “Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist,” that is “of Alexandria and of all Africa.” The title of “patriarch” was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus, convened in 431 AD, and ratified at Chalcedon in 451 AD.\n\nThe Bishop of Alexandria also has the title of \"archbishop.\" This is a natural jurisdictional title for the ecclesiastical dignity of the Bishop of Alexandria. Ruling as a \"metropolitan\", the bishop of the metropolis (i.e. Alexandria), had jurisdiction over the Roman Provinces of Egypt (Lower Egypt I and II, Arcadia Ægypti, Upper Egypt I and II (aka Thebais Prima and Thebais Secunda), Pentapolis, Libya and Nubia, which were at that time, the extent of the “Egyptian Provinces” within the Roman Empire. As set by the Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea 325 AD, the jurisdiction of the Archiepiscopate of Alexandria covered the above-mentioned provinces.\n\nBut since the demise of the Latin (Roman) North African Archiepiscopate of Carthage (which covered all of North and West Africa, apart from Egypt, Pentapolis and Libya) in the 8th century, Alexandria became the sole apostolic throne in the entire continent of Africa. It is to be noted that actually, the historical evangelization of the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria in Africa, apart from Egypt, Pentapolis, Libya, Nubia and the Sudan, does extend to:\n\nEthiopia:\n\nIt constituted a major archdiocese of the Church of Alexandria, which was always governed by an Egyptian patriarchal vicar in the rank of archbishop, and named Aboune Salama by the Ethiopian Church. By 1929, the Alexandrine Throne allowed the Ethiopian Clergy to participate in the governing of their own Church, and the first native Ethiopian archbishop was enthroned in 1930 (thus becoming an autonomous church).\n\nIn 1959, an agreement was reached between the Ethiopian Holy Synod and the Alexandrine throne to have their own patriarch-catholicos in a transitional period. The Ethiopian archbishop ordained as primate of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church back in 1950, was elevated by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria Joseph II in Cairo and enthroned in Addis Ababa by the members of the Ethiopian Holy Synod and an Alexandrine delegation. The first prelate, Aboune Basilius I (1959–1971), patriarch-catholicos of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia, was ordained and enthroned in 1959, by Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria.\n\nAboune Paulos I became the 5th patriarch of the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and of all Ethiopia in 1992. This is after the patriarchates of Aboune Theophilus I (1971–1979) (deposed in a non-canonical way in 1976, sent to prison and murdered in prison in 1979), Aboune Thecla Hemanote I (1976–1988) (who was elected in a non-canonical manner by pressure of the then Communist government to replace his predecessor) and Abouna Mercurios I (1988–1991), (who resigned under pressure, due to the accusation of collaborating with the (Dereg) Menghistu Communist Regime, and who is now living in self-exile in Kenya).\n\nAboune Paulos I has requested from the Alexandrine throne complete independence to his patriarchate. The Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia was granted its independence in 1994, by Shenouda III Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria, thus making the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “autocephalous patriarchate.”\n\nEritrea:\n\nWhose own prelate, Aboune Philipos I (1998–2002), Patriarch of Asmara and of all Eritrea, was ordained and enthroned in May 1998, by Pope Shenouda III Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria. This made the new Patriarchate of Asmara and of all Eritrea a hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “autocephalous patriarchate.” The current prelate, Aboune Antonius I (2004– ), is the third Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea, who succeeded Yacob I (2003–2004), the second Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea. However, he was deposed non-canonically in January 2006, and replaced by Aboune Discoros I. This action is, however, not approved by the Alexandrine throne and is still under debate.\nThe Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia and the Patriarchate of Asmara and all Eritrea are daughter Churches of the Holy Apostolic Patriarchate of Alexandria.\nIn addition to the above, the countries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Botswana, Malawi, Angola, Namibia and South Africa are under the jurisdiction and the evangelization of the Throne of Alexandria.\n\nThe Dean of the Great Catechetical School of Theology of Alexandria:\nThis is a customary title, which many patriarchs of Alexandria have held since the episcopacy of St. Justus (the 6th Bishop of Alexandria), and which was recently revived by Pope Shenouda III.\nThe Ecumenical Judge of the Holy Apostolic and Orthodox Church of God:\nThis was a title given to St. Alexander I (the 19th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of the canonical responsibilities bestowed upon the Primates of Alexandria thereafter, to determine the date of the Pascha, and to convey ecclesiastical letters of notification to all Hierarchies of the Universal Church, along with the Paschal encyclical. This was officially agreed upon and ratified at the Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea (325 AD).\nThe Thirteenth among the Holy Apostles:\nThis title was given to Athanasius I (the 20th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of his apostolic defiance against heresies, especially the Arian heresy. He was exiled five times before his final victory over them. He is known as \"The Apostolic,\" meaning that he reached the level of the Holy Apostles.\nThe Pillar and Defender of the Holy Catholic Church and of the Orthodox Doctrine:\nThis title was given to St. Cyril I, the Great (the 24th Archbishop of Alexandria) in memory of his defense against the Nestorian heresy and his defense of the Title of “Theotokos,\" attributed to the Virgin Mary.\nAll these hierarchical and honorary titles were bestowed upon the bishop who occupies the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria.\n\nThe head of the church of Alexandria was known just as \"Bishop of Alexandria\" since the time of St. Ananius, the first Bishop of Alexandria, who was ordained by St. Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, where the latter preached and evangelized in the City of Alexandria. The title remained simply \"bishop\" until the Church grew within and all over the Egyptian Province, and many bishops were consecrated for the newly founded parishes all over the towns and cities.\n\nThe Bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first bishop, the one who was first consecrated by St. Mark, was honored by the other bishops as first among equals \"(Primus inter Pares)\" as a means of church hierarchical recognition and organization. This was in addition to the appropriate honorary dignity, which was due by virtue of being the senior bishop of the main metropolis of the Province of Alexandria, being also the capital and the main port of the province.\n\nThis honor was bestowed by making the senior bishop an archbishop, thus presiding in dignity of honor over all the Alexandrine and Egyptian bishops. So was the case among other provinces in the Roman Empire East and West (Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, Ephesus, Caesarea, Edessa, Seleucia and many others major metropolitanates), as the bishops of these major cities, and those who were presiding over the churches, which were first established within the region, became to be known as archbishops.\n\nThe word \"pope\" derives from Greek πάππας meaning \"father\". This title was first assumed by the Patriarchs of Alexandria, long before it was assumed by the Bishops of Rome. In fact, the first person known to carry the title of pope was the Archbishop of Alexandria, Pope Heracleus (232–249 AD), the 13th Alexandrine Archbishop.\n\nThe first record in history of the term \"pope\" is assigned to Pope Heraclas of Alexandria in a letter written by the bishop of Rome, Dionysius, to Philemon:\n\nwhich translates into:\n\"Papa\" has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of all Africa on the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclesiastic title is \"Papa Abba\", the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the West to Constantinople in the East, to his guidance. Abba is the most powerful designation, that for all monks in the East to voluntarily follow his spiritual authority.\n\nThe Bishop of Carthage was also known as \"papas\" by the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries, most probably taken from Alexandria or from the common tradition of Pentapolis (under Alexandrine jurisdiction) as it was quite common to call the Senior Bishop of Alexandria and the Senior Bishop of Pentapolis (who was the second in importance and command after the Bishop of Alexandria and known as the Elder of Pentapolis) \"papas.\"\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the identity of the first Bishop of Rome to carry the title Pope of Rome. Some sources suggest that it was Pope Marcellinus (died 304 AD), while other sources suggest that this did not happen until the 6th century, with Pope John I (523–526 AD) the first to assume this title. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this.\n\nFrom the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome.[47] From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century,[47] when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.\n\nBetween the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431 AD) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), the archbishops of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires (i.e. the archbishops of Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, also known as the Archbishops of the Ancient Apostolic Thrones), were given the title of \"patriarch\". These titles were ratified at the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), and henceforth were known historically as the Ancient Patriarchates of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox Church or otherwise as the Pentarchy.\nThe Bishop of Alexandria was first known as the Bishop of Alexandria. Later, due to the importance and dignity of Alexandria as a major Christian center and as an Ancient Apostolic Throne, and in addition to the fact that the Bishop of Alexandria is the successor of the first Bishop on the Throne of Alexandria, he was given the title of archbishop by the late 3rd century. He was already called by the Alexandrine clergy and by all the Egyptian bishops \"papas,\" since the middle of the 3rd century.\nBy the middle of the 5th century, the title of \"patriarch\" was bestowed upon all major Apostolic thrones of the Holy Catholic, Apostolic and Orthodox Church (ratified by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD). By this title, it meant that these patriarchates have geographical jurisdiction based upon either the extent (domain) of the natural borders of their provinces, or as set by Church Ecumenical Councils and/or Church Tradition.\nLater, between the 5th and 7th century, the appellation of \"“papas”\" or \"“pope”\" became somehow a title along with the archiepiscopal and patriarchal titles of the Bishop of Alexandria. This, however, did not mean that the title of \"“pope”\" denoted a higher hierarchical or ecclesiastical dignity or rank than that of the title and rank of \"“patriarch”\" given to the Bishop of Alexandria.\n\nPatriarchal delegates known as \"Patriarchal Exarchs\" are designated for areas outside the region of the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Alexandria, or any other throne that has set jurisdictional boundaries.\n\nIn this way, the Apostolic Exarchates are not in contradiction with the Canon Laws of the Church, but are considered “Embassies of the Patriarchate of Alexandria”, rather than “Jurisdictional Dioceses\" outside the defined canonical jurisdiction.\n\n\nUntil 1928 Patriarchal elections were carried out according to oral and written Church tradition. The patriarchal election of 1928 was the first in modern history to invoke written bylaws. The elections of 1928, 1942 and 1946 inspired controversy by pitting relatively young monks versus older, more experienced bishops. Supporters of each group argued that the other should be disqualified: the advocates of the younger monks claimed that the bishops were wedded to their dioceses for life and that their election to the patriarchate would lead to an unnatural divorce of bishop and diocese, while the bishops' partisans countered that a bishop might continue to provide diocesan pastoral care from the apostolic throne, while observing that the pastoral experience of the more seasoned bishops would be indispensable to the patriarchate of the entire church; they further noted that the patriarchs of every other apostolic church, such as those of the Greek, Russian and Catholic churches, were nearly always Bishops or Abbots prior to election.\n\nThis controversy ultimately led to the development of a new set of bylaws in 1957. The bylaws state that a candidate for election to the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria must be a man of at least 40 years of age and must be a monk with at least 15 years of monastic service (in that Coptic bishops are always drawn from the ranks of monks), but he may be of any ecclesiastical rank: monk, hieromonk (monk priest or monk archpriest), abbot, or bishop.\n\nA potential candidate who meets the requirements of the bylaws must be endorsed by six bishops or twelve of the 24 members of the General Lay Council of the Church, a church governing body composed primarily of laypeople elected by the congregation to five year terms. A Nominations Committee is then formed by nine bishops appointed by the Holy Synod and nine laypersons elected by the General Community Council. The Nominations Committee, chaired by the locum tenens patriarch, narrows the field of candidates to a group of five or seven. Each diocese then contributes twelve electors to an Electoral College; their numbers are augmented by the members of The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the General Community Council, Coptic Orthodox political leaders and journalists and envoys of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The voting of the Electoral College results in a ranking of the remaining five or seven candidates, and the three highest-ranked candidates advance to the final stage of the selection process.\n\nThe name of each candidate is written on a slip of paper in a box placed on the altar of St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo during a Sunday eucharistic liturgy presided over by the Locum tenens of the throne, and attended by all members of the Holy Synod, General Congregation Council and the laity. A five-year-old child selected from the congregation then draws a slip, sight unseen, from the box; the name it bears determines the next Patriarch.\n\nThe last three Coptic Popes were selected in this manner: Cyril VI in 1959, Shenouda III in 1971, and Tawadros II in 2012.\n\nThe duties of the Coptic Orthodox pope, apart from his diocesan duties, are:\n\n\n\nFurther reading on traditions and procedures for electing the patriarch may be found at:\n\n"}
{"id": "85609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85609", "title": "Quirinus", "text": "Quirinus\n\nIn Roman mythology and religion, Quirinus (; , ) is an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, \"Quirinus\" was also an epithet of Janus, as \"Janus Quirinus\". His name may be derived from the Sabine word \"quiris\" \"spear\".\n\nQuirinus is probably an adjective meaning \"wielder of the spear\" (Quiris, in the Sabine language, cf. Janus Quirinus). Other suggested etymologies are: (i) from the Sabine town Cures; (2) from curia, i.e. he was the god of the Roman state as represented by the thirty curies, first proposed by Krestchmer. A. B. Cook (Class. Rev. xviii., p. 368) explains Quirinus as the oak-god (\"quercus\"), and Quirites as the men of the oaken spear.\n\nQuirinus was most likely a Sabine god of war. The Sabines had a settlement near the eventual site of Rome, and erected an altar to Quirinus on the \"Collis Quirinalis\" Quirinal Hill, one of the Seven hills of Rome. When the Romans settled in the area, the cult of Quirinus became part of their early belief system. This occurred before the later influences from the classical Greek culture.\n\nIn Plutarch's \"Life of Romulus\", he writes that shortly after Rome's founder had disappeared under what some considered suspicious circumstances, a Roman noble named Proculus Julius reported that Romulus had came to him while he was travelling. He claimed that the king had instructed him to tell his countrymen that he, Romulus was Quirinus. By the end of the first century BC, Quirinus would be considered to be the deified legendary king.\n\nHistorian Angelo Brelich has argued that Quirinus and Romulus were originally the same divine entity which was split into a founder hero and a god when Roman religion became demythicised. To support this, he points to the association of both Romulus and Quirinus with the grain spelt, through the \"Fornacalia\" or \"Stultorum Feriae\", according to Ovid's \"Fasti\". The last day of the festival is called the \"Quirinalia\" and corresponds with the traditional day of Romulus' death. On that day, the Romans would toast spelt as an offering to the goddess Fornax. In one version of the legend of Romulus' death cited by Plutarch, he was killed and cut into pieces by the nobles and each of them took a part of his body home and buried it on their land.\n\nBrelich claims that this pattern – a festival involving a staple crop, a god, and a tale of a slain founding hero whose body parts are buried in the soil – is a recognized archetype that arises when such a split takes place in a culture's mythology. The possible presence of the flamen Quirinalis at the festival of Acca Larentia would corroborate this thesis, given the fact that Romulus is a stepson of hers, and one of the original twelve arval brethren (Fratres Arvales). The association of Quirinus and Romulus is further supported by a connection with Vofionos, the third god in the triad of the Grabovian gods of Iguvium. Vofionos would be the equivalent of Liber or Teutates, in Latium and among the Celts respectively.\n\nHis early importance led to his inclusion in the first Capitoline Triad, along with Mars (then an agriculture god) and Jupiter. Over time, however, he became less significant, and he was absent from the later, more widely known triad (he and Mars had been replaced by Juno and Minerva). Varro mentions the \"Capitolium Vetus\", an earlier cult site on the Quirinal, devoted to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, among whom Martial makes a distinction between the \"old Jupiter\" and the \"new\". Eventually, Romans began to favor personal and mystical cults over the official state belief system. These included those of Bacchus, Cybele, and Isis, leaving only his flamen to worship him. The Flamen Quirinalis who remained, however, was one of the patrician \"flamines maiores\" (\"greater flamens\") who had oversight over the Pontifex Maximus.\n\nIn earlier Roman art, he was portrayed as a bearded man with religious and military clothing. However, he was almost never depicted in later Roman belief systems. He was also often associated with the myrtle.\n\nHis festival was the Quirinalia, held on February 17.\n\nEven centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Quirinal hill in Rome, originally named from the deified Romulus, was still associated with power – it was chosen as the seat of the royal house after the taking of Rome by the Savoia and later it became the residence of the Presidents of the Italian Republic.\n\n"}

He takes great pleasure in treating animals cruelly and destroying plants.\n\nSometimes, his mother orders him to carry a meal to his father, who works in a garden, and Romãozinho goes, albeit unwillingly. One afternoon en route to delivery, he eats the chicken his mother has sent, puts its bones back in the box, and carries it to his father. Upon opening the box, the perplexed father asks what the bones mean. Romãozinho replies:\n\n\"That's what they gave me. I thought that my mother had eaten a chicken with a man who always goes to our home when you're not there, and sent you just the bones.\"\n\nMad with rage, the father immediately returns home, whereupon he pulls out a dagger and kills his wife. Before dying, the mother curses the laughing son, saying:\n\n\"You will never die! You won't know heaven or hell, or even rest until there's just one person left living on Earth!\"\n\nRomãozinho laughs at the curse and leaves. From that moment onward, the boy never grows. He breaks roof tiles with stones, frightens people and tortures chickens, and is presumably walking through the streets and causing mischief to this day.\n\nHowever, despite his sadistic and sociopathic personality, Romãozinho isn't pure evil and has been known to occasionally use his mischief for noble and selfless reasons. For example, there is a pregnant woman in labor, but there was no midwife to help, so she begged for help, and Romãozinho promptly does by scaring a local midwife's chicken to the woman, thing that helped the woman to give birth.\n"}

Located about six miles (10 km) south of Ahmednagar, the samadhi structure itself was completed in August 1938, more than 30 years before Baba's death in January 1969.\n\nIn June 1927 a cabin of bamboo matting and tin was built for Meher Baba on Meherabad Hill. It had a door and window on the east side. In July of the same year, a pit four feet wide and six feet deep was dug in it, lined with stone and masonry and covered by wooden planks. It was referred to as the Khadda – the Ditch or Pit-Room, by the mandali. Later the tin was replaced by mud-mortared stones and more windows were added. From August 16 Baba started using this crypt-cabin mostly for staying in seclusion. In December, five temporary rooms (meditation cells) were built next to the building for some of his mandali. In May 1934 a severe hail storm tore away the tin roof and it had to be repaired. In 1938 Baba ordered a dome to be built over it, at which time everyone came to know that this was to be the site of Meher Baba's future tomb.\n\nThe old stone walls were torn down and replaced by black stones which came from the original Post Office building on the estate. The Post Office had to be demolished the year before, after an order of the British government, because of its close proximity to the railway tracks. In the first part of August, 1938, the completed dome had four concrete models - a Christian cross, a Hindu temple, a Muslim mosque, and a Zoroastrian fire - fitted onto the corners of the roof. Shortly after, Swiss artist Helen Dahm painted colorful murals on the inside walls of the tomb, completing them in November 1938. The sign over the entrance bears Baba's motto, \"Mastery in Servitude\".\n\nOn January 31, 1969 at 12:15 in the afternoon after having his favorite poet Hafiz's couplets recited, Meher Baba died. His body was brought to the samadhi at Upper Meherabad by an ambulance from Meherazad and was interred on February 7, 1969. The ambulance had been sent by Dr. Brieseman from Booth Hospital. Afterwards, the ambulance itself died; it went out of commission and had to be replaced. The trip it made to Meherabad was its last. The stretcher which carried Baba's body is still preserved in his tin seclusion cabin on the hill. During those seven days, in compliance with Meher Baba's wish, Cole Porter's song \"Begin the Beguine\" was played repeatedly on a record player. During this time people came from all over India and a few from the west to take darshan and to see his physical form for one last time. During these seven days Mecca was flooded and closed for this exact period of Meher Baba's darshan after he dropped his physical form. All India Radio mistakenly announced Baba's passing as 10:00 P.M. on the 31st (his actual time of death was 12:15 P.M.). The next day, announcements were made on the radio several times during the day and BBC also broadcast the news. True to Meher Baba's words, in death he gave darshan in a reclining position during the summer of 1969 in what became known as The Last Darshan.\n\nToday the samadhi is a place of pilgrimage for the followers of Meher Baba from around the world, drawing its largest crowds at Amartithi celebration, the date commemorating Baba's death.\n\n"}

Vinodilal (about in 1690) his Phulamala Pachchisi mentions that organizing a pratishtha is rewarded by the tile Sanghahi.\n\nAt the conclusion of the pratishtha function, a turban of chanderi cloth was formally placed on the head of the organizing shraavaka, and people in the congregation ritually saluted him saying \"Singhaiji Juhaar\".\n\nIn Bundelkhand a raking of titles had existed in the past. A person who already has the rank Singhai, receives the title \"Savaai Singhai\" upon another gaja-ratha pratishtha. On a third occasion they receive the title \"Seth\", and following that the title \"Shrimant Seth\" is conferred.\nKhurai Zamindar Nandlal had conducted gaja-ratha pratishtha on three occasions, 1834, 1839 and 1863 and thus had earned the titles Singhai, Savaai Singhai and Seth. His grandson Mohanlal had conducted pratishtha in 1893 and thus had earned the title Shrimant Seth. Gopal Sao Puran Sao of Seoni was awarded the title for conducting pratishthas in 1849 in Jabalpur and 1877, 1895 and 1902 at Seoni. In Vidisha, in 1933, Sitab Rai Laxmi Chand was given the title Shrimant Seth in Itawa for the funding the publication of Shatkhandagam text. Mathuradas Taraiya of Lalitpur was awarded the title in 1920s. Some of the Khag clan families in Karitoran, Lalitpur hold the title Savaai Seth, which is equivalent.\n\nIn 1924, among the Parwars, 1022 families held the title Singhai, 161 Sawai Singhai, 130 Seth, 1 Sawai Seth and 3 Shrimat Seth. Among the Golapurvas, in 1941, 1186 individuals held the title Singhai, 281 Sawai Singhai, 487 Seh and 8 Sawai Seth, out of a total population of 12569.\n\nThe Taranpanth Samaj officially does not support idols and thus do not conduct bimba pratishtas, however they conduct vedi pratishta. They now award titles Seth and Sawai Seth based on contributions to Taranpanthi institutions. Bhagwandas Jain of Sagar and his descendants were awarded the title Shrimant Seth by the Taranpanth Samaj in 1980s. Oneof the highest rink holder in Jainism\n\n"}
{"id": "354821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=354821", "title": "Taqiya", "text": "Taqiya\n\nIn Islam, Taqiya or taqiyya ( \"\", literally \"prudence, fear\") is a precautionary dissimulation or denial of religious belief and practice in the face of persecution. Another term for this concept, \"kitmān\" (lit. \"action of covering, dissimulation\"), has a more specific meaning of dissimulation by silence or omission.\n\nThis practice is emphasized in Shia Islam whereby adherents are permitted to conceal their religion when under threat of persecution or compulsion. However, it is also permitted in Sunni Islam under certain circumstances.\n\nTaqiyya was initially practiced under duress by some of Muhammad's Companions. Later, it became particularly important for Shias due to their experience as a persecuted religious minority. According to Shia doctrine, taqiyya is permissible in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby. Taqiyya has also been politically legitimised, particularly among Twelver Shias, in order to maintain unity among Muslims and fraternity among the Shia clerics.\n\nYarden Mariuma, sociologist at Columbia University, writes: \"Taqiyya is an Islamic juridical term whose shifting meaning relates to when a Muslim is allowed, under Sharia law, to lie. A concept whose meaning has varied significantly among Islamic sects, scholars, countries, and political regimes, it nevertheless is one of the key terms used by recent anti-Muslim polemicists.\"\n\nThe term \"taqiyya\" ( \"/\") is derived from the Arabic triliteral root \"wāw-qāf-yā\", denoting literally caution, fear, \"prudence, guarding against (a danger)\", carefulness, wariness. In the sense of \"prudence, fear\" it can be used synonymously with the terms \"tuqa(n)\", \"tuqāt\", \"taqwā\" and \"ittiqāʾ\", derived from the same root. These terms also have other meanings. For example, the term \"taqwa\" generally means \"piety\" (lit. \"fear [of God]\") in an Islamic context. An alternative term for religious dissimulation is \"kitmān\" \"action of covering, dissimulation\". The terms \"taqiyya\" and \"kitman\" may be used synonymously, although the former has the more inclusive meaning of \"dissimulation\" in general, while the latter refers to the \"concealment\" of one's convictions by silence or omission.\n\nThe technical meaning of the term \"taqiyya\" is derived from the Quranic reference to religious dissimulation in Sura 3:28:\n\nThe two words \"tattaqū\" (\"you fear\") and \"tuqāt\" \"in fear\" are derived from the same root as \"taqiya\", and use of the abstract noun \"taqiya\" in reference to the general principle described in this passage is first recorded in a Qur'anic gloss by Al-Bukhari (9th century).\n\nRegarding 3:28, Ibn Kathir writes, \"meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly.\" He quotes Muhammad's companion, Abu Ad-Darda', who said \"we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them,\" and Al-Hasan who said \"the Tuqyah is acceptable till the Day of Resurrection.\"\n\nA similar instance of the Qur'an permitting dissimulation under compulsion is found in Sura 16:106. \nSunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse 16:106 refers to the case of 'Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture.\n\nThe doctrine of taqiyya was developed at the time of Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 148 AH/765 AD), the sixth Imamiya Imam. It served to protect Shias when Al-Mansur, the Abbasid caliph, conducted a brutal and oppressive campaign against Alids and their supporters. Religious dissimulation or Taqiyya while maintaining mental reservation is considered lawful in Shi'ism \"in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby\". Shi'is lived mostly as a minority among a frequently-hostile Sunni majority until the rise of Safavid dynasty. This condition made taqiyya doctrine important to Shias.\n\nTaqiyya holds a central place in Twelver Shia Islam. This is sometimes explained by the minority position Shias had under the political dominance of Sunni Muslims, requiring them to protect themselves through concealment and dissimulation. In Shia legal literature, there is a range of situations in which taqiyya may be used or even required. For Shia Muslims, taqiyya is to conceal their association with their faith when revealing it would result in danger. Taqiyya is done for reasons of safety. For example, a person may fear that he might be killed or harmed if he does not observe taqiyya. In this case, taqiyya is allowed. However, in some circumstances taqiyya may lead to the death of an innocent person; if so, it is not permissible; it is haraam (forbidden) to kill a human being to save one's own life. Some Shias, though, advance taqiyya as a form of jihad, a sort of fighting against their adversaries.\n\nOthers relate it to the esoteric nature of early Shia Islam. The knowledge (\"‘Ilm\") given to the Imams by God had to be protected and the truth would have to be hidden before the uninitiated or their adversaries until the coming of the Twelfth Imam, when this knowledge and ultimate meaning can become known to everyone.\n\nReligious rulings of the Shia Imams was also influenced by taqiyya. Without it, basic articles of early Shiism do not make sense and lose coherence because of contradictions. Some of the traditions from the Imams make taqiyya a central element of Shiism: \"He who has no taqiyya has no faith\"; \"he who forsakes taqiyya is like him who forsakes prayer\"; \"taqiyya is the believers shield, but for taqiyya, God would not have been worshipped\". It is unclear whether those traditions only refer to taqiyya under risk or also taqiyya to conceal the esoteric doctrines of Shiism. Many Shias today deny that taqiyya has any significance in their religion.\n\nFor the Ismailis in the aftermath of the Mongol onslaught of the Alamut state in 1256 CE, the need to practice taqiyya became necessary, not only for the protection of the community itself, which was now stateless, but also for safeguarding the line of the Nizari Ismaili Imamate during this period of unrest. Accordingly, the Shia Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq stated \"Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my ancestors\", a tradition recorded in various sources including \"Kitāb al-Maḥāsin\" of Aḥmad b. Muhammad al-Barqī and the \"Da‘ā’im al-Islām\" of al-Qāḍī al-Nu‘mān. Such periods in which the Imams are concealed are known as \"satr\", however the term may also refer to times when the Imams were not physically hidden from view but rather when the community was required to practice precautionary dissimulation. During \"satr\" the Imam could only be accessed by his community and in extremely dangerous circumstances, would be accessible only to the highest-ranking members of the Ismaili hierarchy (ḥudūd), whose function it was to transmit the teachings of the Imam to the community.\n\nAccording to Shia scholar Muhammad Husain Javari Sabinal, Shiism would not have spread at all if not for taqiyya, referring to instances where Shia have been ruthlessly persecuted by the Sunni political elite during the Umayyad and Abbasid empires. Indeed, for the Ismailis, the persistence and prosperity of the community today owes largely to the careful safeguarding of the beliefs and teachings of the Imams during the Ilkhanate, the Safawid dynasty, and other periods of persecution. \n\nAlawites beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities. Alawites tend to conceal their beliefs (\"taqiyya\") due to historical persecution. Some tenets of the faith are secret, known only to a select few; therefore, they have been described as a mystical sect. Alawites celebrate Islamic festivals, their most-important feast is Eid al-Ghadeer.\n\nBecause of the Druze's Ismaili Shia origin, they have also been associated with taqiyya. When the Druze were a minority being persecuted they took the appearance of another religion externally, usually the ruling religion in the area, and for the most part adhered to Muslim customs by this practice.\n\nThe basic principle of taqiyya is agreed upon by scholars, though they tend to restrict it to dealing with non-Muslims and when under compulsion (\"ikrāh\"), while Shia jurists also allow it in interactions with Muslims and in all necessary matters (\"ḍarūriyāt\"). In Sunni jurisprudence protecting one's belief during extreme or exigent circumstances is called \"idtirar\" (إضطرار), which translates to \"being forced\" or \"being coerced\", and this word is not specific to concealing the faith; for example, under the jurisprudence of \"idtirar\" one is allowed to consume prohibited food to avoid starving to death. Additionally, denying one's faith under duress is \"only at most permitted and not under all circumstances obligatory\". Al-Tabari comments on sura XVI, verse 106 (Tafsir, Bulak 1323, xxiv, 122): \"If any one is compelled and professes unbelief with his tongue, while his heart contradicts him, in order to escape his enemies, no blame falls on him, because God takes his servants as their hearts believe.\" This verse was recorded after Ammar Yasir was forced by the idolaters of Mecca to recant his faith and denounce the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Al-Tabari explains that concealing one's faith is only justified if the person is in mortal danger, and even then martyrdom is considered a noble alternative. If threatened, it would be preferable for a Muslim to migrate to a more peaceful place where a person may practice their faith openly, \"since God's earth is wide.\" In Hadith, in the Sunni commentary of Sahih al-Bukhari, known as the Fath al-Bari, it is stated that:\nWhich translates to: \n\nWhen Mamun became caliph (813 AD), he tried to impose his religious views on the status of the Qur'an over all his subjects, in an ordeal called the mihna, or \"inquisition\". His views were disputed, and many of those who refused to follow his views were imprisoned, tortured, or threatened with the sword. Some Sunni scholars chose to affirm Mamun's view that the Qur'an was created in spite of their beliefs, though a notable exception to this was noted scholar and theologian Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who chose to endure torture rather than to lie.\n\nFollowing the end of the \"Reconquista\" of the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, Muslims were persecuted by the Catholic Monarchs and forced to convert to Christianity or face expulsion. The principle of taqiyya became very important for Muslims during the Inquisition in sixteenth century Spain, as it allowed them to convert to Christianity while remaining crypto-Muslims, practicing Islam in secret. In 1504, Ubayd Allah al-Wahrani, a Maliki mufti in Oran, issued a fatwā allowing Muslims to make extensive use of concealment in order to maintain their faith. This is seen as an exceptional case, since Islamic law prohibits conversion except in cases of mortal danger, and even then requires recantation as quickly as possible, and al-Wahrani's reasoning diverged from that of the majority of earlier Maliki Faqīhs such as Al-Wansharisi.\n\nRaymond Ibrahim wrote an article on taqiya in 2008. In it he mentioned a translation of Lebanese Druze scholar Sami Makarem's monograph \"Al Taqiyya Fi Al Islam\" (\"Dissimulation in Islam\"), stating Sami argued that the concept should be considered \"mainstream\" and ubiquitous in modern Islamic politics, \"Taqiyya is of fundamental importance in Islam. Practically every Islamic sect agrees to it and practices it. We can go so far as to say that the practice of taqiyya is mainstream in Islam, and that those few sects not practicing it diverge from the mainstream...Taqiyya is very prevalent in Islamic politics, especially in the modern era.\" It was later characterized by another author in \"Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst\" as being \"well-researched, factual in places but ... ultimately misleading\". Ibrahim responded to this charge in his rebuttal, \"Taqiyya Revisited: A Response to the Critics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38958547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38958547", "title": "Theology of Pope Francis", "text": "Theology of Pope Francis\n\nTheology of Pope Francis is a description of his pronouncements and statements on Christian beliefs and practices. This article deals with salient features, what he \"emphasized\" during his pontificate, as distinct from his time as Jesuit provincial or as archbishop in Argentina. He is the first member of the Society of Jesus to be appointed Pope of the Catholic Church, elected on 13 March 2013.\n\nFrancis has been described as being in close continuity with the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). With the Vatican II, according to the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\", \"the monopoly exercised by neo-Thomists in the church collapsed\" and Christianity increased its appeal to non-Western cultures. He has been popular with people across religious lines from the start of his papacy.\n\nThrough much of Francis' thought there is an insistence on retaining contrasting notions in tension, such as Church doctrine which \"must constantly be re-rooted in pastoral realities\". The new balance he has struck in Church teaching can be seen in his emphasis on God's merciful love for all people, regardless of religious belief, and his intolerance of triumphalism and smugness in the Church. It appears in the way he handles the various polarities that arise in topic after topic, as regards the Church's mission and leadership, pastoral sense and liturgy, and charity as the foundation for morality and motivation for environmentalism today. Francis has also become known for his \"sharp and unscripted remarks\".\n\nThe apostolic exhortation \"Evangelii gaudium\", released eight months after his election, has been described as his programmatic, \"a core document of this pontificate\", in his own words \"pointing out new paths for the Church's journey for years to come\".\n\nIt is suggested that the pontificate of Pope Francis will be looked back upon as the \"decisive moment in the history of the church in which the full force of the Second Vatican Council's reformist vision was finally realized\". Francis returned to the Vatican II theme of \"ressourcement,\" making the church \"more faithful to the original sources in scripture and early traditions than to the social, political, and cultural aspects of more recent times\". In contrast to John Paul II who emphasized continuity with the past in Vatican II's teachings, and reconciling discontinuities, Francis' papacy from the start emphasized discontinuities: a \"church that is poor and for the poor\"; \"disposal of the baroque trappings\" in liturgical celebrations; revision of the institutional aspects of the church, and emphasizing mercy; the need to go into the margins of the world, with a bias toward appointing cardinals from the southern hemisphere; and implementing \"one of the original proposals of Vatican II\" in constituting a council of eight cardinals who would be above the Roman Curia.\n\nBrendan Leahy, Bishop of Limerick, sees Francis' priorities as: formation of the clergy and laity to be capable of warming peoples' hearts, walking with them, dialoguing, and mending their brokenness; solidarity and collegiality; being in a permanent state of mission, with a maternal heart; and speaking up on social justice issues, for the improvement of society.\n\nAccording to the editors of a collection of essays on Francis, \"the essence of Francis' theology is formed by a commitment to the poor and the marginalized, and unwillingness to pass moral judgment on others, a dislike of legalism and decrees from on high, and a distrust of monolithic institutions.\" Francis is very much at home with Dostoyevsky's phrase, \"Beauty will save the world\". \"He's encouraging the Church to live joyfully in the power of Christ's presence, open to the wisdom of the Spirit.\"\n\nIn Chapter One of \"Evangelii gaudium\" on “The Church’s Missionary Transformation”, Pope Francis speaks of his dream of \"a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church’s customs ... and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today’s world rather than for her self-preservation\" (EG 27). For Francis, \"missionary outreach is \"paradigmatic for all the Church’s activity\"” (EG15) and it is “the entire People of God which evangelizes” (EG 17), called by their baptism to be missionary disciples (EG 120). They should be troubled in conscience that so many, our brothers and sisters, live without the sense of purpose and consolation that come from knowing Jesus Christ and without a faith community for support (EG 49). His emphasis on joy \"(Joy of the Gospel, Rejoice and be glad)\" \"is an antidote to the disenchantment and melancholy of the world today\", the joy of \"doing good with the aim of reviving the spirit of the church\".\n\nFrancis was schooled in the \"Spiritual Exercises\" of the Jesuit founder Ignatius of Loyola which immerse one in the life of Jesus to gain “an intimate knowledge of our Lord, ... that I may love Him more and follow Him more closely.” He mentions the name \"Jesus\" 125 times in \"Evangelii Gaudium.\"\n\nAs regards the Catholic's approach to those of other faiths, he says that \"the worst thing of all is religious proselytism, which paralyzes: 'I am talking with you in order to persuade you' \". He calls for dialogue that allows for mutual growth, by attraction. He quotes Vatican II on the Church's continual need for reform (EG 26). He speaks of the Church as \"a mother with an open heart\", constantly in need of communicating better, becoming \"weak with the weak, ... everything for everyone\" (1 Cor 9:22).\n\nHe repeats what he told the Church in Buenos Aires, that he prefers a Church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security, ... caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures” (EG 49). In \"Evangelii gaudium\" he wrote: “In many places an administrative approach prevails over a pastoral approach, as does a concentration on administering the sacraments apart from other forms of evangelization” (63). In line with this he has said: \"When the church does not emerge from itself to evangelize, it becomes self-referential and therefore becomes sick. ... The evils that, over time, occur in ecclesiastical institutions have their root in self-referentiality, a kind of theological narcissism.\"\n\nIn October 2018, Kathryn Jean Lopez, editor at large of \"National Review,\" responded to conservative criticism of Francis by observing: \"\"\"Pope Francis didn’t start the fires that divide the Catholic Church. Under Francis, they are out in the open more, at the highest levels. There is certainly sunlight that is being shone on things that have been previously in the dark. ...He may just trust the Holy Spirit more than the rest of us to sort it out.\"\n\nFrancis argues for “sound 'decentralization'. ... It is not advisable for the Pope to take the place of local Bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory” (EG 16). He finds little progress in finding a new way of exercising Papal primacy as requested by John Paul II (EG 32) in continuity with the desire of the Bishops at Vatican II. He seeks to give episcopal conferences \"genuine doctrinal authority\", and foresees decentralization as facilitating Church life and missionary outreach (EG 32). Francis decries the imbalance that can occur “when we speak more about law than about grace, more about the Church than about Christ, more about the Pope than about God’s word” (EG 38).\n\nHe speaks of consensus building (EG 240) and calls for attention to the \"sensus fidei\" or \"instinct of faith\" especially of the poor (EG 198), whereby the Catholic faithful discern what is of God through a connaturality or intuitive wisdom (EG 119).\n\nFrancis emphasizes that the \"hour of the laity\" has arrived and decries clericalism as rife in the Church, saying that it \"leads to the functionalization of the laity, treating them as 'messengers' \". And through clericalism a priest \"can become seduced by the prospect of a career, ... turning him into a functionary, a cleric worried more about himself, about organizations and structures, than about the true good of the People of God\". He speaks of the \"eighth sacrament\" that some priests would create – the \"pastoral customs office\" that would close doors on people instead of facilitating their reception of the sacraments. Addressing apostolic nuncios, who recommend to the pope good candidates for episcopal appointment, he said:\n\nFrancis wants \"a church based not on fancy vestments and infallible pronouncements, but on love of God and love of others.\" He is critical of a church that is preoccupied with small-minded rules and is a museum for the saintly few rather than, with missionary zeal, being a place of welcome for the many. For the church's clergy he sees \"the need to hold both action and contemplation in creative tension\", to be leaders who are led by God's grace, contemplatives in action. He has castigated and taken action against clerics who he sees as living a princely life. Francis said clergy should be shepherds looking after the people, but knows they can be tempted and corrupted by power. When they take from the people instead of giving, simony and other corruption can follow. Love between the clergy and the people is destroyed.\n\nFrancis fears some clerics \"become wolves and not shepherds; ... careerism and the search for a promotion [to the hierarchy] come under the category of spiritual worldliness\", deceitfully trying to appear holy. Francis is known for his \"snarky\" remarks. He said of clerical vanity: \"Look at the peacock; it's beautiful if you look at it from the front. But if you look at it from behind, you discover the truth. ...Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them\". He admonished 138 newly-appointed bishops not to surround themselves with \"courtiers, climbers, and yes-men\" but to bring people the Gospel that makes people free.\n\nSpeaking to 120 superiors of religious orders, Francis kept up his campaign against clericalism, that seminary formation must be “a work of art, not a police action” where seminarians “grit their teeth, try not to make mistakes, follow the rules smiling a lot, just waiting for the day when they are told ‘Good, you have finished formation’. ...This is hypocrisy that is the result of clericalism, which is one of the worst evils”. Priestly formation \"must form their hearts. Otherwise we are creating little monsters. And then these little monsters mold the people of God. This really gives me goose bumps”.\n\nPicking up on Bishop de Smedt's much-quoted remark at the Second Vatican Council, that the Catholic church was suffering from triumphalism, clericalism, and legalism, Francis described the Church’s “temptation to triumphalism, ... a Church that is content with what it is or has – well sorted, well organized, with all its offices, everything in order, everything perfect, efficient”. But this, he said, is “a Church that denies its martyrs, because it does not know that martyrs are needed”. A healthy Church, on the other hand, recognizes “triumph through failure – human failure – the failure of the Cross”.\n\nAusten Ivereigh, in writing a biography of Francis, describes him as having the rare combination of \"the political genius of a charismatic leader and the prophetic holiness of a desert saint\", the later being a characteristic of his theology. But those who say that Francis \"speaks to the emotions and not to the intelligence ... don't know Bergoglio, who has had an impressive formation in many fields\". For his dissertation work Francis studied Romano Guardini's idea of holding conflicting notions in tension in a multicultural world; to respect \"polar tensions\" without negating any of them or reducing them to a higher synthesis; to respond to each in the light of the gospel.\n\nFrancis has given encouragement to theologians who at times found themselves in an adversarial relationship during John Paul's papacy, a time when, according to Jason Horowitz of the \"New York Times\", the conservative wing of the church dominated, and when there was a revival of the importance given to scholastic philosophy. Francis calls for openness to “differing currents of thought in philosophy, theology, and pastoral practice\", saying that being \"in dialogue with other sciences and human experiences is most important for our discernment on how best to bring the Gospel message to different cultural contexts and groups\". Francis wants a more \"welcoming church\" and \"has decried a church that is inward-looking and self-referential. ... (It) must be prepared to go out to the peripheries, to encounter others in dialogue.\" The word \"dialogue\" occurs 59 times thorughout \"Evangelii gaudium\". Francis has also reached out to the Pentecostal churches, \"a new and heretofore scarcely imaginable step forward\". \n\nFrancis has not continued the attacks on secularism that were common during Benedict's papacy, Francis said:\n\nTo find God in today's world, Francis frequently calls for “discernment”, an important notion from the Jesuit founder’s \"Spiritual Exercises\". The word occurs twenty times in \"Evangelii gaudium\". Francis says that by discernment one could “avoid a kind of legalism” and help people conform to the image of Christ. He mentions the need for discernment to adapt the sign of Christian initiation to each cultural context (EG 166) – to see Christ in endless diversity (EG 181) and in all others whoever they may be (EG 179), in the particularity of each situation in which we are to deliver God's call to people (EG 154). This requires “rethinking of goals, structures, style, and methods” (EG 33) and \"deeper discernment about our experiences and life itself\" enlightened by the Gospel (EG 77). Francis is saying that \"ultimately people have responsibility for their own lives and salvation\", that \"he does not have all the answers\", and \"that he can live with doubt. He often points to the importance of discernment. ... He is critical of 'those who today always look for the disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal 'security'. ... He is steering Catholics away from the dogmatism and legalism of the past and the old-time religion and proposing a more nuanced approach to morality\". He is seen as following a more inductive rather than deductive approach to situations arising, following the “See-Judge-Act” method in applying Catholic social teaching.\n\n\"Time\" magazine selected Francis \"Person of the Year\" in the first year of his papacy, writing:\n\nIn God's merciful love, the Spirit draws us together as God's people, and it is as a people that we expand the circle of those living out the joy of the gospel. We are all called to missionary discipleship, ruling out clericalism or the partitioning off of women. Francis does not see women being ordained to the ministerial priesthood, but says: \"Our great dignity derives from Baptism. ...When we speak of sacramental power 'we are in the realm of function, not that of dignity or holiness' \" (EG 104). And he says:\n\nLooking ahead, he said that many women are well prepared to contribute to religious and theological discussions at the highest levels, alongside their male counterparts. It is more necessary than ever that they do so, \"because women look at reality with a different, a greater richness\".\n\nThe Church does not require married clergy who are converts to cease their ministry if it considers their ordination valid. And celibacy has never been regarded as a divine law for priests. Francis expressed his openness to consider having some older married men ordained, especially in mission areas where there is an extreme shortage of priests. Consistent with his idea of collegiality, he chooses to wait for the conferences of bishops to request this in the light of local situations.\n\nIn \"Evangelii gaudium\", Francis quotes a passage from the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" which stands out in his own thinking: “Imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors”. He goes on to distinguish between the \"evangelical ideal\" and the \"stages of personal growth\". The confessional, he says,\n\nHe quotes St. Ambrose: the Communion bread “is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak” (EG 47). Such talk led a few cardinals in the church to speak of an impending schism.\n\nFrancis decries self-absorption and failing to find God in every human being (EG 92). He finds this happening with those who observe \"certain rules or remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past. A supposed soundness of doctrine or discipline leads instead to a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism\" (EG 94). This he decries as\n\nTo overcome worldliness it is necessary that \"the Church constantly go out from herself, keeping her mission focused on Jesus Christ, and her commitment to the poor” (EG 97), and he adds that \"the Church must be a place of mercy freely given, where everyone can feel welcomed, loved, forgiven and encouraged to live the good life of the Gospel.\" This requires all its members to learn the “art of accompaniment, ... to remove our sandals before the sacred ground of the other (cf. Ex 3:5)\", and that the Church itself be constantly evangelized by the Good News (EG 114, 169, 174). Francis teaches that we serve the church's heritage best \"not by wielding the doctrine of the church as a club\" but by meeting the people \"'in the streets', listening to their concerns and attending to their wounds\", and so knowing \"through a pastoral 'connaturality' how the church's doctrine can best be employed to announce God's solidarity with the poor and suffering of this world and the profligate mercy of God.\n\nThe editors of \"Go into the Streets!\" write that \"Pope Francis inherited a Church which in many ways had moved away from the vision of the Second Vatican Council.\" John F. Baldovin, S.J., describes Francis' motu proprio \"Magnum Principium\" (3 September 2017) as certainly a significant change in direction with regard to who has responsibility for liturgical translations. The pope has changed Canon 838 in two important ways. The weight of responsibility now falls much more on the shoulders of the various episcopal conferences. … Those conferences which have been experiencing tension with the Vatican over revised translations, like the French-speaking and German-speaking, now have much more breathing room in deciding what is best for translating liturgical texts. This effectively countered the efforts of those who under pope John Paul II had required that \"the liturgy conform as closely as possible to the original Latin texts\". In his motu proprio Francis said: \"the vernacular languages themselves, often only in a progressive manner, would be able to become liturgical languages, standing out in a not dissimilar way to liturgical Latin for their elegance of style and the profundity of their concepts with the aim of nourishing the faith\". This was seen by Jason Horowitz as the end of the “reform of the reform” movement that sought to overturn the principles of liturgical reform proposed by the Second Vatican Council, or, as Francis expresses it, “to speak of ‘the reform of the reform’ is an error!” Earlier Francis had written: \"We cannot demand that peoples of every continent, in expressing their Christian faith, imitate modes of expression which European nations developed at a particular moment of their history\" (EG 118). And he had distanced himself from the previous popes who gave broad permission for reversion to the Mass in Latin. Also, Francis speaks against efforts to encourage priests to celebrate Mass \"ad orientem\" and calls \"the altar, the centre toward which our churches focus attention.\"\n\nOf the Eucharistic celebration he says: “A sacrament is not 'a magical rite' but rather the instrument God has chosen in order to continue to walk beside man as his travelling companion through life”. In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of \"Musicam sacram\", Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song. In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this. He said that since he had the upper portion of his right lung removed, he is too short of breath to sing the Mass.\n\nReflecting on the deep meaning of the Communion bread, he draws on Paul's epistles that point to oneness as Christ's body, where all suffer together and are honored together (1 Cor 12:26). Communion, he says, is not \"a private prayer or a beautiful spiritual exercise\" but a means of one's transformation, one's taking on the heart of Christ: peaceable, forgiving, reconciling, in solidarity with all.\n\nFrancis explains how sacraments are means or instruments, not ends in themselves. He goes on to say that true disciples encounter the Lord in the sacraments and receive the power to follow Jesus' teaching. One cannot cover up injustice, dishonesty, and uncharitableness against one's neighbor with prayers and devotions. In his encyclical \"Gaudete et Exsultate,\" his emphasis on good works as a means to holiness is such that Alan L. Anderson observes: \"I find it curious so little attention is paid in His Holiness’s exhortation to the pivotal role played by the sacraments in attaining holiness. Indeed, to attempt holiness without them would be, well, to flirt with neo-Pelagianism\".\n\nFrancis remarks how religion has become privatized and purely personal through the secularization of society (EG 64). In this atmosphere a Catholic's devotional life can fall into sentimentality, bringing personal comfort without encounter with others or an evangelizing spirit (EG 78). He criticizes people who promote such privatized devotion while neglecting the formation of the laity toward the advancement of society (EG 74). As regards the relationship between private piety and public life, Francis was the first pontiff to suggest automatic excommunication for the Mafia, at an outdoor Mass in Calabria: \"Those who in their life have gone along the evil ways, as in the case of the mafia, they are not with God, they are excommunicated\".\n\nRegarding pilgrimages, Francis says peoples' journeying together to shrines manifests a thirst for God and a working of the Spirit. It enable people to witness to their belief and to feel a part of the Church. Bringing one's children or inviting others is an evangelizing gesture (EG 122-6).\n\nFrancis has said: \"The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, ... even the atheists. Everyone! ... We are created children in the likeness of God ... and we all have a duty to do good”. He points to the Last Judgment scene in the Gospel of Matthew as proof of how God judges: what we do for the poor, the hungry, the indigent, the outcast, those who suffer and are alone, Jesus regards as done to himself (25:37-40). And he points to the Beatitudes as showing what gives deep happiness, what Catholics should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness. He devotes most of a chapter in \"Gaudete et exsultate\" to explaining these Beatitudes as the way to holiness for everyone (63-94).\n\nAuthor Elisabetta Piqué, a close friend of Francis, writes: \"Francis wants to break down the wall between the North and South of the world ... (in) the new 'cold war' that he must win over selfishness\". While Christian ethics has always taught that the earth's richness is meant for the common good, Francis has been called a Marxist for his demand for more equality. Francis has \"put the poor, the problems of inequality and structural injustice, at the heart of the church's mission, and therefore at the heart of Christian spirituality and living\". He calls inequality \"the root of all social ills\" and places on economic and government leaders the responsibility to address its structural causes and to assure all citizens access to education, dignified work, and healthcare. He finds this essential to solving any of the world's problems (EG 202, 205).\n\nAn Italian journalist finds that Francis' comments on capitalism in \"Evangelii gaudium\" \"hit the mark\", provoking a host of prominent spokespersons for capitalism, and added: \"Pope Francis is not afraid to proclaim to the world the limits, obvious to everyone after the 2008 financial debacle (in the United States), of an economic model that, left to itself, is likely to overwhelm the world\". Francis is looking for long-term intervention by political entities for the improvement of economic systems, not for the overthrow of these systems. His long-range view is consistent with church tradition and with recent pontiffs and with his prioritizing of “time over space”. “People live poised between each individual moment and the greater, brighter horizon of the utopian future as the final cause which draws us to itself. Here we see a first principle for progress in building a people: time is greater than space” (EG, 222-225).\n\nFrancis says that Catholics must say “no to a financial system which rules rather than serves. Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of peoples rather than serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food on the part of the poorest members of our human family”.\n\nFrancis has criticized the trickle-down theory which claims that economic growth from capitalism leads to widespread prosperity, as has at times been maintained by the Republican Party in the United States. He characterized this as never confirmed by the facts and sacralizing the economic system with a \"crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power\" (EG 54). Francis took the occasion of his address to the US congress in 2015 to acknowledge the benefits of capitalism and to clarify that he is not advocating Marxism. His critique of capitalism is consistent with that of Pope John-Paul II in \"Centesimus Annus\"\".\"\n\nIn his first meeting with the media, the new pope explained his choice of the name \"Francis\" in terms of his being \"a man of poverty, a man of peace, a man who loves and safeguards creation, ... (who) would like a poor church for the poor\". Richard L. Clarke, Anglican Primate of All Ireland, has said that while Francis' \"insistence that the poor of the world are Christ's deepest concern\" may not be new, his \"simplicity of lifestyle ... has undoubtedly conveyed a new impetus and purpose for all Christians\" \"Attention for the poor has become the trademark of Francis's pontificate\", the most visible priority of his papacy. He believes that \"poverty for us Christians is ... a theological category\". His leadership reflects his conviction that \"good leadership looks like Jesus in action\" and as he says: \"Jesus made himself poor to walk along the road with us\". For him, the church should be \"poor and for the poor\" (EG 198), with \"creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone\". Without this all the religious practices and talk of social issues will be just a camouflage (EG 207). He expects some to be offended by his words but would help \"those who are in thrall to an individualistic, indifferent, and self-centred mentality, to ... bring dignity to their presence on this earth\" (EG 208). The need for solidarity with the poor runs through much of \"Evangelii gaudium\", with solidarity mentioned 14 times, indifference 7 times, and widespread selfishness 4 times.\n\nFrancis has been in the forefront of insisting on the importance of helping refugees. His suggestion “to not raise walls but bridges\" was widely interpreted by the media as addressed to President Trump, and it was repeated by Francis with regards to Trump's immigration policy. Francis has said that “to speak properly of our own rights, we need to broaden our perspective and to hear the plea of other peoples and other regions than those of our own country” (EG 190). More broadly he is concerned that \"a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us\" (EG 54).He suggests that Jesus can be found in others' faces, voices, and pleas that constantly call us to live in fraternity (EG 91). He calls on lay ministers in the Catholic church to go beyond serving their own communities and show genuine commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with values according to Jesus (EG 94). Only in this way do they respond to the evangelical mandate that God's love potentially holds for them, if they do not refuse help to all those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).\n\nBy issuing \"Laudato si'\" , Francis lifted environmentalism to the high level of teaching of a papal encyclical, even as other Popes wrote encyclicals to argue for the common good in the moral crises of their day. But as with other issues Francis does not shy away from introducing to the Church a controversial stand, in this case focusing on the human causes of global warming. He addresses Chapter One to all peoples, on our common home, citing \"the results of the best scientific research available today\" (15). While returning to arguments for this larger audience in chapters three through five, in chapters two and six he addresses largely believers, pointing out that \"the Bible has no place for a tyrannical anthropocentrism unconcerned for other creatures\" (68). He speaks of \"the rhythms inscribed in nature\" through sabbatical years and the jubilee year which give rest to the land (71). Among his references are: \"The earth is the Lord’s\" (Ps 24:1); to God belongs \"the earth with all that is within it\" (Dt 10:14); humans are to \"till and keep the garden of the world\" (cf. Gen 2:15).\n\nFrancis observes that developed countries exploit the non-renewable resources of poor countries and are lax in assisting them to sustainable development, though these poor areas are least able to adopt new models that reduce environmental impact (\"Laudato si',\" 52). This returns to the topic of the \"option for the poor\" (above): Catholics should discern the impact on the poor and on integral human development before launching any project (\"Laudato si',\" 185). Francis argues for the common destination of the earth's goods, preserving these for the good of all (\"Laudato si',\" 158). For this Christians must move away from consumerism to a more Christian concept of quality of life, where they can be \"grateful for the opportunities which life affords us ... and appreciate the small things\" with a certain detachment based on their Christian philosophy of life (\"Laudato si',\" 222).\n\nFor Francis, \"mercy is the greatest of all the virtues\" (EG 37) and, according to Cardinal Walter Kasper, \"the center of the Gospel, ... the key word of his pontificate, ... (while) Scholastic theology has neglected this topic and turned it into a mere subordinate theme of justice\". In his encyclical on holiness for everyone, \"Gaudete et exsultate\", mercy is the focal theme: \"What is Pope Francis’ overall summary of holiness? It’s based on the Beatitudes: 'Seeing and acting with mercy'.\" \"Francis’s watchword is mercy, but mercy adheres, first, not in alterations of doctrine but in the new way that Catholics are invited to think of doctrine\", in pastoral practice in conformity with what \"Jesus wants – a Church attentive to the goodness which the Holy Spirit sows in the midst of human weakness\". Francis emphasized this by washing the feet of prisoners, which was for some people a shocking gesture.\n\nFrancis chose for his motto \"miserando atque eligendo,\" literally \"by having mercy and by selecting\", which refers to Jesus' selection for apostleship Matthew the tax collector who was considered unclean by Jewish law. He mentions God's mercy 32 times in \"Evangelii gaudium\" and says: \"God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy\" (EG 3). Francis declared 2016 a yearlong celebration of God's mercy, and describes mercy as fundamental to the \"pastoral sense\" which he enjoins on all those who would exercise ministry in the Church (see above). He writes that in becoming flesh God's Son \"summoned us to the revolution of tenderness” (EG 88), mentioning \"tenderness\" 11 times in \"Evangelii gaudium\",\n\nHe said that “Christian morality is not a form of stoicism, or self-denial, or merely a practical philosophy, or a catalogue of sins and faults. Before all else, the Gospel invites us to respond to the God of love who saves us, to see God in others, and to go forth from ourselves to seek the good of others” (EG 39).\n\nHe warned against \"codification of the faith in rules and regulations, as the scribes, the Pharisees, the doctors of the law did in the time of Jesus. To us, everything will be clear and set in order, but the faithful and those in search will still hunger and thirst for God\". He went on to describe the Church as a field hospital where people should come to know God's warmth and closeness to them.\n\nRegarding gay people, Francis quoted the \"Catechism\", \"that they must not be discriminated against, that they must be respected and accompanied pastorally\". But he goes further and says:\n\nWhile strongly advocating openness to migrants and refugees, Francis acknowledged that the right to migrate must be regulated. Refugees from war or other intolerable situations must be received with greater openness. HIs very first trip as Pope was to draw attention to the refugees on the island of Lampedusa, where he criticized the European community's lack of solidarity and globalized indifference. He says the word \"solidarity\" frightens the developed world.\n\nSpeaking of those who cannot satisfy their basic needs for food and health care, Francis calls on all nations to show \"a willingness to share everything and to decide to be Good Samaritans, instead of people who are indifferent to the needs of others\".\n\nFrancis acknowledged that he carried his emphasis on mercy too far when he reduced the penalty of a pedophile priest from imprisonment to a lifetime of prayer and being barred from saying Mass or being near children, along with five years of psychotherapy. He said of the case: \"I was new and I didn't understand these things well, and before two choices I chose the more benevolent one. ...It was the only time I did it, and never again\".\n\nArgentinian Archbishop Víctor Fernández has explained controversies that have arisen over Francis' words: \"The problem is that the fanatics end up converting some principles into a lifelong battle and deliberately discuss only those issues. ... There are other issues that are non-negotiable: love your neighbor, do justice to the oppressed, ... .\" The scholastic-philosophical approach to morality stemming largely from Thomas Aquinas was used during the papacy of John Paul II to give attention to the \"intrinsic evil\" of abortion. But M. Cathleen Kaveny writes, in \"America\", that she believes it is incorrect to apply the term to determine the gravity of an evil, nor should intrinsic evils be so narrowly delimited. In 2013 Massimo Faggioli wrote: \"The Catholicism of movement 'to the margins' announced by Pope Francis also means trying to take leave of the political culture of neoconservative and neoliberal Catholicism, ... a return to a Catholicism that is in search of 'common ground', such as that of the Cardinal of Chicago Joseph Bernardin.\" This is a departure from the neoconservatism among Catholics in the United States that had reigned since the Reagan era, based on an \"anti-abortion stance that was isolated from the 'social question' \" of market regulation. At the same time, while Francis may be a \"radical reformer\", he believes that \"the task of the papacy is the preservation of the doctrine handed down by Jesus Christ\". This means preserving the church's doctrine, as on abortion and artificial contraception, where he does not respond to specific misinterpretations of his words but uses later opportunities to clarify his orthodoxy.\n\nFrancis has criticized those homilies \"which should be kerygmatic but end up speaking about everything that has a connection with sex, ... whether or not to participate in a demonstration against a draft law in favor of the use of condoms\". He adds: \"We end up forgetting the treasure of Jesus alive, the treasure of the Holy Spirit present in our hearts, the treasure of a project of Christian life that has many implications that go much further than mere sexual questions\".\n\nThe Church's teaching on artificial contraception, in \"Humanae vitae\", has been very poorly received in the living tradition. Francis speaks freely to reporters on the plane during his travels, and while defending natural family planning he commented: “Some people think that in order to be good Catholics we have to breed like rabbits, right?\" He scolded an Italian woman who had eight caesarean sections. However, he attributes the sad condition of the poor to a \"culture of waste\" and to the world economic system.\n\nIn the Extraordinary General Assembly of Bishops in 2014, in preparation for the Synod on the Family of 2015, Francis recommended \"true spiritual discernment, ... to give answers to the many discouragements that surround and suffocate families\". The survey Francis called for before the synod revealed that in Germany \"huge percentages of the people (as many as 97% on some questions) had been ignoring the church's teachings in these areas (related to sexuality, remarriage, birth control, ...)\". In the 2015 Synod, the question of Communion for divorced Catholics living in a civil marriage became heated. Francis' successor to the archiepiscopal office in Argentina writes of him: \"He recommends that we never stop reading the words of St. Ambrose and St. Cyril ... which invite us to not be rigid in administration of the Eucharist\". As archbishop Francis had said Mass among the poor of Buenos Aires, and \"in a shanty town, 90 percent of your congregation are single or divorced. You have to learn to deal with that. Communion for the divorced and remarried is not an issue. Everyone takes Communion.\" \"He is always finding traces of God in everyone, ... especially those we misguidedly judge to be unworthy of sitting at the table of the Lord.\" He led people \"to make room for the marginalized in the life of the local church. ...to lead by example and to encourage people who are struggling.\" This is the pope who had the task of writing \"Amoris laetitia,\" a summation of the synods on the family. He followed the line of progressives at the synod and suggested that bishops must move church practice closer to the real life situations, and to accompany people in “discernment” and an examination of conscience, \"to make room for the consciences of the faithful, who very often respond as best they can to the Gospel amid their limitations, and are capable of carrying out their own discernment in complex situations.\" He wrote that beyond that he left the matter to the local bishops' conferences, in the spirit of collegiality that he had been promoting. Following this, bishops in Germany wrote that “Catholics who have been remarried under civil law after a divorce are invited to go to church, participate in their lives, and mature as living members of the church,” offering \"no general rule\", not insisting that priests give Communion to divorced people but calling for “differentiated solutions, which are appropriate to the individual case”. A similar directive had been given by the bishops' conferences in Argentina and in Malta. A 25-page letter accusing Francis of spreading heresy through \"Amoris laetitia\" bears 62 signatures from Catholics such as clergy and religious, but Richard Gaillardetz of Boston College says that all the signatories are \"marginal figures\".\n\nIn a book of his own reflections, Francis has written: \"Scholars of the law represent the principle opposition to Jesus; they challenge him in the name of doctrine.\" The fear of losing \"the sheep who are already safely inside the pen ...(is) the logic of the scholars of the law. ... The logic of God ... welcomes, embraces, and transfigures evil into good. ... He teaches us what to do, which logic to follow, when faced with people who suffer physically and spiritually.\"\n\nGustavo Gutierrez attended a conference in Petrópolis in 1964, that is considered to have given birth to liberation theology. At that conference spoke on \"The Meaning of the Christian Message in the Midst of Poverty and Oppression\". Gera had been a teacher of Bergoglio, who as Archbishop of Buenos Aires showed his esteem for Gera by allowing him to be buried in the crypt of the cathedral. Argentinian liberation theology, more so than in other parts of Latin America, focuses on the culture of the people, emphasizing not antagonisms but harmony, peace, and reconciliation.\n\nWalter Kasper points out that in line with the paradigm shift of Vatican II, Pope Francis's method \"is not deductive but rather inductive in that it proceeds from the concrete human situation. ... The neighbor is for you the exposition of the concrete will of God\". This is in accord with the Jesuit practice of \"discernment\", whereby one begins with the concrete situation, what Vatican II called discerning the \"signs of the times\" interpreted in the light of the gospel, rather than beginning with church doctrine. This also appears in the method of \"see, judge, and act\" that is characteristic of liberation theology and is reflected in the report of the Latin America bishops' conference at Aparecida, where Bergoglio chaired the editorial committee.\n\nThe conservative-progressive divide among bishops in Latin America is apparent in the question of how involved the clergy should be in politics. Óscar Romero was appointed bishop in San Salvador as a conservative, but moved toward the progressive perspective just 17 days after his consecration as bishop, at the assassination of Father Rutilio Grande. Pope Francis gave his clear support to the progressive perspective by moving forward the causes of canonization of Grande and Romero which had been on hold under the previous pontiffs. And he chose to promote for canonization along with Romero Pope Paul VI, who was described as similar in his care for the poor and for social justice.\n\nThe decline of base communities during the episcopacy of Pope John Paul II has been attributed to his appointment of hundreds of new bishops, some 300 in Brazil alone, \"and almost all of those new bishops have been more conservative than their predecessors.\" Under Pope Francis, base communities have been making a comeback, with his encouragement and blessing.\n\n\nEG: \"Evangelii gaudium\", an apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis on evangelization, 24 November 2013.\n"}

{"id": "44743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44743", "title": "Thomas Hardy", "text": "Thomas Hardy\n\nThomas Hardy (2 June 1840 – 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet. A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native South West England.\n\nWhile Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of such novels as \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (1874), \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" (1886), \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891), and \"Jude the Obscure\" (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin.\n\nMany of his novels concern tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances, and they are often set in the semi-fictional region of Wessex; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, Hardy's Wessex eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in southwest and south central England. Two of his novels, \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" and \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", were listed in the top 50 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n\nThomas Hardy was born on 2 June 1840 in Higher Bockhampton (then Upper Bockhampton), a hamlet in the parish of Stinsford to the east of Dorchester in Dorset, England, where his father Thomas (1811–1892) worked as a stonemason and local builder, and married his mother Jemima (née Hand; 1813–1904) in Beaminster, towards the end of 1839. Jemima was well-read, and she educated Thomas until he went to his first school at Bockhampton at the age of eight. For several years he attended Mr. Last's Academy for Young Gentlemen in Dorchester, where he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential. Because Hardy's family lacked the means for a university education, his formal education ended at the age of sixteen, when he became apprenticed to James Hicks, a local architect.\n\nHardy trained as an architect in Dorchester before moving to London in 1862; there he enrolled as a student at King's College London. He won prizes from the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Architectural Association. He joined Arthur Blomfield's practice as assistant architect in April 1862 and worked with Blomfield on All Saints' parish church in Windsor, Berkshire in 1862–64. A reredos, possibly designed by Hardy, was discovered behind panelling at All Saints' in August 2016. In the mid-1860s, Hardy was in charge of the excavation of part of the graveyard of St Pancras Old Church prior to its destruction when the Midland Railway was extended to a new terminus at St Pancras.\n\nHardy never felt at home in London, because he was acutely conscious of class divisions and his social inferiority. During this time he became interested in social reform and the works of John Stuart Mill. He was also introduced by his Dorset friend Horace Moule to the works of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte. After five years, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling in Weymouth, and decided to dedicate himself to writing.\n\nIn 1870, while on an architectural mission to restore the parish church of St Juliot in Cornwall, Hardy met and fell in love with Emma Gifford, whom he married in Kensington in the autumn of 1874. renting St David's Villa, Southborough (now Surbiton) for a year. In 1885 Thomas and his wife moved into Max Gate, a house designed by Hardy and built by his brother. Although they later became estranged, Emma's subsequent death in 1912 had a traumatic effect on him and after her death, Hardy made a trip to Cornwall to revisit places linked with their courtship; his \"Poems 1912–13\" reflect upon her death. In 1914, Hardy married his secretary Florence Emily Dugdale, who was 39 years his junior. However, he remained preoccupied with his first wife's death and tried to overcome his remorse by writing poetry. In his later years, he kept a dog named Wessex, who was notoriously ill-tempered. Wessex's grave stone can be found on the Max Gate grounds. In 1910, Hardy had been appointed a Member of the Order of Merit and was also for the first time nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He would be nominated again for the prize eleven years later.\n\nHardy became ill with pleurisy in December 1927 and died at Max Gate just after 9 pm on 11 January 1928, having dictated his final poem to his wife on his deathbed; the cause of death was cited, on his death certificate, as \"cardiac syncope\", with \"old age\" given as a contributory factor. His funeral was on 16 January at Westminster Abbey, and it proved a controversial occasion because Hardy had wished for his body to be interred at Stinsford in the same grave as his first wife, Emma. His family and friends concurred; however, his executor, Sir Sydney Carlyle Cockerell, insisted that he be placed in the abbey's famous Poets' Corner. A compromise was reached whereby his heart was buried at Stinsford with Emma, and his ashes in Poets' Corner. Hardy's estate at death was valued at £95,418 (£ in 2015 sterling).\n\nShortly after Hardy's death, the executors of his estate burnt his letters and notebooks, but twelve notebooks survived, one of them containing notes and extracts of newspaper stories from the 1820s, and research into these has provided insight into how Hardy used them in his works. In the year of his death Mrs Hardy published \"The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1841–1891\", compiled largely from contemporary notes, letters, diaries, and biographical memoranda, as well as from oral information in conversations extending over many years.\n\nHardy's work was admired by many younger writers, including D. H. Lawrence, John Cowper Powys, and Virginia Woolf. In his autobiography \"Goodbye to All That\" (1929), Robert Graves recalls meeting Hardy in Dorset in the early 1920s and how Hardy received him and his new wife warmly, and was encouraging about his work.\n\nHardy's birthplace in Bockhampton and his house Max Gate, both in Dorchester, are owned by the National Trust.\n\nHardy's first novel, \"The Poor Man and the Lady\", finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, George Meredith, who felt that \"The Poor Man and the Lady\" would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work.\n\nAfter he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, \"Desperate Remedies\" (1871) and \"Under the Greenwood Tree\" (1872), both of which were published anonymously; it was while working on the latter that he met Emma Gifford, who would become his wife. In 1873 \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\", a novel drawing on Hardy's courtship of Emma, was published under his own name. The term \"cliffhanger\" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of this story (which was published in \"Tinsley's Magazine\" between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff.\n\nIn his next novel \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (1874), Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, Wessex. Wessex had been the name of an early Saxon kingdom, in approximately the same part of England. \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career. Over the next twenty-five years Hardy produced ten more novels.\n\nSubsequently, the Hardys moved from London to Yeovil, and then to Sturminster Newton, where he wrote \"The Return of the Native\" (1878). Hardy published \"Two on a Tower\" in 1882, a romance story set in the world of astronomy. Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to Max Gate, a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother. There he wrote \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" (1886), \"The Woodlanders\" (1887), and \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a \"fallen woman\" and was initially refused publication. Its subtitle, \"A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented\", was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes.\n\"Jude the Obscure\", published in 1895, met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage. Furthermore, its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused further strain on Hardy's already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that \"Jude the Obscure\" would be read as autobiographical. Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and the Bishop of Wakefield, Walsham How, is reputed to have burnt his copy. In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: \"After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop – probably in his despair at not being able to burn me\". Despite this, Hardy had become a celebrity by the 1900s, but some argue that he gave up writing novels because of the criticism of both \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\" and \"Jude the Obscure\". \"The Well-Beloved\", first serialised in 1892, was published in 1897.\nConsidered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in Victorian England, and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people's lives and caused unhappiness. Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet Philip Larkin as central in Hardy's works:\n\nIn \"Two on a Tower\", for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class. The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between women and men. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.\n\nFate or chance is another important theme. Hardy's characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work. \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" is an example of a novel in which chance has a major role: \"Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path.\" Indeed, Hardy's main characters often seem to be held in fate's overwhelming grip.\n\nFor online poems, see \"Poetry collections\" below.\n\nIn 1898 Hardy published his first volume of poetry, \"Wessex Poems\", a collection of poems written over 30 years. While some suggest that Hardy gave up writing novels following the harsh criticism of \"Jude the Obscure\" in 1896, the poet C. H. Sisson calls this \"hypothesis\" \"superficial and absurd\". In the twentieth century Hardy published only poetry.\n\nThomas Hardy wrote in a great variety of poetic forms including lyrics, ballads, satire, dramatic monologues, and dialogue, as well as a three-volume epic closet drama \"The Dynasts\" (1904–08), and though in some ways a very traditional poet, because he was influenced by folksong and ballads, he \"was never conventional,\" and \"persistently experiment[ed] with different, often invented, stanza forms and metres, and made use of \"rough-hewn rhythms and colloquial diction\".\n\nHardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to both the Boer Wars and World War I, including \"Drummer Hodge\", \"In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'\", and \"The Man He Killed\"; his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech. A theme in the \"Wessex Poems\" is the long shadow that the Napoleonic Wars cast over the nineteenth century, as seen, for example, in \"The Sergeant's Song\" and \"Leipzig\". The Napoleonic War is the subject of \"The Dynasts\".\n\nSome of Hardy's most famous poems are from \"Poems of 1912–13\", part of \"Satires of Circumstance\" (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912. They had been estranged for twenty years and these lyric poems express deeply felt \"regret and remorse\". Poems like “After a Journey,” “The Voice,” and others from this collection \"are by general consent regarded as the peak of his poetic achievement\". In a recent biography on Hardy, Claire Tomalin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife, Emma, beginning with these elegies, which she describes as among \"the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.\"\nMany of Hardy's poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and \"the perversity of fate\", but the best of them present these themes with \"a carefully controlled elegiac feeling\". Irony is also an important element in a number of Hardy's poems, including \"The Man he Killed\" and \"Are You Digging on My Grave\". A few of Hardy's poems, such as \"The Blinded Bird\", a melancholy polemic against the sport of , reflect his firm stance against animal cruelty, exhibited also in his antivivisectionist views and his membership in The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nA number of notable English composers, including Gerald Finzi, Benjamin Britten, and Gustav Holst, set poems by Hardy to music. Holst also wrote the orchestral tone poem \"Egdon Heath: A Homage to Thomas Hardy\" in 1927.\n\nAlthough his poems were initially not as well received as his novels had been, Hardy is now recognised as one of the greatest twentieth-century poets, and his verse has had a profound influence on later writers, including Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, and, most notably Philip Larkin. Larkin included twenty-seven poems by Hardy compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot in his edition of the \"Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse\" in 1973. There were also fewer poems by W. B. Yeats.\n\nHardy's family was Anglican, but not especially devout. He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music. However, he did not attend the local Church of England school, instead being sent to Mr Last's school, three miles away. As a young adult, he befriended Henry R. Bastow (a Plymouth Brethren man), who also worked as a pupil architect, and who was preparing for adult baptism in the Baptist Church. Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it. Bastow went to Australia and maintained a long correspondence with Hardy, but eventually Hardy tired of these exchanges and the correspondence ceased. This concluded Hardy's links with the Baptists.\n\nThe irony and struggles of life, coupled with his naturally curious mind, led him to question the traditional Christian view of God: \nScholars have debated Hardy's religious leanings for years, often unable to reach a consensus. However, Hardy's religious life seems to have mixed agnosticism, deism, and spiritism. Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman, Dr A. B. Grosart, about the question of reconciling the horrors of human and animal life with \"the absolute goodness and non-limitation of God\", Hardy replied,\nHardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.\n\nHardy's friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included Horace Moule (one of the eight sons of Henry Moule), and the poet William Barnes, both ministers of religion. Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible, such as those of Gideon Mantell. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book \"The Wonders of Geology\" (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are \"compelling similarities\" between the \"cliffhanger\" section from \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" and Mantell's geological descriptions. It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" was based on Horace Moule.\nSites associated with Hardy's own life and which inspired the settings of his novels continue to attract literary tourists and casual visitors. For locations in Hardy's novels see: Thomas Hardy's Wessex, and the Thomas Hardy's Wessex research site, which includes maps.\n\nHardy corresponded with and visited Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell at Wenlock Abbey and many of Lady Catherine's books are inspired by Hardy, who was very fond of her.\n\nD. H. Lawrence's \"Study of Thomas Hardy\" (1936) indicates the importance of Hardy for him, even though this work is a platform for Lawrence's own developing philosophy rather than a more standard literary study. The influence of Hardy's treatment of character, and Lawrence's own response to the central metaphysic behind many of Hardy's novels, helped significantly in the development of \"The Rainbow\" (1915) and \"Women in Love\" (1920).\n\n\"Wood and Stone\" (1915), the first novel by John Cowper Powys, who was a contemporary of Lawrence, was \"Dedicated with devoted admiration to the greatest poet and novelist of our age Thomas Hardy\". Powys's later novel \"Maiden Castle\" (1936) is set in Dorchester, Hardy's Casterbridge, and was intended by Powys to be a \"rival\" to Hardy's \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\". \"Maiden Castle\" is the last of Powys's so-called Wessex novels, \"Wolf Solent\" (1929), \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932), and \"Weymouth Sands\" (1934), which are set in Somerset and Dorset.\n\nHardy was clearly the starting point for the character of the novelist Edward Driffield in W. Somerset Maugham's novel \"Cakes and Ale\" (1930). Thomas Hardy's works also feature prominently in the American playwright Christopher Durang's \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (1985), in which a graduate thesis analysing \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" is interspersed with analysis of Matt's family's neuroses.\n\nHardy has been a significant influence on Nigel Blackwell, frontman of the post-punk British rock band Half Man Half Biscuit, who has often incorporated phrases (some obscure) by or about Hardy, into his song lyrics.\n\nHardy divided his novels and collected short stories into three classes:\n\nNovels of character and environment\n\nRomances and fantasies\n\nNovels of ingenuity\n\nHardy also produced a number of minor tales; one story, \"The Spectre of the Real\" (1894) was written in collaboration with Florence Henniker. An additional short-story collection, beyond the ones mentioned above, is \"A Changed Man and Other Tales\" (1913). His works have been collected as the 24-volume Wessex Edition (1912–13) and the 37-volume Mellstock Edition (1919–20). His largely self-written biography appears under his second wife's name in two volumes from 1928 to 1930, as \"The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840–91\" and \"The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892–1928\", now published in a critical one-volume edition as \"The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy\", edited by Michael Millgate (1984).\n\nShort stories (with date of first publication)\n\nOnline poems: Poems by Thomas Hardy at Poetry Foundation and Poems by Thomas Hardy at poemhunter.com\n\n\n"}
