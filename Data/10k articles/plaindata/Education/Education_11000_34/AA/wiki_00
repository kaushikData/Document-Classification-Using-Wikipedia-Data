The club was formed by members of the Australian Army's 13th Australian General Hospital, 8th Division AIF and probably included other allied servicemen.\n\nThe AGH Rostrum Club at Changi was formed on much the same principles as the Rostrum Club in Manchester and the Australian Rostrum Clubs. It held to an education aim and was non-sectarian and non-political as espoused by the Rostrum founder, Sidney F. Wicks. It was formed at a time of a great deprivation for the prisoners of war. During this time Changi POW camp was being used to supply men into work camps in Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Sandakan. leading to churn in members.\n\nThe 13th Australian General Hospital (AGH) was hurriedly formed on 11 August 1941 at the Caulfield Racecourse, in response to the need for a second Australian military medical team in Malaya. They departed for Singapore on 2 September 1941, on His Majesty's Australian Hospital Ship (H.M.A.H.S.) Wanganella. The strength of the 13th Australian General Hospital medical team was 18 Officers, 1 Chaplain, 20 Warrant Officers and Sergeants, 44 nurses, 3 Masseuses, and 126 Other Ranks – 212 people in total.\n\nAfter setting up hospitals in Singapore, Tampoi in Johore Bahru, Malaya and then when pushed back by the advancing Japanese, again in Singapore, they were taken prisoner on 15 February 1942, within 6 months of departing Australia. They, and all other allied personnel, were then sent to Changi Prison and the AGH team soon became an annex of the British medical team in Roberts Barracks, part of the Changi POW Prison.\n\nA painting by Murray Griffin, Roberts Hospital Changi in 1943, now held in the Australian War Memorial illustrates the dire conditions for both patients and the AGH staff. Seriously ill battle casualties, many minus a limb, were quartered on the ground floor, the ambulant on the upper floors. The sewerage system was damaged and there was no water to flush anyway. Men with dysentery had to stagger down several flights of stairs to an outside latrine. This was a nightmare for those in the dysentery ward.\n\n \n\nAGH Rostrum at Changi was formed at a public meeting of POWs on 18 May 1943 when the privations of their captivity was harming the health and morale of the POWs . A constitution was agreed, President, Secretary, Committeeman and Critics were elected and it was agreed to meet weekly on Mondays. Meetings were to be held alternatively in the Men's, Sergeant's and Officer's Messes. The Constitution was used a number of elements of the Constitution of Australian Rostrum Clubs but was shorter and appropriate to their situation.\n\nClub members military ranks ranged from Lieutenant Colonel at the top to Private at the bottom.\n\nThe club developed a speaking program on a diverse range of topics including:\n\nAs Rostrum is an organisation that promotes learning and building confidence in a supportive environment, the clubs executive roles were initially rotated very three months. This was later changed to every four months.\n\nThe initial meeting elected two Critics. However this was later struck out and the membership record seems to indicate that this became a rotating role as occurs in Rostrum Clubs in Australia.\n\nIn March 1944 the second of the clubs's objects relating to being non-political and non-sectarian, was deleted from the Constitution.\n\nWhile there are only a few records of the clubs activities, there are noticeable changes in the scope and tenor of the minutes.\n\nInitially all members names are recorded, prefixed by they rank, and proceedings seemed more formal. There is a significant change in later meeting minutes where all members are recorded a Mister (Mr.) irrespective of rank. The other notable change is that minutes became briefer, with closer writing and use both sides of old military forms to maximise the use of available paper which was in short supply.\n\nWhile the club was active, at least in 1943 and 1944, only a few sets of meeting minutes and programs have survived.\n\nClub numbers were depleted as people where sent off with work parties to Malaya, Thailand and Burma. Visitors and new members are recorded over the period.\n\nThere is no record of the normal Rostrum Club maximum membership of 35 members being imposed at AGH Rostrum. While meeting attendance in the minutes we have was typically about 30 people, over 70 people are recorded as having some association with the club.\n\nThe AGH Rostrum Club records displayed here were kept by T H (Bill) Hadden ( Service Number VX61667) and lodged with the Australian War Memorial. He is one of very few of the 15,000 Australian POWs at Changi who have material lodged with the Australian War Memorial.\n\nRostrum Clubs have advertised in veteran's magazines over the years for additional records of the AGH Rostrum Club but none have been found.\n\nThe founding members of the AGH Rostrum Club are:\n\n\"Rank... Name... Military Number... Rostrum Role... Role / Company\"\n\n+ These members are referred to in \"POWs of Japan\" article on the 13th Australian General Hospital.\n\nIn the limited set of minutes, programs and the membership list, that are available over 70 different people are recorded as participating in meetings.\n\nThe club may have had a civilian amongst its members. In the Membership list, a Mr. C Guest is listed amongst all the other members who have their rank prefixing their name. While it would be unusual to have a civilian in this part of the POW camp, it is possible a civilian was associated with the Roberts Hospital and was able to attend the AGH Rostrum meetings. While military rank was dropped in favour of \"Mr\" at club meetings this seems to have been done after this Membership list was compiled.\n\nIt is not clear when AGH Rostrum Changi closed as there are no minutes or other information available to document the closure.\n\nThere are several dates that can be considered possible closure dates. These are:\n\nThe use of POWs on work parties for the Japanese would have had an impact of AGH Rostrum members, some of which have been traced to work gangs on the notorious Thai-Burma Railway. POWs were dispatched to work camps in Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Sandakan. The initial group of 15,000 Australian POWs in 1942 was reduced to 2,500 by mid 1943, and grew to 5,000 by mid 1944.\n\nNote: the POW Changi University operated for the duration of the war although it was at times severely constrained by available staff and students, the demand for people at the work camp, the smaller and smaller food rations as the war went on and a crack down by the Japanese guards who in late 1944 confiscated all paper and pencils. A number of diaries and other documents were saved by being buried in tin cans. Some documents held by the Australian War Memorial and in private hands have a musty smell as a result. This confiscation of documents also probably happened to the records of AGH Rostrum Club.\n\n\nAustralian Rostrum https://www.rostrum.com.au\n\nRochdale Rostrum http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/sites/rochdale-rostrum-speakers-club\n"}

A course is usually an individual subject. Students may receive a grade and academic credit after completion of the course.\n\nIn India, United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore, as well as parts of Canada, a course is the entire programme of studies required to complete a university degree, and the word \"unit\" or \"module\" would be used to refer to an academic course as it is referred to in other parts of the world, for example North America and the rest of Europe.\n\nIn between the two, in South Africa, a course officially is the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called \"modules\") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common. In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders).\n\nCourses are time-limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or \"elective\". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors.\n\nCourses are made up of individual sessions, typically on a fixed weekly schedule.\n\nThere are different formats of course in universities:\n\n\nMany courses combine these formats. Lecture courses often include weekly discussion sections with smaller groups of students led by the principal instructor, another instructor, or teaching assistant. Laboratory courses often combine lectures, discussion sections, and laboratory sessions.\n\nStudents are expected to do various kinds of work for a course:\n\n\nThe exact work required depends on the discipline, the course, and the particular instructor. Unlike most European university courses, grades are generally determined by all of these kinds of work, not only the final examination.\n\nAn elective course is one chosen by a student from a number of optional subjects or courses in a curriculum, as opposed to a required course which the student must take. While required courses (sometimes called \"core courses\" or \"general education courses\") are deemed essential for an academic degree, elective courses tend to be more specialized. Elective courses usually have fewer students than the required courses.\n\nThe term elective is also used for a period of medical study conducted away from the student's home medical school, often abroad. Motivations for choosing such a program include a wish to experience other cultures, and to learn how to work in the clinical situations in other countries.\n\nTypically, North American universities require students to achieve both breadth of knowledge across disciplines and depth of knowledge in a particular chosen subject area, known as a major. Thus, students of the Arts or Humanities are required to take some science courses, and vice versa. Normally, students are free to choose their particular electives from among a wide range of courses offered by their university, as long as the students possess the prerequisite knowledge to understand the subject matter being taught. An English major, for example, might also study one or two years of chemistry, biology or physics as well as mathematics and a foreign language.\n\nElective courses are also offered in the third and fourth years of university, though the choice is more restrictive and will depend upon the particular major the student has chosen. For example, at the University of British Columbia, students intending to specialize in Sanskrit as part of a major in Asian language and culture will usually have to complete several Sanskrit and Hindustani or Punjabi courses during the first two years of university, as well as additional courses in other languages of India in the third and fourth years of study. In addition to these required courses, however, students would choose among several third- and fourth-year elective courses on topics not directly related to India, such as the history and culture of China, Japan or Indonesia.\n\nIn the United States, most universities implement a course numbering system where each course is identified by the name of the major (or an abbreviation thereof) followed by a 3- or 4-digit number − for example, CS 123. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.\n\nThe first digit of the course number is related to its level, or relative difficulty, of the course, and can roughly correspond the year of study in which the course is likely to be taken. It's common for the second digit to represent the subfield in the department within which the course is offered − for example, in a Physics department, all courses numbered PHYS 47xx may be about magnetism, while all PHYS 48xx courses may be about optics. The attribution of the third and fourth digits is less standardized, but in general, sequences of related courses tend to have consecutive course numbers, with gaps between such sequences to signal different sets of courses.\n\nThe course number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area.\n\n\n"}

On April 11, 2017, New York became the first American state to make four-year public colleges tuition-free for those under an earnings threshold.\n\nNew York State's Excelsior Scholarship provides in-state, public college tuition for residents whose families earn below a set annual income cap: $100,000 in 2017. This amounts to an annual savings between $4,000 and $6,500, depending on whether the student attends a community college or a four-year school. As the scholarship only covers tuition, students bear the additional cost of fees and room and board, which can cost up to $14,000 annually. To maintain the scholarship, Excelsior students must maintain 30 annual class credits at a state college: State University of New York (SUNY) or City University of New York (CUNY). There will also be a GPA requirement. After graduation, Excelsior students must live and work in New York for as many years as they received the scholarship.\n\nThe annual income cap will increase as the Excelsior program is phased in (to $110,000 in 2018, and $125,000 in 2019). By the time the program is fully implemented, an estimated 200,000 will be eligible.\n\nThe Excelsior Scholarship requires graduates to live and work in New York state for the number of years that they received the scholarship, which Sara Goldrick-Raab, among others, say will cost New York and scholarship recipients money and is fundamentally unfair. Senator Bernie Sanders praised the program as an example of the free college programs he supports but some in the free college movement say that it falls into the same trap as existing scholarship programs in being complicated and trapping recipients. In addition, the Excelsior Scholarship pays for only tuition and so has been assailed for not helping poorer students who can't afford books or living expenses. The Excelsior Scholarship is a \"last dollar\" scholarship, meaning that Federal aid and grants will be applied first, with the Excelsior Scholarship being applied to the remaining balance.\n\nMarc J Cohen and the Student Assembly of the State University of New York have commended the program as one which will provide greater access to an affordable higher education, but have also articulated concerns that there are many other associated costs to higher education which must be addressed.\n\nAs of 2012, only 25.9% of CUNY students graduate with a bachelors within 4 years, as required by the Excelsior Scholarship, according to the CUNY Office of Institutional Research and Assessment. 48.9% of State University of New York students graduate with a bachelors within 4 years.\n\nIf students do not fulfill the work requirements, or fail to meet academic requirements the amount of scholarship funding they received will be converted into a loan.\n\n\"The New York Times\" estimated that the program's requirement for finishing in two to four years, depending on the degree, would make more than 90% of community college students and 60% of four-year college students ineligible.\n\n"}

He is Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Professor of History of Science, Em, at Harvard University. His contributions range from physical science and its history to their professional and public understanding, from studies on gender problems and ethics in science careers to those on the role of immigrants. These have been acknowledged by an unusually wide spectrum of appointments and honors, from physics to initiatives in education and other national, societal issues, to contributions for which he was selected, as the first scientist, to give the tenth annual Jefferson Lecture that the National Endowment for the Humanities describes as, “the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished achievement in the humanities”. However, his life story is also punctuated by improbable rescues during the dark time of the 20th century.\n\nHolton was born on May 23, 1922 in Berlin, when Germany was in turmoil and sliding toward disaster. In June, the Foreign Minister, Walter Rathenau, was one of the more than 350 politicians and intellectuals assassinated by fascist gangs that already commanded the streets. Albert Einstein was told he was next on the list, so he fled the country.\n\nHolton's parents were Austrians: Emanuel, an Attorney-at-Law specializing in International Law, and Regina, a physiotherapist. Forced by the rise of fascism in Germany, and one physical attack on the young family, they returned early to Vienna. Growing up in Vienna, Holton received his education through most of the Humanistische Gymnasium. Family life was typically that of professionals enamored of Germanic Kultur; indeed, his parents had met first in a Poetry Club.\n\nBut in 1938, the annexation of Austria by Germany made life for Jews there also life-threatening, as was widely understood after the nationwide Pogrom of November 8–9. Yet, soon thereafter he and his younger brother, Edgar, were luckily granted a place on the British Quakers' Kindertransport, to flee to England. There, Holton studied at the School of Technology, City of Oxford, receiving the Certificate of Electrical Engineering in June 1940. At that point, he was able to leave for America with his luckily rejoined family, just days before having to report for incarceration for the duration, as was required for all male adult German refugees, by Prime Minister Churchill’s directive.\n\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., out of the blue, Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT offered Holton a place as a refugee from Europe (as many American Colleges and University did similarly ). At Wesleyan, studying under his mentor, Professor Walter G. Cady, he received a B.A. in 1941 and an M.A. in 1942. From the outbreak of the war he found himself officially among the “Enemy Aliens”, as marked by President Roosevelt’s directive for all holders of German passports. Yet, he was asked to join the Harvard-based war-time research unit, the Electric-Acoustic Laboratory, OSRD, and also was Teaching Assistant on the staff to train Naval Officers in the use and repair of Radar equipment.\n\nUpon the end of WWII, he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard. In 1947 he received his Ph.D. for research on the structure of matter at high pressure, as a student under Professor Percy Williams Bridgman, who in 1946 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his remarkable research in the field he effectively founded. Upon Holton's graduation he was asked to remain at Harvard as Instructor in the Physics Department. His academic professional life had begun, and his association with Harvard has lasted for over 70 years. So has also his marriage to Nina, a sculptor. They have two sons, Thomas and Stephan.\n\nHolton went through various faculty ranks at Harvard, starting in 1947, and was tenured in 1952 at age 30. For 30 years, starting from his thesis, he ran a high-pressure laboratory, specializing on the structure of liquids, and having the usual flow-through of research students and publications.\n\nAmong the courses he taught in the Physics Department was an unusual one – an introduction to Physics seen as part of a cultural tapestry that included astronomy, chemistry and technology as well as history and philosophy of science. It resulted in his publication of his first book, Introduction to Concepts and Theories of Physical Science (Addison Wesley: 1952, and later editions and adaptations), which has been called a seminal work. Its approach and structure was later incorporated in the National Curriculum Project requested by the NSF, called The Project Physics Course. He headed it with colleagues F. James Rutherford and Fletcher Watson. It was also adapted in a number of foreign countries.\n\nIn these, as in Holton’s other educational opportunities, he has been guided by the advice of Alfred North Whitehead, that “In the conditions of modern life, the rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed”. As well, he is based on his firm belief that in education a multi-cultural approach is necessary, both to help immunize against the seduction of narrowness, and to obey the moral imperative to foster a liberal education. For the same reason, Holton wrote extensively against the destructive excesses of Structuralists and Postmodernists in their writings against science.\n\nHolton's service at Harvard included chairmanship of the Concentration on Physics and Chemistry, of the initial General Education Course, membership on the Faculty Council, and on the Advisory Board of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. From 1976 to 1982 he was concurrently Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a founding faculty member of the Program on Science, Technology and Society. At various times he was visiting professor (or similar title) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton; New York University; Leningrad University; Imperial College, London; University of Rome; CNRS-Paris; and invited lecturer in China and Japan.\n\nHere it is appropriate to mention two of Holton's other educational efforts. In 1956, having been elected as Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was asked to be its Editor. For a couple of years before, the Academy had been publishing an experimental, annual, in-house volume called Daedalus, distributed to its members. But Holton realized the opportunity to change Daedalus to a publicly, widely available, quarterly journal. As he put it in his first issue (Winter 1958), the new journal aimed \"to give the intellectual community a strong voice of its own\", and to lift each of us above our individual cell in the labyrinth, so as \"to see the entire structure\".\n\nIn addition for the journal serving as a sort of Adult Education, several issues looked ahead at problems that were coming over the horizon and had an effect on public policy—such as those on \"Arms Control and Disarmament\" (Fall 1960), on \"The Woman in America\" (Spring 1964), on African Americans (Fall 1965, with a Foreword by President L.B Johnson), and on \"Ethical Aspects of Experimentation with Human Subjects\" (Spring 1969).\n\nIn 1955, another unexpected event occurred, one which caused Holton to make an important turn in his studies. When Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, Professor Philipp Frank, Holton's colleague in the Physics Department and proponent of the American continuation of the Vienna Circle philosophy, suggested that a memorial occasion should be arranged, and that as one part Holton should present the history of Einstein's achievements. But Holton found that apart from Einstein's own essays there was then still little solid scholarship on this topic.\n\nWith Professor Frank's recommendation, Holton went to the Institute of Advanced Study, where Einstein's enormous and largely unstudied correspondence and manuscripts were kept, still under the supervision of Einstein's long-time secretary, Helen Dukas. This excursion resulted in Holton, on and off for two years, helping to make the haphazard collection into an Archive usable by scholars, while he, reading through the collection, was learning from it how to see its historical value. Over the years that followed, Holton's researches on Einstein have occupied a large part of his publications. Eventually, this initiative helped launch an academic industry, analogous to the ones concerned with Newton and Darwin. But as the scholar in this field, Tesu Hiroshige, wrote, someone had to take a \"first step\".\n\nWhile studying the rich contents of Einstein’s collection, Holton came to realize a fact that led to a new and fruitful part of his researches on this and other scientists. As shown in Einstein’s work, Einstein brilliantly but silently drew again and again from a set of fundamental guiding concepts that were neither verifiable nor falsifiable. These concepts included, in his theory construction, the primacy of the search for unity; invariance; formal rather than materialistic explanation; logical parsimony; symmetry; the continuum, causality, and completeness. In addition, their contraries held by other scientists, such as acausality and uncertainty, were strongly opposed.\n\nHolton called all such motivating concepts Themata (sing. Thema). He found these crucial, style-defining and differing thematic sets to be also at the core of research of many other scientists, from antiquity to Johann Kepler to Niels Bohr. This insight was later used as well by other historians of science, and by scholars in other fields. His findings led Holton to the publication of his book, The Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought (Harvard University Press, 1973, revised edition 1988).\n\nDifferent sets of themata were and are being held by individual scientist so inclined, as their subjects advanced over time. In that respect, this concept differs profoundly from the idea of a series of incommensurable, non-progressive, so-called “paradigms”. Each of those, in turn, was said to infect the whole social group of scientists at a given time and in the same way—as is disproved even by the famous mutual oppositions between contemporaries such as Einstein, Schroedinger, and Heisenberg.\n\nOccasionally, a public issue became so important that Holton felt he could contribute to its deeper understanding and amelioration. One of these was the general realization that among working scientists in most fields, women were underrepresented and often not sufficiently valued. Therefore, with his colleague Dr. Gerhard Sonnert, a sociologist of science, he initiated a long-term research effort, called Project Access. It yielded two books, Who Succeeds in Science?: The Gender Dimension (Rutgers University Press, 1995), and Gender Differences in Science Careers: The Project Access Study (Rutgers University Press, 1995, with a Foreword by Robert K. Merton).\n\nA second occasion for engaging in a thorough study arose when it became of general interest to explore what immigrants can bring to the betterment of society in the U.S.A. Dr. Sonnert and Holton committed to a several-years study, called Second Wave, to determine, by questionnaires and face-to-face interviews, what was achieved by a particular group—immigrants who had come as children to the U.S.A. as refugees from Nazi persecution—compared to American-borns. The startling results were published by them in a book, What Happened to the Children Who Fled Nazi Persecution (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, with a Preface by Bernard Bailyn; German translation, Was geschah mit den Kindern, Lit Verlag, Muenster, 2008). Noting that the findings in that book appeared to have applications for immigrants to the U.S. in our time, Dr. Sonnert and Holton published another book, Helping Young Refugees and Immigrants Succeed (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).\n\nHolton's researches in the history and philosophy of science as well as in education were published in a number of works, most of them available online and many of them translated into other languages. They include:\n\n\nA selection of Holton's books and essays can be downloaded on DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard). Among the essays are those in which Holton called for the wider adoption of what he called Jeffersonian Research—one with the double purpose of serving both basic investigation and the needs of society, as Thomas Jefferson had done repeatedly.\n\nHolton also engaged in considerable editorial work apart from Daedalus. It included, as General Editor, the series of books on history of science by the Arno Press, and another, called Classics of Science, by Dover Publications, Inc. He also served for some years, from its beginning, on the Editorial Advisory Board and Editorial Committee of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein (Princeton University Press, 1987 ff.). In 1972 he founded the Newsletter on Science, Technology, and Human Values, known since 1976 as the journal Science, Technology and Human Values.\n\nWhile his professional memberships are collected below, one such service required a great deal of time and energy: the Presidency of the History of Science Society (1983-1984), after two years as Vice President. This Society, founded by George Sarton, was highly distinguished in its essential mission; but he found on election that a great deal of work, managerially and financially, had to be done.\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:\n\nAmerican Physical Society: Fellow; American Philosophical Society: Fellow; American Academy of Arts and Sciences: Fellow, Editor of the Academy, 1956–63, Founding Editor of the quarterly journal, Daedalus,1958, member of Council (to 1997).

Straight\n\nHenry Harrison Straight (July 20, 1846 – November 17, 1886) was an American geologist, professor, second president of Peru State College, and the father of investment banker and diplomat Willard Dickerman Straight.\n\nHenry Harrison Straight was born on July 20, 1846, in Charlotte, New York, within Chautauqua County, New York. He was orphaned while still a boy and supported himself by working on a local farm.\n\nWhen he was 16 he began teaching at his first school, earning $39 from three months' teaching that afforded him the opportunity to enter the preparatory school of Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. He later attended special study at Cornell University and became a member of the Royal Geographical Society. From 1875 to 1876, he was at Harvard University and again at Cornell University, in another special study.\n\nFrom January 1871 until 1873, Straight became a science teacher as well as the second president (referred to as principal at the time) of Peru Normal School in Peru, Nebraska, establishing the reputation for the young college that was only opened six years earlier in 1865. He took over as president from the College's first president, John M. McKenzie.\nIn 1873, he joined the Science Department of Central Missouri Normal School in Warrensburg along with his wife, Emma, also an educator. In the summer of 1873, Henry and Emma attended the inaugural program at the Anderson School of Natural History on Penikese Island, a school for naturalists and science teachers ran by distinguished Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz. After Straight returned to Missouri, he tried to put into practice the methods of scientific study that Agassiz taught, combining them with procedures he developed as a classroom teacher at Peru. Henry worked at the College until 1875, when he and Emma both resigned. In 1874, he returned to the Pekinese and in 1875, he embarked on a geological expedition in the mountains of Carolina and Kentucky with Harvard professor and director of Kentucky Geological Survey, Nathaniel Shaler.\n\nFrom 1876 until 1883, he taught at the Oswego Normal School in Oswego, New York where he was the chair of Natural Sciences department. In 1880, he became chair of the Practice School and in 1882, he was also given charge of Psychology and the History of Education departments.\n\nIn the spring of 1883, he taught at Cook County Normal School in Chicago over Col. Francis W. Parker, a pioneer of the progressive school movement in the United States.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1884, he in charge of Industrial Science and Pedagogy at the Martha's Vineyard Summer Institute.\n\nIn the fall of 1885, his health began declining from tuberculosis and he moved to Florida to recover, moving again to Pasadena, California in the spring of the following year.\n\nIn 1873, Straight married Emma Dickerman (1850–1890), also an educator, who was born at Beardstown, Illinois and was the daughter of Col. Willard Arms Dickerman (d. 1864), of the 103rd Illinois Infantry who died from a wound received while commanding of a brigade at Resaca, Georgia. Her mother was Margaret Elizabeth Deaver. Emma was descended from Thomas Dickerman, who likely came to America from Bristol with the Reverend Richard Mather in 1636 and settled in Dorchester. Emma was described as an artist who loved poetry, pictures, and beauty in all its forms, but above all else, she loved people. Together they had:\n\nStraight died on November 17, 1886 in California after a year of declining heath, followed shortly thereafter by his wife in 1890, also of tuberculosis. Before her death, Emma moved to Tokyo, Japan, where she spent two years learning Japanese and teaching at the Normal School there. Like his father, their son was orphaned at a young age, 10. Willard and his sister were taken in by Dr. Elvire Ranier, one of the earliest woman physicians in the country, and her friend (and fellow spinster who she lived with), Laura R. Newkirk of Oswego, women who were teachers and close friends of his parents, who cared for and educated the children.\n\nHis grandchildren included: Whitney Willard Straight (1912–1979), a Grand Prix motor racing driver, aviator, and businessman, Beatrice Whitney Straight (1914–2001), an Academy Award-winning actress, Michael Whitney Straight (1916–2004), a former Soviet spy, and Dorothy Straight Sanborn (1918–1947).\n\nAccording to the Nebraska State Historical Society:\n\"The success of Straight's career does not lie in his publications or even in the large number of students he influenced. Rather he was significant because he influenced other persons who themselves became educational leaders.\"\n\nIn the Annual Report of the Regents of the University, to the Legislature of the State of New York, Straight was described as follows:\n\"His great aim during mature years was to bring science to the people, through which he believed better thinking and better living could be secured; hence he chose to work in normal schools, rejecting higher salaries and more honored positions in other educational institutions, hoping thus to train teachers who in turn would train the children and youth of our land.\"\n\n"}

According to the article 10 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the State has to ensure the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine.\nOther languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. Russian is recognized as the language of a national minority.\n\nA 2012 law, called the law \"On the principles of the state language policy\" gave the status of regional language to Russian and other minority languages. It allowed the use of minority languages in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas of Ukraine where the national minorities exceed 10% of the population. The law was used mostly in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, where predominant or significant parts of the population speak Russian as their first language. Three minor settlements did the same for Hungarian, Moldovan and Romanian. Ukrainian remained the only official country-wide language. Introduction of the law was supported by the governing Party of regions and opposed by the opposition parties. According to its opponents the law undermined and supplanted the role of the Ukrainian language, and violated Article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution.\n\nThe bill was adopted amid fistfights in the Ukrainian Parliament building on 3 July 2012, and the opposition said that the procedure of adopting the law was not respected. The law came into force on 10 August 2012. Since then various cities and regions of Ukraine declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions. Other cities and regions declared their opposition to this law. Immediately after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, on 23 February 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to repeal the law. This decision was vetoed by the acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, who instead ordered drafting of a new law to \"accommodate the interests of both eastern and western Ukraine and of all ethnic groups and minorities.\" However, in October 2014 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine started reviewing the constitutionality of the law, and on 28 February 2018 it ruled the law unconstitutional.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine, the Russian language has dwindled, but remains one of the two most used languages for business, legal proceedings, science, artistry, and many other spheres of everyday life. According to the 2001 census, 67.5% of the citizens of Ukraine regard Ukrainian as their native language, with Russian being considered the native language for another 29.6%. Various other languages constitute the remaining 2.9%. During the Soviet era, both Russian and Ukrainian had official status as state languages of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nSupporters of the bill argued it would make life easier for Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Opponents fear adoption of Russian as a minority language could spread rapidly, challenging Ukrainian and causing splits between eastern and western Ukraine. In practice Russian is already used widely in official establishments in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the article #27 (2nd part) it is necessary to translate Ukrainian place names into other languages using only Ukrainian transcription (the transcription of the state language).\n\nOn 9 February 2013 the authors of the 2012 language law, Serhiy Kivalov and Vadym Kolesnichenko, were awarded the \"Medal of Pushkin\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"great contribution to the preservation and promotion of the Russian language and culture abroad\".\n\n\nV. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, refers to its support from various higher education bodies, scientists and NGOs.\n\nSome say that the bill contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine, violates the Budget Code, and aims to annihilate the Ukrainian language. It suffered a criticism in the conclusions of state authorities and their departments: the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012), the Parliamentary Committee on Culture and Spirituality (September 23, 2011), the Parliamentary Committee on Budget (3 November 2011), Ministry of Finance (9 September 2011), the Ministry of Justice (27 September 2011). The bill also failed to obtain the support of the specialized institutions of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine: the Linguistics Institute, the Institute of the Ukrainian Language, the Institute of political and ethno-national researches, the Shevchenko Institute of Literature, the Institute of State and Law, the Ukrainian linguistic-informational Fund, the Philology Institute of Kiev University, and the Academy of Sciences of the High School of Ukraine.\n\nIn December 2011 the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe issued its Opinion on the draft law. According to Ukrayinska Pravda, the Venice Commission did not notice in the draft law of Kolesnichenko any guarantees of the protection of the Ukrainian language and later came to a decision that the bill is another \"pre-election tool\" for the Party of Regions. V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, claimed the 2011 analysis of the Venice Commission was \"generally supportive\". The opponents noted that the analysis contained strong criticism, specifically about the failure to protect the role of Ukrainian as the State language.\n\nIn its Opinion, the Venice Commission stated, among other theses:\n\n\"It seems questionable to the Venice Commission that the parallel use of the State language and regional and minority languages, and in practice mostly the Russian language in large spheres of public life and not only on a local level, can still be considered to be in compliance with article 10 of the Constitution, as clarified by the Constitutional Court.\"\n\n\"the present draft does no longer formally focus on the Russian language, as the references to this language are almost always replaced by a reference to \"the regional or minority language\". This equalization of the treatment of the Russian language to the treatment of the regional or minority languages appears to be beneficial, in certain areas of public life, to other regional or minority languages\" (Para. 64)\n\n\"…the question remains whether... there are sufficient guarantees, in the current Draft Law, for the consolidation of the Ukrainian language as the sole State language, and of the role it has to play in the Ukrainian multilinguistic society. The Venice Commission can only reiterate its call... for a fair balance between the protection of the rights of minorities, on the one hand, and the preservation of the State language as a tool for integration within society, on the other hand.\" (Para. 66)\n\n\"The recognition of linguistic freedom in the media and in the cultural area could moreover, due to market considerations, result in the dominance of the Russian language.\"\n\nThe Opinion also made other observations and proposals of change. It was of the view that \"further improvements, increased guarantees and more substantial changes to the normative content of the Draft should be introduced...\"\n\nPrior to 24 May 2012 there were rumours that a revision of the legislation on languages would take place in parliament (the Verkhovna Rada) and that the Secretary of National Security and Defense would attend the session. Some 1,000 protesters gathered just outside the Verkhovna Rada building setting up another tent city. State law enforcement warned the protesters not to establish a tent city. The protesters were yelling in Ukrainian \"Get busy with work, not a tongue\" (implying the law draft on languages). Some posters carried the slogan: \"The problem is in poverty, not in language\".\n\nAt the evening session the parliamentary opposition in the Verkhovna Rada (BYuT and Our Ukraine) blocked the main tribune in parliament as some representatives from the Party of Regions surrounded the presidium. The speaker was forced to announce a break in the session. After the break Member of Parliament Vyacheslav Kyrylenko read a statement of the united opposition not to conduct any hearings regarding language issues. After the law draft #10154 \"On the state language of Ukraine\" was not adopted onto the daily agenda, Kyrylenko withdrew his draft #9059 \"Prohibition of narrowing the sphere of use of Ukrainian language\" from a revision, while Kolesnichenko gave a presentation on his draft #9073. The head of the Committee On Issues of Culture and Spirituality Volodymyr Yavorivsky disclosed the decision of the committee to reject the bill #9073 as it was the decision of the committee's majority. He pointed to the fact that the law draft in fact will introduce a bilingual situation in number of regions. However, after a review the bill was supported by the parliamentary majority which showed its support in adopting two state languages: Ukrainian and Russian. The parliamentary minority and the deputy group \"Reforms for the Future\" stayed in opposition to the bill. Parliament speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn was forced to hastily close the session as further discussion descended into another scandalous fight leaving some members of parliament injured.\n\nThe Party of Regions released a statement to the press where it accused the opposition of denying the adaptation of a bill that protects some constitutional rights of millions of citizens of Ukraine. PoR leader in parliament Yefremov promised to revisit the issue once everything is stable.\n\nThe bill was to come into force only after it was signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the Chairman of Parliament. But the Chairman of Parliament Volodymyr Lytvyn tendered his resignation on 4 July 2012. However, the Verkhovna Rada twice held votes of confidence in the speaker, and did not accept his resignation. On 31 July Lytvyn signed the law. The bill was signed by President Yanukovych on 8 August 2012. The law came into force on 10 August 2012. Since then various Ukrainian cities and regions have declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions, these being the municipalities of Odessa, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Sevastopol, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk and Krasny Luch; and the Oblasts of Odessa, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk. Hungarian has been made a regional language in the town of Berehove in Zakarpattia Oblast, Moldovan in the village of Tarasivtsi (Chernivtsi Oblast), and Romanian in the village of Bila Tserkva; also in Zakarpattia Oblast. These languages will now be used in city/Oblast administrative office work and documents. As of September 2012 there were no plans for such bilingualism in Kiev. Chairmen of the Supreme Council of Crimea Volodomyr Konstantinov stated in March 2013 that the August 2012 law had changed nothing in Crimea.\n\nOn February 23, 2014, the second day after the flight of Viktor Yanukovich, while in a parliamentary session, a deputy from the \"Batkivshchina\" party, Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, moved to include in the agenda a bill to repeal the 2012 law \"On the principles of the state language policy\". The motion was carried with 86% of the votes in favour—232 deputies in favour vs 37 opposed against the required minimum of 226 of 334 votes. The bill was included in the agenda, immediately put to a vote with no debate and approved with the same 232 voting in favour. The bill would have made Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels. Still, all the minority languages (including Russian) remain explicitly protected under article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution. The repeal would also bring back into force the previous law on languages, which was in place in Ukraine for 23 years before July 2012 and was regulating the use of the minority languages. According to Uilleam Blacker, the repeal bill contained no specific threat to the Russian language.\n\nHowever the move to repeal the 2012 law \"On the principles of the state language policy\" provoked negative reactions in Crimea and in some regions of Southern and Eastern Ukraine. It became one of the topics of the protests against the new government approved by the parliament after the flight of Viktor Yanukovich. In this context, the next major development was the Crimean crisis.\n\nPassage of the repeal bill was met with regret by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities expressed concern over possible further unrest. He also proposed to give advice and facilitate discussions on new legislation, declaring that \"we must avoid the mistakes made last time [in 2012] when unbalanced legislation was adopted without a proper dialogue in the Verkhovna Rada.\" The bill was also criticized by the Ambassador for Human Rights of the Russian foreign ministry. Bulgarian and Romanian foreign ministers evaluated it as a step in the wrong direction, and the Greek foreign minister expressed disappointment. The Hungarian foreign ministry expressed serious concerns, noting that the decision \"could question the commitment of the new Ukrainian administration towards democracy\". The Polish foreign minister called it a mistake.\n\nAfter urgently ordering a working group to draft a replacement law on February 27, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov declared on 3 March that he will not be signing the repeal bill until a replacement law is adopted. Since then the repeal bill is not signed, but not vetoed by President, its current status is \"ready for sign\".\n\nOn 7 April 2014 former BYuT leader Yulia Tymoshenko stated she supported the 2012 language law.\n\nOn 3 November 2014, newly elected president Petro Poroshenko declared that the language policy in Ukraine will be amended.\n\nOn 10 July 2014 57 parliamentary deputies appealed the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to review the 2012 law \"On the principles of the state language policy\". On 10 October 2014 the court opened the proceedings on the constitutionality of the law. On 14 December 2016 the Constitutional Court ended the oral proceedings and on 13 January 2017 moved to the closed part of the process. On 28 February 2018 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled the law unconstitutional.\n\n"}
{"id": "39685873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39685873", "title": "Learning development", "text": "Learning development\n\nLearning development describes work with students and staff to develop academic practices, with a main focus on students developing academic practices in higher education. Learning developers are academic professionals who: teach, advise and facilitate students to develop their academic practices; create academic development learning resources; and reflect on their own academic practices through a community of practice.\n\nHilsdon (2011: 14) defines learning development as,\n\"a complex set of multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary academic roles and functions, involving teaching, tutoring, research, and the design and production of learning materials, as well as involvement in staff development, policy-making and other consultative activities.\"\n\nLearning development is a term used mainly within UK and Australian academia, with some overlap with academic advising in the USA. The learning development movement in the UK has aligned itself closely with the UK Educational Development movement in light of its developmental work with academic staff. However, the primary objective of learning development remains the development of student learning.\n\nThe learning development movement began with the recognition of a new direction of practice emerging by founding and early members of an email discussion forum Community in 2002, which was transferred to the documented JISCMail Listserv Community LDHEN in 2003. Early members were all involved in the provision of study skills support, but recognised the limitations of a purely study-skills approach.\n\nFrom 2005 onward, the establishment of the LearnHigher CETL (Centre of Excellence in Teaching and Learning) contributed greatly to the volume of publicly available learning development resources. The LearnHigher CELT was funded by the Higher Education Funding Council and comprised a consortium of teams from 16 universities, led by Liverpool Hope University to develop learning resources in 20 areas of study. LearnHigher aimed to develop and maintain a bank of open access materials for self-access by students. The CETL later referred to their work as learning development.\n\nThe LDHEN later restructured and formed the Association of Learning Development in Higher Education (ALDinHE), who published the first peer reviewed journal dedicated to learning development, \"The Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education\". This organisation have also organised a themed national conference since 2003 and annually since 2005, contributing greatly to the development of learning development as distinct area of practice. The Staff and Educational Development Association (SEDA)have also provided space for ideas in learning development to develop, as have other student-focused organisations and conferences.\n\nSome observers may identify strong learning development themes in conferences in allied areas, such as Writing Development (e.g. \"Writing Development in Higher Education (WDHE)\" conferences and \"EATAW\"), Mathematics Support (e.g. the \"Sigma Network\" and the CETL-MSOR conferences) or even Educational Development (e.g. \"SEDA\"). Likewise, the HEA's \"What Works?\" conferences and the \"Improving Student Learning\" annual symposiums have strongly tangential themes. However, these organisations/conferences rarely use the term \"learning development\" to describe their activities.\n\nWriting development is administratively subsumed within learning development at a number of UK universities, where practices may be merged locally. However, writing development has rich tradition of research and practice, established before learning development and representing a distinct field.\nInformation literacy is sometimes seen as learning development, but also has its own distinct body of practice and literature.\n\nAccording to the SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011: 3), Information Literacy is, \"an umbrella term which encompasses concepts such as digital, visual and media literacies, academic literacy, information handling, information skills, data curation and data management.\"\n\nSCONUL's seven pillars of information literacy are:\n\nLearning development in numeracy, mathematics and statistics, commonly referred to as \"mathematics support\", works with students and staff to develop mathematical practice in the disciplines. Mathematics Support ranges from basic adult numeracy to advanced support for second and third year undergraduate mathematics students. This provision is commonly provided via a mathematics (learning) support centre.\n\nThe UK mathematics support movement is seen to have begun in 1993 with a conference held at the University of Luton and was influenced by the Minnesota model of developmental mathematics, and may be considered as a sub-movement, separate and tangential to learning development. A recent survey of mathematics support in the UK identified 88 out of 103 responding higher education institutions offering some form of mathematics support.\n\nMathematics support centres and services are also present in Australia and the Republic of Ireland. Statistics support for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students is often provided via a statistics advisory service.\n\nMany learning developers resist categorising their practice into distinct subjects. For example, the use of statistics, encouraged by learning development, is cross-disciplinary, however, resources such as study guides are often categorised into distinct subjects. The following areas of learning development are taken from the LearnHigher website\n\nWhen critical thinking is applied to external sources it is called critical analysis. Critical analysis is sometimes seen as the 'holy grail' of academic writing or a 'rite of passage' for students to become accepted members of their academic community of practice. There are several different approaches to critical analysis: critically analysing a single source using a premise, argument, conclusion, application approach; moving from descriptive writing to analytical writing to evaluative writing; comparing and contrasting two different opinions using a discursive argumentation format; moving from summarising, to making simple inferences, to critiquing according to objective criteria and bringing in a personal interpretation; and using a questioning approach (who, what, where, why, etc.) to brainstorm an issue.\n\nThe learning development movement emphasises learner development from any prior level of ability. This view is generally opposed to study skills that represent remedial education - aiming to bring weaker students up to a set standard. However, accepting that support may be the most developmental approach in some circumstances, study skills remain a feature of learning development..\n\nProvision for strongly performing students and the extent to which a broader base of students should engage with learning development are both currently debated issues..\nThe characteristics of embedded provision, one-to-one provision and resource provision are each underpinned by the developmental model adopted by learning development.\n\nTeaching with learning objectives is also an effective way of integrating 'learning development' into the curriculum. This characteristic is usually referred to as embedding.\n\nLearning development practices have remained committed to provision one-to-one with academic staff.\n\nResearch-informed practice in learning development has drawn on various traditions of research. Some key examples are provided below.\n\nLea and Street have demonstrated that university staff in various disciplines have varying expectations of students in assignments. Rust \"et al\" advocate explicating assessment criteria to augment success not only in the short term, but also to better facilitate learning for the long term. Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick summarise converging literature suggesting that internal feedback and student self-regulation are only possible with a good conception of the criteria. This has prompted learning developers to work centrally to explicate or negotiate assessment criteria. This ranges from resources providing disciplinary definitions of keywords, to one-to-one practice to negotiate student understandings of assessment criteria with reference to assignment drafts.\n\n\n"}

Hopkins is a small coastal Garifuna community in the Stann Creek District of southern Belize. The center exists with the goals of keeping Garifuna music alive, passing traditional music along to young people in the community, and sharing music with visitors to Hopkins. The center’s focus is on traditional percussion music, though guitars have been donated and are also played. \n\nThe young people who play and take lessons at the drumming center perform regularly, and in 2006, they recorded a CD entitled \"Traditional Garifuna Music\" played by Youth from Hopkins, Belize, published by Innova Recordings. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Traditional Music category.\n\nTraditional Garifuna drums, or \"garaones\", are handmade of mahogany wood and deer hide. The drumhead is secured to the wooden body with cordage that is laced around the head and attached through holes at the bottom of the drum. These are tension drums; they are tuned by way of wooden pegs attached to the cordage that can be wound to tighten or loosen the drumhead. Additionally, these drums often have a thin wire or piece of fishing line stretched across the head in order to create a buzzing sound, an aesthetic which is common in much Central and West African music, and has been preserved in Garifuna music. The drums at Lebeha are crafted by master drum-maker Austin Rodriguez, whose workshop is located in Dangriga, Belize.\n\nThere are two main types of drums used in Garifuna music: \"Primero\" and \"Segunda\". The primera (or \"lanigi\", “heart-drum”, in Garifuna) is the higher-pitched of the two, and serves to accent dancers’ movements. The segunda, or \"lufarugu\" (“shadow-drum”), which provides the beat for dancers. Sometimes a third drum, the tercera, or luruwahn (“third drum”) is the lowest-pitched of the three and serves as a bass drum. The presence of the tercera allows the Segunda to play more syncopated rhythms.\n\nPunta is a traditional Belizean music and dance, often performed during festivals. This is the genre that has influenced the evolution of the popular music style punta rock. \nParanda refers to both a Garifuna rhythm, and a musical genre that features Garifuna drumming, guitar, and singing. Lyrics in this genre are often nostalgic, and paranda is usually performed by men. One can hear the Latin/Spanish influence in this style of music.\n\nBelize's most well-known popular musical style is Punta rock, a style of dance music that combines traditional Garifuna rhythms with western popular music elements, including electric and bass guitars and keyboard.\n\n"}

{"id": "32362461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32362461", "title": "Massive open online course", "text": "Massive open online course\n\nA massive open online course (MOOC ) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets, many MOOCs provide interactive courses with user forums to support community interactions among students, professors, and teaching assistants (TAs) as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments. MOOCs are a recent and widely researched development in distance education which were first introduced in 2006 and emerged as a popular mode of learning in 2012.\n\nEarly MOOCs often emphasized open-access features, such as open licensing of content, structure and learning goals, to promote the reuse and remixing of resources. Some later MOOCs use closed licenses for their course materials while maintaining free access for students. \nBefore the Digital Age, distance learning appeared in the form of correspondence courses in the 1890s–1920s and later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of e-learning. Typically fewer than five percent of the students would complete a course. The 2000s saw changes in online, or e-learning and distance education, with increasing online presence, open learning opportunities, and the development of MOOCs. By 2010 audiences for the most popular college courses such as \"Justice\" with Michael J. Sandel and \"Human Anatomy\" with Marian Diamond were reaching millions.\n\nThe first MOOCs emerged from the open educational resources (OER) movement, and from work by researchers who pointed out that class size and learning outcomes had no established connection. The term \"MOOC\" was coined in 2008 by Dave Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island in response to a course called \"Connectivism and Connective Knowledge\" (also known as \"CCK08\"). CCK08, which was led by George Siemens of Athabasca University and Stephen Downes of the National Research Council, consisted of 25 tuition-paying students in Extended Education at the University of Manitoba, as well as over 2200 online students from the general public who paid nothing. All course content was available through RSS feeds, and online students could participate through collaborative tools, including blog posts, threaded discussions in Moodle, and Second Life meetings. Stephen Downes considers these so-called cMOOCs to be more \"creative and dynamic\" than the current xMOOCs, which he believes \"resemble television shows or digital textbooks.\"\n\nOther cMOOCs were then developed; for example, Jim Groom from The University of Mary Washington and Michael Branson Smith of York College, City University of New York hosted MOOCs through several universities starting with 2011's 'Digital Storytelling' (ds106) MOOC. MOOCs from private, non-profit institutions emphasized prominent faculty members and expanded existing distance learning offerings (e.g., podcasts) into free and open online courses.\n\nAlongside the development of these open courses, other E-learning platforms emerged — such as Khan Academy, Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU), Udemy, and ALISON — which are viewed as similar to MOOCs and work outside the university system or emphasize individual self-paced lessons.\n\nAs MOOCs developed with time, multiple conceptions of the platform seem to have emerged. Mostly two different types can be differentiated: those that emphasize a connectivist philosophy, and those that resemble more traditional courses. To distinguish the two, several early adopters of the platform proposed the terms \"cMOOC\" and \"xMOOC\".\n\ncMOOCs are based on principles from connectivist pedagogy indicating that material should be \"aggregated\" (rather than pre-selected), \"remixable\", \"re-purposable\", and \"feeding forward\" (i.e. evolving materials should be targeted at future learning). cMOOC instructional design approaches attempt to connect learners to each other to answer questions or collaborate on joint projects. This may include emphasizing collaborative development of the MOOC. Andrew Ravenscroft of the London Metropolitan University claimed that connectivist MOOCs better support collaborative dialogue and knowledge building.\n\nxMOOCs have a much more traditional course structure. They are characterized by a specified aim of completing the course obtaining certain knowledge certification of the subject matter. They are presented typically with a clearly specified syllabus of recorded lectures and self-test problems. However, some providers require paid subscriptions for acquiring graded materials and certificates. They employ elements of the original MOOC, but are, in some effect, branded IT platforms that offer content distribution partnerships to institutions. The instructor is the expert provider of knowledge, and student interactions are usually limited to asking for assistance and advising each other on difficult points.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", 2012 became \"the year of the MOOC\" as several well-financed providers, associated with top universities, emerged, including Coursera, Udacity, and edX.\n\nDuring a presentation at SXSWedu in early 2013, Instructure CEO Josh Coates suggested that MOOCs are in the midst of a hype cycle, with expectations undergoing wild swings. Dennis Yang, President of MOOC provider Udemy, later made the point in an article for the \"Huffington Post\".\n\nMany universities scrambled to join in the \"next big thing\", as did more established online education service providers such as Blackboard Inc, in what has been called a \"stampede.\" Dozens of universities in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia have announced partnerships with the large American MOOC providers. By early 2013, questions emerged about whether academia was \"MOOC'd out.\" This trend was later confirmed in continuing analysis.\n\nThe industry has an unusual structure, consisting of linked groups including MOOC providers, the larger non-profit sector, universities, related companies and venture capitalists. \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" lists the major providers as the non-profits Khan Academy and edX, and the for-profits Udacity and Coursera.\n\nThe larger non-profit organizations include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the American Council on Education. University pioneers include Stanford, Harvard, MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, Caltech, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of California at Berkeley, and San Jose State University. Related companies investing in MOOCs include Google and educational publisher Pearson PLC. Venture capitalists include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, New Enterprise Associates and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nIn the fall of 2011 Stanford University launched three courses. The first of those courses was \"Introduction Into AI\", launched by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig. Enrollment quickly reached 160,000 students. The announcement was followed within weeks by the launch of two more MOOCs, by Andrew Ng and Jennifer Widom. Following the publicity and high enrollment numbers of these courses, Thrun started a company he named Udacity and Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng launched Coursera. Coursera subsequently announced university partnerships with University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Stanford University and The University of Michigan.\n\nIn January 2013, Udacity launched its first MOOCs-for-credit, in collaboration with San Jose State University. In May 2013 the company announced the first entirely MOOC-based master's degree, a collaboration between Udacity, AT&T and the Georgia Institute of Technology, costing $7,000, a fraction of its normal tuition.\n\nConcerned about the commercialization of online education, in 2012 MIT created the not-for-profit MITx. The inaugural course, 6.002x, launched in March 2012. Harvard joined the group, renamed edX, that spring, and University of California, Berkeley joined in the summer. The initiative then added the University of Texas System, Wellesley College and Georgetown University.\n\nIn September 2013, edX announced a partnership with Google to develop MOOC.org, a site for non-xConsortium groups to build and host courses. Google will work on the core platform development with edX partners. In addition, Google and edX will collaborate on research into how students learn and how technology can transform learning and teaching. MOOC.org will adopt Google's infrastructure. The Chinese Tsinghua University MOOC platform XuetangX.com (launched Oct. 2013) uses the Open edX platform.\n\nBefore 2013 each MOOC tended to develop its own delivery platform. EdX in April 2013 joined with Stanford University, which previously had its own platform called Class2Go, to work on XBlock SDK, a joint open-source platform. It is available to the public under the Affero GPL open source license, which requires that all improvements to the platform be publicly posted and made available under the same license. Stanford Vice Provost John Mitchell said that the goal was to provide the \"Linux of online learning.\" This is unlike companies such as Coursera that have developed their own platform.\n\nBy November 2013, EdX offered 94 courses from 29 institutions around the world. During its first 13 months of operation (ending March 2013), Coursera offered about 325 courses, with 30% in the sciences, 28% in arts and humanities, 23% in information technology, 13% in business and 6% in mathematics. Udacity offered 26 courses. The number of courses offered has since increased dramatically: As of January 2016, Edx offers 820 courses, Coursera offers 1580 courses and Udacity offers more than 120 courses. According to FutureLearn, the British Council's Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests has an enrollment of over 440,000 students.\n\nEarly cMOOCs such as CCK08 and ds106 used innovative pedagogy, with distributed learning materials rather than a video-lecture format, and a focus on education and learning, and digital storytelling respectively\n\nFollowing the 2011 launch of three stanford xMOOCs, including \"Introduction Into AI\", launched by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig a number of other innovative courses have emerged. As of May 2014, more than 900 MOOCs are offered by US universities and colleges. As of February 2013 dozens of universities had affiliated with MOOCs, including many international institutions. In addition, some organisations operate their own MOOCs – including Google's Power Search.\n\nA range of courses have emerged; \"There was a real question of whether this would work for humanities and social science\", said Ng. However, psychology and philosophy courses are among Coursera's most popular. Student feedback and completion rates suggest that they are as successful as math and science courses even though the corresponding completion rates are lower. \nIn January 2012, University of Helsinki launched a Finnish MOOC in programming. The MOOC is used as a way to offer high-schools the opportunity to provide programming courses for their students, even if no local premises or faculty that can organize such courses exist. The course has been offered recurringly, and the top-performing students are admitted to a BSc and MSc program in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. At a meeting on E-Learning and MOOCs, Jaakko Kurhila, Head of studies for University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, claimed that to date, there has been over 8000 participants in their MOOCs altogether.\n\nOn 18 June 2012, Ali Lemus from Galileo University launched the first Latin American MOOC titled \"Desarrollando Aplicaciones para iPhone y iPad\" This MOOC is a Spanish remix of Stanford University's popular \"CS 193P iPhone Application Development\" and had 5,380 students enrolled. The technology used to host the MOOC was the Galileo Educational System platform (GES) which is based on the .LRN project.\n\n\"Gender Through Comic Books\" was a course taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Instructure's Canvas Network, a MOOC platform launched in November 2012. The course used examples from comic books to teach academic concepts about gender and perceptions.\n\nIn November 2012, the University of Miami launched its first high school MOOC as part of Global Academy, its online high school. The course became available for high school students preparing for the SAT Subject Test in biology.\n\nDuring the Spring 2013 semester, Cathy Davidson and Dan Ariely taught the \"Surprise Endings: Social Science and Literature\" a SPOC course taught in-person at Duke University and also as a MOOC, with students from Duke running the online discussions.\n\nIn the UK of summer 2013, Physiopedia ran their first MOOC regarding Professional Ethics in collaboration with University of the Western Cape in South Africa. This was followed by a second course in 2014, Physiotherapy Management of Spinal Cord Injuries, which was accredited by the World Confederation of Physical Therapy and attracted approximately 4000 participants with a 40% completion rate. Physiopedia is the first provider of physiotherapy/physical therapy MOOCs, accessible to participants worldwide.\n\nIn March 2013, Coursolve piloted a crowdsourced business strategy course for 100 organizations with the University of Virginia. A data science MOOC began in May 2013.\n\nIn May 2013 Coursera announced free e-books for some courses in partnership with Chegg, an online textbook-rental company. Students would use Chegg's e-reader, which limits copying and printing and could use the book only while enrolled in the class.\n\nIn June 2013, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill launched Skynet University, which offers MOOCs on introductory astronomy. Participants gain access to the university's global network of robotic telescopes, including those in the Chilean Andes and Australia.\n\nIn July 2013 the University of Tasmania launched \"Understanding Dementia\", the world's first Dementia MOOC. With one of the world's highest completion rates (39%), the course was recognized in the journal Nature.\n\nStartup Veduca launched the first MOOCs in Brazil, in partnership with the University of São Paulo in June 2013. The first two courses were Basic Physics, taught by Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, and Probability and Statistics, taught by Melvin Cymbalista and André Leme Fleury. In the first two weeks following the launch at Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo, more than 10,000 students enrolled.\n\nStartup Wedubox (Finalist at MassChallenge 2013) launched the first MOOC in finance and third MOOC in Latam, the MOOC was created by Jorge Borrero (MBA Universidad de la Sabana) with the title \"WACC and the cost of capital\" it reached 2.500 students in Dec 2013 only 2 months after the launch.\n\nIn the fall 2014 Georgia Institute of Technology launched the first \"MOOD\" (massive online open degree) (Master's degree) in computer science for $7000 by partnering with Udacity and AT&T.\n\nIn September 2014, the high street retailer, Marks & Spencer partnered up with University of Leeds to construct an MOOC business course \"which will use case studies from the Company Archive alongside research from the University to show how innovation and people are key to business success. The course will be offered by the UK based MOOC platform, FutureLearn.\n\nOn 16 March 2015, the University of Cape Town launched its first MOOC, \"Medicine and the Arts\" on the UK-led platform, Futurelearn.\n\nIn July 2015, OpenClassrooms, jointly with IESA Multimedia, launches first MOOC-based Bachelor degree in multimedia project management, recognized by French state.\n\nIn January 2018, Brown University opened its first \"game-ified\" course on Edx. Titled \"Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature\" by Professor James Egan. It featured a storyline and plot to help Leila, a lost humanoid wandering different worlds, in which a learner had to play mini games to advance through the course.\n\nThe Pacific Open Learning Health Net, set up by the WHO in 2003, developed an online learning platform in 2004-5 for continuing development of health professionals. Courses were originally delivered by Moodle, but were looking more like other MOOCs by 2012.\n\nBy June 2012 more than 1.5 million people had registered for classes through Coursera, Udacity or edX. As of 2013, the range of students registered appears to be broad, diverse and non-traditional, but concentrated among English-speakers in rich countries. By March 2013, Coursera alone had registered about 2.8 million learners. By October 2013, Coursera enrollment continued to surge, surpassing 5 million, while edX had independently reached 1.3 million.\n\nA course billed as \"Asia's first MOOC\" given by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology through Coursera starting in April 2013 registered 17,000 students. About 60% were from \"rich countries\" with many of the rest from middle-income countries in Asia, South Africa, Brazil or Mexico. Fewer students enrolled from areas with more limited access to the internet, and students from the People's Republic of China may have been discouraged by Chinese government policies.\n\nKoller stated in May 2013 that a majority of the people taking Coursera courses had already earned college degrees.\n\nAccording to a Stanford University study of a more general group of students \"active learners\" – anybody who participated beyond just registering – found that 64% of high school active learners were male and 88% were male for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses.\n\nA study from Stanford University's Learning Analytics group identified four types of students: auditors, who watched video throughout the course, but took few quizzes or exams; completers, who viewed most lectures and took part in most assessments; disengaged learners, who quickly dropped the course; and sampling learners, who might only occasionally watch lectures. They identified the following percentages in each group:\n\nJonathan Haber focused on questions of what students are learning and student demographics. About half the students taking US courses are from other countries and do not speak English as their first language. He found some courses to be meaningful, especially about reading comprehension. Video lectures followed by multiple choice questions can be challenging since they are often the \"right questions.\" Smaller discussion boards paradoxically offer the best conversations. Larger discussions can be \"really, really thoughtful and really, really misguided\", with long discussions becoming rehashes or \"the same old stale left/right debate.\"\n\nMIT and Stanford University offered initial MOOCs in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Since engineering courses need prerequisites so at the outset upper-level engineering courses were nearly absent from the MOOC list. Now several universities are presenting undergraduate and advanced-level engineering courses.\n\nIn 2013, the Chronicle of Higher Education surveyed 103 professors who had taught MOOCs. \"Typically a professor spent over 100 hours on his MOOC before it even started, by recording online lecture videos and doing other preparation\", though some instructors' pre-class preparation was \"a few dozen hours.\" The professors then spent 8–10 hours per week on the course, including participation in discussion forums.\n\nThe medians were: 33,000 students enrollees; 2,600 passing; and 1 teaching assistant helping with the class. 74% of the classes used automated grading, and 34% used peer grading. 97% of the instructors used original videos, 75% used open educational resources and 27% used other resources. 9% of the classes required a physical textbook and 5% required an e-book.\n\nUnlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Georgia Tech professor Karen Head reports that 19 people work on their MOOCs and that more are needed. The platforms have availability requirements similar to media/content sharing websites, due to the large number of enrollees. MOOCs typically use cloud computing and are often created with authoring systems. Authoring tools for the creation of MOOCs are specialized packages of educational software like Elicitus, IMC Content Studio and Lectora that are easy-to-use and support e-learning standards like SCORM and AICC.\n\nDespite their potential to support learning and education, MOOCs have a major concern related to attrition rates and course drop out. Even though the number of learners who enroll in the courses tends to be in the thousands range, only a very small portion of the enrolled learners complete the course. According to the visualizations and analysis conducted by Katy Jordan (2015), the investigated MOOCs have a typical enrollment of 25,000, even though enrollment has reached a value up to ~230,000. Jordan reports that the average completion rate for such MOOCs is approximately 15%. Early data from Coursera suggest a completion rate of 7%–9%. Coffrin et al. (2012) report the completion rates are even lower (between 3 and 5%), while they say there is a consistent and noticeable decline in the number of students who participate in the course every week. Others have also shown attrition rates similar to Coffrin. One example is the course \"Bioelectricity, in the Fall of 2012\" at Duke University, where 12,725 students enrolled, but only 7,761 ever watched a video, 3,658 attempted a quiz, 345 attempted the final exam, and 313 passed, earning a certificate. Students paying $50 for a feature (designed to prevent cheating on exams) have completion rates of about 70%. Yang et al. (2013) suggest that even though there is a large proportion of students who drop out early on due to a variety of reasons, there is a significant proportion of the students who remain in the course and drop out later, thus causing attrition to happen over time.\n\nBefore analyzing some factors which is related to attrition rates and course drop out, one important thing should be keep in mind is that average completion rate for MOOCs is not a good indicator. Completion rate can not reflect the overall view of every student because different students have diverse purposes. For example, Khe Foon Hew (2016) indicates that some students take part in the MOOCs just for interest or finding extrinsic value of course. They drop the course if the course can not satisfy their purpose. However, completion rate is objective enough to reflect engagement of students.\n\nMuch research has investigated why students drop out of MOOC courses or what factors could contribute to them dropping out. For example, Rosé et al. (2014) investigate how three social factors make predictions on student attrition, for students who participated in the course discussion forum. The authors found that students who serve as authorities in the community seem to be more committed to the community and thus less inclined to drop out the course. In addition, students who actively participated in the course since the first week were 35% less likely to drop out of the course, compared with the average population. Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Rosé et al. (2014) is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.\n\nOther studies focus on exploring how motivation and self-regulated learning could be related to MOOC dropout and attrition. Carson (2002) investigated characteristics of self-directed learning in students of grades 8–12 who took online courses through a statewide online program. Two of the hypothesis that the study explored were whether there exist underlying distinct classes (categories) of self-regulated learners and if the membership in these classes was associated with measures such significantly different online course completion, online final grade, or GPA. The results show that there exist different latent classes of self-regulated learning within the population of online students, designated as high, moderate, and low self-directed learning. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that there is an association between the self-directed learning class the student belongs to with the significantly different course completion rate or course achievement (course achievement was measured by the completion of the online courses, the final online course grade and the cumulative GPA). In other words, course completion and self-directed learning in students were found to be significantly related.\n\nOne online survey published a \"top ten\" list of reasons for dropping out of a MOOC. The list involved reasons such as the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included \"lecture fatigue\" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material. Other non-completers were \"just shopping around\" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course. In addition, some participants participate peripherally (\"lurk\"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.\n\nBesides those factors cause the low completion rate in MOOCs, the inequality on receiving knowledge affected by different characters of individual also has huge influence on the consequence of completion rate. Actually, MOOC is not as fair as we expected. Russian researchers Semenova, T.V. and Rudakova, L.M (2016), indicate that MOOC is designed to decrease the unequal access to getting knowledge, but that doesn't mean every individual can enjoy the same equality in course completion rate. From their research, there are three main factors cause the inequality, which are degree of education, experience of MOOCs and gender. The survey shows that 18% high-education students complete the course while only 3% low-education students complete. To be more visualized, 84–88% students who have completed the course are high-educational. What's more, among students who have completed the course, 65–80% students have at least one experience of using online learning platform comparing to 6–31% students who have no experience . Gender also influence the completion rate, in general, 6%–7% more men than women complete the course because women are supposed to do household in many countries, which distract women's attention in learning.\n\nThe effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses. Alraimi et al. (2015) explained in their research model a substantial percentage of the variance for the intention to continue using MOOCs, which is significantly influenced by perceived reputation, perceived openness, perceived usefulness, and perceived user satisfaction. Perceived reputation and perceived openness were the strongest predictors and have not previously been examined in the context of MOOCs\n\nHowever research indicates that completion rates is not the right metric to measure success of MOOCs. Alternate metrics are proposed to measure effectiveness of MOOCs and online learning.\n\nMany MOOCs use video lectures, employing the old form of teaching (lecturing) using a new technology. Thrun testified before the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) that MOOC \"courses are 'designed to be challenges,' not lectures, and the amount of data generated from these assessments can be evaluated 'massively using machine learning' at work behind the scenes. This approach, he said, dispels 'the medieval set of myths' guiding teacher efficacy and student outcomes, and replaces it with evidence-based, 'modern, data-driven' educational methodologies that may be the instruments responsible for a 'fundamental transformation of education' itself\".\n\nSome view the videos and other material produced by the MOOC as the next form of the textbook. \"MOOC is the new textbook\", according to David Finegold of Rutgers University. A study of edX student habits found that certificate-earning students generally stop watching videos longer than 6 to 9 minutes. They viewed the first 4.4 minutes (median) of 12- to 15-minute videos. Some traditional schools blend online and offline learning, sometimes called flipped classrooms. Students watch lectures online at home and work on projects and interact with faculty while in class. Such hybrids can even improve student performance in traditional in-person classes. One fall 2012 test by San Jose State and edX found that incorporating content from an online course into a for-credit campus-based course increased pass rates to 91% from as low as 55% without the online component. \"We do not recommend selecting an online-only experience over a blended learning experience\", says Coursera's Andrew Ng.\n\nBecause of massive enrollments, MOOCs require instructional design that facilitates large-scale feedback and interaction. The two basic approaches are:\n\n\nSo-called connectivist MOOCs rely on the former approach; broadcast MOOCs rely more on the latter. This marks a key distinction between cMOOCs where the 'C' stands for 'connectivist', and xMOOCs where the x stands for extended (as in TEDx, edX) and represents that the MOOC is designed to be in addition to something else (university courses for example).\n\nAssessment can be the most difficult activity to conduct online, and online assessments can be quite different from the bricks-and-mortar version. Special attention has been devoted to proctoring and cheating.\n\nPeer review is often based upon sample answers or rubrics, which guide the grader on how many points to award different answers. These rubrics cannot be as complex for peer grading as for teaching assistants. Students are expected to learn via grading others and become more engaged with the course. Exams may be proctored at regional testing centers. Other methods, including \"eavesdropping technologies worthy of the C.I.A.\" allow testing at home or office, by using webcams, or monitoring mouse clicks and typing styles. Special techniques such as adaptive testing may be used, where the test tailors itself given the student's previous answers, giving harder or easier questions accordingly.\n\n\"The most important thing that helps students succeed in an online course is interpersonal interaction and support\", says Shanna Smith Jaggars, assistant director of Columbia University's Community College Research Center. Her research compared online-only and face-to-face learning in studies of community-college students and faculty in Virginia and Washington state. Among her findings: In Virginia, 32% of students failed or withdrew from for-credit online courses, compared with 19% for equivalent in-person courses.\n\nAssigning mentors to students is another interaction-enhancing technique. In 2013 Harvard offered a popular class, \"The Ancient Greek Hero\", instructed by Gregory Nagy and taken by thousands of Harvard students over prior decades. It appealed to alumni to volunteer as online mentors and discussion group managers. About 10 former teaching fellows also volunteered. The task of the volunteers, which required 3–5 hours per week, was to focus online class discussion. The edX course registered 27,000 students.\n\nResearch by Kop and Fournier highlighted as major challenges the lack of social presence and the high level of autonomy required. Techniques for maintaining connection with students include adding audio comments on assignments instead of writing them, participating with students in the discussion forums, asking brief questions in the middle of the lecture, updating weekly videos about the course and sending congratulatory emails on prior accomplishments to students who are slightly behind. Grading by peer review has had mixed results. In one example, three fellow students grade one assignment for each assignment that they submit. The grading key or rubric tends to focus the grading, but discourages more creative writing.\n\nA. J. Jacobs in an op-ed in the \"New York Times\" graded his experience in 11 MOOC classes overall as a \"B\". He rated his professors as '\"B+\", despite \"a couple of clunkers\", even comparing them to pop stars and \"A-list celebrity professors.\" Nevertheless, he rated teacher-to-student interaction as a \"D\" since he had almost no contact with the professors. The highest rated (\"A\") aspect of Jacobs' experience was the ability to watch videos at any time. Student-to-student interaction and assignments both received \"B-\". Study groups that didn't meet, trolls on message boards and the relative slowness of online vs. personal conversations lowered that rating. Assignments included multiple choice quizzes and exams as well as essays and projects. He found the multiple choice tests stressful and peer graded essays painful. He completed only 2 of the 11 classes.\n\nWhen searching for the desired course the courses are usually organized by \"most popular\" or a \"topical scheme\". Courses planned for synchronous learning are structured as an exact organizational scheme called a chronological scheme, Courses planned for asynchronous learning are also presented as a chronological scheme, but the order the information is learned as a hybrid scheme. In this way it can be harder to understand the course content and complete, because they are not based on an existing mental model.\n\nMOOCs are widely seen as a major part of a larger disruptive innovation taking place in higher education. In particular, the many services offered under traditional university business models are predicted to become unbundled and sold to students individually or in newly formed bundles. These services include research, curriculum design, content generation (such as textbooks), teaching, assessment and certification (such as granting degrees) and student placement. MOOCs threaten existing business models by potentially selling teaching, assessment, or placement separately from the current package of services.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has cited recent developments, including the online learning innovations at Carnegie Mellon University, Arizona State University and Georgia Institute of Technology, as having potential to reduce the rising costs of higher education.\n\nJames Mazoue, Director of Online Programs at Wayne State University describes one possible innovation:\nBut how universities will benefit by \"giving our product away free online\" is unclear.\nPrinciples of openness inform the creation, structure and operation of MOOCs. The extent to which practices of Open Design in educational technology are applied vary.\n\nIn the freemium business model the basic product – the course content – is given away free. \"Charging for content would be a tragedy\", said Andrew Ng. But \"premium\" services such as certification or placement would be charged a fee – however financial aids are given in some cases.\n\nCourse developers could charge licensing fees for educational institutions that use its materials. Introductory or \"gateway\" courses and some remedial courses may earn the most fees. Free introductory courses may attract new students to follow-on fee-charging classes. Blended courses supplement MOOC material with face-to-face instruction. Providers can charge employers for recruiting its students. Students may be able to pay to take a proctored exam to earn transfer credit at a degree-granting university, or for certificates of completion. Udemy allows teachers to sell online courses, with the course creators keeping 70–85% of the proceeds and intellectual property rights.\n\nCoursera found that students who paid $30 to $90 were substantially more likely to finish the course. The fee was ostensibly for the company's identity-verification program, which confirms that they took and passed a course.\n\nIn February 2013 the American Council on Education (ACE) recommended that its members provide transfer credit from a few MOOC courses, though even the universities who deliver the courses had said that they would not. The University of Wisconsin offered multiple, competency-based bachelor's and master's degrees starting Fall 2013, the first public university to do so on a system-wide basis. The university encouraged students to take online-courses such as MOOCs and complete assessment tests at the university to receive credit. As of 2013 few students had applied for college credit for MOOC classes. Colorado State University-Global Campus received no applications in the year after they offered the option.\n\nAcademic Partnerships is a company that helps public universities move their courses online. According to its chairman, Randy Best, \"We started it, frankly, as a campaign to grow enrollment. But 72 to 84 percent of those who did the first course came back and paid to take the second course.\"\n\nWhile Coursera takes a larger cut of any revenue generated – but requires no minimum payment – the not-for-profit edX has a minimum required payment from course providers, but takes a smaller cut of any revenues, tied to the amount of support required for each course.\n\nMOOCs are regarded by many as an important tool to widen access to Higher Education (HE) for millions of people, including those in the developing world, and ultimately enhance their quality of life. MOOCs may be regarded as contributing to the democratisation of HE, not only locally or regionally but globally as well. MOOCs can help democratise content and make knowledge reachable for everyone. Students are able to access complete courses offered by universities all over the world, something previously unattainable. With the availability of affordable technologies, MOOCs increase access to an extraordinary number of courses offered by world-renowned institutions and teachers.\n\nThe costs of tertiary education continue to increase because institutions tend to bundle too many services. With MOOCs, some of these services can be transferred to other suitable players in the public or private sector. MOOCs are for large numbers of participants, can be accessed by anyone anywhere as long as they have an Internet connection, are open to everyone without entry qualifications and offer a full/complete course experience online for free.\n\nMOOCs can be seen as a form of open education offered for free through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs is to open up quality Higher Education to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nCertain lectures, videos, and tests through MOOCs can be accessed at any time compared to scheduled class times. By allowing learners to complete their coursework in their own time, this provides flexibility to learners based on their own personal schedules.\n\nThe learning environments of MOOCs make it easier for learners across the globe to work together on common goals. Instead of having to physically meet one another, online collaboration creates partnerships among learners. While time zones may have an effect on the hours that learners communicate, projects, assignments, and more can be completed to incorporate the skills and resources that different learners offer no matter where they are located.\n\nThe MOOC Guide suggests six possible challenges for cMOOCs:\n\nThese general challenges in effective MOOC development are accompanied by criticism by journalists and academics.\n\nRobert Zemsky (2014) argues that they have passed their peak: \"They came; they conquered very little; and now they face substantially diminished prospects.\" Others have pointed to a backlash arising from the tiny completion rates.\n\nSome dispute that the \"territorial\" dimensions of MOOCs have received insufficient discussion or data-backed analysis, namely: 1. the true geographical diversity of enrolls in/completes courses; 2. the implications of courses scaling across country borders, and potential difficulties with relevance and knowledge transfer; and 3. the need for territory-specific study of locally relevant issues and needs.\n\nOther features associated with early MOOCs, such as open licensing of content, open structure and learning goals, and community-centeredness, may not be present in all MOOC projects.\n\nEffects on the structure of higher education were lamented, for example, by Moshe Y. Vardi, who finds an \"absence of serious pedagogy in MOOCs\", and indeed in all of higher education. He criticized the format of \"short, unsophisticated video chunks, interleaved with online quizzes, and accompanied by social networking.\" An underlying reason is simple cost-cutting pressures, which could hamstring the higher education industry.\n\nThe changes predicted from MOOCs generated objections in some quarters. The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher Michael Sandel:\n\nCary Nelson, former president of the American Association of University Professors claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that \"It’s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them.\" Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the American Federation of Teachers expressed concern that \"These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program.\"\n\nWith a 60% majority, the Amherst College faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the \"information dispensing\" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The Duke University faculty took a similar stance in the spring of 2013. The effect of MOOCs on second- and third-tier institutions and of creating a professorial \"star system\" were among other concerns.\n\nAt least one alternative to MOOCs has advocates: Distributed open collaborative courses (DOCC) challenge the roles of the instructor, hierarchy, money and massiveness. DOCC recognizes that the pursuit of knowledge may be achieved better by not using a centralized singular syllabus, that expertise is distributed throughout all the participants and does not just reside with one or two individuals.\n\nAnother alternative to MOOCs is the Self-Paced Online Course (SPOC) which provides a high degree of flexibility. Students can decide on their own pace and with which session they would like to begin their studies. According to a report by Class Central founder Dhawal Shah, more than 800 self-paced courses have been available in 2015.\n\nAlthough the purpose of MOOCs is ultimately to educate more people, recent criticisms include accessibility and a Westernized curriculum that lead to a failure to reach the same audiences marginalised by traditional methods.\n\nMOOCs have been criticized for a perceived lack of academic rigor as well as the monetization strategies adopted by providers. In \"MOOCs: A University Qualification in 24 Hours?\" Michael Shea writes \"By offering courses that are near-impossible to fail and charging up front fees for worthless certificates, Coursera is simply running a high-tech version of the kind of scams that have been run by correspondence colleges for decades.\"\n\nLanguage of instruction is one of the major barriers that ELLs face in MOOCs. In recent estimates, almost 75% of MOOC courses are presented in the English language, however, native English speakers are a minority among the world's population. This issue is mediated by the increasing popularity of English as a global language, and therefore has more second language speakers than any other language in the world. This barrier has encouraged content developers and other MOOC stakeholders to develop content in other popular languages to increase MOOC access. However, research studies show that some ELLs prefer to take MOOCs in English, despite the language challenges, as it promotes their goals of Economic, Social, and Geographic mobility. This emphasizes the need to not only provide MOOC content in other languages, but also to develop English language interventions for ELLs who participate in English MOOCs.\n\nAreas that ELLs particularly struggle with in English MOOCs include MOOC content without corresponding visual supporting materials (e.g., an instructor narrating instruction without text support in the background), or their hesitation to participate in MOOC discussion forums. Active participation in MOOC discussion forums has been found to improve students grades, their engagement, and leads to lower dropout rates, however, ELLs are more likely to be spectators than active contributors in discussion forums. \n\nResearching studies show a “complex mix of affective, socio-cultural, and educational factors” that are inhibitors to their active participation in discussion forums. As expected, English as the language of communication poses both linguistic and cultural challenges for ELLs, and they may not be confident in their English language communication abilities. Discussion forums may also be an uncomfortable means of communication especially for ELLs from Confucian cultures, where disagreement and arguing one’s points are often viewed as confrontational, and harmony is promoted. Therefore, while ELLs may be perceived as being uninterested in participating, research studies show that they do not show the same hesitation in face to face discourse. Finally, ELLs may come from high power distance cultures, where teachers are regarded as authority figures, and the culture of back and forth conversations between teachers and students are not a cultural norm. As a result, discussion forums with active participation from the instructors may cause discomfort and prevent participation for students from such cultures.\n\n"}

He attended the University of Sydney and obtained a BA (Hons) degree (1990–93) and an MPhil in History (1997). He was awarded a Commonwealth Research Scholarship to complete a PhD at the University of Western Sydney, entitled Scottish Soldiers in France and The Netherlands, 1660–1692 (conferred 2002).\n\nGlozier has written works on expatriate soldier groups of French Huguenot and Scottish extraction. As Official Historian of the Australian Air Force Cadets he is currently preparing for publication a history of Australian Air Force cadets, 1941-2016, for the 75th anniversary diamond jubilee of the AAFC. He is also slowly compiling a volume of biographical reference relating to French refugee soldiers serving in armies across Europe circa 1685–1713. The project grew out of his earlier\nprosopographical research into the Huguenot military support lent to William of Orange during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This is the subject of his monograph, published by Sussex Academic Press in 2002. A second book, \"Scottish Soldiers in France in the Reign of the Sun King: Nursery for Men of Honour History of Warfare\": 24 (Brill Academic Publishers), based on his doctoral thesis, appeared in 2004. \n\nHe has written and revised nine articles for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and his most recent biography is the first scholarly long study of Friedrich Hermann von Schomberg to be written in English based on new research: \"Marshal Schomberg, 1615–1690: ‘the ablest soldier of his age’: International soldiering and the formation of state armies in seventeenth–century Europe\" (Sussex Academic Press, 2005). The book has been called an \"accessible study\" that should \"do much to rescue its subject's life and career from undeserved neglect\".\n\nGlozier’s most recent work is a book on Huguenot soldiers in armies across Europe, co-edited with Dr David Onnekink (Utrecht University) – \"War, religion and service: Huguenot soldiering, 1685–1713\" (Ashgate Academic Publishers, 2007). A foreword to the book was contributed by Peter de la Billière who claimed ‘it is the first study of its kind to treat consistently the military contribution made by the Huguenots to armies outside France at the high point of their historical importance as a historical group.’. The collection deals with areas of Huguenot studies often neglected by Anglophone research. \n\nGlozier is widely published as a military historian, interested in military, social and religious aspects; he analyses migration streams and the social and religious stratification of soldier refugee groups, in volumes that appeal to academic and to interested general readers and whose international scope is useful for those seeking to explore the nexus of British and European military and political history. He explores the rise of nationalism, the transition from contract-based military service to the reliance on standing forces, and religion as a chief motivation for many soldiers. \n\nMatthew is a co–founder of the Huguenot Society of Australia (begun in 2002) and a Fellow of the Huguenot Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2009. He was appointed Official Historian of the Australian Air Force Cadets organization in 2013.\nMatthew is an Honorary Associate of the Medieval and Early Modern Studies Centre (University of Sydney), President of the Sydney Society for Scottish History, and a History Master at Sydney Grammar School.\n\nMatthew is married to Francesca and they have two children, Max and Charlotte. He coaches and writes about fencing, a sport he has enjoyed since he was at school. He is currently researching Classical Fencing.

The murder was noticeable for its implication of mid-level law enforcement officials in Mexico City.\n\nMartí was driven in an armored BMW with a bodyguard to the British American School on June 4, 2008, when he was stopped at a roadblock by officers wearing uniforms of Mexico's Federal Investigations Agency, the equivalent of the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation. The driver was tortured by having his teeth pulled out and later killed, and the bodyguard was choked. The bodyguard survived and later implicated law enforcement, including Jose Luis Romero, commander of the detective unit at Mexico City International Airport. On July 12, 2008, the ransom of 5,135,000 pesos (about US$404.3K) was agreed, but initially the official information was that a total of US$6 million was paid by all the Marti family. After several days of waiting on August 1, 2008, the body of Fernando Marti was found inside the trunk of a car that was left abandoned in the city. The case prompted public outrage in Mexico, and there has growing pressure to reintroduce capital punishment.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, the Subprocuraduría de Investigación Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), which specializes on criminal organized gangs, initiated an investigation for organized delinquency and kidnapping against the organization of La Flor (The Flower), thought to be responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Fernando Marti Haik.\n\nOn October 18, 2010, Alejandro Marti, now president of Mexico SOS, published photos of the alleged criminals.

The conservatory was officially declared defunct by the state of New York in 1952, although for all practical pedagogical purposes, it had ceased to function much earlier than that; however, between its founding and about 1920 the conservatory played an important part in the education and training of musicians in the United States. A number of prominent names are associated with the institution, including that of Victor Herbert and Antonín Dvořák, director of the conservatory from Sep. 27, 1892 to 1895. (It was at the conservatory that Dvořák composed his famous E minor Symphony and subtitled it, at Thurber’s suggestion, \"From the New World\".)\n\nThe idea of federally funded national conservatory in the United States had been a dream of Thurber's, who had studied at the Paris Conservatory in her teens. In the early 1880s she convinced a number of philanthropists, including Andrew Carnegie. to sponsor the founding of such an institution. The idea was to model the institution after that of Paris in order to create a “national musical spirit.” The conservatory (originally the \"American School of Opera\") was incorporated in the state of New York on September 21, 1885. The first director was Belgian baritone, Jacques Bouhy. Among the faculty was also Emma Fursh-Madi, one of the great sopranos of the day. There were 84 students when the conservatory started operations, operating out of two converted homes near Union Square at 126-128 East 17th St. in New York City.\n\nIt is not clear from sources exactly how much it cost to attend the conservatory or how scholarships were awarded. Some sources claim that no tuition was charged at all. Henry Finck, an NCMA music history lecturer for decades, wrote \"It was not organized as a money-making institution, but as a musical high school ... for a merely nominal sum, or, if talented, without any charge for tuition... [It was intended for those seeking a profession but] also for amateurs, for whom there are special courses.\" Its mission included \"seeking out and encouraging female, minority and physically disabled students\". In any event, the cost of operations was originally met by Mrs. Thurber and others. After three years of existence, the conservatory petitioned the US congress for $200,000 to support the institution, saying that “…hundreds of candidates have had to be rejected from lack of room to accommodate them and of funds to increase the staff of Professors which would be required by their admittance….” The petition failed. Thurber changed strategy and then proposed moving the conservatory to the nation’s capital, Washington D.C.. A bill to that effect was passed in congress and signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison in March, 1891.\n\nA site for the new “national conservatory” in the District of Columbia was never selected, much less built. The school continued to function in New York City, existing solely from philanthropy. The school awarded substantial prizes to four composers after their works were judged at a March 30, 1893 concert at Madison Square Garden. In that year Dvořák and Thurber insisted that the Conservatory be \"thrown open free of charge\" to black students. \"In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music,\" Dvořák wrote.\n\nBy 1900, the school had educated about 3,000 students. After that date and after a rapidly changing series of directors, the National Conservatory of Music of America started to fade, not from a single catastrophic failure such as bankruptcy, but more through the declining energies of its driving force, Mrs. Thurber, herself. Additionally, there was increasing competition from other institutions in the area, including The Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York, founded in 1904 and then becoming the Juilliard School of Music in 1924. As well there were concerns from many private institutions that a federally funded national conservatory on the European model would reduce their own schools to the role of a “feeder system.” \n\nIn 1913 the school attempted to hire German composer Engelbert Humperdinck as director, but although he signed a contract, the Prussian government refused him permission. By 1916 the school had moved to 126-128 West 79th Street. By the 1920s, Mrs. Thurber’s National Conservatory of Music of America had faded to such obscurity that proposals from other quarters to fund a “national conservatory” were made in apparent ignorance that such an institution already existed. As late as 1928, Mrs. Thurber was still making her case that “At no time more than the present has the necessity for a national conservatory of music been so evident…the National Conservatory of Music, which was founded in 1885 and has been in existence for over 40 years, is the only institution of its kind which in scope and in organization is in conformity with the old established models…From its inception the plan…has been to establish a national conservatory of music in Washington with branches….” The stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression dried up monies from many philanthropic sources and spelled the end of conservatory. There is no record of operations after 1930.\n\nMusically, the National Conservatory of Music of America was a brief but bright light in the cultural life of the United States. It aimed to provide affordable musical education for all-comers, including the physically handicapped and African Americans. Its prestige was greatly enhanced by the directorship of Dvořák, and it offered a yearly prize in the area of “American music,” a competition that led to the recognition of a number of young composers from the United States. Among the musicians associated with the conservatory are:\n"}

The NOLS mission is to be the leading source and teacher of wilderness skills and leadership that serve people and the environment. NOLS runs courses on six continents, with courses in a variety of wilderness environments and for almost any age group.\n\nCourses feature both leadership and technical outdoor skills, which include backpacking, canoeing, whitewater kayaking, packrafting, caving, rock climbing, fly fishing, horse-packing, sea kayaking, mountaineering, rafting, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, and wilderness medicine. NOLS has trained more than 280,000 students. Academic credit is available for all courses, through either the University of Utah, Western State Colorado University, or Central Wyoming College. NOLS also has direct credit agreements with many colleges and universities. NOLS is headquartered in Lander, Wyoming.\n\nNOLS was founded in 1965 by Paul Petzoldt, a world-famous mountaineer and a member of the Army's 10th Mountain Division, with the backing of three affluent Lander residents (Ed Breece, legislator and Petzoldt's brother-in-law; Jack Nicholas, legislator; and William Ericson, physician). Breece, Nicholas, and Ericson formed the nucleus of the early board of trustees. Petzoldt was also an early Outward Bound Chief Instructor, and he wanted to establish a school which promoted concentrating on refining outdoor leadership skills.\n\nThe first facility opened in 1965 in Lander, Wyoming at Sinks Canyon. June 8, 1965 marks the date of the founding and the first trip beginning at the trailhead of Hidden Valley Ranch where 100 male students went into the Wind River Range. In the beginning, NOLS struggled with finances to provide necessities for outdoor trips, so Petzoldt and his early team developed the “uniform” made of Salvation Army donations. The school began to grow in the early years and in 1966, women were allowed to enroll. In 1967, the Adventure Courses began for young boys aged 13–15.\n\nIn 1971, the administrative offices were moved to downtown Lander, Wyoming, where NOLS is still based today. NOLS has facilities in Alaska, Washington, Arizona, Utah, New York, Idaho, Chile, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Yukon Territory, Tanzania, Scandinavia, and India. It also runs wilderness medicine courses in a variety of other locations around the world.\n\nNOLS grew enormously during the 1970s, due to the publicity gained by an appearance on NBC's \"Alcoa Hour\". The episode, titled \"30 Days to Survival,\" followed a NOLS course as they traveled through the Wind River Range. The school's focus became more ecological; conservation and preservation began to rank with leadership training in terms of emphasis. As a result of the airing, the school’s enrollment grew from 250 students in 1969 to over 750 in 1970. The school also gained publicity in December 1969 from the Life magazine article, “Last Mountain Man? Not If He Can Help It,\" which featured the school and Paul Petzoldt. The school's growth continued; by the end of 1976, NOLS had 40 instructors and from 1976 to 1977, had enrolled 1,523 students.\n\nDuring the 1980s, NOLS continued to evolve. NOLS partnered with the University of Utah to offer college credit for courses, and helped create the U.S. Leave No Trace program. In 1989, NOLS adopted an outcome-based education model. In 1999, NOLS acquired the Wilderness Medicine Institute, one of the nation's foremost trainers of wilderness medicine. NOLS also began to offer professional training to corporate and institutional clients, including NASA.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the crew of the space shuttle Columbia completed a 12-day, 50-mile expedition in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming with NOLS Professional Training. These same seven crewmembers were the crew on the space shuttle Columbia that broke up upon returning to Earth on February 1, 2003. When on the course, the crewmembers commented on the group cohesion the course helped them develop, as well as the similarities to space flight: “we spent a whole lot of time together as a team solving problems without any other outside influences, which is similar to the way that it will be in space,” said crewmember Laurel Clark. NOLS has continued to train NASA astronauts.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, NOLS designed, developed, and led Expedition Denali, the first team of African Americans to attempt to climb Denali (Mt. McKinley), the United States’ highest peak at 20,320 feet. The summit attempt was not successful due to weather conditions, but the outreach work that NOLS and Expedition Denali members did before and after the expedition expanded the awareness of organizations and individuals about people of color engaging in the outdoors and in providing youth of color with role models to pursue their own outdoor interests. A film, An American Ascent, was made throughout the expedition and has been shown in film festivals and schools around the country as well as the White House on July 3, 2015. Author James Edward Mills wrote The Adventure Gap, a book chronicling the expedition as well as the history of African Americans in the outdoors in the United States.\n\nThe Leave No Trace National Program began in the 1960s as the USDA Forest Service looked for ways to help people take care of the public lands they were visiting in increasing numbers. In the early 1990s NOLS partnered with the Forest Service on the program. 1994 marks the founding of the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a non-profit organization.\n\nThe Principles of Leave No Trace concern minimizing the social and environmental impacts which have led to ecological degradation. The program serves as an education tool to provide guidance for how to behave while camping in the backcountry. The seven principles are: \n\nFounded by Melissa Gray and Buck Tilton in Pitkin, Colorado in 1990, the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) was purchased by NOLS in 1999. Now known as NOLS Wilderness Medicine, it is one of the leading wilderness medicine training organizations in both the United States and internationally.\n\nThe school maintained its headquarters in Pitkin, Colorado until the summer of 2002, at which point the offices and administrative staff moved to Lander, WY and into the newly finished NOLS international headquarters. In January 2007, WMI entered into a partnership with Landmark Learning of Cullowhee, NC in order to provide wilderness medicine courses in the American southeast. Then, in 2010 WMI entered into a partnership with REI, Inc. to offer wilderness medicine courses through the REI Outdoor School. In addition, more than 350 organizations sponsor courses each year. \n\nNOLS WIlderness Medicine provides Wilderness First Aid (WFA), Wilderness Advanced First Aid (WAFA), Wilderness First Responder (WFR), Wilderness Upgrade for Medical Professionals (WUMP), Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician (WEMT), Wilderness Medicine for the Professional Practitioner (WMPP), Wilderness First Responder Recertification (WFRR) and Hybrid Wilderness First Responder Recertification (HWRR) courses. NOLS Wilderness Medicine also provides a Wilderness Medicine and Rescue semester, custom courses, courses for medical students and physicians, and combination courses in conjunction with NOLS Custom Education and NOLS Expeditions. NOLS Wilderness Medicine runs over 950 courses each year and educated 21,935 students in 2017. It is the largest provider of pre-hospital wilderness medicine training in the world.\n\nLeadership education is the hallmark of NOLS' curriculum. NOLS uses four roles and seven skills as a framework to define ideal leadership characteristics. The curriculum's goal is to push students to use leadership skills and teamwork to rise up to challenges faced while on remote, backcountry excursions. The four roles of leadership are: designated leadership, active followership, peer leadership, and self leadership. The seven skills of leadership are: expedition behavior, vision and action, communication, judgement and decision-making, self-awareness, tolerance for adversity, and competence.\n\nExpedition behavior refers to having a positive attitude, respect for others, an awareness of the needs of other group members, and a willingness to place group needs above individual ones. NOLS teaches that it is only through good expedition behavior that groups can successfully collaborate to achieve goals that would be impossible for an individual to achieve on his or her own. All NOLS courses rely on expedition behavior as the underlying basis for successful cooperation.\n\nCompetence is the mastering of wilderness skills and potential for personal growth and to gain more knowledge. Communication involves effectively communicating interpersonally and with the group on both verbal and nonverbal levels. Judgment and decision-making involve making decisions that benefit the group, given unique circumstances, both externally and internally to the group. Tolerance for adversity and uncertainty refers to being flexible to various challenges, and being able to respond in a calm, concise, effective manner. Leadership should keep the positive attitude and work through the issues in a responsible manner. Self-awareness is defined as the skill to realize, interpret, and respond to one's own personal needs, as well as recognizing strengths and weaknesses, and compensating for them accordingly. This skill is imperative in the backcountry because it empowers the individual to take responsibility for his or her health. Taking care of their safety and health is important to being able to function properly and making strong decisions. Vision and action refers to having the initiative to lead a group and seeing the possibilities for moving the group toward a goal.\n\nSkills taught on NOLS courses include backpacking, canoeing, caving, climbing, fly-fishing, horsepacking, mountaineering, rafting, river kayaking, sailing, sea kayaking, skiing, snowboarding, etc. Students gain insight into how to choose equipment, clothing, and how to feed themselves in the outdoors. They learn that proper hygiene is essential to prevent illnesses. Leave No Trace principles show students how to travel in the outdoors with minimum impact.\n\nThroughout the courses students learn about Leave No Trace principles and practice them. Students gain insight into the history of their location by reading about and discussing the plants, animals, geology, etc. of their surroundings. Students delve into the environmental issues around the area and humans' environmental ethics regarding the topics.\n\nRisk management is a part of the curriculum and plays a large role in how the school approaches new course areas and course types. In the field, risk management revolves around self-care, preventing injury, and handling risky situations. Students learn about proper foot care and body temperature regulation. Judgment and group decision making is taught through experience leading daily travel and through targeted classes. Classes include a framework for classifying objective and subjective risks encountered in the wilderness with an emphasis on making thoughtful decisions. Emergency procedures are put into place and taught to all students in case a student or staff member is injured or lost.\n\nAdditionally NOLS, along with Outward Bound USA and the Student Conservation Association, sponsors the Wilderness Risk Management Conference.\n\nNSHSS (National Society of High School Scholars) and NOLS team together to encourage members of NSHSS to pursue leadership development. NOLS is the premier teacher of outdoor skills and leadership, offering courses in the world's most spectacular wilderness settings. NSHSS members receive an automatic $150 partial scholarship for NOLS summer courses as well as a program application fee waiver in recognition of the academic and leadership contributions they already make at their schools and in their communities.\n\nNOLS partners with the University of Utah's department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism in order for NOLS students to receive college credit through the University of Utah on NOLS courses.\n\n\n"}

It includes an academic component in fall semester, travel, and a community service component in spring semester. It is associated with Conservative Judaism.\n\nThe program had a record enrollment of 106 participants in 2007, which was prior to the recent recession in the United States. This came at a time of increased enrollment for several gap year programs in Israel, which was attributed by Keith Berman of Young Judaea's Year Course to calm in Israel. Others cited growth in financial aid, and growing acceptance of gap years in general in North America.\n\nNativ numbers fell 30% with the North American recession in 2008–2009 along with other gap year programs, but recovered in 2009–2010 from 80 to 95 students. David Keren of United Synagogue Youth said that people were getting used to the financial crisis and that Nativ conducted aggressive marketing.\n\nEach student who goes on Nativ gets to choose from different options for their academic semester (fall) and community service semester (spring). All participants are based in Jerusalem, near the city center, during the first semester, their options include: attending the Rothberg International School at Hebrew University of Jerusalem on Mount Scopus, learning at the Conservative Yeshiva, or taking Ulpan classes in the broader Jerusalem community. For the spring semester Naitv-ers have traditionally been able to choose from either a kibbutz or city track. For many years Kibbutz Saad, and then Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, hosted Nativ participants for the spring semester. Recently, due to security issues with the kibbutz's location close to the border with Gaza, the kibbutz option has been moved to Kfar Hasidim a youth village in the north of Israel near Haifa. Another option for participants is to move into a developing community in either Yeruham or Karmiel and volunteer within the community there. Possible service options are teaching English in local high schools and yeshivot, joining the Magen David Adom ambulance corps, volunteering in kindergartens and preschools, as well as other opportunities that might change year to year.\n\n\n"}

Preschool programs, which are less formal and usually not mandated by law, are generally not considered part of primary education. The first year of primary education is commonly referred to as \"kindergarten\" and begins at or around age 5 or 6. Subsequent years are usually numbered being referred to as \"first grade\", \"second grade\", and so forth. Elementary schools normally continue through sixth grade, which the students normally complete when they are age 11 or 12. Some elementary schools graduate after the 4th or 5th grade and transition students into a middle school.\n\nIn 2001, there were 92,858 elementary schools (68,173 public, 24,685 private) in the United States.\n\nSome private schools, and some public schools, are offering pre-kindergarten (also known as pre-K) as part of elementary school. The first three to five years of an individual’s life can be the most critical period of their education(nursery school). During this time period young minds work on several physical, intellectual, and emotional developments, including curiosity, formation of character, personality, cognition, language skills, and social skills.\n\nSince 1965, the federal government has promoted the growth of state-funded programs such as Head Start, a program under the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 2007, it served over 22 million preschool-aged children and their families. Head Start works to educate the whole child in addition to providing health and nutrition services to low-income families.\n\nStudents may attend either a 5-year 6-year or 7-year public or private elementary school. Elementary school usually runs from kindergarten or 1st grade through either 5th or 6th, depending on the region. Upon successful completion of their elementary education students then proceed to middle school, (High School in the UK) also known as junior high school. Depending on the school district, some students attend separate middle schools, beginning at 6th grade and then completing at 8th grade before they transition to high school. Additionally, students may have the option of attending elementary schools that include all eight primary grades. In this case, the student will directly proceed to High School.\n\nIn most U.S. elementary schools, students have all their core classes from one or two homeroom teachers (as opposed to middle and high schools that typically have students rotate from one specialized teacher to the next throughout the day). In some elementary schools, when funding and supplies are adequate, additional teachers are hired to instruct students in areas such as art and music.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of Arthur Reekie and Jane Reekie and was the youngest of eight siblings. She attended the Bronte Villas School and then Gravesend Country School for Girls.\n\nWhile working in the nursery at Cadby Hall during World War II, Reekie visited the Greek Embassy and watched a film shown by the Red Cross detailing the wartime conditions and deprivation in Europe, and the need for relief workers. While continuing to work, Reekie trained with the Red Cross to work overseas with refugees.\n\nAs a British nurse and childcare specialist who trained with the Red Cross, in 1945 Reekie sailed with a group of other workers to Belgium.

Reekie worked at the Welfare Centre in the Sialkot district of Karachi, where training was given to local midwives and clinics were organised for mothers and babies. \n\nReekie visited villages on foot helping women in many practical ways such as delivering relief food and clothing, and promoting and supervising women's sewing; defending their work against the traditional views of men and missionary wives.\n\nIn 1968 Reekie returned to Scotland and was appointed by the Home Board of the Church of Scotland to work three days a week in Glasgow with displaced people and those in need. Suitable accommodation was required as a safe place for the refugees. Originally Reekie used her own tenement flat and in 1972 the Church of Scotland bought a flat at 20 Glasgow Street which became known as the International Flat where refugees, immigrants and their families were welcomed. \n\nOn 28 September 1982 Reekie died after suffering from cancer.\n"}

{"id": "5426552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5426552", "title": "Student–teacher ratio", "text": "Student–teacher ratio\n\nStudent–teacher ratio or student–faculty ratio is the number of students who attend a school or university divided by the number of teachers in the institution. For example, a student–teacher ratio of 10:1 indicates that there are 10 students for every one teacher. The term can also be reversed to create a teacher–student ratio.\n\nThe ratio is often used as a proxy for class size, although various factors can lead to class size varying independently of student–teacher ratio (and vice versa). In most cases, the student–teacher ratio will be significantly lower than the average class size.\n\nStudent–teacher ratios vary widely among developed countries. In primary education, the average student–teacher ratio among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is just below 16, but ranges from 40 in Brazil to 28 in Mexico to 11 in Hungary and Luxembourg.\n\nFactors that can affect the relationship between student–teacher ratio and class size include the number of teachers with non-teaching duties, the number of classes per teacher, and the number of teachers per class. In addition, if there are small classes for a small number of students, for example for special education or second language learners, the student–teacher ratio for the institution will be misleadingly low relative to the average student's experience.\n\nAn example of this variation is that both Israel and the United States have an average student–faculty ratio of 15, but the average class size is 21 in the United States but 27 in Israel.\n\nA low student–teacher ratio is often used as a selling point to those choosing schools for tertiary education. On the other hand, high student–teacher ratio is often cited for criticizing proportionately underfunded schools or school systems, or as evidence of the need for legislative change or more funding for education.\n\nIn the United States, some states have enacted legislation mandating a maximum student–teacher ratio for specific grade levels, particularly kindergarten. When such figures are stated for schools, they often represent averages (means) and thus are vulnerable to skewing. For example, figures may be biased as follows: if one classroom has a 30:1 ratio and another has a 10:1 ratio, the school could thus claim to have a 20:1 ratio overall. In schools, such ratios are indicative of possible staff changes. If the student–teacher ratio is 50:1, the school will probably consider hiring a few teachers. If the ratio is very low, classes could be combined and teachers fired. In extreme cases, the school may close, due to its apparent redundancy.\n\nClasses with too many students are often disrupting to education. Also, too many students in a class results in a diverse field of students, with varying degrees of learning ability. Consequently, the class will spend time for less academic students to assimilate the information, when that time could be better spent progressing through the curriculum. In this way, student–teacher ratios are compelling arguments for advanced or honors classes.\n\nNumerous sources argue that lower student–teacher ratios are better at teaching students complex subjects, such as physics, mathematics and chemistry, than those with a higher ratio of students to teachers. Commonly, the schools with lower student–teacher ratios are more exclusive, have a higher attendance of whites and are in non-inner urban areas and/or fee-paying (non-government) institutions.\n\nThe manifold arguments and controversies of funding and student–teacher ratios have been the basis for a multitude of studies and debates. One view is illustrated below:\n\nSmaller classes are widely believed to benefit all pupils because of individual attention from teachers, and low-attaining pupils are seen to benefit more at the secondary school level, where the content level is more challenging. Pupils in large classes drift off task because of too much instruction from the teacher to the whole class instead of individual attention, and low-attaining students are most affected. Students benefit in later grades from being in small classes during early grades. Longer periods in small classes resulted in more increases in achievement in later grades for all students. In reading and science, low achievers benefit more from being in small classes. The benefits of small class sizes reduce the student achievement gap in reading and science in later grades. In contrast, in East Asian countries like Japan, larger class sizes are valued for the opportunities they give children to rub shoulders and socialize in the group, especially at the lower levels, and particularly preschool.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40846275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40846275", "title": "Technothlon", "text": "Technothlon\n\nTechnothlon is an international school championship organized by the students of IIT Guwahati. Technothlon began in 2004 with an aim to ‘Inspire Young Minds’. Starting on its journey with a participation of 200 students confined to the city of Guwahati, over the next 12 years Technothlon has expanded its reach to over 300 cities all over India and various centers abroad.\n\nThe contest is organized over 2 rounds: a written preliminary examination, Prelims (which takes place in numerous schools all over India in July) and Mains - which is conducted at IIT Guwahati, among the top 100 students from each IX-X(Junior Squad) and XI-XII(Hauts Squad) class students. It is a team-based event -- two students participate as a team, attempting the paper together and also participate in the Mains event as a team.\n\nThrough a series of events involving mental aptitude, logic, and dexterity, it seeks to provide school students a platform to build fundamental experience and knowledge, to exercise co-ordination skills, and to think out of the box. As its preliminary round is conducted through several centers in India, it is a competitive test of critical thinking. Its final round is conducted in IIT-Guwahati during Techniche, the annual Techno-Management festival of IIT Guwahati.\n\nTechnothlon 2004 - started from a small room in the campus of IIT Guwahati with a participation of 200.\n\nTechnothlon 2005 - took its first step forward; Science Exhibitions are conducted in Local Schools of Guwahati. Participation increased to 350.\n\nTechnothlon 2006 covers the seven sisters. Participation went over 700.\n\nTechnothlon 2007 reached Hyderabad. Participation reached the three figures.\n\nTechnothlon 2008 became National. Participation reached four figures.\n\nIt was this year which has witnessed a manifold increase in the reach of Technothlon 2009 with tie-up with nearly 1000 KV schools. Over 60 nationwide media articles were published and it was conducted in 50+ centers all over India.\n\nTechnothlon 2010 went International. For the first time Technothlon was conducted abroad in the cities of Singapore and Dubai. Moreover, Technothlon also reached another milestone at the National level with the tie up with nearly 600 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas. This time the exam was held in 75+ cities across the country.\n\nIn 2011, the participation increased to around 120 cities and was held in about 150 centers. Rajendra K. Pachauri – Nobel Laureate, Nobel Peace Prize 2007 & Chairman of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change impressed the participants of the Mains round with his lectures in Technothlon 2011.\n\nIt was witnessed by nearly 150 cities and around 200 centers, which included almost all the big states of India. Dr. Udaya Kumar, the maker of the Rupee symbol graced the event as the chief guest and also as a judge for \"Final Showdown\", Hauts during Techniche. Technothlon 2012 also witnessed an amazing lecture especially for Technothlon students by George Kourounis, Storm Chaser and host of television series Angry Planet. International students from Moscow and Kathmandu also participated in 2012.\n\nTechnothlon 2013 amplified its reach manifold by collaborating with nearly 100 private schools for the first time in its history. Being conducted in nearly 200 centers, Technothlon expanded its reach to around 20 states at the National level along with being conducted successfully at the international level as well in Kathmandu. During Mains, the participants were introduced to the very new and mystical world of Astronomy by the renowned Kepler Mission Manager at NASA Ames Research Center, Roger Hunter. Not only this, the students alsogot a chance to attend an exciting workshop on Humanoids by A-Set. Dr. Gautam Barua, Former Director (2003–2013), IIT Guwahati motivated the participants during the crucial nerve-racking hours of Final Showdown, Hauts.\n\nTechnothlon 2014 expanded its reach to a whooping 200 cities, with almost 300 centres across India, making it the largest Technothlon then. And also, for the first time, the examination was also conducted with the question paper printed in Hindi. Technothlon also launched its own initiative - LED (Learn Experience Discover) - which involved the Technothlon organizers reaching out to the under-privileged students and demonstrating small science experiments, thus taking a step in introducing scientific temperament in the children. The top 50 teams, who made it to IIT Guwahati for the Mains got an amazing opportunity to interact with Christer Fuglesang, Swedish physicist and ESA Astronaut, during which he shared with the participants the dazzling experiences of the space.\n\nTechnothlon 2015 got even bigger and better, thanks to tie up with Kendriya Vidyalayas & Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, bringing in huge participation, and which helped widening the reach quite remote places of the country (Eg. Naxalite affected Dantewada, Chhattisgarh) bringing in participation of 12000 students from these KVs and JNVs. The reach expanded to 350 examination centers across 250 cities in the country. Technothlon also launched its own blog, on which it followed some of the behind-the-scenes activity of the Technothlon team as well as an informative blog. And the highlight was a tie-up with UNICEF in inspiring young minds. During the Mains, the participants interacted with Claude Nicollier, Swiss ESA and Professor at EPFL.\n\nTechnothlon is conducted for students of class IX to XII. There are two squads for which the examination is held. The first is the Junior squad and the second is the Hauts squad. For a student to appear in the Junior squad examination, he/she must be VIII class passed and must not have appeared for the X boards i.e. The students should be studying in IX or X STD. For a student to be appearing for the Hauts squad examination, he/she must have passed the X board examination and not appeared for the XII board examination.\nThe members can belong to the same class or as well as different class. For example: a team consisting of one member from class IX and one of class X is perfectly acceptable. \nThe basic requirements for team formation is that they should consist of exactly two members from the same squad and the same school.\n\nThe interested students can register themselves for the examination online or offline. Technothlon is conducted over various cities and centers with the help of city representatives. The city representatives are responsible for collecting the registrations offline. Participating schools can collect the registration fees themselves and then prepare a demand draft to be handed over to the city representatives.\n\nStudents participate in teams of two. There are two squads:\nTechnothlon is held in two stages:\n\nPrelims is in general an objective written exam. It involves no syllabus or general knowledge requirement and relies solely on the student’s logical and analytic thinking abilities. The exam is generally of 2 and ½ hour length. The question paper will have various sections like maths, puzzles, code crunchers etc. Each section has its own unique marking scheme.\nIt is held nationwide, at selected cities on the 3rd Sunday of the month of July.\n\nMains is an event based competition. The selected teams compete against each other of the same squad to complete the events. Each team will have to face 3 events from which top 5 teams from each squad will be selected for the Final Showdown. The events, like Prelims, do not require any prerequisite knowledge and students will be taught any extra knowledge they require. The events will vary every year. In addition to these, students can attend the workshops and fun events to spend the night.\nMains is conducted during \"Techniche\", the Techno-Management Festival of IIT Guwahati, held during the first week of September. Other than events, the students can witness the competitions of Techniche, attend the Lecture Series of famous personalities and watch laser shows and Nite performances.\n\nTechnopedia is the online module of Technothlon providing the participants an exclusive experience before they give the preliminary exam, with monthly quizzes and the various articles which are added to the module regularly. It aims at increasing the thinking capabilities and analytical reasoning and also helping them prepare for Prelims. Technopedia generally consists of 10 questions divided into 10 levels. A higher level gets unlocked only after answering the questions in the preceding level correctly. It is updated on a monthly basis for about 6 months before the preliminary examination of Technothlon. Only the students who have registered for prelims may log onto Technopedia using the provided ID and password. Participants who are consistent in clearing Technopedia monthly may expect a SURPRISE gift during Techniche.\n\nTechno Coup D'œil is a series of questions published on the official Facebook page of Technothlon, giving the followers of the page a feel of what the actual paper might be like.\n\n\nOther than the top 50 participants which are selected for mains in each squad; the next 200 participants in both the squads are awarded Silver certificates from Techniche, IIT Guwahati. All the participants of the Mains will be served with accommodation for the four days during their stay at IIT Guwahati. All the teams attending the Mains events at IITG will also be given Gold certificates from Techniche, IITG. \n\nTechnothlon and Techniche, being non-profit organizations charge only an amount of Rs. 150 per team (of two students) as registration fees for the Prelims Examination conducted all over India which covers the examination conduction expenses.\n\n17. Mass participation of students all over India in technothlon 2017. Nearly 68k teams went on participanting. Even IIT Guwahati was not ready for such response\n"}

Primary funding for DO-IT and its projects is provided by the National Science Foundation, the State of Washington, and the U.S. Department of Education.\nIt promotes accessibility and universal design in learning environments and instruction, including Web accessibility, through the online Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) and by creating, collecting and distributing publications, training materials, and tutorials for use by educators and faculty throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Center works with international institutions and organizations to adapt its practices and programs for international application. For example, the DO-IT Scholars Program has been replicated in Japan as DO-IT Japan, a summer program hosted by the University of Tokyo. South Korea, through the leadership of Seoul National University and Korea Nazarene University, also hosts a similar summer study program in collaboration with the DO-IT Center.\n\nThe DO-IT Center was founded at the University of Washington in 1992 by Dr. Sheryl Burgstahler with a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Since its inception, DO-IT's mission has been to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in postsecondary education and careers at local, regional, national (within the United States) and international levels.\n\nIn 1992, with funding from NSF, DO-IT launched the first DO-IT Scholars Program. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) funded the DO-IT Prof project, which created professional development materials and trained faculty and academic administrators in the U.S. to more fully include students with disabilities in their courses. In 2005, OPE and the NSF funded DO-IT’s AccessCollege project. AccessCollege staff worked with a team of faculty and administrators representing twenty-three two- and four-year institutions in the U.S.; the project included creation of the web-based Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE), publication of the book \"Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice\", and the training manual \"Building Capacity for a Welcoming and Accessible Postsecondary Institution\".\n\nIn 2006, with funding from the NSF, the DO-IT Center partnered with University of Washington's Department of Computer Science and Engineering to launch the AccessComputing Alliance, a nationwide program to increase the participation of people with disabilities in computing fields. In 2006, AccessComputing partners included Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., Microsoft, the NSF Regional Alliances for Persons with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (hosted by the University of Southern Maine, New Mexico State University and University of Washington), and American Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing. As of 2013, 32 postsecondary institutions and organizations are partnered with AccessComputing.\nThe program provides summer research programs and internships open to all U.S. students.\n\nThe DO-IT Center's programs are centered on the concept of identifying the \"critical junctures\" students with disabilities face on their path to postsecondary education and careers, and providing resources, projects and programs to help students successfully navigate these critical junctures (e.g., projects to develop STEM interests in students with disabilities at the \"critical juncture\" between high school and the transition to a four- or two-year postsecondary institution).

{"id": "56320669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56320669", "title": "Two Point Hospital", "text": "Two Point Hospital\n\nTwo Point Hospital is a 2018 business simulation game developed by Two Point Studios and published by Sega for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows. A spiritual successor to Bullfrog Productions' 1997 game \"Theme Hospital\", \"Two Point Hospital\" puts players in the role of a hospital administrator tasked with constructing and operating a hospital (and, by extension, an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, where the game is set) with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of \"Theme Hospital\", including Mark Webley and Gary Carr. They made use of their expertise in developing games such as \"Theme Hospital\" and \"Black & White\" and wanted players to be confident in using the menus. The use of humour was deemed important because visiting real hospitals is unpopular.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" was released to a positive reception from critics, who acclaimed it for its style, humour and its faithfulness to \"Theme Hospital\"'s aesthetics, but the game was criticised for its repetitiveness and lack of challenge.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" offers a similar style of gameplay to that of \"Theme Hospital\". Players take on the role of a hospital manager charged with constructing and maintaining a hospital; tasks include building rooms and amenities that cater for patients and staff (such as toilets, staffrooms, reception desks, cafés, and seating), expanding the hospital into new plots, the hiring and management of doctors, nurses, janitors, and assistants to maintain the hospital; and dealing with a variety of comical illnesses. \"Two Point Hospital\" features unique, comical conditions, including \"Light-Headedness\" (having a light bulb for a head), \"Pandemic\" (having a pan on one's head), \"Mock Star\" (patients are Freddie Mercury impersonators), \"Cubism\", and \"Animal Magnetism\" (having animals stuck to the patient's body; the latter disease was planned for \"Theme Hospital\" but was cut.). Like \"Theme Hospital\", hospitals start out empty.\n\nPatients' diagnosis begins in a GP's Office before they are sent for further diagnosis in other rooms, and eventually treatment. From time to time, emergencies (an influx of patients with a specific disease) can occur. The hospital has a reputation rating (affected by how well it is doing) that affects the chances of new patients coming. Every game year, there is an awards ceremony in which the player is awarded performance-based rewards. There are 15 hospitals within in Two Point County, the game's setting.\n\nThe game features modifications to \"Theme Hospital\"s gameplay - while rooms are square or rectangular, they can be expanded with individual additional plots; staff have personalities that affect their work and specialisations; expansion of the hospital onto new plots requires the player to wait for a fixed time before they can build rooms in the new wings; patients will require players to tend to their needs such as hunger and entertainment by establishing amenities such as vending machines, magazine racks, telephones, and plants; the completion of challenges and other tasks awards \"Kudosh\", a currency that can be used to unlock new items that can be placed within rooms and corridors. Training is more complex than in \"Theme Hospital\"; all staff (not just doctors) can learn and receive qualifications that grant them new skills or improve their ability in a certain department. For example, the General Practitioner skill improves a doctor's skill in the GP's Office. Assistants can run marketing programmes to attract patients with a certain illness or staff with certain skills. When patients die, they sometimes become ghosts, which disrupt the hospital by terrorising patients and staff. Only janitors with the Ghost Capture skill can remove them. New rooms and machine upgrades can be researched in the Research room, and unlike \"Theme Hospital\", researched rooms and upgrades are available throughout the empire (they do not have to be re-researched in each hospital). Machines upgrades are performed by trained janitors.\n\nElements new to the game include Star Ratings, Hospital Levels, and room prestige. Each hospital has a set of objectives, including the curing of a set number of patients, an increase of the hospital's value, the earning of a fixed sum of money, and an increase of the hospital's level that eventually increases the hospital's Star Rating. The achievement of a one-star rating allows players to progress to the next hospital, though they may continue building up their current hospital by completing additional objectives to increase the rating to two or three stars. If the player moves on, (s)he can return to the hospital at anytime. Once a three-star rating is awarded, players can continue running the current hospital. Hospital Levels are determined by the number of rooms and staff members a hospital has – increasing the level unlocks more skilled staff to hire. A room's prestige is affected by its size and ornamentation, and the higher a room's prestige level, the happier staff are inside it.\n\nThe game features online leaderboards, and co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. An updated released in October 2018 also added a sandbox mode.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" is a spiritual sequel to \"Theme Hospital\", a 1997 simulation game developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts. Among those involved in the development of both games were \"Theme Hospital\"s producer Mark Webley, its lead artist Gary Carr, and its lead composer Russell Shaw. \"Theme Hospital\" followed \"Theme Park\", also developed by Bullfrog, and there had been plans to expand the range of \"Theme\" simulation games. Near the time of \"Theme Hospital\"s release, Electronic Arts began exerting more control over the products made by Bullfrog, leading to the departure of Webley and Peter Molyneux who co-founded Lionhead Studios, and Carr who joined Mucky Foot Productions, and the expansion of Bullfrog's \"Theme\" series never happened.\n\nAfter they left Bullfrog, Webley and Carr continued to discuss a follow-up to \"Theme Hospital\". Their first attempt was \"ER Tycoon\", which was planned during Carr's time at Mucky Foot Productions but was cancelled because they could not find a publisher for the game. Mucky Foot closed in 2003 and Carr joined Lionhead; however, ongoing projects did not permit the continuation of the \"Theme\" concept. In 2015, Carr left Lionhead, which was closed by Microsoft Game Studios the following year. Webley had left the studio in 2013. They designed to found Two Point Studios to follow up on the \"Theme\" idea. Webley stated, \"Gary and I have been talking about this project for a number of years and are really excited to be announcing Two Point Studios\". \n\nThe timing of a \"Theme Hospital\"-style game was also apt: Art director Mark Smart said making a hospital-simulation game \"felt right\" and that there was \"a lot of love for Theme Hospital\", while studio co-founder and technical director Ben Hymers said players had been wanting a sequel to \"Theme Hospital\" for years. According to Webley and Carr, \"Two Point Hospital\" is a completely new game, rather than a reapplication of new assets to an existing game. Carr said \"I wanted to work on something like Theme Hospital again, appealing to a broader range of people\". The game was developed by envisioning fictional symptoms, often based on word play, and the means for the player to cure them, and determining which ones most attracted the attention of the development team. Webley and Carr also wanted to develop a graphics style that would remain \"future-proof\" relative to changes in graphics rendering technology, and opted to use claymation-like effects, which they found made it easy for players to observe on-screen situations and would not become dated.\n\nOnline features were an early target of the design of \"Two Point Hospital\"; Webley and Carr recognised that players of management games tend to prefer single-player experiences. They designed the online elements of the game to be opt-in and to feature asynchronous gameplay elements, including multiplayer challenges. Players would be tasked with achieving objectives such as curing patients within a set number of months and their scores would be placed on online leaderboards. Players would be able to view their progress compared to that of friends and other players during the challenge from these leaderboards, an approach Webley and Carr took from ghosts that are used in some arcade racing games. \"Theme Hospital\" was recognised as one of the first games with support for mods; Webley and Carr said \"Two Point Hospital\" would feature mod support, which will not be available at launch.\n\nTo produce the game, Webley and Carr considered a few approaches to developing the game before signing with Sega. They originally considered crowdfunding the development through Kickstarter; they spoke to Playtonic Games, which had used Kickstarter to revive a 1990s property \"Banjo-Kazooie\" for \"Yooka-Laylee\". Shortly afterwards, however, they found video game development via Kickstarter was waning and decided this approach was too risky. They also considered taking an early access approach. Hymers suggested they approach Sega as a publisher, which was fortuitous because Sega wanted to expand their profile with games similar to \"Theme Hospital\". While they were in negotiations with Sega, they selected a number of Lionhead Studios developers to help with \"Two Point Hospital\"s development, but Microsoft closed Lionhead in April 2016 before the Sega deal was complete and they had to quickly choose their staff on limited funds, building the team more quickly than they had planned.\n\nAccording to Hymers, the developers used their experience in making games including \"Theme Hospital\", \"Populous\", and \"Black & White\" to make \"Two Point Hospital\", which \"GamesTM\" described as \"engrossing time-vacuum gameplay\". Smart said the team wanted the game to be accessible and not throw players in at the deep end, and that they wanted players to have confidence when examining the sub-menus and realising the level of strategy involved. Smart also said people do not like to visit hospitals and that using humour makes a difference. According to Smart, the ailments were concocted backwards; someone would decide that they wanted something and the team worked from that, or that they worked on them from \"terrible puns\".\n\nHymers said queues of patients and their movement along corridors was difficult to produce because the game is in 3D, which raised questions about wall thickness and cell width. He compared these elements with their counterparts in \"Theme Hospital\" and believed it was much easier in that game, which is 2D with graphics made from sprites, and that people were drawn in front of the walls. He also stated that making people avoid each other was tricky. The game was developed using the Unity engine. A later patch for the game featured character customisation, and a \"copy and paste\" rooms feature.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" was announced on 16 January 2018 in a short YouTube video showing the game's visuals and comedic styling, and depicted a patient suffering from Light Headedness. \"Edge\" compared this disease's role in the game's marketing to that of \"Theme Hospital\"s Bloaty Head, which was described as its \"poster disease\".\n\nThe first public viewing of \"Two Point Hospital\" was held at the PC Gamer weekender on 17 February 2018. The gameplay demo explored the game's user interface and its turning camera, which was not present in \"Theme Hospital\". The game's publisher also announced a potential release date in August 2018. The panel discussed some of the new ailments that would be included in the game, confirming one that changes the patient into a mummy. In a \"GamesTM\" preview, Smart stated that the closest illness in the game is Hurty Leg, which he described as \"almost like somebody in plaster\".\n\nDevelopers Two Point Studios announced in a newsletter that subscribers would receive a \"golden ticket\" that would allow the player to download an in-game \"golden lavatory\". An hour-long gameplay demo that included information about the release was available during E3 2018.\n\nIn July 2018, Steam began accepting pre-orders for the game, which was released on 30 August 2018.\n\nOn 23 October 2018, a Halloween patch was released, which introduced a spookier soundtrack, new DJ lines, a night-time intervention on some levels, and the 'Frightheadedness' disease.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" received critical acclaim. Media review aggregation website Metacritic summarised the game as garnering \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe game received praise for its nostalgia compared with that of \"Theme Hospital\" and its improvements over it. Rachel Weber of \"Games Radar\" was positive about the game's use of nostalgia, stating that the game had \"taken the funny bones\" from the original and transplanted them into \"Two Point Hospital\". Weber also praised other aspects of the game, calling it a \"delight\". Johnny Chiodini of \"EuroGamer\" stated that the game \"stays true to the spirit of its sort-of predecessor\" in \"Theme Hospital\", and that it was a \"modernised successor\". Chiodini also called the game a \"welcome reinvention of a childhood classic\". The game's similarity to \"Theme Hospital\" was also praised by \"Edge\", who said it \"extends beyond its predecessor both in terms of detail and scope\" and that \"Theme Hospital\" had been replaced by \"something better\". \"GamesTM\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital 2.0\" and \"A modern take on a beloved title\", but also believed that it could have distanced itself from it more. Similar compliments about the game's similarities to \"Theme Hospital\" were given by Jeuxvideo.com and James Ide of the \"Daily Mirror\". Even before release, Dominic Tarason of \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital 2 in all but name\". This view was shared by \"Bit-Tech\"s Rick Lane, who described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital\"s \"sequel in all but name\". Jacob Bukacek of \"Hardcore Gamer\" was of the opinion that \"Two Point Hospital\" used \"Theme Hospital\" as a base for improvement and remarked that it \"isn’t Theme Hospital remade; It’s Theme Hospital improved\". \"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves thought that Two Point Studios had done \"a remarkable job reviving Theme Hospital\". \"GamesMaster\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"the perfect cure\" for \"Bullfrog deficiency\" and said it is precisely what \"Theme Hospital\" fans wanted it to be.\n\nCritics also praised the game's humorous content. UK newspaper \"Metro\" regarded the \"amusing script and visual humour\" of \"Two Point Hospital\" as one of its best features, calling it \"endearing\". Nic Rueben of \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" also commented on the game's humour, writing; \"it’s not that any individual element is hilarious – it’s more of an infinite dads pulling infinite crackers sort of scenario. It just feels comfy, goofy and pleasant ...\" \"GamesTM\" believed the humour was taken from Bullfrog and praised its balance, saying the game is not \"trying too hard\" and keeps it light-hearted. Jason Coles of the \"Daily Star\" also liked the game's \"Good sense of humour\" and abundance of puns. James Swinbanks of \"GameSpot\" echoed these sentiments by describing the game's \"British\" sense of humour as the game's \"overwhelming charm\", as did Paul Tamburro of \"Game Revolution\" with his description of the game as \"delightfully lighthearted\", and \"GamesRadar+\"s Rachel Weber's concurrence with Swinbanks about the humour's Britishness. \"Shacknews\"'s Chris Jarrard compared the game's \"outstanding\" radio station to \"SimCity 2000\"s (which he described as \"nonsensical\") news system.\n\nJose Cabrera of \"IGN Spain\" was positive about gameplay but critiqued its lack of challenge (an opinion shared by Tamburro). Cabrera referred to the game as being \"fun and casual\", but was well put together. Cabrera also called the game a \"perfectly balanced simulation\" that is based on the nostalgia of \"Theme Hospital\". TJ Hafer believed \"Two Point Hospital\" \"revitalizes the business management genre\". Fraser Brown of \"PC Gamer\" magazine was positive about the game's release, calling it a \"brilliant management game regardless of nostalgia\". Brown, however, was critical of the game's balance, saying some \"missions bleed together\" and only a few levels are noticeably distinct.\n\nOther criticisms include the game basics being too similar to those of \"Theme Hospital\", repetition, the lack of an ability to copy rooms, and the lack of a sandbox mode.\n\n"}

{"id": "27140072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27140072", "title": "Visionlearning", "text": "Visionlearning\n\nVisionlearning is a free, web-based resource for students and educators in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Geared toward those studying at high school and undergraduate levels, Visionlearning takes advantage of recent advances in new media to provide students and educators with learning and teaching materials. Research by project personnel has shown that this peer-reviewed and bilingual content improves student understanding of science and facilitates multidisciplinary teaching. The project also strives to build community around improving STEM education.\n\nSupported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education, Visionlearning provides educational content that not only explores specific STEM concepts, but examines how we know these things. Project leaders believe that an important facet of succeeding in these disciplines is understanding their respective histories, as well as engaging with the process of discovery.\n\nIn 1998, Dr. Anthony Carpi, an environmental chemist and then-assistant professor at John Jay College of the City University of New York, designed and launched a prototype Internet learning resource for science students, called The Natural Science Pages. This was in part a response to the growing evidence that poor textbook content and deficient teaching materials contribute to inadequate science education. The purpose of the prototype was to see if presenting important course information in a new form would improve what students understood, what information they remembered, and how well they performed in their class overall.\n\nWhat this research showed, through standardized exam scores and student retention data, was that using the prototype significantly improved science comprehension and performance in the targeted natural science course. Further evaluations also showed that the prototype helped improve communication skills and student engagement with the course.\n\nIn response to the success of The Natural Science Pages prototype and with support of the NSF, Carpi developed the Visionlearning project, which brought on a group of scientists and educators to create content and became a website open to students and educators worldwide. In the last decade, Visionlearning has evolved into a more comprehensive website that provides free educational materials to support the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, with translations into Spanish. These materials include independent learning modules that focus on distinct topics within STEM disciplines, teaching resources, a MyClassroom tool (similar to Moodle or WebCT) that allows educators to customize and maintain a virtual learning environment for their students, and new media elements to benefit multiple learning styles. A key feature of all of Visionlearning’s material is an emphasis on the process of science and discovery.\n\nThroughout the development of the learning modules and multimedia tools, Visionlearning has emphasized an importance on teaching science as a process, rather than “a simple set of facts and terms to be memorized.” This comes from an organizational ideology that understanding how scientific knowledge evolves better prepares students to engage with the process of discovery and helps to dispel common misconceptions about science. The underlying notion is that students will develop independent, objective thinking skills regardless of whether they pursue a career in STEM disciplines, and understand that science is far more than simply conducting experiments in a lab and working with complex mathematical formulas.\n\nAs of 2009, Visionlearning has developed 70 independent learning modules in nine subject areas, including biology, chemistry, earth science, and the process of science. Scientist and author Nathan H. Lents has been a longtime contributor and module reviewer for Visionlearning and currently serves as life science editor. Visionlearning modules are organized into concise, relevant topic areas, grouped by discipline. Each module can be used independently, or in conjunction with others, and intentionally concentrates on core concepts to help direct learning. Supplementary materials such as quizzes, links to reviewed sources, and biographies are also provided for additional exploration. These modules are directed toward undergraduate and high school learning and have been written by experts in the relevant disciplines. Every module is peer reviewed for quality and accuracy, and includes historical context and contemporary relevance.\n\nAs part of its dedication to supporting educators, Visionlearning has developed a teaching portal called MyClassroom. Similar to other virtual teaching tools (such as Blackboard, Moodle, and WebCT), MyClassroom allows educators to create a course customized to their needs. They are able to add learning modules from Visionlearning’s library into their classroom, annotate any of these modules, and create their own modules for access by students enrolled in the course. Having this material accessible to students via the Internet allows for 24-hour access to the learning materials, without cost, and aids Spanish bi-lingual students with translations.\n\nAs Visionlearning has expanded over the years, the project has embraced and integrated new media with the use of flash animations, simulations, high resolution graphics, and more recently iPod apps. To further embrace developments in technology and become more ADA compliant, the site administrators are developing additional media resources for users, such as podcasts and scripts for animations. Like many corporations today, they are also exploring the use of blogs and social networking sites, such as Facebook, to build awareness and a user base. In 2017, Visionlearning launched a podcast entitled \"This World of Humans,\" hosted by Nathan H. Lents. This podcast focuses on new research in biology and social science and includes teaching guides on the podcast website to help science educators incorporate the podcast and its featured research articles into their classrooms.\n\nVisionlearning does not subscribe to any political party or affiliation. The project is dedicated to providing impartial information in the STEM disciplines and encouraging learning in the process of science. One important goal of the project is to provide an understanding of scientific concepts while emphasizing how the scientific community has arrived at these conclusions. The intention is that, through teaching about the process of scientific discovery, students will look at science not as factual elements, but as a way of knowing about the world.\n\nThe project does not subscribe to the belief that the Internet and new media are replacing more traditional forms or communication, but that through proper integration of all the technology available students will have a greater chance of success in STEM learning.\n"}
