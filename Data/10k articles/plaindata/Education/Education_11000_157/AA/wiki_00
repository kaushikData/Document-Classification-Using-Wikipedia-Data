The platform covers academic classes from classes 1 to 12 covering the entire academic syllabus of the Bangladesh schooling system, university admission subjects covering different branches of study, and skills training.\n\nAyman Sadiq founded 10 Minute School in mid 2014 as an YouTube Channel. Largely self-sponsored in the beginning, 10 Minute School did not initially have a website and solely reached students through educational info graphics. It started creating video tutorials for Mathematics and English and eventually started taking live classes on Facebook. 10 Minute School went on to cover the entire academic syllabus from Class 1 through Class12, university admission subjects covering topics from public and private university examinations and extensive software and skills training.\n\nWhile one of the major challenges for the organization back then was to find a suitable sponsor to fund its operational activities, it later came to be supported by telecom operator Robi Axiata Ltd and the ICT Ministry of Bangladesh.\n\nAs of July 2018, the website produced 4000 video lessons, 100 SmartBooks, 3965 quizzes and 255 live classes.\n"}

The protestors came from all over Ireland – students from most third-level colleges featured, as did some protestors from Queen's University Belfast – with many travelling to the city by coach. It took more than an hour and a half for all the protestors to walk from Parnell Square to Government Buildings in Merrion Street, a short distance.\n\nSome protestors and gardaí engaged in clashes following the protest, with an unidentified number of people being wounded and three gardaí sustaining minor injuries; two arrests were made. The two men who were arrested were in their twenties and charged with criminal damage and a breach of the peace respectively. The Department of Finance was occupied by protestors for a time, and 36 complaints of police brutality were made of which just over half were admitted; these led to a further march by students seven days later with the intention to \"end garda brutality\".\n\nPresseurop wondered the day after thousands of students marched on the streets of Dublin: \"Has Ireland awoken?\" and said the protest had \"Giv[en] the lie to general opinion that the economically stricken nation has taken swingeing austerity measures with passive resignation\". \"Scenes bizarrely similar\" occurred in London one week later.\n\nThe BBC's Ireland Correspondent Mark Simpson noted that most demonstrations in Ireland had been \"angry rather than violent\". One example he alluded to occurred two days before students demonstrated when Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney was successfully pelted with red paint by an opposition politician in a protest intended to highlight the \"blood budget\" which \"will result in the unnecessary and avoidable deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people over the coming years\"; this incident occurred while she was attempting to open a mental healthcare facility in Dublin. But Simpson also wrote that \"It is unlikely that their [students] demonstration will make any difference. [...] They [the Irish government] will be hoping that young people will eventually accept [that Ireland has no money]. After all, most students know what it feels like to be broke\".\n\nAccording to \"The Irish Times\", the protest was \"powerful, uplifting – and very peaceful\". It commenced from Parnell Square at 13:00. T-shirts bearing slogans such as \"Education not Emigration\" were worn by many protestors. Students from Queen's University Belfast joined their counterparts on the streets of Dublin for the protest in return for support given to their own protest at Stormont two days earlier. Forty minutes later, some protestors left the march route at Nassau Street and approached Dáil Éireann's front gates on Kildare Street. Some scaled poles and items were thrown through the gates. March organisers sent them back to the main protest.\n\nSeveral dozen protestors entered the Department of Finance's lobby at 15:00 and commenced occupation. Authorities removed some and barricaded the remainder inside. More students gathered outside the entrance where authorities lined up to separate them from those inside the building, while horses and vans were deployed to split those outside into two. A sit-down protest ensued among those who were outside. Riot police arrived on the scene and authorities removed the rest of the protestors still inside the building, some of whom had \"evidence of a beating on their faces\" (\"The Irish Times\"). Riot police then forced those outside to move backwards, eventually charging at them followed by horses and dogs until they reached the Shelbourne Hotel. A second charge by the authorities forced those in the vicinity back to Anglo Irish Bank.\n\nMany of those left outside the Department of Finance then joined a peaceful sit-down protest which was occurring outside Dáil Éireann. Free Education for Everyone then organised a march to Pearse Street garda station, thought to be the destination of those who had been arrested. They collected there and demanded the release of anyone who had been arrested.\n\nTwo female protesters were reported to have been pulled out of the Department of Finance \"by their ankles\" and one by her hair. One bespectacled male student was trampled upon by a horse. A female was kicked and knocked to the ground by a horse. Another who said she was engaging in a peaceful protest was told by police to \"get the fuck off the street\" before being batoned. A male sitting peacefully on the ground with his hands out was reported to have been \"rammed\" by four garda horses. Blood and facial injuries were a common sight.\n\nAfter viewing video footage of the disorder MEP Joe Higgins said: \"The use of Garda horses and dogs against student protesters in Dublin on Wednesday is an outrageous abuse of the right to protest. The intention was clearly to intimidate peaceful protesters and it is an utter scandal. They should never again be used against protesters\".\n\nThese events led to numerous complaints about police brutality being sent to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). Within days the number of complaints had more than doubled. Video footage taken by witnesses was to be examined.\n\nOn 10 November, hundreds of students marched through Dublin again, this time before the banner \"END GARDA BRUTALITY\". \"The Irish Times\" stated that \"While members of the Socialist Worker Student Society and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement were present at last night’s protest, they made up only a small proportion of the crowd\". Among the protestors was Vanessa O'Sullivan, video footage of whom unconscious was broadcast on YouTube and RTÉ. She told the crowd: \"This day last week I was knocked unconscious by a gárda... All I am guilty of is walking inside a public building and sitting down\".\n\n\n"}

He first went to the University of Tübingen, where he graduated with a Ph.D. in 1853. The results of his work was published in \"Die Juraformation Englands, Frankreichs und des südwestlichen Deutschlands\" (1856–1858). He went to the Palaeontological Museum at Munich in 1858 and became an assistant there. It was in 1860 that he became the Professor of Palaeontology at the University of Munich. Then, a year later, he became the director of the Palaeontological Collection. Of his later works, it can be said that the most important was \"Paläontologische Mittheilungen aus dem Museum des Königlichen Bayerischen Staates\" (1862–1865). He died on 23 December 1865 at the age of 34. The wrinkle ridge Dorsum Oppel on the Moon is named after him, as is the fossil prawn genus \"Albertoppelia\".\n\nOppel devoted his life to the study of fossils and the examination of the strata of the Jurassic period deposits. He is considered to have founded the study of zone stratigraphy and the use of index fossils, a term which he created, to compare the different strata. He also established the Tithonian stage, for strata (mainly equivalent to the English Portland and Purbeck Beds) that occur on the borders of Jurassic and Cretaceous. He was awarded the Chair of Paleontology at the University of Munich.\n\n"}
{"id": "16496406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16496406", "title": "Anti-evolution legislation", "text": "Anti-evolution legislation\n\nA number of anti-evolution bills have been introduced in the United States Congress and State legislatures since 2001. Purporting to support academic freedom, supporters have contended that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection. Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution. An investigation in Florida of the allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred. The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana's Louisiana Science Education Act, which was enacted in 2008.\n\nBased largely upon language drafted by the Discovery Institute, from language originally drafted for the Santorum Amendment, the common goal of these bills has been to expose more students to articles and videos that criticize evolution, most of which have been produced by advocates of intelligent design or Biblical creationism.\n\nIn 2001 former Republican United States Senator Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania proposed an amendment, to the education funding bill which became known as the No Child Left Behind Act, which promoted the teaching of intelligent design while questioning the academic standing of evolution in U.S. public schools. The language of this amendment was crafted in part by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, with Phillip E. Johnson, founding adviser of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, and \"father\" of the intelligent design movement, assisting Santorum in phrasing the amendment. It portrayed evolution as generating \"much continuing controversy\" and being not widely accepted, using the Discovery Institute's Teach The Controversy method.\n\nOn June 14, 2001, the amendment was passed as part of the education funding bill by the Senate on a vote of 91-8. This was hailed as a major victory by proponents of intelligent design; for instance an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence \"Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America ... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending.\"\n\nScientists and educators feared that by singling out biological evolution as very controversial, the amendment could create the impression that a substantial scientific controversy about evolution exists, leading to a lessening of academic rigor in science curricula. A coalition of 96 scientific and educational organizations signed a letter urging that the amendment be stricken from the final bill, which it was, but intelligent design supporters on the conference committee preserved it in the bill's legislative history.\n\nRather than calling for teaching intelligent design or Bible-based creationism (as previous legislative attempts have), the bills make no mention of these subjects. They instead describe evolution as controversial and attempt to bar school administrators from interfering with teachers who describe purported flaws in the theory. This runs contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus, which holds that there is no debate about the core principles of evolution: the only credible, and a thoroughly tested, scientific explanation for the development and diversification of all life on Earth.\n\nTom Hutton, a senior staff lawyer for the National School Boards Association, stated that while state legislators have a legal right to craft laws that affect districts' policies as a general rule, he believes that some decisions are better left to local officials. He further suggested that these proposed bills, if enacted, could face difficult legal challenges. He further stated that despite their language stating that they are not promoting religious views, and wording to promote \"scientific\" rather than religious critiques, courts are likely to question the motives behind these bills, and their specific focus on evolution, and draw a conclusion as to \"what's going on here.\"\n\nMichael Simpson, a lawyer for the National Education Association stated that courts have generally refused to afford significant free-speech protections to teachers for in-class remarks. He further offered the opinion that the legality of these measures would depend on a number of unknowns, such as how the critical views of evolution-critical views were presented, and possibly the degree of congruence between them and other state policies, such as state science curriculum.\n\nA variety of groups, such as the National Center for Science Education and Anti-Defamation League, criticized and are publicly opposed to the \"Academic Freedom bills.\"\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, a series of unsuccessful anti-evolution 'Academic freedom' bills were introduced in the Alabama Legislature.\n\nOn April 8, 2004, the Alabama Senate unanimously passed SB336, the \"Academic Freedom Act.\" The bill would have given teachers at public institutions \"the affirmative right and freedom to present scientific, historical, theoretical, or evidentiary information pertaining to alternative theories or points of view on the subject of origins\" and gives students the right to hold a \"particular position on origins, so long as he or she demonstrates acceptable understanding of course materials.\" Before passage, it was amended so that \"[t]he rights and privileges contained in this act do not apply to the presentation of theoretical information unless it is accompanied by scientific, historical, or evidentiary information.\" On May 17, 2004, the Alabama House adjourned the 2004 legislative session without voting on the bill, allowing it to lapse.\n\nOn February 8, 2005, a pair of virtually identical bills were simultaneously introduced in the Alabama Senate and House (HB352 and SB240), again under the description of \"The Academic Freedom Act.\" These bills purported to protect the right of teachers \"to present scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories\" and the right of students to \"hold positions regarding scientific views\". In an attempt to avert Establishment Clause concerns, the bills both stated that \"[n]othing in this act shall be construed as promoting any religious doctrine, promoting discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs, or promoting discrimination for or against religion or non-religion.\" On April 5, 2005, a third, near-identical bill (also dubbed the \"Academic Freedom Act\") was introduced in the Alabama House (HB 716). On May 3, 2005, the legislative session closed without passing any of these three bills, so that they lapsed.\n\nOn January 10, 2006, another pair of identical anti-evolution bills (HB106 and SB45), closely resembling the previous bills, were introduced in the Alabama legislature, again under the description of \"The Academic Freedom Act\". On April 18, 2006 the Alabama Legislature again adjourned without passing them, again allowing them to lapse.\n\nOn April 24, 2008, David Grimes introduced an 'Academic Freedom' bill (HB 923) into the Alabama House and it was referred to the Education Policy Committee. It died in committee on May 7.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, Grimes introduced another 'Academic Freedom' bill (HB 300) which was again referred to the House Education Policy Committee. It died in committee with the end of the legislative session on May 15.\n\nIn early 2006 Representative Sally Kern introduced an anti-evolution 'Academic Freedom' bill (HB2107) into the Oklahoma House, which passed it by a vote of 77-10 on March 2, 2006. Also in 2006 Senator Daisy Lawler introduced another anti-evolution bill, based upon language in the Santorum Amendment, in the Oklahoma Senate. Both bills (and two further, unrelated, anti-evolution bills) lapsed with the end of the 2006 legislative session.\n\nIn February 2009 a bill titled the 'Scientific Education and Academic Freedom Act' (SB 320) was introduced by Senator Randy Brogdon and died in committee the Oklahoma Senate. The bill is nearly identical to the Act passed in 2008 in Louisiana.\n\nA bill (HB1531) was introduced into the Maryland House of Delegates on February 16, 2006, to enact a \"Teachers Academic Freedom Act\" and a \"Faculty Academic Freedom Act\", that closely resembled the 2006 Alabama bills. The bill lapsed with the end of the 2006 legislative session.\n\nIn January 2007, two identical bills (HB 506 and SB 371) \"relating to public education; providing for school science content standards and rules regarding the teaching of theories of biological origins\" were introduced into the New Mexico Legislature and Senate by Representative W. C. \"Dub\" Williams and Senator Steve Komadina. The bills died with the end of legislative session on March 17, 2007.\n\nIn February 2009, an identical bill was again introduced, this time by Senator Kent L. Cravens in the New Mexico Senate. Although it does not mention the phrase \"academic freedom\", the National Center for Science Education described the bill as \"clearly in the mold of the recent spate of anti-evolution 'academic freedom' bills\". A Public Education Department analysis of the bill found that \"[a]lthough the bill's definition of 'scientific information' excludes information derived from religious or philosophical writings, beliefs or doctrines\", the bill \"goes on to say that scientific information may have religious or philosophical implications and remain scientific in nature\", which led to the conclusion that \"this point would allow the teaching of theories of biological origins such as intelligent design or creationism.\"\n\nOn March 21, 2009, the bill died in committee when the legislature adjourned.\n\nPre-release screenings for legislators of the controversial film \"\", which portrays proponents of intelligent design as being \"persecuted\", have been presented by actor Ben Stein. There were special showings for legislators from Florida and Missouri to promote Academic Freedom bills in those states.\n\nThe Florida showing was at the invitation of that Florida bill's House sponsor, Representative Alan Hays, on March 12, 2008. It was a private screening restricted to legislators, their spouses, and their legislative aides. The press and public were excluded, and when the House general counsel was asked if that was legal under the Florida sunshine law Hays said that it was technically legal as long as they just watched the film without discussing the issue or arranging any future votes. Commenting on this, and the controversy over Roger Moore of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" previously managing to view the film against the wishes of the film company, House Democratic leader Dan Gelber of Miami Beach said, \"It's kind of an irony: The public is expelled from a movie called Expelled.\" The screening was attended by about 100 people, but few were legislators, and the majority of legislators stayed away.\n\nShortly before the film was released on April 18, 2008, the producer of the film, Walt Ruloff, held a press conference on April 15 at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.. Ruloff announced his plans to use the \"Expelled\" film as part of a campaign to pass academic freedom bills in a variety of American states.\n\nOn 29 February 2008, Senator Ronda Storms introduced an Academic Freedom bill (SB2692) in the Florida Senate, which closely resembled both the Discovery Institute model statute and the previous Alabama bills. Its sponsor in the Florida House of Representatives (as HB1483) was Representative Alan Hays, who claimed that the bill was simply drafted to allow teachers and students to discuss \"the full range\" of problems and ideas surrounding Darwin's theory without fear of punishment. Hays and Storms were unable to name any teachers in Florida who have been disciplined for being critical of evolution in the science classroom. Hays said, \"I want a balanced policy. I want students taught how to think, not what to think. There are problems with evolution. Have you ever seen a half-monkey, half human?\"<ref name=\"03/10/2008MiamiHerald\"></ref> DI attorney Casey Luskin's statement at a press conference supporting the bill that, in his personal opinion, Intelligent Design constitutes \"scientific information\" (which the bill explicitly permits) was taken by the Miami Herald as an admission that \"Intelligent Design could more easily be brought up in public-school science classrooms\" under the proposed law.<ref name=\"03/15/2008MiamiHerald\"></ref> The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed concerns that these bills might make it easier to teach intelligent design as science in public schools. The bills were also opposed by Chemistry Nobel Prize-winner Harold Kroto who said, \"it's an abuse of position not to teach science correctly to children\".\n\nThe Senate bill was later amended to define \"scientific information\" as \"germane current facts, data, and peer-reviewed research specific to the topic of chemical and biological evolution as prescribed in Florida's Science Standards.\" Storms refused to answer repeated direct questions from senate Democrats as to whether teachers would be permitted to teach Intelligent design under her bill and whether she believes that intelligent design meets its criteria for 'scientific information'. The bill has also been criticized for its inconsistency in only protecting the freedom of teachers to discuss anti-evolution arguments, but not other controversies (such as birth control and abortion), but when Democrats introduced a proposal to have the bill's protection extended to sex-education Storms had it voted down. The House bill underwent substantial modification and, as amended, requires \"Critical Analysis of Evolution\" to be taught. An attempt by Senator Storms to ease the bill's passage by substituting the heavily amended House version failed to win acceptance in the Senate, leaving two incompatible bills, which died with the end of the legislative session on May 2.\n\nA bill (SB561) named the \"Louisiana Academic Freedom Act,\" was pre-filed on March 21, 2008, in the Louisiana Senate by the Education Committee chair, Ben Nevers, a Bogalusa Democrat. While its name is the same as the Florida, Alabama and Discovery Institute bills, the Louisiana version is modeled on a policy adopted in 2006 by the Ouachita Parish School Board with the backing of the pro-creationism Louisiana Family Forum (LFF). The bill contends that \"the teaching of some scientific subjects, such as biological evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming, and human cloning, can cause controversy, and that some teachers may be unsure of the expectations concerning how they should present information on such subjects,\" and extends permission to Louisiana's teachers to \"help students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course being taught.\"\n\nNevers states that he was asked to sponsor the bill by the LFF. Gene Mills, executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum, stated that a bill is needed that makes it easier for teachers to delve into criticism of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. However in introducing the LFF-suggested bill he also stated that the LFF \"believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory.\" Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State described the bill as \"all about God in biology class\".\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Representative Frank Hoffman, who was the assistant superintendent of the Ouachita Parish school system at the time it adopted the LFF-backed policy, introduced an identical bill into the Louisiana House of Representatives (HB1168). The next day, references to evolution, global warming and other subjects were stripped from the senate bill and replaced with calls for more general changes in science classes, and it was renamed the \"Louisiana Science Education Act\" (and renumbered SB733), and was passed unanimously on April 28, 2008. On June 11, 2008, the House bill was passed by a vote of 94-3. In response, Americans United noted that Louisiana legislators have repeatedly tried to water down the teaching of evolution, with previous attempts having been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and suggest that this legislation \"opens the door to teaching creationism in public schools, an action that is likely to spark litigation\".\n\nOn June 12, 2008, the day after the House bill passed, \"concerned parents, teachers and scientists\" formed Louisiana Coalition for Science, \"[i]n response to numerous attacks on science education in the Bayou State\". Founding members include prominent philosopher and critic of the intelligent design movement Barbara Forrest and veteran biology teacher Patsye Peebles.\n\nIn late June 2008, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal signed the bill into law.\n\nThe legislation has been criticized by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, with the latter calling for its repeal.\n\nConservative commentator John Derbyshire questioned the constitutionality of the law, and its likely effects:\nIn a December 2008 \"Scientific American\" article Glenn Branch and Eugenie Scott stated:\n\nOn April 1, 2008, representative Robert Wayne Cooper introduced a bill to add a \"new section [into state law] relating to teacher academic freedom to teach scientific evidence regarding evolution\" into the Missouri House of Representatives (HB2554). It would require educational authorities to \"endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions, learn about scientific evidence, develop critical thinking skills, and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues, including such subjects as the teaching of biological and chemical evolution\" and forbid them from \"prohibit[ing] any teacher in a public school system of this state from helping students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological or chemical evolution.\" Previously in 2004, Cooper had introduced two unsuccessful bills (HB 911 and HB 1722) that called for equal time for intelligent design in Missouri schools.\n\nThe bill was passed by the House Committee on Elementary and Secondary Education on April 30, 2008, but died when the Missouri legislative session ended on May 16, 2008.\n\nOn February 10, 2009, Representative Robert Wayne Cooper introduced a bill (HB 656) to add a \"new section relating to teacher academic freedom to teach scientific evidence regarding evolution\" to existing legislation. It died, without having been assigned to a committee, with the end of the legislative session on May 15.\n\nOn April 30, 2008, a bill on \"academic freedom to teach evidence regarding controversial scientific subjects\" (HB 6027) was introduced in the Michigan House of Representatives by representative John Moolenaar. On June 3, 2008, an identical bill (SB 1361) was introduced into the Michigan Senate. Both bills later died in committee.\n\nA bill (SB 1386) was introduced in the South Carolina Senate on May 15, 2008 by Senator Michael L. Fair to amend the state's education code to provide:\nThe National Center for Science Education described the bill as \"aimed at undermining the teaching of evolution\".\n\nJim Foster, a spokesman for the state Department of Education, disputed the need for the bill:\nThe bill died in committee when the South Carolina legislature adjourned on June 5, 2008.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, a bill for an \"Evolution Academic Freedom Act\" was introduced into the Iowa Senate, by State Representative Rod Roberts, R-Carroll. More than 200 faculty members at 20 Iowa colleges signed a statement opposing a proposed state law:\n\nGlenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education said that the Iowa statement represented the first organized effort by college faculty members throughout a state to oppose this creationist strategy. It died in committee on March 13, 2009.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26911714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26911714", "title": "Arthur Oldham", "text": "Arthur Oldham\n\nArthur William Oldham OBE (6 September 1926 – 4 May 2003) was an English composer and choirmaster. He founded the Edinburgh Festival Chorus in 1965, the Chorus of the Orchestre de Paris in 1975, and the Concertgebouw Orchestra Chorus in Amsterdam in 1979. He also worked with the Scottish Opera Chorus 1966–74 and directed the London Symphony Chorus 1969–76. For his work with the LSO Chorus, he won three Grammy Awards. He was also a composer, mainly of religious works, but also a ballet and an opera.\n\nArthur Oldham was born in London in 1926. When he was age 14, his mother committed suicide by gassing herself in an oven, and he was brought up in Wallington, at that time in Surrey. He won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where he studied composition under Herbert Howells. He then became Benjamin Britten's only private pupil at Aldeburgh between 1945 and 1951. (He claims that the bar lines on the manuscript of \"Peter Grimes\" were his work.) He and Britten came into conflict over their ideas about choral music, but they later worked together in Edinburgh on Britten's \"Voices for Today\", Op. 75, and the \"War Requiem\". Until 1968 the only published vocal score of Britten's \"The Little Sweep\" was the piano duet and percussion version prepared by Arthur Oldham.\n\nHe was appointed musical director of the Ballet Rambert in 1945, aged only 19. His music first came to public notice in 1946, when his ballet \"Mr Punch\" was performed by the Ballet Rambert at Sadler's Wells, and was included in the Rambert's 1947–48 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Several of his own pieces were heard at early Aldeburgh Festivals. He also composed for the Royal Ballet for a time.\n\nHe arranged Britten's \"Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge\" (a work for string orchestra) for full orchestra, for the ballet \"Le Rêve de Léonor\", choreographed by Frederick Ashton. This had its first performance on 26 April 1949 at the Prince's Theatre, London, by the Ballet de Paris de Roland Petit.\n\nIn 1952, after Edmund Rubbra pulled out of the project, Oldham provided a variation for \"Variations on an Elizabethan Theme\", a collaborative work with other contributions by Lennox Berkeley, Britten, Imogen Holst, Humphrey Searle, Michael Tippett and William Walton. That year, his modern treatment of Thomas Arne's pastiche opera \"Love in a Village\" was staged by the English Opera Group. Criticism of the work led to a nervous breakdown and his working outside music for some time.\n\nHe then became a Roman Catholic and was employed as a teacher at Scotus Academy and choirmaster at St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Edinburgh. He introduced Scottish pre-Reformation music such as Robert Carver's 19-part motet \"O Bone Jesu\". Britten's \"Missa Brevis\" had its first performance in Scotland under Oldham's direction. His work at the Cathedral was noticed by people such as Carlo Maria Giulini and Georg Solti.\n\nThe first performance in Scotland (and one of the earliest in the United Kingdom) of Mahler's Symphony No. 8 \"Symphony of a Thousand\" was scheduled for the opening night of the 1965 Edinburgh Festival, with the Scottish National Orchestra, but a suitable choir was lacking. Lord Harewood and Alexander Gibson approached Oldham to create one and train the singers, and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus was born. Under his direction for the next 12 years, the chorus went on to participate in major works such as Verdi's \"Requiem\" (under Giulini), Tippett's \"A Child of Our Time\" (under Gibson), Bach's \"Magnificat\" (under Herbert von Karajan), Prokofiev's \"Seven, They are Seven\" (under Gennady Rozhdestvensky], Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony (under Leonard Bernstein), Brahms's \"A German Requiem\" (under Daniel Barenboim), and Stravinsky's \"Symphony of Psalms\" (under Claudio Abbado). He was instrumental in the first Scottish performances of Britten's \"War Requiem\", under Alexander Gibson. He also continued with the St Mary's Cathedral Choir until 1971.\n\nDavidson was the recipient of the 1973 St Mungo Prize, awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow.\n\nHe also worked with the London Symphony Chorus between 1969 and 1976, winning three Grammy Awards.\n\nHe left for Paris in 1977 to create the Orchestre de Paris's Chorus at Daniel Barenboim's request. For his farewell appearance in Edinburgh he wrote \"Psalms in Time of War\", which was performed at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival. His first project with the Paris chorus was Berlioz's \"Te Deum\", under Barenboim, for which he had auditioned 1,700 people to create a chorus of 200 singers. From 1987 to 1994 he commuted weekly between Paris and Edinburgh, working with both choirs. In 1992, the Edinburgh Chorus presented Schoenberg's \"Moses und Aron\". From 1994, he worked with the Orchestre de Paris Chorus exclusively. He celebrated 20 years with the chorus in 1996 with a new work, \"The Will of Villon\". He retired from that chorus in 2002.\n\nArthur Oldham died in Villejuif in 2003, aged 76. Fauré's \"Requiem\" was performed in his memory. He was married twice, and left 2 sons and 2 daughters.\n\nThe Arthur Oldham/Michael Lester-Cribb Memorial Fund has been created to honour the joint work of Oldham and Michael Lester-Cribb, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus's pianist.\n\nArthur Oldham shared the credit for three Grammy Awards for his work with the London Symphony Chorus:\n\nThis is an incomplete list of Arthur Oldham's compositions:\n\n"}

Students collectively identify a common\nchallenge facing their community and prepare an action plan to overcome it. Issues can range from sexual abuse,\npollution, violence, crime, and drugs, to lack of health care or schools. Students can take the technical skills they’ve\nlearned in class to mobilize their communities, engage in advocacy and awareness campaigns,\nand work together to solve that specific problem.

These centers were awarded through a competitive submission process to four schools of public health (Saint Louis University, University of Alabama-Birmingham, University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Oklahoma). These initially funded centers formed a nucleus upon which to build a response to the events on September 11, 2001. Yet, with nearly 450,000 public health professionals dispersed throughout more than 3,000 state and local health agencies expected to protect the health of the U.S. population against threats that were previously considered unthinkable, the magnitude of the problem demanded more vigorous collaboration between the academy and the practice community. In 2001, the CDC and the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) added resources to the A-CPHP that allowed for the stepwise expansion of the program to more schools of public health. \n\nIn 2009, there were 27 Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH)-accredited schools of public health with established and funded centers:\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010, the CDC gave $134 million in funding to the Centers for Public Health Preparedness (CPHP) Cooperative Agreement program; 27 CPHPs within accredited schools of public health received the funds.

{"id": "1471182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1471182", "title": "Crutch", "text": "Crutch\n\nA crutch is a mobility aid that transfers weight from the legs to the upper body. It is often used by people who cannot use their legs to support their weight, for reasons ranging from short-term injuries to lifelong disabilities.\n\nCrutches were used in ancient Egypt. In 1917, Emile Schlick patented the first commercially produced crutch; the design consisted of a walking stick with an upper arm support. Later, A.R. Lofstrand, Jr. developed the first crutches with a height-adjustable feature making the crutches customizable. Through time, the design of crutches haven't changed much such that the classic design still is most commonly used.\n\nThere are several types of crutches:\n\nAxillary crutches are used by placing the pad against the ribcage beneath the armpit and holding the grip, which is below and parallel to the pad. They are usually used to provide support for patients who have temporary restriction on ambulation.\nWith underarm crutches, sometimes a towel or some kind of soft cover is needed to prevent or reduce armpit injury. A condition known as \"crutch paralysis,\" or \"crutch palsy\" can arise from pressure on nerves in the armpit, or axilla. Specifically, \"the brachial plexus in the axilla is often damaged from the pressure of a crutch...In these cases the radial is the nerve most frequently implicated; the ulnar nerve suffers next in frequency.\"\n\nAn uncommon type of axillary crutches is the spring-loaded crutch. The underarm pad is a curved design that is open in the front with the grips for the hands shaped for maximum comfort and to reduce the prevalence of overuse injuries. These crutches also contain a spring mechanism at the bottom. The idea behind this design is to allow the user to propel themselves further, resulting in quicker movement from place to place, though research has shown that the difference in speed is very small when comparing standard axillary crutches to spring-loaded crutches. These crutches are most commonly used by young or athletic populations.\n\nA forearm crutch (also commonly known as an elbow crutch, Canadian crutch or \"Lofstrand\" crutch due to a brand by this name) has a cuff at the top that goes around the forearm. It is used by inserting the arm into a cuff and holding the grip. The hinged cuff, most frequently made of plastic or metal, can be a half-circle or a full circle with a V-type opening in the front allowing the forearm to slip out in case of a fall.\n\nForearm crutches are the dominant type used in Europe, whether for short or long term use. Outside of Europe forearm crutches are more likely to be used by users with long term disabilities, with axillary crutches more common for short term use.\n\nThese are less common and used by those with poor hand or grip strength due to arthritis, cerebral palsy, or other conditions. The forearm rests on a horizontal platform and is usually strapped in place with velcro-type straps that allow the platform or trough to release in case of a fall. The hand holds an angled grip which, in addition, should allow adjustment of length from trough to grip and side-to-side sway depending on the user's disability.\n\nThese non-traditional crutches are useful for users with an injury or disability affecting one lower leg only. They function by strapping the affected leg into a support frame that simultaneously holds the lower leg clear of the ground while transferring the load from the ground to the user's knee or thigh. This style of crutch has the advantage of not using the hands or arms while walking. A claimed benefit is that upper thigh atrophy is also reduced because the affected leg remains in use. Unlike other crutch designs these designs are unusable for pelvic, hip or thigh injuries and in some cases for knee injuries also.\n\nWalking sticks or canes serve an identical purpose to crutches, but are held only in the hand and have a limited load bearing capability because of this.\n\nWhen using one crutch, the crutch is placed on the side of the unaffected leg.\n\nThose who can tolerate partial weight bearing on both legs usually use the four point gait. The sequence is right crutch, left leg, left crutch, right leg. This is the slowest of all gaits but also the safest in that three of the four points are in contact with the ground at any given time. \n\nThose who can tolerate partial weight bearing on both legs but require less support than a four-point gait usually use the two-point gait. The sequence is right crutch with left leg and then left crutch with right leg.\n\nThe three point gait is usually used by those who cannot bear weight on one leg. Both crutches are advanced while bearing weight on the unaffected leg. Then the unaffected leg is advanced while bearing weight on the crutches.\n\nA person with a non-weight bearing injury generally performs a \"swing-to\" gait: lifting the affected leg, the user places both crutches in front of himself, and then swings his uninjured leg to meet the crutches. A similar \"swing-through\" gait is when both legs are advanced in front of the crutches rather than beside them.\n\nWhen climbing up stairs, the unaffected leg is advanced first, then the affected leg and the crutches are advanced. When descending stairs, the crutches are advanced first and then the affected leg and the unaffected leg.\n\nThe knee scooter and the wheelchair are possible alternatives for patients who cannot use or do not like crutches. These wheeled devices introduce an additional limitation, however, since they cannot negotiate stairs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2700105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2700105", "title": "Cultural psychology", "text": "Cultural psychology\n\nCultural psychology is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.\n\nThe main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them. As Richard Shweder, one of the major proponents of the field, writes, \"Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion.\"\n\nCultural psychology is often confused with cross-cultural psychology. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes. So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether Jean Piaget's stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.\n\nCultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including social psychology, cultural-historical psychology, developmental psychology, and cognitive psychology. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.\n\nAccording to Richard Shweder, there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.\nTherefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones. This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the indigenous psychology approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.\n\nThe acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research. Findings from psychology research utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often labeled as universal theories and are inaccurately applied to other cultures.\n\nRecent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values. The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the \"fundamental attribution error\" or the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day. Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.\n\nBy studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.\n\nMutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.\n\nWhile cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, \"...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth\". While the company can ensure the \"equal opportunity for learning and personal growth\", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure \"safety\" on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a \"stable work environment\". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:\n\nInstead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.\n\nPast research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.\nAlthough cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article \"Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution\" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.\n\nOne of the most significant themes in recent years has been cultural differences between East Asians and North Americans in attention, perception, cognition, and social psychological phenomena such as the self. Some psychologists, such as Turiel, have argued that this research is based on cultural stereotyping. Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to \"generalize about human development across nations and continents\" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual. Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.\n\nSelf-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology. However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.\n\nCultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable. The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.\n\nIn fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett & Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the culture of honor theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners. In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort. In terms of cognition styles, Chinese tend to perceive image using a holistic view compared to American.\n\nQuantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries. These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao & Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries. In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.\n\n\"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life.\" Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.\n\nThe 4 I's cultural model was developed by Hazel Rose Markus and Alana Conner in their book \"Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.\" In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a \"culture cycle.\" The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.\n\nThe first \"I\" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as \"independent\", \"equal\", and \"individualistic\". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation. When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as \"energetic\", \"friendly\", or \"hard-working\". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as \"obligated to society\", \"interdependent\", and \"considerate\". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as \"I try not to upset anyone,\" or \"I am a father, a son, and a brother.\"\n\nInteractions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave. For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying \"No Smoking\". These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.\n\nThe next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During \"birthday month celebration,\" for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.\n\nJohn and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at Harvard University, developed the \"Whiting model\" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.\n\nThe Whitings coined the term \"cultural learning environment\", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development. Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being \"characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior\". This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.\n\nMany researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model, and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the \"Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology\", \"All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development.\"\n\nWhile self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures. Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities. With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures, the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include downward social comparison, compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, external attributions and basking in reflected glory. In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.\n\nA main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement. Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group. Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The Fundamental Attribution Error has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic). Along these same lines, the self-serving bias was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals. This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out. Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society. This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.\n\nThese differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy and emotional empathy: taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.\n\nCultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own. This idea has been further developed with the concept of ethnocultural empathy. This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.\nOne of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:\n\nPaucity of:\n\nand:\n\nThese five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.\n\nAnother barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy. One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression. While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed. The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.\n\nFour important facets of cultural empathy are:\n\nThese four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds. Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.

{"id": "7430013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7430013", "title": "Dual language", "text": "Dual language\n\nDual language is a form of education in which students are taught literacy and content in two languages. The majority of dual language programs in the United States teach in English and Spanish, although increasing numbers of programs use a partner language other than Spanish, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Hawaiian, Japanese, or Korean. Dual language programs use the partner language for at least half of the instructional day in the elementary years.\n\nDual language programs generally start in kindergarten or first grade and extend for at least five years, although many continue into middle school and high school. These programs aim for bilingualism (the ability to speak fluently in two languages), biliteracy (the ability to read and write in two languages), academic achievement equal to that of students in non-dual language programs, and cross-cultural competence. Most dual language programs are located in neighborhood public schools, although many are charter, magnet, or private schools.\n\nThe initiation of dual immersion programs in the United States is characterized by the coalescence of local politicians and community members. Coral Way Elementary, a K-8 school in Dade County, Florida, is cited as the first two-way bilingual school, beginning in 1963 . The program was started by Cuban citizens who were seeking refuge in Florida from the Castro regime and believed that their children would eventually return to Cuban schools . The Ecole Bilingue, a French/English school in Massachusetts, was formed around the same time . In 1968, the passing of the Bilingual Education Act served to address the reality that Limited English Proficient(LEP) students were in need of proper instructional support to achieve academic gains, and in turn provided federal funding for primary language instruction in local school districts . The Lau v. Nichols ruling of 1974 further affirmed a student’s right to educational opportunity via appropriate instructional services (Calderón, 2000). Schools were thus charged with the mission to implement programs suitable to the needs of their language minority students.\n\nWhile the number of dual immersion programs remained relatively low throughout the mid-1980s, a greater attention to the need to provide challenging yet comprehensible (Calderón, 2000) instruction to English language learners (ELLs), in more recent years, triggered a substantial growth in the number of programs. In 2002, for example, the implementation of the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act of the No Child Left Behind Act subsequently made it requisite that schools with large numbers of language minority students provide instruction that facilitates their acquisition of English, to consequently perform well on standardized tests . There are presently three hundred and ninety-eight two-way immersion programs in thirty distinct states and the District of Columbia . The quantity of programs has increased significantly in the last decade, despite efforts made in states such as Arizona and California to eradicate bilingual education programs in favor of English-immersion, with the passing of Proposition 203 and Proposition 227, respectively. It is estimated ninety-four percent of the dual immersion programs are Spanish/English, with the remaining six percent either Chinese/English, Navajo/English, Japanese/English, and Korean/English programs (Bae, 2007).\n\nOne of the most salient changes that has occurred in the two-way immersion program since its inception is its conversion from a program centered predominately on aiding ELLs to develop fluency in English to an enrichment program striving for biliteracy, bilingualism and biculturalism for all students participating. Although two-way immersion was initially focused on supporting ELLs in their development and acquisition of English literacy skills, the need to develop bilingualism in an increasingly globalized society has made the program appealing for many parents of children who are native speakers of English (Calderón, 2000). Whereas foreign-language education programs can provide native speakers of English with exposure to a second language, TWI has the potential to help students achieve near fluency in a second language. This suggests that such programs are not solely focused on helping ELLs to acquire English, but instead aim to develop second language proficiency for native speakers of English. In fact, because two-way immersion requires almost an equal amount of native English and native Spanish speakers, if the former is lacking, it is likely that such programs will not be implemented, which implies that the latter may not receive the opportunity to take part in the dual immersion program (Gomez, 2005).\n\nThere are four main types of dual language programs, which mainly differ in the population:\n\n\nThe term \"dual language\" is often used interchangeably with two-way immersion. Other variations on dual language include \"dual language immersion,\" \"dual immersion,\" and \"dual enrollment\". The term bilingual education has somewhat fallen out of favor among dual language practitioners, but it is still used to refer to any program that uses two languages for instruction.\n\nDual language programs are different from transitional bilingual programs, where the aim is to transition students out of their native language and, in the United States, into English as quickly as possibly, usually in three years. This is sometimes referred to as \"subtractive bilingualism\" since the first language is typically lost as English is acquired. Dual language programs are considered to promote \"additive bilingualism\", meaning that students' primary language is developed and maintained as a second language is added.\n\nAnother type of program that is not considered dual language is foreign language education where students receive less than half a day studying in the partner language, and often only study language arts and literature in that language as opposed to content area subjects such as mathematics, science, and social studies.\n\nThere are two main variations:\n1. Amount of time spent in the partner language\n2. Division of languages\n\n1. Time Spent in Partner Language\n\n\nThere is currently no research indicating that one of these methods is preferable to another, although some research indicates that students who spend more time in the partner language do better in that language (Howard, Christian, & Genesee, 2003; Lindholm-Leary, 2001; Lindholm-Leary & Howard, in press), and that language minority students (in the U.S., those whose native language is not English) do better academically when their native language is supported and developed (Thomas & Collier, 1997; 2002).\n\nSome schools, like Arizona Language Preparatory in Phoenix, Arizona and Alicia R. Chacon Elementary School in El Paso, Texas include a third language for a full day or a small portion of the day at all grade levels. Arizona Language Preparatory offers two full days of Mandarin Chinese, two full days of Spanish and one day of English. Arizona Language Preparatory is also the first school in the nation to send a delegation of \"Mini Ambassadors\" through Phoenix Sister Cities to Chengdu, China. Youth ambassador programs are typically done on the high school level.\n\nFull immersion (90/10) programs typically begin literacy instruction for students in kindergarten and first grade in the partner language and add formal literacy in English in second or third grade. Students do not need to relearn how to read in English; teachers help them transfer their literacy skills from one language to the other. Other 90/10 programs separate students by native language and provide initial literacy instruction in the native language, adding second language literacy by second or third grade. In partial immersion or 50/50 programs, initial literacy instruction is either provided simultaneously in both languages to all students, or students are separated by native language in order to receive initial literacy in his or her native language.\n\nDual language programs in middle school and high school often merge students from several dual language elementary schools and exist as programs within larger mainstream schools. They often offer dual language students the opportunity to take language arts and at least one content area in the partner language, and many prepare students to take the Advanced Placement exams.\n\n2. Division of Languages\n\n\nDual language programs vary in the kinds of instruction they provide, but generally implement many of the following features:\n\n\nDual language teachers also incorporate practices that should be in place in any classroom that includes linguistically diverse students:\n\n\nIn regard to lesson planning, dual language teachers should focus on creating lessons that:\n\nOther important tips for educators teaching bilingual or multilingual students include organizing content around themes, providing students with choice, starting the learning process with students’ questions, and exposing students to not only professional published books and magazines but student-authored literature (Freeman & Freeman, 1994).\n\n\"For names of more dual language programs not profiled in Wikipedia, see The Directory of Two-Way Bilingual Programs in the U.S. or The Directory of Foreign Language Immersion Programs in U.S. Schools\"\nGerman/American Elementary School, Houston, Texas\n\n\nTwo-way immersion has been referred to as the most effective bilingual program contributing to long-term academic success (Howard et al. 2003, p. 24). Thorough planning and effective implementation are crucial to the success of TWI programs, in addition to ample support from administrators and access to quality resources. In well-implemented programs, ELLs have achieved higher academic success than their peers in other bilingual programs (Dorner, 2011). Effective implementation, for one, lies in the duration of the program. In order to produce academic achievement, students ideally must be enrolled in TWI programs for four to seven years (Howard et al. 2003, p. 24). Students participating in TWI programs for this length of time have been shown to demonstrate higher academic performance than their peers in English-immersion programs (Howard et al. 2003, p. 24). On the contrary, students who receive little to no instruction in their native language, during their elementary years, struggle to attain grade level performance in the target language (Cobb, 2006).\n\nBoth Native English Speakers (NES) and ELLs are beneficiaries of the gains made through TWI. The juxtaposed use of the majority and minority language in TWI programs can enable children to transfer skills from the secondary language to their primary language and vice versa (Scanlan, 2009). Research comparing the academic achievement made by native speakers of English and native speakers of Spanish illustrates that while both groups show growth in their native and secondary language, English native speakers are more dominant in their primary language, whereas Spanish native speakers are able to achieve a more balanced form of bilingualism, that is, relatively equal in their ability to communicate orally and in writing in their primary and secondary language (Howard et al. 2003, p. 36).\n\nThe evidence of the effectiveness of TWI is consistent in programs where less common languages are maintained as well. For example, an eight-year study of the Navajo/English two-way bilingual program at the Rough Rock Community School in northeastern Arizona confirms that those students who received thorough instruction in their native language as well as the target language encountered more success in school than their peers in English-only programs (McCarty, 2000). Such students too showed progress in both languages in their writing abilities on local and national measures (McCarty, 2000).\n\nIn addition to quantitative measures of effectiveness, research has further credited the two-way immersion model as creating more unified communities in public schools amongst parents and caregivers, since speakers of both majority and minority languages are grouped together in an effort to develop literacy skills in both languages and consequently foster cross-cultural relationships in both cultures (Scanlan, 2009). Furthermore, studies have shown that high school students who attended schools with two-way bilingual programs were more motivated and passionate about attaining higher level education (Cobb, 2006).\n\nDual Language Immersion programs may be inefficient in the education of language-minority students. Issues are raised in the quality of instruction in the minority language, the effects of dual immersion and intergroup relations, and, how Dual Language immersion programs fit into the relationship between language and power of children and society (Valdes, 1997).\n\nWhile such examples attest to the effectiveness of the TWI model, these programs are often voluntary which signifies the inherent difficulty in making comparisons across programs. Academic success and biculturalism may be attributed to the quality of the TWI program, however, may also be ascribed to external factors such as a student’s inherent qualities or socioeconomic status (Howard et al. 2003, p. 12). Thus, while standardized test scores, from a policy perspective, are often used to determine the effectiveness of a program, other elements may impact the academic success achieved by many students in the TWI program (Howard et al. 2003, p. 23).\n\nRenewal: The Case of the Navajo.\" Proceedings of the 1996 World Conference on Literacy.\nUniversity of Arizona: Tucson, AZ. 2000.\n\n\"See also\"\n\n•Association of Two-Way and Dual Language Education (http://www.atdle.org)\n"}

She spent most of her career singing lyric coloratura roles at the Metropolitan Opera. After her performance career ended she taught singing to young artists and also directed the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artist Program for over ten years. Upon leaving the Met, she joined the voice faculty at the University of Kentucky.\n\nRobinson was born in Meridian, Mississippi but moved to Jackson, Tennessee shortly thereafter. She showed musical talent early, performing locally on radio and television. She graduated from Jackson High School in 1964 and went on to study voice under Norvell Taylor at Memphis State University. While at MSU, she won the Metropolitan Opera's \"Audition of the Air\" (the precursor to the National Council Auditions) at the young age of 19. Following this important win, Robinson left MSU to the Met's development program for young artists, with which Robinson sang leading roles in school performances throughout New York, beginning in 1966.\n\nRobinson made her professional opera debut in 1966 with Memphis Opera as the title heroine in Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" conducted by Fiora Contino. That same year she toured to Rhode Island with the Met to perform the role of the Swallow in the American premiere of Malcolm Williamson's \"The Happy Prince\". She made her debut at the company's opera house three years later as the First Genii in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\". She became a regular performer at the Met during the next two decades singing in more than 200 performances with the company. Her roles with the Metropolitan Opera included Adina in \"L'Elisir d'Amore\", Almirena in \"Rinaldo\", Amore in \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", Annina in \"La Traviata\", Barbarina in \"Le nozze di Figaro\", Flower Maiden in \"Parsifal\", Garsenda in \"Francesca da Rimini\", Gilda in \"Rigoletto\", Gretel in \"Hänsel und Gretel\", Guadalena in \"La Périchole\", Juliette in \"Roméo et Juliette\", Konstanze in \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\", Lucia in \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", Norina in \"Don Pasquale\", Oscar in \"Un Ballo in Maschera\", Pamina in \"The Magic Flute\", Princess in \"L'Enfant et les Sortilèges\", Rosina in \"Il Barbiere di Siviglia\", Servilia in \"La Clemenza di Tito\", Sophie in \"Der Rosenkavalier\", and Sophie in \"Werther\" among others. Her last performance both with the Met and on the operatic stage was as Echo in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" on October 10, 1987. Robinson decided to retire at the time due to health reasons.\n\nRobinson's career also took her to other leading opera houses around the world including the Hamburg State Opera, Berlin State Opera, the Munich State Opera, and Grand Théâtre de Genève among others. She also sang at numerous companies in the United States including the Lyric Opera of Chicago, San Antonio Grand Opera Festival, Opera Company of Philadelphia, New Orleans Opera, Opera Omaha and the Kentucky Opera among others.\n\nRobinson also had a fruitful career as a concert artist and recitalist, giving performances in more than 80 cities in the United States alone and singing at such distinguished places as the White House and Carnegie Hall. She performed with several prestigious orchestras including the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra among others.\n\nAfter her career on stage she began mentoring young singers in the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artist Program, becoming director of both that program and the Met's National Council Auditions for almost fifteen years. In 1999 she became a professor of voice at the University of Kentucky and held the position until she died. Several of her students have gone on to have successful opera careers including Stephanie Blythe, Dwayne Croft, Christine Goerke, Paul Groves and Heidi Grant Murphy.\nRobinson was the recipient of numerous honours including an honorary PhD in fine arts from Rhodes College, Memphis, and the inaugural Obelisk Award of the Center for Contemporary Opera.\n\nRobinson died of complications from rheumatoid arthritis on October 19, 2008, aged 62. She was the wife of Henno Lohmeyer, a journalist and writer. They had two children together, Patrick Lohmeyer and Jennifer Toney, and four grandchildren.\n\nVery little of Robinson's work has been recorded. She was never offered a recording contract with a record label and the only surviving records of her work are a videotaped performance of the Met's production of \"Francesca da Rimini\", several operetta films, such as Millöcker's \"Die Dubarry\", that she made in Germany during the 1970s, and several television appearances.\n\n\n"}

Most pupils will go on to learn the traditional method, once they are comfortable with the grid method; but knowledge of the grid method remains a useful \"fall back\", in the event of confusion. It is also argued that since anyone doing a lot of multiplication would nowadays use a pocket calculator, efficiency for its own sake is less important; equally, since this means that most children will use the multiplication algorithm less often, it is useful for them to become familiar with a more explicit (and hence more memorable) method.\n\nUse of the grid method has been standard in mathematics education in primary schools in England and Wales since the introduction of a National Numeracy Strategy with its \"numeracy hour\" in the 1990s. It can also be found included in various curricula elsewhere. Essentially the same calculation approach, but not necessarily with the explicit grid arrangement, is also known as the partial products algorithm or partial products method.\n\nThe grid method can be introduced by thinking about how to add up the number of points in a regular array, for example the number of squares of chocolate in a chocolate bar. As the size of the calculation becomes larger, it becomes easier to start counting in tens; and to represent the calculation as a box which can be sub-divided, rather than drawing lots and lots of dots.\n\nAt the simplest level, pupils might be asked to apply the method to a calculation like 3 × 17. Breaking up (\"partitioning\") the 17 as (10 + 7), this unfamiliar multiplication can be worked out as the sum of two simple multiplications:\n\nso 3 × 17 = 30 + 21 = 51.\n\nThis is the \"grid\" or \"boxes\" structure which gives the multiplication method its name.\n\nFaced with a slightly larger multiplication, such as 34 × 13, pupils may initially be encouraged to also break this into tens.\nSo, expanding 34 as 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 and 13 as 10 + 3, the product 34 × 13 might be represented:\n\nTotalling the contents of each row, it is apparent that the final result of the calculation is (100 + 100 + 100 + 40) + (30 + 30 + 30 + 12) = 340 + 102 = 442.\n\nOnce pupils have become comfortable with the idea of splitting the whole product into contributions from separate boxes, it is a natural step to group the tens together, so that the calculation 34 × 13 becomes\ngiving the addition\n\nso 34 × 13 = 442.\n\nThis is the most usual form for a grid calculation. In countries such as the U.K. where teaching of the grid method is usual, pupils may spend a considerable period of time regularly setting out calculations like the above, until the method is entirely comfortable and familiar.\n\nThe grid method extends straightforwardly to calculations involving larger numbers.\n\nFor example, to calculate 345 × 28, the student could construct the grid with six easy multiplications\n\nto find the answer 6900 + 2760 = 9660.\n\nHowever, by this stage (at least in standard current U.K. teaching practice) pupils may be starting to be encouraged to set out such a calculation using the traditional long multiplication form without having to draw up a grid.\n\nTraditional long multiplication can be related to a grid multiplication in which only one of the numbers is broken into tens and units parts to be multiplied separately:\n\nThe traditional method is ultimately faster and much more compact; but it requires two significantly more difficult multiplications which pupils may at first struggle with . Compared to the grid method, traditional long multiplication may also be more abstract and less manifestly clear , so some pupils find it harder to remember what is to be done at each stage and why . Pupils may therefore be encouraged for quite a period to use the simpler grid method alongside the more efficient traditional long multiplication method, as a check and a fall-back.\n\nWhile not normally taught as a standard method for multiplying fractions, the grid method can readily be applied to simple cases where it is easier to find a product by breaking it down.\n\nFor example, the calculation 2½ × 1½ can be set out using the grid method\n\nto find that the resulting product is 2 + ½ + 1 + ¼ = 3¾\n\nThe grid method can also be used to illustrate the multiplying out of a product of binomials, such as (\"a\" + 3)(\"b\" + 2), a standard topic in elementary algebra (although one not usually met until secondary school):\n\nThus (\"a\" + 3)(\"b\" + 2) = \"ab\" + 3\"b\" + 2\"a\" + 6.\n\nMathematically, the ability to break up a multiplication in this way is known as the distributive law, which can be expressed in algebra as the property that \"a\"(\"b\"+\"c\") = \"ab\" + \"ac\". The grid method uses the distributive property twice to expand the product, once for the horizontal factor, and once for the vertical factor.\n\nHistorically the grid calculation (tweaked slightly) was the basis of a method called lattice multiplication, which was the standard method of multiple-digit multiplication developed in medieval Arabic and Hindu mathematics. Lattice multiplication was introduced into Europe by Fibonacci at the start of the thirteenth century along with the so-called Arabic numerals themselves; although, like the numerals also, the ways he suggested to calculate with them were initially slow to catch on. Napier's bones were a calculating help introduced by the Scot John Napier in 1617 to assist lattice method calculations.\n\n\n"}

In 2008 he was named a 3 under 35 honoree by the National Book Foundation.\n\nNam Le came to Australia from Vietnam with his parents, when he was less than a year old, as a boat refugee. He attended Melbourne Grammar School and the University of Melbourne, from which he graduated with a BA (Hons) and LLB (Hons). His Arts thesis supervisor was the Australian poet Chris Wallace-Crabbe. He worked as a corporate lawyer and was admitted to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2003/2004.\n\nLe decided to turn to writing, and in 2004 attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop in the United States where he completed a Masters in Creative Writing. He became fiction editor at the \"Harvard Review\". His first short story was published in \"Zoetrope\" in 2006. Nam Le also held fellowships at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown in 2006, and at the Phillips Exeter Academy, in 2007.\n\nIn an interview on Australian ABC radio, he said he turned from law to writing due to his love of reading: \"I loved reading, and if you asked me why I decided to become a writer, that's the answer right there, because I was a reader and I was just so enthralled and thrilled by the stuff that I'd read that I just thought; what could be better? How could you possibly better spend your time than trying to recreate that feeling for other people\". In the same interview he said that his first writing was poetry.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 2008, but is moving to Great Britain to take up a writing fellowship at the University of East Anglia.\n\nWhen asked about his source of inspiration, Nam Le said in 2008 that \"I’d say I’m most inspired by my parents for the choices and sacrifices they’ve made. It still boggles me\".\n\nRegarding his style, Nam Le said in an interview that \"one of the demarcations is writers that deal primarily with language, the more lyrical minded writers, and writers that are more structurally oriented. I always used to...I started out writing poetry and reading poetry, and so I always knew that that was the side that I was most predisposed to, and so I actually had to be quite careful in these stories to not overdo that impulse, to not throw too many images or indulge too many lyrical flights of fancy.\"\n\nThe book, first published in 2008, comprises seven short stories which take the reader to such places as Colombia, New York City, Iowa, Tehran, Hiroshima, and small-town Australia. In the opening story, \"Love and Honor and Pity and Pride and Compassion and Sacrifice\", he writes about a Vietnamese-born character called Nam Le who is attending a writing workshop in Iowa. In a conversation with Michael Williams he said about the practice of using a narrator close to \"self\" in a story:\nA lot of people presume if I'm writing a narrator who has clear parallels to me, that's just sheer inertia; that there's a natural adaptation from so-called life to so-called text. But any careful reader or writer would understand how much artifice and contrivance go into making this self-standing and self-contained. Actually it's tougher: if I stick in something that has more resonance for me than is communicated on the page, then that's a failure of my charge as a writer . . . I'm not creating a good enough space for the reader to come in and fully partake in that scene or that language or that line.\"\n\nEach story provides \"a snapshot of a pivotal point in the characters' lives\".\n\nNam Le has said of his Vietnamese heritage and writing that:My relationship with Vietnam is complex. For a long time I vowed I wouldn’t fall into writing ethnic stories, immigrant stories, etc. Then I realized that not only was I working against these expectations (market, self, literary, cultural), I was working against my kneejerk resistance to such expectations. How I see it now is no matter what or where I write about, I feel a responsibility to the subject matter. Not so much to get it right as to do it justice. Having personal history with a subject only complicates this — but not always, nor necessarily, in bad ways. I don’t completely understand my relationship to Vietnam as a writer. This book is a testament to the fact that I’m becoming more and more okay with that.\n\nAustralian short story writer Cate Kennedy, interviewing Nam Le, said that \"The Boat\" has put the short story back in \"the literary centre stage\".\n\n\n"}

In early adolescence, he began studying martial arts, beginning with judo, then karate and jiujitsu. He excelled in athletics while in high school and was awarded a scholarship to San Diego State College in San Diego, California where he was named All-American in track and field.\n\nAfter a Marine Corps tour of duty in the mid 1960s, Strozzi-Heckler traveled throughout Asia studying yoga and meditation. He returned to the United States, eventually earning a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Saybrook University with an emphasis on mind-body connection.\n\nStrozzi-Heckler holds the rank of seventh degree black belt (shichidan) in aikido.\n\nStrozzi-Heckler co-founded the Lomi School in 1970 with Robert K. Hall, Alyssa Hall, and Catherine Flaxman, integrating aikido and bodywork principles into a body oriented psychotherapy called Lomi Work.\n\nIn 1976, Strozzi-Heckler, together with George Leonard and Wendy Palmer, established the Aikido of Tamalpais dojo in Mill Valley, California. In 1985, he was invited to contribute to a US Army Special Forces project designed to test the effectiveness of integrating various practices into its training program. During the six-month program, he taught aikido and meditation techniques.\n\nIn 1986, he moved to rural Sonoma County, California outside of Petaluma, and developed a methodology, Strozzi Somatics, aimed at reproducing the outcomes of the US Army project with individuals and civilian organizations. Strozzi Somatics has been employed in various forms to groups around the world.\n\nStrozzi-Heckler helped design and implement the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program.\n\nPointing out the relationship of thoughts and mood to an individual's body (e.g., posture, facial expression, tone of voice), Strozzi-Heckler has said that congruency between these elements and a person’s words is a primary characteristic of effective leaders. He asserts that this characteristic can be practiced and improved as reliably as practicing and improving one's skill in a martial art or with a musical instrument.\n\nThe Strozzi Somatics methodology involves eliciting an individual or organization’s defining values and introducing practices that combine conceptual understanding with physical activity in a way that is intended to produce an increase in behavioral traits that are in accordance with those values. Many of these practices are based on aikido movements or principles.\n\nIn addition to corporate and military leadership, Strozzi Somatics have been applied to law enforcement, corrections, professional and Olympic athletics, education, politics, social justice, and health.\n\n\n"}

The school has classes only from Std VI to X.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, this school celebrated its golden jubilee.\n\nIn 1952–53, the Mudaliar Commission's report on \"Reform in the System of Secondary Education in India\" suggested a vast set of reforms for the education system. At that time, the educationists-cum-policy makers for Odisha, e.g., Professor B. C. Das, DPI; Shree H. Mishra, DDPI; Dr. S. Sahu, and senior officials of the BSE conceived an idea to establish three model schools at Cuttack, Sambalpur and Berhampur, respectively.\n\nUnder this initiative, construction of a school, named Secondary Board High School, began at Cuttack in 1958. The school opened on 3 August 1959 with 148 students (including 31 girls), under the guidance of Shree Chakradhar Mohanty, deputed by the BSE as special officer, and nine teachers.\n\nIt was initially planned to have only three classes, i.e., VI, VII and VIII, and accordingly, admission process began on 9 June 1959 starting with Class-VI. On demand by local guardians, classes IX and X were introduced later. The first batch passed the HSC Examination in 1962 with three years of study in the school, the fully trained first batch passed out in 1965 with all six years of study in the school.\n\nGradually the strength of students grew up to 1,100 by 1984.\n\nThe school shares the same campus as the BCE and the two buildings stand facing each other.

Originally founded in 1954 as Lovanium University during Belgian colonial rule, the current university was established following the division of the National University of Zaire (UNAZA) in 1981. It is located in Kinshasa.\n\nThe university had an enrollment of 26,186 and a faculty and research staff of 1,530 in the 2006-07 academic year, and currently has ten academic divisions.\n\nThe university is located about south of central Kinshasa, in the suburb of Lemba.\n\nMany of the campus facilities have deteriorated and are in poor condition, or lack proper instructional tools - in 2003, the science library had as few as 300 titles in its collection. Since 2001, the university has hosted Cisco Academy, a joint project sponsored by the American software company Cisco and the United Nations Development Programme. The academy focuses on providing recent technology, training students to install and operate computer networks and all coursework is online.\n\nThe university was established in 1954 as Lovanium University by Belgian colonial authorities following criticism that they had done too little to educate the Congolese people. The university was originally affiliated with the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. When it opened, the university received heavy subsidies from the colonial government and funding from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development and was lauded as the best university in Africa.\n\nIn August 1971, the university was merged with the \"Protestant Autonomous University of Congo\" (\"Université Libre du Congo\") and \"The University of Congo at Lubumbashi\" (founded in 1956) into the \"National University of Zaire\" (Université Nationale du Zaïre, UNAZA). Ties were cut with the Catholic University of Leuven, and funding for the university began to drop precipitously. At this point, the university had an enrollment capacity of just 5,000.\n\nThe decision to merge the private universities into one centralized system was made, at least partially, to counter concerns about political demonstrations on campuses. The entire higher education system was run by a single rector and faculty and staff were put on the federal payroll.\n\nBy 1981, the centralized system became too burdensome and the decision was made to re-establish the three separate institutions: the University of Kinshasa, Kisangani University, and the University of Lubumbashi.\n\nNewly independent, the University of Kinshasa continued to struggle financially throughout the 1980s. By 1985, the campus was in decline, strewn with trash and the dormitories in poor condition. The university's cafeteria stopped serving meals and pay for professors slipped as low as $15.\n\nIn response to declining government funds tuition was raised 500 percent in 1985, and in 1989, deeper cuts were made, with the suspension of nearly all scholarships and financial aid and institution of new fees. Through the 1980s, as much as 90 percent of the university's budget was paid for by the government, with only a small amount of revenues coming from student tuition. By 2002, the government only contributed $8,000 (USD) of the university's estimated $4.3 million annual budget (not including some personnel costs which are paid directly by the state).\n\nThe first nuclear reactor in Africa was built at the University of Kinshasa in 1958. The reactor, known as TRICO I, is a TRIGA reactor built by General Atomics. TRICO stands for a combination of TRIGA or “Training Isotopes General Atomic” and Congo. The reactor was built while the country was still under Belgian control, and with the assistance of the United States government, under the Atoms For Peace program. TRIGA I was estimated to have a 50-kilowatt capacity and was shut down in 1970. In 1967, the African Union established a nuclear research center, the Regional Center for Nuclear Studies and the United States agreed to provide another TRIGA reactor. The second reactor, TRICO II, is believed to have a one-megawatt capacity and was brought online in 1972.\n\nIn 2001, the TRICO II reactor was reported to be operational, but was apparently put on standby in 1998. The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo stopped funding the program in the late 1980s, and the United States has since refused to ship replacement parts.\n\nInternational observers have long been concerned about the safety and security of the two nuclear reactors and the enriched uranium they contain.\n\nThere are ten academic divisions at the university:\n\n\n"}
