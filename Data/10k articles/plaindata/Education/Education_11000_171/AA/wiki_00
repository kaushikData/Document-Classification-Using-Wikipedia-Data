It is based on the 2004 novel \"Project X\" by Jim Shepard.\n\nIn the cruel world of junior high, Edwin suffers in a state of anxiety and alienation alongside his only friend, Flake. Misunderstood by their families and demoralized at school daily, their fury simmers quietly until an idea for vengeance offers them a terrifying release. Based on the acclaimed novel \"Project X\" by Jim Shepard, this unflinching look at adolescence explores how the powerful bonds of childhood friendship and search for belonging can become a matter of life or death.\n\n\n\"And Then I Go\" made its worldwide premiere at the 2017 Los Angeles Film Festival.\n\nThe film was picked up for distribution by The Orchard, and was released theatrically as well as on VOD and Digital HD on April 17, 2018.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 11 reviews, and a MetaCritic score of 77.\n\nThe film has received almost unanimous critical acclaim with Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter calling it, \"A powerful portrait of teen alienation.\" Further stating, \"A disturbing drama of teen disaffection, Vincent Grashaw's feature provides an essential and insightful perspective that will resonate with audiences attuned to the challenges of adolescence.\"\n\nForbes goes on to call the film \"an uncommonly poignant treatment of adolescence, darker but not entirely dissimilar from Richard Linklater's 2014 masterpiece, Boyhood, irrespective of where this particular story leads.\" Further stating, \"And Then I Go is less a film about school shootings than one about the crushingly real struggles of youth, struggles that adults quickly forget or make light of, which often just exacerbates the problem. That such difficulties can lead, increasingly, to equally real tragic ends should give any parent or educator pause. We may not be able to stop school shootings once and for all, but recognizing that each one is unique, and likely the product of something far more commonplace than mental illness, might be a place to start.\"\nEntertainment Weekly garnered the film with a 'B+' rating and listed as a 'Must See'.

Its model uses recent college graduates serving an AmeriCorps term of service as near-peer mentors for students lacking the social resources to successfully enroll in and graduate from college. Headquartered in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the organization serves students in all 50 states with offices located in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metro area, Chicago, Milwaukee, Omaha, Portland, and Philadelphia.\n\nCollege Possible was chartered as a nonprofit in September 2000, beginning operations in two Twin Cities public high schools the next spring. By the 2008-09 school year, the organization was serving students in seventeen high school schools across Minneapolis-Saint Paul and launched a second site in Milwaukee. In the spring of 2015, College Possible launched a sixth site in Chicago, Illinois. In 2016, College Possible launched Catalyze, a program to embed their coaching model and curriculum on campus with partner colleges and universities. In the 2017-18 school year, College Possible served more than 22,000 students at hundreds of high schools, colleges and universities across the country.\n\nA \"New York Times\" article from November 2005 quotes CEO Jim McCorkell as saying: \"My starting idea was what if we replicated Kaplan for poor kids.\" To be eligible for College Possible's free services, students must come from low-income families and have a GPA of 2.0 or higher. High school students accepted into the program participate in after-school sessions over their junior and senior years, with time divided between test preparation, college applications, financial aid applications and preparing to transition to college. The program also has a service component, including an annual service event on Make a Difference Day.\n\nCollege students receive guidance in finding and accessing campus resources, renewing the FAFSA, locating internships, maintaining a healthy balance between homework and social obligations, as well as when transferring schools.\n\nCollege Possible is a partner organization with the Bloomberg Philanthropies funded CollegePoint program, which is a virtual advising program designed to help high-achieving, low-income students gain admission to top colleges.\n\nCollege Possible is a 501(c)3 organization that has received a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for financial management and a three-star rating for accountability and transparency.\n\nA 2011 Harvard study determined that Admission Possible more than doubles the chances a low-income student will enroll in a four-year institution. A later 2013 Harvard study found College Possible to have a significant positive impact on four-year college enrollment, though it had no statistically significant effect on ACT scores.\n\nWilder Research, an arm of the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, performed an evaluation of Admission Possible in 2006, substantiating its claim that 91% of the organization's students enrolled in college, and that it compared favorably to similar programs.\n\nThe Charities Review Council deems that it \"meets all standards\".\n\nMcCorkell was named an Fellow, a recognition for social entrepreneurship, in 2006.

On the basis of his academic record he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1874, he had become one of the first African Americans to graduate from Yale College.\n\nAlthough Bouchet was elected to Phi Beta Kappa along with other members of the Yale class of 1874, the official induction did not take place until 1884, when the Yale chapter was reorganized after thirteen years of inactivity. Because of the circumstances, Bouchet was not the first African American elected to Phi Beta Kappa as many historical accounts state; that honor belongs to George Washington Henderson (University of Vermont).\nBouchet was also among the first 20 Americans (of any race) to receive a Ph.D. in physics and was the sixth to earn a Ph.D. in physics from Yale.\n\nEdward Bouchet was born at home in New Haven, Connecticut, to parents William and Susan (Cooley) Bouchet. At that time, there were only three schools in New Haven open to black children. Bouchet was enrolled in the Artisan Street Colored School with only one teacher, who nurtured Bouchet's academic abilities. He attended the New Haven High School from 1866 to 1868 and then Hopkins School from 1868 to 1870, where he was named valedictorian (after graduating first in his class).\nHe ranked sixth in his class on graduation from Yale.\n\nBouchet was unable to find a university teaching position after college, probably because of racial discrimination. Bouchet moved to Philadelphia in 1876 and took a position at the Philadelphia's Institute for Colored Youth (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania), where he taught physics and chemistry for the next 26 years. He resigned in 1902 at the height of the W. E. B. Du Bois-Booker T. Washington controversy over the need for an industrial vs. collegiate education for blacks.\n\nBouchet spent the next 14 years holding a variety of jobs around the country. Between 1905 and 1908, Bouchet was director of academics at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School in Lawrenceville, Virginia (presently, St. Paul's College). He was then principal and teacher at Lincoln High School in Gallipolis, Ohio from 1908 to 1913. He joined the faculty of Bishop College in Marshall, Texas in 1913. Illness finally forced him to retire in 1916 and he moved back to New Haven. He died there, in his childhood home, in 1918, at age of 66. He had never married and had no children. He was a Republican.\n\nThe American Physical Society (APS Physics) confers the Edward A. Bouchet Award on some of the nation's outstanding physicists for their contribution to physics. The Edward Bouchet Abdus Salam Institute was founded in 1988 by the late Nobel Laureate, Professor Abdus Salam under the direction of the founding Chairman Charles S. Brown. In 2005, Yale and Howard University founded the Edward A. Bouchet Graduate Honor Society in his name. The current chair of EBASI is Professor Milton Dean Slaughter.\n"}

Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological hazards, including volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis and many help prepare disaster mitigation strategies with local communities. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current climate changes as well as demonstrating a \"best practise\" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of \"green tourism\". Tourism industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.\n\nGeoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for natural resources, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding environment while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the landscape. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.

In her early career she distinguished herself by creating roles in the world premieres of two operas by Gian Carlo Menotti, the Secretary of the Consulate in \"The Consul\" (1950) and Desideria in \"The Saint of Bleecker Street\" (1954); both roles which she performed in successful runs on Broadway and on international tours. For her performance in \"The Consul\" she was awarded a Clarence Derwent Award and two Donaldson Awards.\n\nLane was also a regular performer at the New York City Opera from 1952 to 1960, and was heard as a guest artist with several important American opera companies during the 1950s. After 1960, Lane's career was primarily centered in Europe. She made appearances in leading roles at many of the most important European opera houses during the 1960s, including La Scala, The Royal Opera, and the Vienna State Opera among others. She was particularly admired for her portrayal of the title heroine in Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\". In the 1970s she performed briefly as a dramatic soprano in performances at the Glyndebourne Festival, Hawaii Opera Theatre, and Vancouver Opera. After retiring from singing in 1977, she taught voice out of a private studio in Los Angeles.\n\nBorn Gussie Siet in Trenton, Lane was the daughter of a junk dealer. In 1948, having had no formal voice training, she won the Philadelphia Inquirer's annual 'Voice of Tomorrow Contest'. Winning the contest enabled her to pursue vocal studies with Elizabeth Westmoreland in Philadelphia. In 1949 she won a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Center where she made her debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra performing the title role in scenes from Bizet's \"Carmen\" under director Boris Goldovsky.\n\nIn 1950 Lane created the role of the Secretary of the Consulate in the world premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's \"The Consul\" at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia. She continued with the production when it moved to Broadway later that year where it enjoyed a successful eight-month run. She also performed the role in the UK at the Cambridge Theatre in February 1951 and in Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in May 1951. For her performance as the Secretary of the Consulate she won the Clarence Derwent Award for best supporting actress in a musical role, and the Donaldson Awards for best supporting actress and best debut performance.\n\nIn 1954 Lane returned to Broadway to appear in another Menotti world premiere, creating the role of Desideria in the Pulitzer Prize winning \"The Saint of Bleecker Street\".

She also sang Carmen for her debuts at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and the San Francisco Opera in 1959, and for her debut at the Opera Company of Boston in 1960.\n\nDuring the 1960s Lane's career was primarily based in Europe and Canada. Among the opera companies with whom she sang leading roles during this time were the Canadian Opera Company, the Edmond Opera Association, the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux, La Fenice, La Scala, Opéra National de Lyon, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi, the Teatro Massimo, Teatro Regio di Parma, Teatro Regio di Torino, the Vienna State Opera, and the Wexford Festival Opera among others. In 1961 she created the role of Beatrice in the world premiere of Renzo Rossellini's \"Uno sguardo dal ponte\" at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma; a role she also sang for the opera's American premiere with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1967. In 1968 she portrayed Desideria at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lane's career had begun to dwindle in terms of the number of bookings. She attempted to revitalize her career by switching her fach to that of a dramatic soprano; beginning with Santuzza in \"Cavalleria rusticana\" with the Vancouver Opera in 1971. She was heard later that year at the Glyndebourne Festival in the title role of Strauss' \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" and as Lady Macbeth in Verdi's \"Macbeth\". Although reviews of her performance were positive overall, she failed to elicit much more work after this point. In 1974 she gave her last performance in a staged production as Desdemona in \"Otello\" at the Hawaii Opera Theater. Her final notable project was a 1976 recording of Katerina Ismailova in Dmitri Shostakovich's \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\" for RAI.\n\nAfter retiring from the stage, Lane settled in Los Angeles where she taught voice out of a private studio. Her notable students included Pamela Scanlon, Christine Kelley, and Francis Liska. She was married to the late conductor Samuel Krachmalnick for 50 years.\n\n"}

It was located at the capital, Gaegyeong (modern-day Kaesong), and provided advanced training in the Chinese classics. It was established in 992 during the reign of Seongjong. Its name has been changed to Songgyungam in 1298 and to Songgyungwam in 1308. Its current name is Koryo (/Goryeo) Songyungwam University/University of Light Industry. A similar institution, known as the \"Gukhak\", had been established under Unified Silla, but it was not successful.\n\nThe Gukjagam was part of Seongjong's general program of Confucian reform, together with the \"gwageo\" civil service examinations and the \"hyanggyo\" provincial schools. It formed the cornerstone of the Confucian educational system he envisioned. In the waning days of Goryeo, the Gukjagam again became a centerpiece of reform through the policies of the early Neo-Confucian scholar An Hyang.\nIn the beginning, the Gukjagam provided a total of six courses of study. Of these, three divisions were restricted to children of the highest-ranking officials: Gukjahak, Taehak, and Samunhak. These were a total of nine years long, and focused on the Confucian classics.\n\nThe other three divisions were open to children of officials as low as the 8th rank: Seohak (secretarial training), Sanhak (arithmetic), and Yulhak (law). Each of these took six years to complete, and focused on technical training with a heavy admixture of the classics.\n\nA seventh division was added in 1104, in the reign of Yejong: Gangyejae (강예재), providing military training. This was the first recorded occasion of a Korean dynasty providing formal training in the military arts. Due to tensions between the aristocracy and the military, it was soon removed from the curriculum, in 1133.\n\nSeongjong's original edict of 992 provided land and slaves to support the school. However, the tuition remained prohibitive for most students not from wealthy families. In 1304, An Hyang levied a new tax which officials of the top 6 ranks had to pay in silver, and those of the lower ranks in cloth. This tax was used to defray the cost of tuition for the Gukjagam's students.\n\nThe name was changed to Gukhak in 1275, upon the ascension of King Chungnyeol. It was changed to Seonggyungam in 1298 and to Seonggyungwan in 1308, but then reverted to Gukjagam during the reign of Gongmin in 1358. The Seonggyungwan name was adopted again in 1362, and continued in use until the fall of Goryeo thirty years later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7333072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7333072", "title": "Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht", "text": "Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht\n\nHans Ulrich \"Sepp\" Gumbrecht (born 1948) is a literary theorist whose work spans philology, philosophy, literary and cultural history, and epistemologies of the everyday. A professor at Stanford University since 1989, he holds the Albert Guérard Chair as Professor in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French and Italian in Stanford's Division of Literatures, Languages, and Cultures; by courtesy, he is also affiliated with the Departments of German Studies, Iberian and Latin American Cultures, and the Program in Modern Thought and Literature.\n\nGumbrecht's writing on philosophy and modern thought extends from the Middle Ages to today and incorporates an array of disciplines and styles, at times combining historical and philosophical inquiry with elements of memoir. Much of Gumbrecht's scholarship has focused on national literatures in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German, and he is known for his work on the Western philosophical tradition, the materiality of presence, shifting views of the Enlightenment, forms of aesthetic experience, and the joys of watching sports.\n\nAs well as publishing academic works and teaching graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford, Gumbrecht is recognized as a public intellectual in Europe and South America and contributes to a range of newspapers and journals in English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n\nBorn οn June 15, 1948 in Würzburg, Germany, Gumbrecht graduated from the Siebold Gymnasium of his hometown in 1967, also having studied at Lycée Henri IV in Paris. He specialized in Romance Philology and German Literature, but also studied philosophy and sociology during his university years, which took him to Munich, Regensburg, Salamanca, Pavia, and Konstanz. After receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Konstanz in 1971, he became Assistant Professor, acquiring the \"Venia legendi\" (Habilitation) in Romance Literatures and Literary Theory in 1974.\n\nGumbrecht was a Full Professor at the University of Bochum from 1975 to 1982, and from 1983 to 1989 at the University Siegen, where he founded the first Humanities Graduate Program in Germany, which was dedicated to the topic \"Forms of Communication as Forms of Life.\" From 1983 to 1985, Gumbrecht was Vice President of the German Association of Romance Philology.\n\nHaving been offered the Albert Guérard Chair at Stanford University, he moved to Palo Alto in 1989. While at Stanford he has taught classes to graduate and undergraduate students, advised over 100 dissertations and honors theses, and continued to publish regularly.\n\nOn February 9–10, 2018, a conference titled \"After 1967: Methods and Moods in Literary Studies in Honor of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht\" was held at Stanford to commemorate Gumbrecht's fifty-year career. Over forty scholars of theory, philosophy, and literary studies who had worked with Gumbrecht attended the conference. Stanford football coach David Shaw also attended.\n\nGumbrecht has written extensively on \"Stimmung\", a German word also referencing the tuning of musical instruments, but more commonly meaning \"mood\" and as such used by Gumbrecht to indicate the mood or atmosphere of a particular era or artistic work. He has used this theme to write about both daily life on a broad cultural scale and interpretative practices in the humanities.\n\nBy identifying specific moods as temporal in nature, he attempts to capture the spirit of particular time periods and to recreate how they were experienced by people living at those times. He does so by examining how everyday activities, material and aesthetic experiences, and reading processes shape individual and cultural understandings of the world.\n\nGumbrecht's first work to locate a temporal mood was \"In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time\" (1998), which associates excitement and anticipation with the emergence of new and faster-paced activities, forms of entertainment, and ways of thinking. The book presents fragments of life from various geographical locations, large-scale events and private practices, and perspectives of both celebrities and ordinary individuals. Events described range from boxing matches to bar conversations, and Gumbrecht profiles artistic greats and public figures alongside workers, farmers, and engineers to depict the emergence of new sensibilities that transcended boundaries of class, race, gender, or nation.\n\nIn \"After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present\" (2013), Gumbrecht explores the legacy of World War II through an investigation of a widespread cultural mood, primarily in Germany but also relating to a broader response to the aftermath of war. He describes a climate \"(Stimmung)\" in which \"a disposition of violent nervousness permeates the seemingly quiet postwar world, which points to a latent state of affairs.\" The mood of latency has implications for cultural identity today in the form of a widely felt sense of inertia and a changed relationship to time: the argument is that from the vantage point of the postwar years, the future came to be viewed as a threat.\n\nWhile these are two of Gumbrecht's more detailed elaborations on temporal moods, \"Stimmung\" relates also to a broader concept of moods that can be triggered by aesthetic experiences to produce a sense of \"presence.\" Gumbrecht elaborates this theme further in his works about the material component of literary study.\n\nThrough the concept of Stimmung, Gumbrecht has argued that certain cultural events and aesthetic experiences can become \"present,\" or have a tangible effect on human senses, emotions, and bodies. This idea underlies Gumbrecht's writing about literary criticism and methods of interpretation, and also much of his other work on material forms of culture, communication, and understanding in the 20th and 21st centuries. Presence is a central concept to many of his books, including \"In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time\" (1998), \"Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey\" (2003), \"The Powers of Philology: Dynamics of Textual Scholarship\" (2003), \"Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature\" (2012), \"After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present\" (2013), and \"Our Broad Present: Time and Contemporary Culture\" (2014).\n\nThroughout his writing, Gumbrecht emphasizes the importance of material experience to consuming literature and art. In \"Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature\" (2012), Gumbrecht applies the concept of mood to the process of reading literary works. He argues that the function of literature is to \"make present,\" and treats aesthetic experiences as concrete encounters that affect a reader or viewer's physical environment or body.\n\nBy connecting presence to art, especially the art of literature, in his description of language as a material component of the world, Gumbrecht returns to his roots in the study of philology, moving beyond Deconstruction's concept of language. He writes, \"'Reading for \"Stimmung\"' always means paying attention to the textual dimension of the forms that envelop us and our bodies as a physical reality—something that can catalyze inner feelings without matters of representation necessarily being involved.\"\n\nFocusing on the atmosphere produced by a work of literature and experienced by the work's reader, he argues, is crucial to the intellectual practice of reading and analyzing literature.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with Gumbrecht, Ulrik Ekman describes Gumbrecht's work on presence as an \"extremely intricate oscillation between a move, perhaps unavoidable, towards epistemological sense-making and conceptualization on the one hand, and, on the other, an at least formally opening move in the direction of ontological concerns.\" Gumbrecht links the practice of interpretation as the search for meaning or \"sense-making\" with a form of understanding that is unique to the social and historical context, as well as the material and bodily experience, of the reader.\n\nGumbrecht's focus on presence in the reading of literature is significant for his elaboration of a \"post-hermeneutic\" form of literary criticism. He has argued that the emphasis on interpretation in academic intellectual practices is incomplete, and that the \"meaning-only\" model of understanding it produces does not account for the subjective experience of the arts.\n\nIn \"Production of Presence\" (2003), Gumbrecht critizises the status of literary study in university settings, arguing that the humanities over-emphasize the importance of interpretation, or \"the reconstruction and attribution of meaning.\" Instead, he argues for an intellectual practice that would take into account the importance of \"presence,\" or material engagement with the artistic works being examined.\n\nGumbrecht traces the emphasis on meaning and interpretation back to Early Modernity, drawing from Martin Heidegger's concept of \"Being\" and commenting on the work of many other scholars, including Jacques Derrida's writing on overcoming metaphysics. Gumbrecht critiques the emphasis on reason and rationality that originated with the Age of Enlightenment, and in particular, references Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\", \"Critique of Practical Reason\", and \"Critique of Judgment\", as well as the Cartesian tendency to exclude presence from metaphysics. These modes of conceptualization have become ingrained in philosophical analysis and other intellectual inquiry in the humanities.\n\nGumbrecht highlights the importance of modes of \"world-appropriation\" that do not focus on locating or discerning meaning. He describes three principle methods meant to define the future, non-hermeneutical function of the humanities. These are epiphany, presentification, and deixis. Epiphany refers to a moment of intensity or loss of control related to viewing an artistic work; presentification refers to immersing oneself in the past moment of the artwork's production; deixis involves the \"lived experience\" of artistic work, rather than the imposition of meaning.\n\nGumbrecht has also written on the spectatorship of sport, using philosophy and the history of athletics to present an analytical perspective on the precise ways sport is consumed and appreciated. Most notably in his book \"In Praise of Athletic Beauty\" (2006), but also in articles such as \"Epiphany of Form: On the Beauty of Team Sports\" and interviews with newspapers and academic sources, he examines the widespread cultural fascination with athletics in the 21st century and in historical contexts.\n\nGumbrecht's project is to provide a new mode for exploring and understanding the aesthetic experience of sports spectatorship, or what precisely makes certain athletic moves and plays \"beautiful.\" In his discussion of the ways beauty can be ascribed to athletes' actions, Gumbrecht describes the effect of perceiving athletes to be \"lost in focused intensity,\" and how the players' physical presence and performance of ability lead the spectator—or \"everyfan\"—to attribute meaning to athletes' movements, but also to feel affected emotionally.\n\nAmong other elements, Gumbrecht also presents as key elements of spectatorship the importance of styles of communication and sociality among fans and the spectators' sense of gratitude toward players. That gratitude is sparked by \"special moments of intensity\" when athletes appear to go beyond the limits of human performance—which, in Ancient Greek culture, was seen as occurring in the presence of the gods. This often means successful performance, but can also relate to the suffering, pain, and loss also experienced in the sporting arena.\n\nGumbrecht's writing on sport interconnects with his concepts of presence and materiality insofar as the activity of watching takes on a communal character, offering spectators \"opportunities to immerse themselves in the realm of presence.\" Gumbrecht cites Friedrich Nietzsche's distinction between Dionysian and Apollonian attitudes, where the Dionysian spectator tends \"to revel in communion both with other spectators and with the energy that emerges from the action they are following,\" while the Apollonian spectator \"has a greater affinity with the concept of analysis than with the concept of communion.\" While Gumbrecht does not present one form as superior to the other, he notes the contemporary tendency to attach social anxiety to the frenzy of crowds, linking this to \"the nightmare of Fascism still haunting the West.\"\n\nGumbrecht acknowledges the occurrence of fights and hooliganism at sporting events, but focuses instead on the sense of communion that watching athletics can produce—for example, through acts of cheering, chanting, or even doing \"the Wave.\" Though he asks how modern media technology has changed the viewing habits of sports fans, his focus is on the sensation of presence—even if that presence is produced through the illusion of the screen. The energy of the crowd, in combination with the other aesthetic and emotional responses evoked by watching athletic aptitude, leads to the range of \"fascinations\" Gumbrecht incorporates into his method for describing and expressing appreciation for sport.\n\nIn addition to his work on presence, materiality, and hermeneutics in the humanities, Gumbrecht's main areas of research, teaching, and publishing include:\nGumbrecht's publications are extensive and in many languages. He wrote primarily in German during his early career, and in English after moving to the United States in 1989. He also writes in Spanish and Portuguese, and his works are regularly translated into French, Hungarian, Korean, Russian, and several other languages.\n\nAlthough Gumbrecht continues to teach at Stanford, he is affiliated with other universities and is a visiting professor or associate professor at institutions worldwide. He is Associate Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Montréal, an instructor and board member at the School of Criticism and Theory at Cornell University, a Fellow at the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation in Munich and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, an Affiliate Professor at Collège de France and the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Gumbrecht regularly contributes commentaries on contemporary culture to journals and newspapers in English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, notably the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", and \"Estado de São Paulo\".\n\nAt Stanford, Gumbrecht convenes the Philosophical Reading Group along with Italian Literature professor Robert Harrison. The professors initiated the group in 1989 to provide students and faculty with an opportunity to engage in philosophical close reading and analytical discussion on a weekly basis. Over an academic quarter, the Group discusses one contemporary or historical text from the Western philosophical tradition.\n\n\n\n"}

The housemaster is responsible for the supervision and care of boarders in the house and typically lives on the premises. The term houseparent is also sometimes used, most commonly when a married couple share the role. In addition, there is often an assistant housemaster (or assistant housemistress) acting as a deputy.\n\nThe Housemaster's primary role is leading and running their boarding house, along with (if any) an assistant housemaster/mistress, resident tutors, senior prefects or a pupil 'head-of-house'. \nThe Housemaster has a vast range of duties and responsibilities, ranging from the pastoral care of their boarders to everyday basic maintenance, laundry and organisational tasks. His top priority is caring for his boarders' physical and mental well-being and he does this by getting to know his charges, guiding them daily and offering them support and advice. The Housemaster acts as the parent or leader of the house and deals with any problem the boarder may have.\nDepending on the size of the house he may or may not have a team of staff working with him, such as other pastoral staff, housekeeping/cleaning staff and medical. \nThe list of duties could consist of anything that a child needs help with, to the physical upkeep of the building and administrative work.\n\nThe Housemaster additionally may be a teacher, sports coach, cadet forces instructor, or just a Housemaster, etc. In this way, he is often involved in the activities his boarders undertake.\n\nOften, as the post is almost always residential, a close bond develops between the boarders and Housemaster. The Housemaster has the care of his boarders, not only as his job, but - depending on the individual - will have it as a personal way of life. As boarders obviously live together and make friends with each other, a community spirit fosters between the boarders themselves and naturally the Housemaster leading them. Many boarding houses have names, sometimes of a famous person, or a person with a strong connection and important history within the school, or they may be more functional names. Many schools, like Shrewsbury, will have houses named after old-boys or important figures of the school, whilst others, like Eton, will refer to houses mostly by the initials of the housemaster. \nRegardless of the name, with each house having an identity, a sense of pride develops for the Housemaster to see his house as a fine one, with good qualities as the fabric of it. Many houses are known for certain attributes or characteristics, such as hard-working, kind, organized, good at sports, musical, academically-gifted or noble and brave. The Housemaster will have an important part in ensuring the good reputation and image that his house develops.\n\nThe Housemaster is the master of discipline, as well as support, for the boarders. He maintains authority in his own manner within his house (and across the school). It is a semi-autonomous position and the Housemaster may have a wide range of ways in dealing with unruly or unwanted behaviour, such as official sanctions (such as detentions or extra duties), but must also recognise when negative behaviour may be covering something worse that his happening in his boarder's life, which will require more tact. The Housemaster will frequently be the first port-of-call for other members of staff, including non-boarding teachers and boarding staff, when they have queries of a boarder. So the Housemaster must be prepared to give an honest, accurate account of the boarder as a whole, as well as defend if necessary the boarder if he is in trouble. \nIn the boarders' eyes, the Housemaster is the ultimate (less parents or Headmaster/mistress) person who they know will always condemn or support certain behaviour and actions of the boarder.\n\n\n"}

Brown was one of the first graduates of El Paso High School. She was the first person to teach music in the public schools in Texas and El Paso and was the first woman to own a bicycle in El Paso. Brown is also one of the original creators of the El Paso International Museum which later became the El Paso Museum of Art.\n\nBrown was born in Missouri on December 17, 1871. She was raised in Sherman, Texas where she took music lessons at the North Texas Female College. Brown's sister, Francis Moore, would later become a well-known pianist in New York. Brown came to El Paso in 1886 with her family. She served as a bridesmaid for Anne Buford, who married into the Magoffin family in 1887. Brown was in the first graduating class of El Paso High School, and was one of the two graduates in 1887. When she graduated, she went with her father to San Diego, California where she received a second high school diploma from a high school there in 1889. \n\nShe returned to El Paso again in 1890, a year after her father died. She then began to teach music in the public schools and was the first person to do so in both El Paso and Texas. Brown was the first woman to own and ride a bicycle in El Paso, Texas. She used the bike to get to the schools she taught at, pedaling through sand in some places. She taught music in the public schools until 1899. She also wrote about the history of music in El Paso.\n\nBrown married William R. Brown, a railroad agent for the Santa Fe railroad, on June 29, 1898. Her husband was a cornet player and also enjoyed music. Brown continued to play piano and organ and also organized various musical groups in El Paso. \n\nBrown joined the El Paso Woman's Club in 1899. She was the head of the El Paso Woman's Club's music department. Brown was also a member of the first board of directors for the El Paso School for Girls (Radford School) in 1910. Also in 1910, Brown became the president of the Woman's Club and held meetings at her home. Later, she was on the executive board of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1917, she formed an auxiliary of the Woman's Club devoted to music, called the MacDowell Club, named after Edward MacDowell.\n\nBrown became the second woman elected to the El Paso School Board in 1921. She recalled later that the Ku Klux Klan attempted to infiltrate politics within the board, and she said, \"I worked hard as a board member and stood for justice.\" She later became the state chair of Child Welfare in 1923. Brown helped originate the idea for the El Paso International Museum (later known as the El Paso Museum of Art) in 1925. She served as an organizer for the museum and worked as a chair on the board. In 1933, she was the president of the Pioneer Women's Association.\n\nBrown's husband died in 1934. Kate Moore Brown inherited his estate.\n\nBrown was president of the El Paso Symphony Association and helped get the organization incorporated in 1937. Brown also served on the board for the El Paso Public Library. She was president of the library board in 1936. \n\nBrown collected the fans and shawls belonging to notable women from around the world. Brown donated her collection of over 300 fans to the El Paso International Museum. She died on March 28, 1945.\n\n"}

Development began in 1992 by the Consortium for Service Innovation, a non-profit alliance of service organizations. Its methodology is to integrate use of a knowledge base into the workflow.\n\nWhile the legacy of KCS lies in customer support organizations, the methodology is now being adopted across all the functions of business, as noted in the latest version of the KCS v6 Practices Guide.\n\nKCS seeks to:\n\nWith over 20 years in development and over $50 million invested in developing the methodology, KCS has produced significant benefits for support organizations around the world, including Apollo Group, Autodesk, Avaya, Dell, EMC, Ericsson, HP Enterprise, Omgeo/DTCC, Oracle, PTC, Salesforce.com and SDL.\n\nThe KCS Academy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Consortium for Service Innovation. The KCS Academy is the only designated certification body by the Consortium for Service Innovation. The KCS Academy offers certification programs for people and a KCS \"Verified\" program for knowledge base tools that enable the KCS practices.\n\nDevelopment began in 1992 by the Consortium for Service Innovation, a non-profit alliance of support organizations. Its premise is to capture, structure, and reuse technical support knowledge. Initially it was known as Solution-Centered Support, and was renamed to acknowledge the methodology as best practices in knowledge management.\n\nThe Consortium for Service Innovation was founded in Seattle in 1992 by Symbologic. Shelly Benton was the founding Executive Director and built the membership-based organization. The early work of the Consortium was used to identify features and functionality for a tool that would help organizations capture and reuse knowledge as a by-product of doing work.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994 the nature of the member's conversation was largely focused on technology. However the members began to see that success in capturing and reusing knowledge was more about people and their behaviors than it was about the tool. From 1994 to 1996 the conversation shifted to defining a methodology that focused on people and the organizational culture.\n\nAs the conversation evolved both the members of the Consortium and Symbologic agreed that the Consortium's work was about much more than technology and that both the work and the members would be better served by being independent and vendor agnostic. In 1996 Greg Oxton, who was a member of the Consortium at the time, joined the Consortium staff with the goal of creating a member funded non-profit organization.\n\nIn January 1997 the Consortium became an independent legal entity registered as a 501(c)(6) with the Internal Revenue Service. At that time it was called the Customer Support Consortium.\n\nFrom 1997 through 1999 the Consortium members began to report dramatic benefits from implementing the methodology. In 1999 the Consortium released the first Practices Guide. This was written by Livia Wilson and John Chamj. With the help of the members who shared their adoption experiences and results Wilson and Chamj created the first prescriptive, comprehensive definition on how to do KCS.\n\nFor the next few years the Consortium facilitated member conversations and based on a model of collective thinking and shared experiences continued to evolve the KCS methodology.\n\nIn 2003, HDI partnered with the Consortium for Service Innovation to promote the learnings and experiences of the Consortium's members to the market. Working together, they captured this information into a three-day workshop: The Knowledge Management Foundations: KCS Principles course now known as \"KCS Principles\". Since that time, hundreds of companies have been learning about and implementing Knowledge Centered Service within their environments.\n\nIn 2005, the Consortium for Service Innovation introduced the KCS-Verified program for knowledge management software vendors. There are a number of popular software applications verified to enable the KCS best practices to learn more about KCS Verified products. This program defines the functional requirements that software vendors must implement to successfully enable KCS. Implementation is then verified by KCS certified at one of levels, \"Aligned\" or \"Verified\". Program implementation is enabled through experts through the Consortium for Service Innovation or other certified practitioners.\n\nIn 2006, the Consortium updated KCS to version 4.1 and published the Practices Guide. Version 5.0 and 5.1 were published in 2011. Version 5.3 was published in 2012 and version 6.0 in 2016. They continue to evolve KCS through the experiences of their members and other companies that share their personal stories.\n\nIn 2007, HDI introduced the first KCS certification in the industry with the KCS Principles Certification that allows individuals to demonstrate their knowledge of the KCS methodology and how to implement it.\n\nIn 2010, The KCS Academy was formed as an outreach company of the Consortium for Service Innovation. Development of the KCS Certified Publisher exam began and became publicly available in 2011.\n\nIn June 2014, AXELOS and HDI jointly published a whitepaper on the Synergies between ITIL and KCS. While KCS and ITIL were developed independently, guidance on how these two best practices can be used together to enhance service management processes is helping support organizations to improve their operations.\n\nIn April 2016, the Consortium for Service Innovation released KCS v6. This released renamed Knowledge Centered Support to Knowledge Centered Service. The terminology in the methodology was updated to be more generic as KCS adoption has expanded beyond the technical support environment to the enterprise. The following documents were published: KCS Principles and Core Concepts and the KCS v6 Practices Guide\n\n"}

Landon Lecture Series is a series of speeches on current public affairs, which is organized and hosted by Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. It is named after Kansas politician Alf Landon, former Governor of Kansas and Republican presidential candidate. The first lecture in the series was given by Landon on December 13, 1966.\n\nThe lecture series has been described as \"prestigious,\" and Eric Lichtblau noted in his 2008 book \"Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice\" that the \"Landon Lecture Series has provided an unlikely but powerful platform allowing world leaders, from Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger, to expound on the critical public issues of the day.\"\n\nAmong the speakers who have delivered Landon Lectures are nine Nobel laureates, eight Pulitzer Prize-winners, and more than 40 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.\n\nSeven of the ten men to serve as U.S. President since the series began in 1966 have delivered Landon lectures (excluding Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump). George W. Bush (2006), Ronald Reagan (1982) and Richard Nixon (1970) delivered speeches during their tenure in office. Bill Clinton (2007), Jimmy Carter (1991) and Gerald Ford (1978) spoke after leaving office. George H. W. Bush delivered a Landon Lecture while serving as Vice President of the United States in 1985, before being elected to the Presidency. Before Reagan delivered his Landon Lecture as U.S. President in 1982, he previously spoke in the series in 1967, while Governor of California.\n\nOther sitting U.S. federal officials to speak in the series include: Vice President Walter Mondale; Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield; Minority Leaders Hugh Scott, Howard Baker and Tom Daschle; House Speakers Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright; Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Sonia Sotomayor; and Attorney General Janet Reno. In addition, nine current or former foreign heads of state have also spoken in the series, including former Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, former Malawian President Joyce Banda, and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.\n\nU.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was one of twenty-two active U.S. Senators to deliver a lecture in the series (including also his brother Ted Kennedy in 1984). Kennedy's speech on March 18, 1968, \"Conflict in Vietnam and at Home\", is notable for being the first speech Kennedy delivered after announcing his much-anticipated candidacy for the U.S. presidency two days earlier. The campaign speech was attended by a crowd of 14,500 people, and Kennedy used the opportunity to share anti-war views on the Vietnam War. Evan Thomas wrote in his biography of Kennedy that \"the setting was ideal for a raucous campaign kickoff.\" Kennedy was assassinated less than three months later, on June 6, 1968, after winning the California Democratic primary.\n\nU.S. General William Westmoreland, a main target for student protests against the Vietnam War, spoke on April 9, 1969. The alternative newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, wrote afterwards: \"The man himself came to speak to the students of Kansas State. Yes, General William Westmoreland decided to deliver his first college lecture since returning from Viet Nam here, and he could not have picked a better place. Kansas State students will be courteous at all times... The General was greeted by applause, by cheering, by approval.\"\n\nU.S. President Richard Nixon spoke at the Landon Lecture Series on September 16, 1970. As student protestors gathered outside, Nixon delivered what the \"Christian Science Monitor\" called \"one of the strongest and most uncompromising speeches of his career,\" denouncing the protests as part of a \"cancerous disease\" that is gripping the United States. Nixon asserted: \"we face the greatest crisis in the history of American education today.\" The complete speech was aired on network television, and then rebroadcast on several local stations after Nixon supporters purchased time to re-air it.\n\nFormer Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith was scheduled to deliver a Landon Lecture on October 31, 1980. The speech was disrupted by protestors objecting to the denial of voting rights to blacks in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) under Smith's governance. Due to the controversy, the speech was recategorized as a non-Landon Lecture and is not included in the history of the series.\n\nMSNBC news reporter Ashleigh Banfield delivered a Landon Lecture on April 24, 2003. Banfield used the forum to raise concerns regarding media coverage of the Iraq War. She spoke against \"cable news operators who wrap themselves in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic\" and specifically named Fox News Channel as an example. \"The New York Times\" reported that her speech angered NBC management, who rebuked her and lowered her profile.\n\nOn January 23, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke at the Landon Lecture, one month after news reports broke the story of the U.S. government's warrantless wiretapping of telephone conversations in the United States. In his Landon Lecture, Bush gave the domestic wiretapping program the name of \"Terrorist Surveillance Program\" for the first time. Before Bush's speech, NPR aired a piece comparing Bush's Landon Lecture speech to Nixon's appearance in the series in 1970, noting both were defending their national security policies \"as public discontent with a foreign war persists.\"\n\nThrough March 2017 there have been 177 Landon Lectures, featuring 180 speakers. The most recent speaker was Joyce Banda, the former president of Malawi, who spoke on January 29, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, the speaker held the office indicated below at the time the Landon Lecture was delivered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47490492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47490492", "title": "Logitech Harmony", "text": "Logitech Harmony\n\nLogitech Harmony is a line of remote controls and home automation products produced by Logitech. The line includes universal remote products designed for controlling the components of home theater systems (including televisions, set-top boxes, DVD and Blu-ray players, video game consoles) and other devices that can be controlled via infrared, as well as newer \"Hub\" products that can be used to additionally control supported Internet of things (IoT) and Smart home products, and allow the use of mobile apps to control devices.\n\nThe Harmony remote control was originally created in 2001 by Easy Zapper, a Canadian company, and first sold in November 2001. The company later changed its name to Intrigue Technologies and was located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Computer peripheral manufacturer Logitech acquired it in May 2004 for US$29 million, turning Harmony remotes into a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nAll Harmony remotes prior to the 2015 Harmony Elite are set up online and retrieve settings via a computer's USB port. The 2015 Elite model introduced the ability to set up the remote with a mobile device app.\n\nEach remote has infrared (IR) learning capability (some later models also include RF support), and can upload information about a new remote to an online device database. 5000+ brands of devices were supported.\n\nAll Harmony remotes support one-touch activity based control, which allows control of multiple devices at once. For example, a home theater setup might include a TV, a digital set top box and a home theater sound system. Pressing the 'Watch TV' activity button on the remote will turn on the TV, turn on digital set top box, turn on the sound system, switch the input of TV to the digital set top box and switch the input of the sound system to the set top box. In addition, the volume buttons would be mapped to the sound system, the channel buttons would be mapped to the digital set to box, and other controls to the most appropriate system component for the activity.\n\nThe remote software allows users to update the remote configuration, learn IR commands, and upgrade the remote control's firmware.\n\nEarly versions of the remote software required a web browser; newer versions are Java-based. The software requires constant Internet connectivity while programming the remote, as remote control codes are downloaded from Logitech. This method allows updates to the product database, remote codes, and macro sequences to be easily distributed. This also allows Logitech to survey their market in order to determine products for investigation and research. Harmony control software is available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. A group of developers was working on Harmony Remote software for the Linux operating system; the latest available release was dated August 2010.\n\nOn March 31, 2010 Logitech launched a new website called \"My Harmony\" for setting up several later Harmony remote controls.\n\nAs of January 2017, the current products being sold in the Harmony line are:\n\nThe lowest-budget version of the Harmony remote, which can control up to 8 devices in particular categories, and supports only one activity: Watch TV. Unlike most current and former products in the Harmony line, this model lacks a display screen.\n\nThe lowest-cost version of the Harmony remote that contains a display screen, which is color. It can be programmed with multiple activities and up to 8 devices.\n\nThis device is not a remote, but rather a hub that can control IR and Bluetooth devices, as well as certain smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, Nest thermostat). It is controlled by certain Harmony remotes as well iOS/Android based apps, and more recently Alexa can control certain functions. By itself, it can control up to 8 home theater devices and an amount of home automation devices. A lot of the current products include this along with the remote. This replaces the older Harmony Ultimate Hub, Harmony Home Hub and Harmony Link devices.\n\nIncludes a Harmony Home Hub and a simple remote control that contains three activity buttons used to activate up to 6 different activities. The simple remote lacks a display screen, and can also be purchased separately for those who already own a Harmony Home Hub. Supports up to 8 devices.\n\nLike the Harmony Smart Control described above, but the included Simple Remote also contains home automation controls. Like the Smart Control Simple Remote, the included remote lacks a display screen, but it cannot be purchased for Home Hub owners unlike the Smart Control remote.\n\nThis includes the Harmony Hub along with a keyboard containing a built-in trackpad. The keyboard appears to be like Logitech's previous K400 keyboard and trackpad combo, except some of the keys and buttons have been replaced with others more useful to a home theater remote, and two numbered, Harmony-specific USB receivers are included. It lacks a display screen, supports three activities (Watch a Movie, Watch TV, and Listen to Music), and can also be purchased as an add-on accessory for Harmony Home Hub owners. It controls up to 8 devices.\n\nThe Harmony Touch remote control contains a full-color display screen with touch functionality. It is an IR remote that supports up to 15 devices and multiple activities. It lacks dedicated physical buttons for home automation control. This remote can be added to a Harmony Hub for additional functionality. No longer available from the manufacturer, but still available via retail.\n\nThe Harmony Ultimate One remote control is a revised version of the Harmony Touch adding motion-activated back-lit keys, eyes-free gesture control, tilt sensor and vibration feedback. This remote can be added to a Harmony Hub for additional functionality. The Harmony Ultimate is a bundle containing both the Harmony Ultimate One remote control and the Harmony Hub but this pack is no longer available from the manufacturer, but still available via retail.\n\nIncludes the Harmony Home Hub and a remote similar to the above described Harmony Ultimate One. The package includes four IR emitters, the remote, the hub, and two IR extenders that plug into the hub. Pressing a button on the included remote or any add-on remote will first communicate with the hub, then the hub will tell the one of the four IR emitters based on configuration (including the IR emitter on the remote) to transmit the command. Harmony Ultimate Home also contains home automation controls, unlike the Ultimate One. The remote can't be purchased separately for Home Hub owners, unlike most of the other remotes that include it. It supports a maximum of 15 devices.\n\nThe current top of the range Harmony available via retail. The Harmony 950 is a redesigned version of the Harmony Ultimate One with the addition of dedicated physical buttons for home automation control. Other changes include the media transport control buttons being relocated to a more ergonomic location, and the addition of user accessible battery compartment. This remote can be added to a Harmony Hub for additional functionality. The Harmony Elite is a bundle containing both the Harmony 950 remote control and the Harmony Hub.\n\n\nThe Harmony E-R0001 is an IR to Bluetooth adapter for the PS3.\n\nThe Harmony RF Wireless Extender allows some Harmony remotes, \"e.g.\", models 890, 1000 and 1100, to control devices using radio frequencies instead of infrared, with longer range than infrared and no need for line-of-sight transmission. The Harmony 1000 can use two RF Extenders, while the 1100 can use multiple extenders.\n\nThe Harmony IR Extender System has an IR blaster and a set of mini blasters, and does not require programming. It is manufactured by Philips and rebadged.\n\nA device which utilizes a mobile app as a remote to control devices within the room. It has since been succeeded by the newer Harmony Hub product, which also supports controlling Smart home products. On November 8, 2017, Logitech announced that it would end support for the Harmony Link and make the devices inoperable after March 18, 2018, citing an expired security certificate for a component in the platform. Following criticism of Logitech's originally-announced plan to do so for users whose devices were still under warranty, Logitech announced on November 10, 2017 that it would exchange all Harmony Links for Harmony Hubs free-of-charge, regardless of warranty status.\n\nThe Harmony 500 remotes are mid-range remotes that is similar in functionality to the Harmony 659 and 670, but with different button arrangements and a squared-off physical design compared to the hourglass design of the 6xx series. Compared to today's offerings, these remotes offered control of up to 15 devices at an affordable price. The remotes have a back-lit monochrome LCD screen. The 500 series seems to be discontinued entirely.\n\nWhile it's marketed for the Xbox 360 segment, this remote must be said to be part of the 5xx series. It runs the same software. The Harmony 360 is pre-configured to be used with the Xbox 360 console, and has special buttons, X, Y, A, B and media center control, correlating with the same as found on native Xbox controllers. It has a back-lit LCD screen and uses four AAA batteries.\nThe hardware layout is mostly the same as the 550. The extra up/down arrows of the 550 is removed to make room for the colored X, Y, A and B buttons beneath the play and pause rows. This would make it the remote in the 500 series with the most hardware buttons, 54 (counting the four direction arrow keys). It can control up to 12 devices.\n\nThe Harmony 510/515 is an entry-level remote that is essentially a replacement to the 500 series and the Xbox 360 version. It has the same number of buttons as the 525 and features colored buttons typical on most satellite boxes. It has a four-button, monochrome LCD display. This remote is software limited to controlling up to five devices. Like its mid-range cousins, the 520 and 550, it has no recharge pod and uses AAA batteries instead. Unlike previous 500 series models, these newer models have been limited to 5 devices in software, yet sell for the same prices.\n\nDifference between 510/515:\nThe 510 is black; the 515 is silver.\n\nThe Harmony 520 is a mid-range remote that is similar in functionality to the Harmony 659 and 670, but with a different button arrangement and a squared-off physical design compared to the hourglass design of the 6xx series. It has a blue back-light and monochrome LCD screen. These 5xx models are equipped with an infrared learning port to learn IR signals of unsupported or unknown devices. By pointing an original remote control at the Harmony's learning port, it is able to copy and reproduce those codes and, in the case of supported devices, it is able to figure out what the remote is used to control and imports that device. They require 4 AAA batteries. A mini USB port is used to connect these to a computer for programming.\n\nDifference between 520/525:\nThe 525 has 50 buttons, while the 520 has 46. It lacks the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. Apparently, the 520 is the American model while the 525 is the European. The 520 and 525 can control up to 12 and 15 devices respectively.\n\nThe harmony 550/555 remotes are variants of the 525 remote. Compared to the model 525, the 550 and 555 have two extra buttons, and are made of higher grade materials with different colors. The 550 and 555 models both have a sound and a picture button that changes the button mapping on the remote, allowing for reuse of the same physical buttons for different set of functionality. 52 buttons.\n\nDifference between 550/555:\nThe 550 and 555 have the same number and placement of buttons, just with different mapping. The 555 have the same color buttons as the 525. The 550 does not, instead it has the following extra functions: Up arrow, Down arrow, A and B buttons. The 555 has orange back-light, the 550 has blue.\n\nThe Harman/Kardon TC 30 appears to be a redesigned, rebranded Harmony 52x with a cradle and a color LCD. The LCD has eight items compared to the four of the rest of the Harmony 5xx series. Images exist of the TC 30 both with and without the teletext color buttons. This might mean that there's one version based on the 520 and one based on the 525. The key layout is identical to the 52x remotes. It seems to require different software from the Logitech branded remotes — however at the moment you can download this software from Logitech via harmonyremote.com.\n\nThe Harmony 610 is functionally identical to the Harmony 670 and Harmony 620, but comes in black with a silver face panel. The 610 can control a maximum of 5 devices.\n\nThe Harmony 620 is functionally identical to the Harmony 670, but comes in black instead of silver/black. The 670 can control up to 15 devices, where the 620 can only control 12 devices.\n\n\nThe Harmony 659 is another mid-range universal remote that offers most of the functionality in the Harmony line. It has a monochrome LCD screen.\n\n\nThe Harmony 670 is a mid-range universal remote that offers most of the functionality in the Harmony line. The 670 has a monochrome LCD screen and puts DVR functions in the middle of the remote. Logitech has discontinued this product.\n\n\nThe Harmony 680 is a mid-range, computer programmable universal remote. The 680 has a back lit monochrome LCD screen, and Media PC specific.\nbuttons. Unlike many newer Harmony remotes, the 680 is able to control up to 15 devices.\n\n\nThe Harmony 688 was (no longer produced) a mid-range, computer programmable universal remote. The H688 has a monochrome LCD screen and is back lit by an Electro Luminescent sheet (blue in color).\n\nThe Harmony 720 was initially offered exclusively through Costco in 2006 and featured a color screen and backlit keys. It was designed as an inexpensive competitor to the earlier Harmony 880, with few differences, except for the ergonomic design and key layout. It is now available through other vendors, but remains unlisted on Logitech's product page.\n\nThe harmony 720 remote is closely related to the 500 series, as it has a square shape and a layout akin to those remotes. When compared to the 525, you will find the same buttons above the LCD. The 720 has a colour LCD with six buttons/activities instead of four. The eight play/stop etc. buttons have been moved to the lower part. The Mute and Prev buttons have been moved and in their place, there are extra up and down buttons — same as on the 550. Compared to the 500 series, the glow button has been removed. These remotes do not have the Sound and Picture buttons to change key mappings, like the 550/555 remotes does. Lacking red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons, the 720 has 49 buttons. It can control up to 12 devices.\n\n\nThe Harmony 768 is a capsule-shaped remote with a backlit LCD screen it was available in silver, blue or red. It has 32 buttons, as well as a clickable thumb-wheel to scroll through and select activities.\n\nThe harmony 785 is nearly identical to the 720. While the 720 has 49 buttons, the 785 has 53. The extra buttons are the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. These are located above the number buttons, which are placed further down compared to the 720. Another difference from the 720 is that the 785 can control up to 15 devices.\n\nThe Harmony 880 was the first Harmony with a color LCD screen and a rechargeable battery. The Harmony 885 remote has extra buttons as mentioned below. The 885 replaces up and down keys with four color keys used for Teletext and, more recently, by some set-top boxes.\n\nThere was a short-lived 880Pro that had the picture and sound buttons. This remote did not feature multi-room/multi-controller support like the 890Pro.\n\nThe 885 has the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. These four buttons occupy the same space where the 880 has two selection buttons (up arrow, down arrow).\n\nThe Harmony 890/895 is the same as the 880/885, but it adds radio frequency (RF) capability, enabling the remote to control devices even without line-of-sight to and from different rooms, up to a range of 30 meters. This remote control cannot control proprietary RF devices, but it can control special Z-Wave RF devices, as well as IR devices without line-of-sight via the RF extender.\n\nThe 890Pro adds multi-room and multi-controller support, as well as a different color scheme. (Primary and secondary remotes can be set up that work with the same wireless extender) It also adds two buttons — picture and sound — that allow for quick access to picture- and sound-related commands. It is not listed on the Logitech Web site and is sold through custom installation companies. The 890Pro is not shipped with the RF extender.\n\nThe Harmony 1000 has customizable touch screen commands, sounds and a rechargeable battery, and allows control up to 15 devices. It is also compatible with the RF extender. A maximum of two extenders can be configured within the software.\n\nThe universal remote has 1 activity support (Watch TV), and control up to 4 devices. The remote supports customizes key with remote features and favorite channels. This remote has no LCD, and like the discontinued 500 series mid-range models, no battery charge pod. Requires two AA batteries.\n\n\nSupport for up to 5 devices. Monochrome display. Requires 2 AA batteries.\n\nSupport for up to 5 devices. Color display. Requires 2 AA batteries.\n\nSupport for up to 6 devices. Color display. Rechargeable AA batteries via USB.\n\nThe Harmony One features a color touch screen and is rechargeable. It does not offer any RF capability. A CNET TV review stated that it is one of the best universal remotes on the market today.\n\nHarmony 900 has the same ergonomics design as Harmony One. It has additional four color buttons compared to Harmony One and RF supported. The RF technology used by Harmony 900 is not comparable with Harmony 890, 1000, and 1100. The Harmony 900 and 1100 models do not support \"sequences\" (Logitech parlance for macros).\n\nAdds QVGA resolution to the touch screen and allows 15 devices to be controlled.\n\nThe user interface of the Harmony 1100 is now Flash based vs the Java based one found in the Harmony 1000.\n\n\n"}

He co-founded the Alliance Film/Video Cooperative in 1993 (with William Keddell) and the Anti Film Festival in 1994. Some of his most widely screened films are Unknown Unknown(s), (2009) USSA: Secret Manual of the Soviet Politburger, (2001) Agent Orange, the feature film The Subversion Agency (2004) and the documentary \"60 Seconds of Solitude in Year Zero\".\n\nFor many years Boswell has taught at the San Francisco Art Institute, The Ringling College of Art and Design, Florida, and the Pratt Institute in New York. He was awarded the 2004 International Media Art Award from The ZKM Museum in Karlsruhe Germany for his film The End of Copenhagen. He has also lectured internationally on agit-prop cinema at the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, the Wolfsonian/FIU Museum Of Propaganda in Miami Beach, the Magis Film Conference in Italy, and the Ruskin College of Art at Oxford University, England. During the mid-nineties he edited numerous projects for Doris Wishman during the last phase of her career in Miami Beach.\n\nBoswell’s work is sometimes noted for its elliptical montage structure featuring a wild concoction of appropriated film materials coupled with his own production footage. Another aspect of this process is his usage of subtitles over original scenes from iconic films that leads toward an entirely different storyline.\n\nDuring the 2009 Cambridge Film Festival in England the British film critic Laura J Smith wrote: He refers to his work as “Nova-Kino” a pertinent cinematic theory for filmmakers and media artists alike who, as Boswell describes, “utilise found footage as source material to be re-edited or re-animated, giving radical rebirth or second life in their reconstructed state.” A vital element of Nova-Kino is “the usage of critical, political, and other highly charged points of view embedded within the structure of the work that challenge hegemonic power structures at large or in more specific realms.” By no accident, these aesthetics are undeniably similar to those of Agit-Prop cinema, which Boswell labels “the eternal bi-product of the Russian Revolution.” \n\nIn Helsinki 2003 during the Avanto Festival, for the European premiere of his first feature film\"The Subversion Agency\" – the Finnish film critic Manu Haapalainen wrote: The black and white film feels and looks like a version of Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\", set in Cuba, directed by Jean-Luc Godard and scripted by William Burroughs. The film's intricate and non-linear plot has to do with the adventures of an American arms dealer in a perplexing country called K-Zone. K-Zone is like a cross between Cuba and a kind of socialist America imaginable only in an alternative reality. \"The Subversion Agency\" is an extremely stylish work on the level of both image and sound. The aged, grainy archival material has been allowed to dictate the visual look of the whole film. The soundtrack of \"The Subversion Agency\" is chock full of something resembling electronic music, hissing sounds, beeps and interferences. The film's narrative is repeatedly interrupted by auditive and visual discontinuities and disturbances. The experience is voyeuristic and somewhat enigmatic.\n\nNova-Kino is an experimental cinematic movement with departure points from the Russian twenties, film noir, situationism, the classical avant-garde, and post-modern appropriationist theory. The movement is blatantly left with variations of classical anarchism, situationism and Marxist paranoia of unrestrained capitalism.\nNova-Kino is a technologically advanced medium that incorporates digital, celluloid, analog, and pseudo-redundant motion picture technologies that en somme, actualize the free market mantra of \"the democratization of technology.\"\nNova-Kino's fire-brand critique of Capitalism, Americanism, and Technotopia will make its acceptance into the traditional venues of exhibition, distribution, and production DIFFICULT - but not impossible.\nNova-Kino is an investigation into the political structure of the past, present, and future. It does not operate under any sequential formula. Therefore, it is a Buddhist attack on the narrative structure of History. However, unlike the old guard/avant-garde, Nova-Kino wholeheartedly embraces the telling of \"stories.\" Nova-Kino is therefore the simultaneous raconteur of the past and prophet of the present.\nNova-Kino does not recognize the traditional property rights of the West. More specifically, the further Hollywood advances its tautological consumerism on Society, the further WE attack! Nova-Kino is like an Indian Casino; paradoxical, autonomous, and ultimately wise...\n\n\n"}

These artists included Angela Lansbury, Arthur Miller, Ingmar Bergman, Jacob Lawrence, and Stephen Sondheim. It was announced in 2009 that the Meadows Award would be replaced by the Meadows Prize, an international arts residency. The prize allows up to four artists to interact with Meadows students and affiliated arts organizations and leave a lasting legacy in Dallas, whether a piece of artwork for the community or a new composition to be performed locally. The inaugural recipients were eighth blackbird and Creative Time.\n\nMeadows alumni have won notable prizes including the Pulitzer Prize, Tony Award, Emmy Awards, and Academy Awards.\n\nAdvertising students placed first in the National Student Advertising Competition twice between 2002 and 2004. In two years, three CCPA students ranked in the top 10 of a PRWeekly competition.\n\nAlumni artists and art historians contribute to museums and collections nationwide, including New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art.\n\nOn February 28, 2006, SMU announced that the Meadows Foundation had given a gift of $33 million USD to the Meadows School and to the affiliated Meadows Museum. This gift is the largest single donation in the history of the Meadows Foundation. It is also the third largest individual contribution ever made to SMU, surpassed by two gifts of $35 million USD.\n\n"}

Robinson, who is described as the \"chief architect\" of the organization, has presented a history of the group and its website in the book \"Religion on the Internet: Research Prospects and Promises\" (edited by Jeffrey K. Hadden and Douglas E. Cowan). In 2008, the group consisted of an Agnostic, an Atheist, a Christian, a Wiccan and a Zen Buddhist.\n\nFeeling that much of the information spread about religious minorities was inaccurate, the group created its ReligiousTolerance.org website in an attempt to explain the nature of these beliefs. Satanism, Wicca, other Neopagan religions and New Age were some of the first belief systems they focused on. The site has hosted over eight thousand articles devoted to the description of numerous religions and religious controversies.\n\nThe group has stated that religious tolerance does not mean having to accept that the beliefs of others are true, or will lead to the same God, but rather it means according to others the right to choose their beliefs without being oppressed or discriminated against: \"We can believe that members of another religious group are hopelessly deluded, and still support their right to enjoy religious freedom\".\n\nHaving originally begun as an informal group, the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance were registered as a sole proprietorship in 1996, one year after the website had first been made available online. In addition to his writings on the website, Robinson has also contributed a chapter on \"Satanic Ritual Abuse\" to \"The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions\" (2001), edited by James R. Lewis.\n\nIn \"Dimensions of Human Behavior\", Elizabeth D. Hutchison described Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance as \"an agency that promotes religious tolerance as a human right\". In \"Teaching New Religious Movements\" (2007), David G. Bromley has listed ReligiousTolerance.org among recommended secondary research sources on new religious movements to be used in concert with movement and countermovement sources. Rebecca Moore, a scholar teaching Religious Studies at San Diego State University, described the ReligiousTolerance.org website as a \"massive education program\" and she expressed regret that her students dismissed the site at first because it supported itself with advertising. A 2005 online literacy guide (\"IssueWeb: A Guide and Sourcebook for Researching Controversial Issues on the Web\") has listed ReligiousTolerance.org as a suggested research resource on abortion, assisted suicide, religious tolerance, gay rights and hate groups/hate crimes. The \"New York Times\" noted in 2002 that access to the site was blocked to Internet users in Saudi Arabia.\n\n"}

Most media attention has focused on Kaufman's attempt to redefine intelligence. Kaufman is Scientific Director of The Imagination Institute in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also co-founder of The Creativity Post and author of \"Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\". Kaufman won the 2011 Daniel E. Berlyne Award from Division 10 of the American Psychological Association for outstanding research on aesthetics, creativity, and the arts by a junior scholar, and is a 2011-2012 recipient of the Mensa International Award for Excellence in Research. He is listed on Business Insider as one of the \"50 groundbreaking scientists who are changing the way we see the world\".\n\nAfter graduating from Lower Merion High School in 1998, Kaufman received his B.S. from Carnegie Mellon University, where he was Nobel Prize Winner Herbert A. Simon's last research assistant, and a student of Randy Pausch. In 2005, he received his M.Phil. from King's College, Cambridge under a Gates Scholarship, where he worked with Nicholas Mackintosh. After Cambridge, Kaufman earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Yale University where he was mentored by Robert Sternberg, Jeremy R. Gray, and Jerome L. Singer. From 2009-2010, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies.\n\nKaufman is the grandson of former Philadelphia Orchestra cellist Harry Gorodetzer.\n\nKaufman's research focuses on the measurement and development of intelligence and creativity, with a consideration of implications for education, business, and society. Kaufman has over 40 scientific papers in numerous books and journals, including \"Cognition\", \"Intelligence\", and the \"Journal of Creative Behavior\". He is also editor of \"The Philosophy of Creativity\" (with Elliot Samuel Paul, Oxford, 2014), \"The Complexity of Greatness: Beyond Talent or Practice\" (Oxford, 2013), \"The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence\" (with Robert Sternberg, Cambridge, 2011), and \"The Psychology of Creative Writing\" (with James C. Kaufman, Cambridge, 2009).\n\nMost theories of human intelligence and tests of intelligence emphasize controlled and deliberate reasoning as the hallmark of human intelligence. While agreeing that such thought processes are an important component of intelligence, Kaufman argues that spontaneous forms of thinking such as insight, imaginative play, daydreaming, implicit learning, and a reduced latent inhibition are also important contributors to a wide range of intelligent behaviors as well as creative greatness. Integrating modern dual-process theories of cognition with research on human intelligence, Kaufman proposed the dual-process theory of human intelligence. The theory emphasizes the importance of adaptation to task demands as the essence of intelligent functioning. At the same time, the theory takes into account an individual's personal goals and accommodates a wide range of intelligent behaviors in a wide range of fields, from the arts to the sciences. A key assumption of the theory is that abilities are not static entities but are constantly changing throughout the life span as the person continually engages with controlled and spontaneous modes of thought. In \"Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\", Kaufman makes the point that his theory is also fundamentally developmental, because it views intelligence as the dynamic interplay of engagement and ability over time in the pursuit of personal goals. \n\nKaufman sees well-being as influenced by happiness and meaning.\n\n\n"}

Education is not compulsory after the age of 16, the age of majority in Scots law.\n\n\"Note: Some ages vary because of the child's birth year.\"\nIn Scotland, students transfer from primary to secondary education at 11 or 12 years old. Pupils usually attend the same secondary school as their peers, as all secondaries have 'intake primaries'. Pupils attend either a Roman Catholic or non-denominational school according to their family's beliefs. Pupils in Scotland attend the same secondary school throughout their education; no sixth form colleges operate in Scotland, as in other countries in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first and second years of secondary school \"(abbreviated to S1 and S2)\" are a continuation of the Curriculum for Excellence started in primary school, after which no set national approach is established. S3 is still considered to be with the Broad General Education (or BGE) phase. Some schools allow students to start to narrow their field of study, with exceptions for compulsory subjects such as English and Mathematics. In S4, students undertake 6–9 subjects called Nationals, and at this stage, students tend to be presented at levels 3–5. Nationals should take one year to complete. National 3 has no external exam. National 4 and National 5 however are levels that start external exams. Some National 5 & 4 qualifications, such as Physical Education, also have no external exam. Rarely, S4 pupils take a class that could be a higher class.\n\nAfter these qualifications, some students leave to gain employment or attend further education colleges; however these days most students study for Highers, of which five are usually studied. These take a year to complete, after which some students apply to university or stay on for S6, where other Highers are gained, or Advanced Highers are studied. Due to the nature of schooling in Scotland, undergraduate honours degree programmes are four years long as matriculation is normally at the completion of Highers in S5 (age 16–17), which compares with three years for the rest of the UK. As well as instruction through the English language, Gaelic medium education is also available throughout Scotland.\n\nThe vast majority of Scottish pupils take Scottish Qualifications Certificate qualifications provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Until 2013/2014, most pupils took Standard Grades (but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and Highers in S5. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and Advanced Highers (formerly CSYS) in S6 could be taken. Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 qualifications – which were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively, but in practice (although they may vary from subject to subject), Intermediate 1 was easier than General, and Intermediate 2 harder than Credit – could also be taken in lieu of any of the aforementioned qualifications.\n\nPupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities. In recent times, it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers.\n\nAll educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Intermediates 1, 2 and Access 1–3 ceased to be in use. These qualifications were replaced by National qualifications that are designed to fit in with the Scottish Government's \"Curriculum for Excellence\" system.\n\n\n"}

Created by the entertainment studio JibJab, the StoryBots content library includes educational TV series, books, videos, games and classroom activities designed to make foundational learning fun and encourage intellectual curiosity in children.\n\nSubjects cover a wide range of topics and feature a cast of characters called the StoryBots, who are tiny, colorful creatures who live within our computers, tablets and phones and help humans answer questions. Similar to the personalized videos and e-cards produced by its parent company JibJab, StoryBots uses its Starring You feature to put the user's face and name into many of its videos, books and activities.\n\nAfter launching primarily online - and amassing more than 485 million views on YouTube - StoryBots launched its first television series on Netflix in 2016. \"Ask the StoryBots\" has won multiple Daytime Emmy Awards along with recognition from the Peabody Awards and British Academy Children's Awards, while also spawning a companion show, \"StoryBots Super Songs\", and a holiday special, \"A StoryBots Christmas\".\n\nStoryBots launched to the public in the fall of 2012, and has been featured on CNN, The New York Times, CNBC, and other news outlets. Gregg Spiridellis, co-founder and CEO of StoryBots, told CNBC in 2013 that he and his brother have five young children between them and noticed “a massive shift in how kids are consuming media.” Spiridellis says that became the inspiration for StoryBots, with digital content designed to be akin to \"Sesame Street\" but for a device-centric, connected generation of children.\n\nStoryBots pairs educators and learning experts with JibJab's team of artists, storytellers and technologists to build a robust library of learning content and activities. The library currently includes:\n\nIn 2016, StoryBots launched StoryBots Classroom, a free resource for educators that includes unlimited access to the entire StoryBots library of books, videos and activities, as well as the newly created Common Core State Standards Initiative-aligned Math Games, and a suite of classroom management tools including Group Builder, Lesson Planner, Home Assignment and Class Roster. The product is designed for use on laptops, tablets and interactive white boards. When it was released, StoryBots Classroom was by profiled by Education Week and was named a S'Cool Tool of the Week by EdSurge.\n\nAccording to its website, StoryBots is used in more than 70,000 classrooms worldwide. In an interview, CEO Gregg Spiridellis cited an attempt to bridge the \"digital divide\" between wealthier school districts and less fortunate schools - as well as the role of teachers as powerful advocates - as the impetus to offer StoryBots to teachers for free.\n\nThe StoryBots franchise's inaugural original TV series, \"Ask the StoryBots\", premiered on Netflix on August 12, 2016. The show, which follows the StoryBots characters of Beep, Boop, Bing, Bang and Bo (a.k.a. \"Answer Team 341B\") as they go on adventures into the human world to help answer kids' biggest questions, stars Judy Greer and includes guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Kevin Smith, Garfunkel and Oates, Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell. \"Ask the StoryBots\" received critical acclaim for its educational quality and entertainment value for both parents and children. The show also spawned a soundtrack available on Spotify, Apple Music, ITunes and Amazon.com.\n\nA companion series, \"StoryBots Super Songs\", premiered on October 7, 2016, also on Netflix. While each episode of \"Ask the StoryBots\" featured the lead characters answering a child's single question, \"StoryBots Super Songs\" focuses on broader topics, such as outer space, colors, shapes and dinosaurs, through music and live-action vignettes with real children.\n\n\"Ask the StoryBots\" also spun-off a holiday special, A StoryBots Christmas, which premiered December 1, 2017, on Netflix. Featuring a guest appearance by Ed Asner as Santa Claus, the special received two Daytime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Special Class Animated Program.\n\nSince its founding in 2012, StoryBots has won numerous awards for its digital content, including the Teachers' Choice Award from \"Learning Magazine\", Parent's Choice Award, a Family Choice Award, Tech Edvocate Award, and an Editor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review.\n\nFor its television work including \"Ask the StoryBots\" and \"A StoryBots Christmas\", StoryBots has won three Daytime Emmy Awards (with nine additional nominations), as well as recognition from the Annie Awards, British Academy Children's Awards and Peabody Awards.\n"}
{"id": "39337193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39337193", "title": "Stress in medical students", "text": "Stress in medical students\n\nStress in medical students is stress caused by strenuous medical programs, which may have physical and psychological effects on the well-being of medical students. Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral symptomatology. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress.\n\nStress is defined as an imbalance between environmental conditions necessary for survival and the ability of individuals to adapt to those conditions. Stress in medical students has been recognized for a long time. Many studies have explored the causes, consequences and solutions. There are three issues considered to be the most relevant, in terms of stress development in medical students. They are required to learn a great deal of new information in a short period of time before taking exams and evaluations. Therefore, they have little to no time to review what they have learned.\n\nMedical students are overloaded with a tremendous amount of information. They have a limited amount of time to memorize all the information studied. The overload of information creates a feeling of disappointment because of the inability to handle all the information at once and succeed during the examination period. Many medical students struggle with their own capacity to meet the demands of medical curriculum.\n\nStress responses to different situations vary at different levels of consciousness, psychological stress, and physiological stress. These points of stress may be interrelated, and each may be at a different level. Many people believe that the most stressful period of a medical student's academic career is the gap between graduation from medical school and being board eligible in a medical specialty. The Resident Service Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) divided the common stressors of residency into three categories: situational, personal, and professional.\n\nSituational stressors include inordinate hours, sleep deprivation, excessive workload, overbearing clerical and administrative responsibilities, inadequate support from allied health professionals, a large number of difficult patients, and conditions for learning that are less than optimal. Second year students experience other stress situations because they start to interact with the patients. These interactions include stressful situations, like the delivery of bad news.\n\nPersonal stressors include family, friend and relationship issues. Financial issues are common, as many residents carry heavy educational debts, and they feel compelled to hold a secondary job in order to repay their debts. Isolation is frequently exacerbated by relocation away from family and friends. Other stressors include limited free time to relax or develop new support systems, psycho-social concerns brought by the stress of residency, and inadequate coping skills. Professional stressors include responsibility for patient care, supervision of more junior residents and students, difficult patients, information overload and career planning.\n\nExcessive amounts of stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts, sleeping disorders, decreased attention, reduced concentration, temptation to cheat on exams, depression, loss of objectivity, increased incidence of errors, and improper behavior such as negligence. Furthermore, stress in medical students can break the stability of the student's health and result in illness. This can cause headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, coronary heart disease, impaired judgments, absenteeism, self-medication, and the consumption of drugs and alcohol. It is notable that these risks continue throughout training, also affecting resident physicians in addition to medical students, particularly with regard to depressive symptoms.\n\nA recent study among German medical students at international universities displayed the significantly higher risk of depression symptoms being 2.4 times higher than the average population. 23.5% of these German medical students showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis in the American journal \"JAMA\" suggested depressive symptoms in 21% to 43% of all medical students.\n\nThe students make an effort to counteract the impact of stressful situations with various coping skills. The coping includes both cognitive and behavioral efforts against the problem of stress encountered during examinations. Medical students who fail to manage their stress levels have a tendency to be less competent in their work. Students who do not manage the time limits of examinations well lack time for exercise and social interactions because those two points are more stressful than the perceived discrimination on the course or the death of patients.\n\nStress levels have a strong relationship with physical condition. Medical students during an examination period can experience insomnia, fatigue, and nausea. Moreover, metabolism is disturbed by diarrhea or constipation. Skin diseases, including acne, dermatitis, and psoriasis, are common during the examination period. These symptoms are provoked by long working hours and the tension of completing the courses with good grades.\n\nMedical students have been known to consume caffeinated beverages to be active and alert during time of studying. These students drink large quantities of coffee, tea, cola, and energy drinks. Though an increased intake of caffeine can increase the levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and dopamine in the blood, caffeine also inhibits the absorption of some nutrients, increasing the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract and depleting the levels of calcium, magnesium, iron and other trace minerals of the body through urinary excretion. Furthermore, caffeine decreases blood flow to the brain by as much as 30 percent, and it decreases the stimulation of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate the body's blood sugar level.\n\nStress can cause high levels of the following hormones: norepinephrine, leptin, NPY, nitrite, ACTH and adrenomedullin. Elevated levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and dopamine in the blood can produce fatigue, depression, behavior changes, heart disease, weight problems, diabetes, and skin diseases. It also decreases the immune response, which can lead to heartburn and stomach ulcers.\n\nThe hormones of the menstrual cycle (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)) during the examination periods are also affected. Female students may be disturbed during menstrual cycles because the FSH and LH normal levels changes radically. Medical students may also have disturbed sleep cycles in these periods.\n\nAn optimal level of stress is considered good because medical students develop coping abilities. However, too much stress causes problems. Previous studies have reported that a significant percentage of medical students suffer anxiety disorders because stress has a strong relationship to emotional and behavioral problems. Feelings of disappointment academically are most prevalent in those students who have poor academic performance.\n\nThe major emotional disorders that have been observed include the inability to feel reasonably happy, loss of sleep, over-worry, constantly feeling under strain, feeling unhappy and depressed, inability to concentrate, inability to enjoy normal activities, losing confidence in one’s self, inability to overcome difficulties, inability to face up to problems, inability to make decisions, inability to play a useful part in things, and believing oneself to be worthless.\nGiven these emotional disorders, studies have also proved that medical students are more likely to have suicidal thoughts than students from other schools.\n\nFemale medical students may respond to the stress with stronger manifestations of anxiety. Physiological, psychological and behavioral stressors are found to be related to the metabolic changes of the body.\n\nStress may also harm professional effectiveness. It decreases attention, reduces concentration, impinges on decision-making skills, and reduces the ability to establish strong physician–patient relationships. Medical students have also noticed changes in their behavior when they are stressed. Irritability and depression are common in students in later semesters, and these mental disturbances increase when examinations start.\n\nAs too much stress causes problems, it is important to evaluate the degree of stress a student may have. Today, there are methods to assess the level of emotional stress that medical students can handle. It is advisable to manage study time and include healthy nutrition during the whole day. In addition, daily exercises can help to reduce the stress. Interventions against academic dishonesty such as plagiarism also helps to prevent the risk of stress and depression in medical students. Studying in a small group also allows students to learn from each other and reduce the stress of learning by sharing ideas. Furthermore, some medical schools provide psychologists to help students manage stress.\n\nCommunication among third and fourth year medical students prepares them for the stressors of real-life clinical practice. This mental preparation stimulates the students to reduce the percentages of error in a medical consultation. Medical students are prepared to diagnose and treat patients, but may not be adequately prepared to interact with the problems of their patient, or to deal with bad news as well as the patient's emotional stress during consultations.\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI) can be a protection against the effects of psychological stress, and it may enhance well-being. However, EI is molded through personality and has not been observed to be affected by stressful situations. However, those students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower states of anxiety than those who are concentrated only on their studies. To address these problems, some medical schools have made changes such as reducing the workweek, instituting curricular reforms such as having shorter classes, less rote memorization, and providing psychological services.\n\nStress in medical students has become a focus of concern globally, with the first line of detection and defense of the stress being the students themselves. Some interventions include compulsory attendance in support groups, so the level of stigma is much lower than that associated with attending individual therapy. This provides long-term continuous support and help for students to monitor the progress and preparation for a better practice.\n\nOther stress-management programs provide trainees with coping techniques such as hypnosis, imagery, and muscle relaxation; affiliation with peers, opportunities for emotional expression and intensified relationships with the faculty.\n\nThe interventions of the majority of the programs use a group structure where the trainees meet with their peers, or with leaders. No \"gold standard\" exists for the content of stress-reduction programs for medical trainees. Some propose a scheme of directed and non-directed support groups, relaxation training (including meditation and hypnosis), time-management and coping skills, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mentoring programs. Good intervention includes relaxation basics like abdominal breathing, learning to identify and counter negative thoughts, use of the imagery in relaxation, practical ways to increase healthy eating, building positive coping, applying relaxing or activating words appropriately, and redirecting time and energy to different tasks based on the level of importance.\n"}
{"id": "27334748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27334748", "title": "Student transport", "text": "Student transport\n\nStudent transport is the transporting of children and teenagers to and from schools and school events. School transport can be undertaken by school students themselves (on foot, bicycle or perhaps horseback; or for older students, by car), they may be accompanied by family members or caregivers, or the transport may be organised collectively, using buses or taxis.\n\nUsing the general-purpose public transport is the most common means of student transport, in some countries. Sometimes the parents or the students get reimbursed when they buy public transport tickets.\n\nStudent transport can use specially designed school buses. Many districts in Canada and the United States use specially built and equipped school buses, painted school bus yellow and equipped with various forms of warning and safety devices specific to them. In other parts of the world, buses used for transporting students tend to be more general-purpose type buses than their North American counterparts.\n\nParental transport of students in the family automobile, sometimes termed the \"school run\", is increasing due to perceived hazards to unaccompanied children. Older students in some countries are able to drive themselves to school.\n\nThe Walk to school campaign and 'walking buses' promote the benefits of walking to school.\n\nA 1994 report based on Australian road safety statistics found that traveling to school by bus is:\nOfficials of the National Transportation Safety Board (in the USA) say school buses are safer than cars, even if they are not fitted with seat belts.\n\nIn Argentina, although most students either walk, are driven by parents, or take regular public transit to school, many of them use private buses carrying an identification and authorization of government in each city. They are usually white and orange and are mostly vans, a change from the times when bigger transit-style buses were used. Parents pay the van owner a monthly fee to carry their children back and forth from school. These vans are not affiliated to the school and usually transport children from different schools in the same route. \nIn Australia, students who live in outer suburban or rural areas often travel on public buses and trains or on special routes provided by private bus companies. The school services cross-subsidise the regular bus routes. In inner city areas, school students travel on government-owned route service buses. Students travel on either a public route bus, or a \"school special\" service. Some private schools have their own buses which are often provided by a school where a private company is unwilling or unable to provide the service.\nIn New South Wales, school bus transport is listed as one of the safest forms of land transport, other than train (current figures are represented without seatbelts installed). Students in years K-2 get free travel regardless of where they live, students in years 3-6 get free travel if they live further than radial distance or by the most direct practical walking distance from the school, and high school students get free travel only if they live more than radial distance or by the most direct practical walking distance from school.\n\nThe concept of the walking bus was first invented in Australia 1992 by David Engwicht\n\nIn Canada, student transport is handled in much the same way as it is in the United States: the yellow school bus. Canadian school districts usually engage school bus contractors for student transport services, almost always provided without charge to families. Outside of the metrification of the dashboard instruments and the French-language signage on school buses in the province of Quebec, Canadian and U.S. school buses are largely identical (and are produced by the same manufacturers).\n\nIn Finland, students who live more than 5 kilometers away from the nearest school, or have other significant impediments to going to the school, are eligible to either bus or Taxi rides. The buses and taxis that are used are normal vehicles, typically operated by local companies. Buses that are reserved solely for school busing have \"Koulukyyti/Skolskjuts\" markings on front and back. Taxis engaged in student transport have a triangular sign on the roof. Buses engaged in student transport are limited to driving at 80 km/h maximum speed.\n\nThere're no special school buses in Germany with a few exceptions. Public transport timetables are often adapted to the needs of secondary schools. Some German states offer a reimbursement for public transport tickets.\n\nIn Hong Kong, younger students are transported between their homes and schools by \"nanny vans\". These vehicles are typically van-based and are smaller than a typical Hong Kong public light bus. When nanny vans originated, they were regulated primarily by the schools and the van drivers. Today, in the interest of safety, nanny vans are government-regulated vehicles that run on fixed routes. Another Way Students Are transported are by School Buses which can fit 15 students a bus mother and a driver. The Bus Mother takes care of the children while they are on the bus and help the bus driver while he is driving. Some school buses fit up to 27 Students but are mostly 16 students per bus.\n\nIn the Netherlands, there isn't an organized form of student transport on a large scale.\n\nChildren who attend kindergarten are usually brought by their parents.\n\nAlmost all students at elementary school go to school by foot, as they live close by the school. Students who live further away, go by bike.\n\nWhen the students go to high school, they usually go by bike. When the student has a handicap (or goes to a special education school) and is therefore not able to go to school by a regular bike, he or she gets a budget from the municipality to pay for a taxi to go to school with (with a normal taxi, there aren't different taxis for student who go to school) or for an annual season ticket so the students can use public transport.\n\nWhen the students go to college, they get an annual season ticket from the government, so they can use the public transport 'for free' ('For free', because when the government introduced this scheme in the 1990s, students yearly budgets were cut as a result, without a choice for students to opt in or out).\n\n\"See also School bus.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, student transport is sometimes provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Education through school bus contractors or general bus companies. Bus companies generally have a fleet of older transit buses or coaches, different from the newer public service fleet vehicles to cater for school services. While carrying students are marked by either \"SCHOOL\", \"SCHOOL BUS\", \"KURA\" (Maori for \"school\"), or pictograms of children in black on a fluorescent chartreuse background, and a limited on the open road to . These signs all indicate that a motorist should slow to when passing a stationary bus in either direction\n\nA student is entitled to free school bus transport if they attend the closest state or state integrated school appropriate for the student's year level and gender, and in the case of a state integrated school, the special character the student or parents identifies with. However, students are not entitled to transport if they live within of the school for primary school students (ages 5–12) or within of the school for secondary school students (ages 13–18). Students are also not eligible if there are suitable public transport services between the school and the student's residence, ruling out free transport in most cities.\n\nFree school busing is a fast-diminishing phenomenon in New Zealand. It has historically favored rural students. As population migration trends internal to New Zealand have favored the growth of cities, it is an increasingly smaller minority of students who are served by school buses. Parents, acting as chauffeurs, are filling this gap, with multiple negative consequences (e.g., productivity losses for the New Zealand workforce, increased vehicular traffic interfering with commercial or industrial traffic well into the work-day, increased carbon footprint, diminished development of transport self-management skills in early teenagers, dangerous concentrations of hectic motoring near congested school entrances at school start-times, etc.). The matter occasionally surfaces in the New Zealand media, but making free school busing the norm is usually dismissed as another example of American-style thinking.\n\nIn Auckland, New Zealand, as at November 2007, one hundred schools were running 230 walking buses with over 4,000 children and 1,500 adults participating.\n\nBefore school buses were introduced, from 1924 onwards, rural children rode to school and left their horses in the school paddock, known as a glebe in some areas. The Education Department paid about 4d a day towards the upkeep of each horse. The first buses allowed five rural schools to be merged into one, a pattern which continued as school buses spread (e.g. Raupo Consolidated High School in 1929), so that, by 1940, the five had increased to 650, but wartime rationing slowed the pace of consolidation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most student transport is performed by ordinary transit buses. These buses can be used for other purposes when not in use for school journeys. Most children use local scheduled public transport bus services. In almost all cases, dedicated school transport bus services in the UK are contracted out to local bus companies.\n\nIn Greater London, many school children travel to school using the ordinary bus service as the bus stops are very close together and travel is free using the Oyster card system.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are concerns about children's safety after they have alighted from conventional buses used for student transport. There are also more general worries about safety, such as lack of seatbelts, crowded buses, and in Northern Ireland especially, the use of \"three for two\" seating, where three children are expected to sit on a bench seat intended for two passengers.\n\nOther concerns include poorly maintained buses, drivers' backgrounds, children travelling on public buses and school children's behaviour. In one case in 2009, two boys aged 14 and 15 fell out of a bus window, after they leaned on the side of the Premiere Travel bus they were travelling on.\n\nAs a result of this, over the past decade, starting in around 2000, the talk of and introduction of dedicated, yellow student-specific school buses has been widespread. In 2005, it was reported that the introduction of such buses would \"save pupils\". As well as safety benefits, it would also be better to the environment.\n\nNorth American-style 'yellow' school buses (built by European manufacturers) are being introduced by First Student UK and My bus.\n\nThe Walk to school campaign is a British campaign promoting the benefits of walking to school. It is run by the charities Living Streets and Travelwise. It receives funding from the Department for Transport and Transport for London.\n\nWalking buses have remained popular. The first walking bus in the United Kingdom was introduced in 1998 by Hertfordshire County Council and used by students of Wheatfields Junior School in St Albans in 1998 \n\nIn the United States, purpose-built school buses are the primary means of student transport, almost always provided without charge to families. In the US, the term, \"busing\" is also used to refer to desegregation busing, the transport of students to schools other than the closest local school for increased racial integration.\n\nEach year, school buses provide an estimated 10 billion student trips in the United States. Every school day, 475,000 school buses transport 25 million children to and from schools and school-related activities. School buses are purchased or leased by some school districts, while other school districts engage the service of school bus contractors to perform this function. Approximately 40% of school districts in the United States use contractors to handle the function of student transport.\n\nHowever, the use of standard public transit buses is increasingly common in urban areas. For example, New York City provides yellow school bus service to select students based on grade level and their distance from the school, but relies on the public New York City Transit bus system to transport students in grades 7-12 and younger students where dedicated school bus service is unavailable. Free or half-price transit passes are provided by the school system for this purpose. Some public transit services may provide \"tripper service\" with routes designed to serve local schools. Such routes are regularly scheduled transit routes that are open to the public and, by law, cannot be used exclusively for school transportation, but are drawn to connect local schools to nearby communities and transit centers.\nMost kids over the age of 16 drive to school.\n\n\n"}

It is a port and revision of the \"SimTower\" (1994), a.k.a. \"The Tower\" in Japan, with some elements of \"Yoot Tower\" (1998). In the game, the player is tasked to construct a tower for their company boss, Yama.\n\nIn \"The Tower SP\", perhaps due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance's system, the \"Tower\" status (the highest available tower rating) is obtained with a population of 2,000 people; a goal which is quite hard considering the height limit for the building is 50 floors(35 floors for the commercial tower) and a certain foundation width. The width is slowly expanded as Yama gets deregulation for the roads and buildings surrounding the player's Tower. However, reaching that population is not enough. The \"Tower\" status is only awarded when a wedding takes place in the building, which only occurs when a cathedral is constructed at the maximum height, the cathedral can be reached without any stress, the cathedral is full, and when there are 2,000 people in the building at that moment.\nAchieving a \"Tower\" status with the Office Building unlocks the possibility of building a \"Commercial Building\". The site permits construction of a higher lobby at the ground floor, but doesn't permit the construction of building offices, condominiums, medical centers, security offices, nor recycling centers, allows up to 3 cinemas in the building (whereas the Office Building only allowed one), as well as a spa with water from a hot spring and hotel suites (once the appropriate star rating is reached). As such, building built in this mode may resemble a mall-hotel hybrid, depending on the player's design.\n\nOther features are taken from \"Yoot Tower\", while some are new. Restrooms must be built; security must check the player's tower nightly; housekeeping cleans offices weekly, and cockroach infestation now has three phases: one (which requires a bug bomb), two (which requires a costly exterminator), and three (which condemns the infested facility). Like \"Yoot Tower\", the player must use different shops and stores to satisfy tenants and visitors.\n\n"}

It was developed to help universities assess whether applicants have the skills and aptitudes considered essential for Higher Education study. Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing produces and distributes practice materials, including specimen questions and past papers, on their website.\n\nThe test was first introduced for undergraduate entry to the University of Cambridge in 2001 and was used as part of the admissions process for a number of undergraduate courses. It is currently used for application to the Land Economy course only.\n\nIn 2007, the University of Oxford introduced TSA as part of its admissions process for Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). At this stage, the test was known as the ‘PPE Admissions Test’. The use of TSA was extended for entry to Economics and Management in 2008; to Experimental Psychology, and Psychology and Philosophy in 2009, Geography, Philosophy and Linguistics, and Psychology and Linguistics in 2012, and in 2015 to Human Sciences. Since 2016, candidates applying for Chemistry have been required to sit a version of TSA consisting of Section 1 of the test only (TSA S1), with History and Economics requiring the same from 2017. From 2018, the University of Oxford no longer required applicants to take TSA for entry to their Geography course.\n\nSince the 2008–09 application cycle, University College London has used TSA to assist in the selection of applicants to European Social and Political Studies (ESPS).\n\nTSA consists of one or two sections, depending on the university and course being applied for. Section 2 is used in addition to Section 1 by the University of Oxford for certain courses. \n\n\n\nThe multiple-choice answers (Section 1) are marked by Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing with 1 mark available per question. Final scores are calculated to one decimal place on the TSA scale (running approximately 0–100) using the Rasch statistical technique. \nThe writing task component of TSA (Section 2) used by the University of Oxford is reviewed by admissions tutors.\n\nFor University College London (UCL), TSA is taken during the interview stage. It is administered as a paper-based test. UCL admissions interviews are held on specific dates from December to March. Results are reported to the university only.\n\nFor the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford, TSA is held in late October/early November as a pre-interview, paper-based test taken at schools, colleges or authorised test centres globally. Results are issued in mid-January of the following year, via Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing’s results online portal.\n\nThe exact use of results varies between the subjects which use the test, and candidates need to refer to their chosen course for precise details.\n\n\n"}

The project anticipated many of the current features of the social web and social computing.\n\nThe VTC was concerned with virtual objects. It was a collection of digital representations that may be used as a collection. The images did not pretend to be the objects, but were objects in their own right and, therefore, able to constitute a collection in their own right.\n\nThe goals of the VTC were twofold. First, to explore the range and potential of producing and using digital representations in their various forms; images, texts, hypertexts, video, sound, 3-D images and illustrations. Second, to construct a working digital museum that was meaningful to the way we work with collections.\n\nThe collections that were developed included about 4,000 images and other representations of objects, along with the related catalogue information. Within the Archaeology Collection, these objects span the Neolithic to the Medieval period in Britain. The History of Science Collection drew on the collections of the Whipple Museum at the University of Cambridge and the History of Science Collection at the University of Oxford. As well as directly related information, these Collections also included text, video, and display resources, as well as bibliographies and glossaries.\n\nIncluded in the collections were a variety of what were called \"narratives\". These were works using the collections in a variety of forms from traditional documents to hyper-documents to display spaces, but these are seen, much as any work, as the view of an author. This was central to the way that Cabinet collections work. They are not fixed ‘textbooks’ but flexible resources that teachers and students may work with to create meaningful works. It was in this way that the collections do not form an end in themselves, but a means of working. They are the very flexible resource that students and researchers use to think with.\n\n\"Cabinet\" was a software application developed as part of the VTC and was designed to be an easy to use and well presented suite of software tools that were intuitive. Using these tools, the user could create their own collection, and could search, retrieve, display and browse the existing collections. The presentation tools allowed the user to compare different objects, to identify and display significant details, to create links to related images, video and text, and to embed representations in their own authored texts or other presentations, whether these be straightforward documents or more complex hyper-documents.\n\nCabinet was not simply a multimedia authoring tool. It was designed to be under the control not only of the author, but also of the reader. The collections were not interactive in the conventional sense, but were interactive in the sense that the reader could also modify or even re-author what had been produced. This kind of flexibility of presentation tools freed the user from the rigidity of traditional presentations and gave access to the full potential of contextualising information. There was an increased variety of narrative forms, but, primarily, it was an environment within which students and researchers could construct and explore new ways of thinking about material objects and their history.\n\n\n"}

It consists of Wageningen University and the former agricultural research institutes (Dienst Landbouwkundig Onderzoek (DLO)) of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture. Wageningen University & Research trains specialists (BSc, MSc and PhD) in life and social sciences and focuses its research on scientific, social and commercial problems in the field of life sciences and natural resources. In the field of life sciences, agricultural and environmental science, the university is considered world-class. According to the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" it is the best university in the Netherlands and No. 1 worldwide, in agriculture and forestry for 2017 on the QS World University Rankings charts. The university has about 12,000 students from over 100 countries. It is also a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network.\n\nIn 1876 the \"Rijkslandbouwschool\" (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the \"Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool\" (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in \"Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool\" (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).\n\nIn 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to \"Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool\" (National Agricultural College). The openings date and official Dies natalis is 9 March 1918.\n\nIn 1986 the \"hogescholen\" (comparable to scientific institute of technology) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became \"Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW)\" (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name hogeschool in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science.\n\nOver the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general; while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new holding was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under the Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.\n\nIn 2006, the university of applied sciences Van Hall Larenstein became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures for the different types of higher education, collaboration between the two schools remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to Velp.\n\nIn 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication. In addition university research could be presented under the name of the university: \"Wageningen University (WU)\" (as an alternative of using the name of the holding Wageningen UR). On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes decided to continue as one, jointly brand: \"Wageningen University & Research\" (\"WUR\"). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University & Research celebrates her 100 years anniversary. During this year there are many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. \n\nWageningen University & Research was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the European Commission and guarantees the quality of the study programme. An important consideration is that the university consequently applies the European Credit Transfer System; this promotes the mobility of students within Europe and prevents study delay. The label is an acknowledgement of the international character of the university. Out of 56 European applications in 2005, only three ECTS labels were awarded.\n\nWageningen University & Research offers 19 BSc programmes (2018-2019). The language of instruction is partly Dutch, partly English. For some BSc programmes the language of instruction is English. The programmes start each year in September, they last three years and consist of 180 ECTS credits. The programmes are in the field of economy and society, health, life sciences and technology, nature and environment, animals and plants.\n\nList of BSc programmes offered in English during the 2018-2019 academic year:\nList of BSc programmes offered in Dutch during the 2018-2019 academic year:\n\nWageningen University & Research offers a 36 different MSc programmes (2017-2018) and two online masters programs.

The program, subsequently named the \"World Water Monitoring Challenge\" and \"EarthEcho Water Challenge,\" aims to build public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world by empowering citizens to carry out basic monitoring of their local water bodies. Roberta (Robbi) Savage, ACWF's President and CEO created WWMD, and Edward Moyer was the first WWMD Coordinator. \n\nA simple test kit enables everyone, children and adults, to sample local water bodies for a set of water quality parameters including temperature, acidity (pH), clarity (turbidity) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Information on purchasing low-cost test kits is available from the current sponsoring organization, EarthEcho International, and the results of monitoring events are then shared with participating communities around the globe on the sponsor's website.\n\nWorld Water Monitoring Day was originally celebrated annually on September 18. This date was initially chosen to be a month later (October 18) to recognize the anniversary of the US Clean Water Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1972 to restore and protect the country’s water resources. In 2007, the date was changed to facilitate participation in parts of the world where temperatures reach freezing conditions at that time.\n\nIn 2006, ACWF transferred the coordination of the event to the Water Environment Federation (WEF) and the International Water Association (IWA). The collective goal was to expand participation to one million people in 100 countries by 2012. In January 2015 the management of World Water Monitoring Day was transferred to EarthEcho International.\n\n2008 saw students from Indonesia to Arkansas taking part in water sampling to bring attention to the importance of water quality.\n\nAs of 2018, EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the \"EarthEcho Water Challenge\" during any period between March 22 (World Water Day) and December of each year.\n\n\n"}
