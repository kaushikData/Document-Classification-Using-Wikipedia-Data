The school was inaugurated in Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia by its founder, Betty Cecilia Lugo, on May 4, 1974. It was later integrated into the government educational program, becoming a public school and renamed as \"Institute of Special Education\" Jesús Enrique Losada\".\n\nIn the early 1970s the western region of Zulia state included four municipalities and it was the main center of Venezuela's oil industry. Many international corporations, connected to oil and gas, had long time and successful business in the district.\nDespite being one of the richest regions in the country, Special Education was not included in the programs followed by local schools. There was not even awareness about the importance of integrating disabled children into the educational system.\n\nThis situation was perceived by philanthropist Betty Cecilia Lugo when she arrived in Lagunillas. Educated in Medicine and Special Education, she started a crusade in order to include special education into the local educational system. That is how the idea of starting a school for children with disabilities was born. The school was created primarily as a place where disabled children could be educated, have special activities outdoors and start to play sports. \n\nBetty Lugo started the project by creating awareness within the local community. She discussed the importance of Special Education with private companies and government institutions and built a fundraising committee. The most important achievement at this stage was to make possible that oil international companies included the project in their donation programs..\n\nThe second stage focused on the search and selection of teachers, to be chosen into a community where Special Education was an unknown field. Given her academic training on the subject, Betty Lugo took care of the education and guidance of selected teachers, training them as special educators.\n\nThe third stage aimed to find an appropriate building to start activities, which took one year of meetings with different public and private companies. The school was inaugurated on May 4, 1974, in a large building donated by Shell Company of Venezuela, located in Ciudad Ojeda, Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia. The building had enough space for classrooms and offices. It also had a large garden, where children could develop psychomotor skills. Furniture and other equipment was purchased with money collected by the fundraising committee. \n\nThe name of the school was AZUPANE- Lagunillas (\"\", English: \"Zulian Association of Parents and Friends of Exceptional Children\" - Lagunillas district). It started with seven pupils while Betty Lugo, together with benefactors and local authorities, continued searching for disabled children within the region. Other cases in need for special education started to show up and the school soon began to increase the number of students. \n\nThe school program was planned for children aged six to twelve years, suffering from neurological disorders, motor disabilities and communication and language problems. The main purpose was to create the appropriate atmosphere to grant academic learning, as well as the acquirement of social skills and the improvement of students quality of life.\n\nParents took care of the student’s daily transportation to the school, till Shell Oil Company of Venezuela, one of the greatest benefactors of the project, donated a school bus and provided the gasoline. Betty Lugo donated to the school all her special educational material, acquired during her training years in the United States. This kind of special educational resource was not produced or imported in Venezuela, by the time AZUPANE - Lagunillas started.\n\nWhile AZUPANE- Lagunillas was raising awareness for the need of special education, Betty Lugo continued her crusade by encouraging private and official organizations to create special schools throughout the region. When she left Lagunillas, at the end of the 1970s, the school had increased the number of students, the local society was attentive to children with special needs and the Ministry of Education was planning to develop similar projects in the area. AZUPANE-Lagunillas was lately absorbed by the government as part of its educational programs, and the school was renamed as Institute of Special Education “Jesús Enrique Lossada”.\n"}

Her pupils included several prominent opera singers, actors, and entertainers, including sopranos Renée Fleming, Renata Tebaldi, Anna Moffo, tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, and actors Madeline Kahn, Kevin Kline, and Constance Towers among others. Music critic Anthony Tommasini wrote that \"Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems.\"\n\nBorn Beverley Peck in Portland, Oregon, Johnson was the daughter of Hartwig O. Peck and Cecilia W. Peck. She grew up in Walla Walla, Washington, and earned degrees in both speech and drama from the Ellison-White Conservatory in Portland. Shortly thereafter she moved to New York where she began studies in piano with Andre Kostelanetz, and was soon active as an accompanist for singers and ensembles in NYC.\n\nPeck studied voice with one of the singers she accompanied in NYC, tenor Hardesty Johnson, who became her husband. Her husband was a faculty member at the Juilliard School and she served as his studio accompanist during lessons and for masterclasses. She often performed in joint recital with her husband as both a pianist and a soprano vocalist. She accompanied other well known singers as well in concerts during her career. Hardesty Johnson died in 1952.\n\nIn 1960, Johnson joined the voice faculty of the School of Sacred Music at the Union Theological Seminary where she taught until 1965. She joined the faculty at the Juilliard School in 1964 where she taught until her death 37 years later. She concurrently worked on the faculty of the Aspen Music Festival and School; as an adjunct professor at the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College; and as a professor at the Manhattan School of Music from 1982–1989.\n\nIn addition to working as a University professor, Peck taught out of a private studio. One of her notable pupils was actor Kevin Kline who began studying with her to prepare his voice for the music in the 1983 film version of \"The Pirates of Penzance\". Kline stated in an interview that Peck \"was very, very strict about protecting the voice\", and that he must choose between cigarettes and her if he was a smoker. Peck's other private students included Sarah Atereth, Ara Berberian, Blythe Danner, Mignon Dunn, Tammy Grimes, Madeline Kahn, Evelyn Lear, Rita Shane, Renata Tebaldi, Constance Towers, Giorgio Tozzi, and Theodor Uppman.\n\nJohnson also had a widely known reputation of helping voices experiencing distress. She was hired to assist President Lyndon B. Johnson in his post-operative recovery from the surgical removal of vocal fold nodules while he was in office. She was also sought by Anna Moffo when the renowned soprano began experiencing vocal difficulties in the 1970s.\n\nIn a 1977 interview with \"The New York Times\", Johnson said following about her work with Moffo:Anna's voice has been there all the time. It's just that somebody along the way forgot to tell her that you can't run a Rolls-Royce without gas in it. She has one of the really natural beautiful voices, like Tebaldi. But she never had any true physiological technique to fall back on. She had no breath support; there was no resonance in the lower or middle voice. Only air was coming out. So what we tried to do for the past two years is wash away the crud and build up her stamina. A singer, like an athlete, has to have every workable muscle trained.\n\nJohnson died in Manhattan in 2001 at the age of 96. At the time leading up to her death she was closely administered to by her pupils Anthony Dean Griffey and Renée Fleming. Fleming described Griffey as \"like a surrogate son to Beverley\", and recounted how her final lesson with her teacher was just a month before Johnson's death. Some of her pupils became celebrated voice teachers and accompanists in their own right, including Shane, Margot Garrett, Ken Noda, and Brian Zeger. Adamantly opposed to having her photo taken, \"The New York Times\" was unable to locate or obtain a photo of her at the time of her death.\n"}

{"id": "8188320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8188320", "title": "Brain training", "text": "Brain training\n\nBrain training (also called cognitive training) is a program of regular mental activities purported to maintain or improve one's cognitive abilities. It reflects a hypothesis that cognitive abilities can be maintained or improved by exercising the brain, analogous to the way physical fitness is improved by exercising the body.\n\nAlthough there is strong evidence that aspects of brain structure remain \"plastic\" throughout life and that high levels of mental activity are associated with reduced risks of age-related dementia, scientific support for the concept of \"brain fitness\" is limited. The term is infrequently used in academic literature, but is commonly used in the context of self-help books and commercial products.\n\nCognitive reserve is the capacity of a person to meet the various cognitive demands of life and is evident in an ability to assimilate information, comprehend relationships, and develop reasonable conclusions and plans. Cognitive training is a hypothesis that certain activities, done regularly, might help maintain or improve cognitive reserve.\n\nAs of 2016, companies offering products and services for cognitive training have marketed them as improving educational outcomes for children, and for adults as improving memory, processing speed, and problem-solving, and even as preventing dementia or Alzheimers. They often support their marketing with discussion about the educational or professional background of their founders, some discuss neuroscience that supports their approach—especially concepts of neuroplasticity and transfer of learning, and some cite evidence from clinical trials. The key claim made by these companies is that the specific training that they offer generalizes to other fields—academic or professional performance generally or everyday life.\n\nAs of 2016, there was some evidence that some of these programs improved performance on tasks in which users were trained, less evidence that improvements in performance generalize to related tasks, and almost no evidence that \"brain training\" generalizes to everyday cognitive performance; in addition most clinical studies were flawed.\n\nCogmed was founded in 2001, Posit Science in 2002, and \"Brain Age\" was first released in 2005, all capitalizing on the growing interest within the public in neuroscience, along with heightened worries by parents about ADHD and other learning disabilities in their children, and concern about their own cognitive health as they aged.\n\nThe launch of \"Brain Age\" in 2005 marked a change in the field, as prior to this products or services were marketed to fairly narrow populations (for example, students with learning problems), but \"Brain Age\" was marketed to everyone, with a significant media budget. In 2005, consumers in the US spent $2 million on cognitive training products; in 2007 they spent about $80 million.\n\nBy 2012, \"brain training\" was a $1 billion industry. In 2013 the market was $1.3 billion, and software products made up about 55% of those sales. By that time neuroscientists and others had a growing concern about the general trend toward what they called \"neurofication\", \"neurohype\", \"neuromania\", neuromyths.\n\nTo address growing public concerns with regard to aggressive online marketing of brain games to older population, a group of neuroscientists published a letter in 2008 warning the general public that there is a lack of research showing effectiveness of brain games in elderly.\n\nIn 2010, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend any method of preventing age-related memory deficits or Alzheimer's.\n\nIn 2014 another group of scientists published a similar warning. Later that year, another group of scientists made a counter statement, organized and maintained by the Chief Scientific Officer of Posit.\n\nStarting in January 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued companies selling \"brain training\" programs or other products marketed as improving cognitive function, including WordSmart Corporation, the company that makes Lumosity, and Brain Research Labs (which sold dietary supplements) for deceptive advertising; later that year the FTC also sued LearningRx.\n\nThe FTC found that Lumosity's marketing \"preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer's disease\", without providing any scientific evidence to back its claims. The company was ordered not to make any claims that its products can \"[improve] performance in school, at work, or in athletics\" or \"[delay or protect] against age-related decline in memory or other cognitive function, including mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease\", or \"[reduce] cognitive impairment caused by health conditions, including Turner syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, or side effects of chemotherapy\", without \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\", and agreed to pay a $50 million settlement (reduced to $2 million).\n\nIn its lawsuit against LearningRx, the FTC said LearningRx had been \"deceptively claim[ing] their programs were clinically proven to permanently improve serious health conditions like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and concussions\". In 2016, LearningRx settled with the FTC by agreeing not to make the disputed assertions unless they had \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" which was defined as randomized controlled trials done by competent scientists.\" For the judgment's monetary component, LearningRx agreed to pay $200,000 of a $4 million settlement.\n\n\n"}

It was released in the \"Acornsoft Education\" range and includes two business simulation games; \"Stokmark\" and \"Telemark\".\n\n\"Stokmark\" is a simulation of the stock market. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the standard supply and demand principle although there is a random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded dividends on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.\n\n\"Telemark\" is a four player game where each player has to make decisions based on the manufacturing of televisions. This includes whether to build or extend factories, spend on improving management or marketing, and setting the price. When the player enters their price, it is not displayed on the screen so other players do not know what their competitors are charging until the end of each round. The game introduces terms and reports such as market share, overheads, profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. The instruction booklet provides detailed instructions on working out the break-even point as well as blank worksheets to be filled out by the players. The winner is the player who has made the most profit after a set number of rounds or the first player to gain more than half the market share for televisions.\n\n\"Business Games\" was released in 1983 as part of Acornsoft's Education range which was aimed at schools as well as home users. As it only requires 16k RAM, it runs on the BBC Micro Model A as well as the Model B. It was also released for the Acorn Electron in 1984. The instructions recommend the games for teaching business and economic studies but the Acorn Electron version in particular was well known among home users, as it was often included with the Acornsoft software packs bundled with Electrons in 1984 and 1985.\n\nThe package was reviewed by Ken Garrett for The Micro User which was largely positive. \"Stokmark\" was described as \"a well-presented and useful introduction to some investment terms\" but also \"rather repetitive\". He claimed \"Telemark\" is \"a good game and to be properly appreciated must be played seriously\".\n"}

It focuses on the research and education in the field of information and communications and enjoys a nationwide reputation in the study of posts, telecommunications and information technology, especially for its research and commercialization in 3G mobile technologies, optical sciences and related digital research. It is one of the four universities of Posts and Telecommunications in China and the only one of its kind in the Southwest China. It enjoys a very good reputation in the ICT industry in China due to its high quality education and research and the large number of alumni working in the ICT industry. Due to its achievements and contributions in the field of Information and Communications, especially in the development of China's own digital communications systems, CQUPT is considered as the cradle of China's digital communications.\n\nCQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People's Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan Province as a Municipality in 1997).\n\nIn 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Chinese Central Government with the Chongqing government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by Ministry and Province (Municipalities) government.\n\nCQUPT has 15 schools and institutes with the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor established in 2010.\n\n\nA list of schools at CQUPT and the academic programs each offer can be found at the webpage 'School Navigation' from CQUPT's website.\n\nCQUPT is the origin of the China's digital communications systems. In the very recent years, over 600 scientific projects in the ICT field have been done in the university and 80 of them were granted the \"Scientific Research Achievement Awards\" by the government. CQUPT is the only Chinese university participating in the development of China's own 3G standard: TD-SCDMA.\n\nThe world's first TD-SCDMA chip and mobile phone were developed at CQUPT. The university played a key role in the establishment of China's first national \"EPA Communication Standard for Industrial Measurement and Control System\", which was recognized by the IEC as international standard in the field of industrial automation. The university's spin-off company Chongqing CYIT Communications Technologies Company (CYIT) is among the first companies doing research on TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE in China and is already a frontrunner in the field nowadays.\n\nThe university's strength also lies in areas such as computer science, automatic control technology, microtechnologies, and others, as one of the first academic institutions doing research in these fields in China.\n\nResearch at CQUPT is done in about 30 research platforms. Each of the research platforms may contain several laboratories or research groups. Research at CQUPT is closely linked to the industry. In 2010, the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor, which is in and hosted by CQUPT, was founded with the participating of nearly 50 partners in industry from around the world, including Qualcomm in USA, Eplida in Japan, the International Association of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials European Microelectronics Center in Taiwan among others. The research at CQUPT is widely done in cooperation with other academic or industrial partners in the form of joint research centers or laboratory.\n\nAcademic institutions which have founded joint research centers with CQUPT include the Chinese Science Academy (CSA), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, Essex University in UK, Inha University in South Korea, etc. The university's industrial partners, which have founded joint research centers or laboratories include Oracle, Cisco, Lenovo Mobile, Maipu Communications, and others.\n\nThe university boasts 11 Key Disciplines of ministry and provincial level, and 16 key laboratories, engineering research centres and humanities & social science bases.\n\n\n'Research Institutions' on CQUPT's website offers a complete list of research platforms and research institutions at CQUPT.\n\nOver the 60 years since the establishment of university in 1950, CQUPT has educated over 70,000 students in the field of Information and Communication, many of whom are in the high positions of China's telecommunications companies. The university is deemed as the cradle of talents of ICT industry in China. It boasts its high employment rate among Chinese universities.\n\nEven though the university is featured with excellence in the area of Information and Communications, it is striving to offer a wide range of other subjects including science, engineering, economics, management, arts and education, most of which are related to applied science and engineering. The university offers 45 undergraduate programs, 37 postgraduate programs and Master of Engineering programs; it was also authorized to confer doctor’s degrees in the disciplines of Information and Communication Engineering, Computer Science and Technology, Electronic Science and Technology, Control Science and Engineering, Management and Engineering.\n\nCQUPT has about 20,000 students, including more than 3,000 postgraduates.\n\nCQUPT has established good cooperative relations and links with over 30 prestigious universities in USA, Russia, UK, Italy, Canada, Korea, Singapore and so forth.\n\nSome examples of joint research centers co-founded with other academic institutions out of China include the Joint Research Center of 4G Mobile Communications co-founded with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, the Sino-Korean Institute of Spatial Information Systems founded with Inha University and Seowon University in South Korea, the Sino-Europe Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Robotics with the Essex University and Open University in UK.\n\nResearch at CQUPT is also widely collaborated with famous companies in the industry. Many companies found joint laboratories or centers with CQUPT such as Oracle (CQUPT-Oracle Joint Laboratory of Database Technology), Lenovo Mobile (CQUPT-Lenovo Moile Internet Application Research Center), Cisco (CQUPT-Cisco Joint R&D Center of Green Technology). In July, 2010, the School of Computer Science and Technology signed a collaboration contract with Cornell University and founded the CU-CQUPT Joint Lab of Intelligent Computing. Other education or research partners include IBM, Ericsson, Lenovo Mobile, Nokia, China Silian Group, Maipu Communications, Foxconn Technology, ProMOS Technologies and many others. To deepen the relationship with local industry, the university also establishes a good relationship with the local high-tech industry parks like Chongqing Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing Xiyong Microelectronics Industrial Park and Chayuan Industrial Park.\n\nIn 2010, the university founded the university board. The board of the university include China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, China Post, Huawei, ZTE, DaTang, China Putian, Lenovo and other industry partners.\n\n"}

There is a wide selection of emblems, pictures, and words that can be added to the sides of the rings and even inside the center gem.\n\nThe tradition of class rings originated with the class of 1835 at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nThe \"Complete Book of Etiquette\" by Amy Vanderbilt indicates the following protocol for wearing of a class ring. For as long as the wearer is in school, the insignia should face the wearer to remind him/her of the goal of graduation. Upon graduation, the class ring gains the status of a \"badge of honor\" similar to a diploma, with the effect that graduation entitles the wearer to display the insignia facing outward so that it faces other viewers. An additional justification for this practice is the rationale that the ring also symbolizes the graduate him/herself: During the wearer's time in school, he or she focuses on self-development and goals specific to the insular academic environment; upon graduation, the wearer enters the wider world and puts what he or she has learned to work in shaping it.\n\nA notable exception to this protocol is the custom followed by older graduating classes of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Today, as in years past, Academy graduates frequently wear their rings on the left hand in observance of the ancient belief, which also underlay the Anglo-American custom of wearing wedding bands on the left hand, that a vein connects the left ring finger to the heart. Prior to graduation, these classes wore the USMA Class Ring with the Class Crest closest to the heart, signifying a given cadet's bond to his class within the Academy. Following graduation, members of these classes wore (and, for surviving members, still wear) the ring with the Academy Crest closest to the heart, signifying their bond with the Academy as a whole.\n\nAt the United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force Academy, The Citadel, and the United States Coast Guard Academy each cadet's class ring contains melted gold from rings donated to the respective school from deceased alumni.\n\n\"The Lords of Discipline\". \"I wear the ring. I wear the ring and I return often to the city of Charleston, South Carolina, to study the history of my becoming a man.\" Author Pat Conroy attended and graduated from The Citadel and wrote the fictional account of a cadet's journey at a military school set in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n"}

He also wrote plays, poetry, journalism, and non-fiction.\n\nDenis Johnson was born on July 1, 1949 in Munich, West Germany. Growing up, he also lived in the Philippines, Japan, and the suburbs of Washington, D.C. His father, Alfred Johnson, worked for the State Department as a liaison between the USIA and the CIA. His mother, the former Vera Louise Childress, was a homemaker. He earned a B.A. in English (in 1971) from the University of Iowa and an M.F.A. (in 1974) from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where he also returned to teach. While at the Writers' Workshop, Johnson took classes from Raymond Carver.\n\nJohnson published his first book, a collection of poetry titled \"The Man Among Seals\", in 1969 at the age of 19. He earned a measure of acclaim with the publication of his first novel, \"Angels\", in 1983. He came to prominence in 1992 with the short story collection \"Jesus' Son\", which included vignettes originally published in \"The New Yorker\", inspired by Isaac Babel’s book \"Red Cavalry\". In a 2006 \"New York Times Book Review\" poll, \"Jesus' Son\" was voted one of the best works of American fiction published in the last 25 years. It has been variously described as: seminal, legendary, transcendent, a classic, and a masterpiece. It was adapted into the 1999 film of the same name, which starred Billy Crudup. Johnson has a cameo role in the film as a man who has been stabbed in the eye by his wife.\n\n\"Tree of Smoke\" won the 2007 National Book Award for Fiction and was a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It takes place during the Vietnam War, spanning the years 1963–70, with a coda set in 1983. In the novel, we learn the history of Bill Houston, a main character in Johnson’s first novel \"Angels\", the latter novel set in the early 1980s.\n\n\"Train Dreams\", originally published as a story in \"The Paris Review\" in 2002, was published as a novella in 2011 and was a finalist for that year's Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. However, for the first time since 1977, the Pulitzer board did not award a prize for fiction that year.\n\nJohnson's plays have been produced in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Seattle. He was the Resident Playwright of Campo Santo, the resident theater company at Intersection for the Arts in San Francisco. In 2006 and 2007, Johnson held the Mitte Chair in Creative Writing at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. Johnson would also occasionally teach at the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nAltogether, Johnson was the author of nine novels, one novella, two books of short stories, three collections of poetry, two collections of plays, and one book of reportage. The final book he published while still alive was a novel, \"The Laughing Monsters\", which he called a \"literary thriller\" set in Uganda, Sierra Leone and Congo. It was released on November 4, 2014. Johnson's final work, a book of short stories titled \"The Largesse of the Sea Maiden\", was published posthumously in January 2018.\n\nJohnson was twice divorced and lived with his third wife, Cindy Lee, in Phoenix, Arizona, at the time of his death. They also shared a home in Idaho. Johnson had three children, two of whom he homeschooled; in October 1997 he wrote an article for the website \"Salon\" in defense of homeschooling.\n\nFor most of his twenties, Johnson was addicted to drugs and alcohol and did not do much writing. In 1978 he moved back to his parents’ home in Scottsdale, Arizona, to sober up and find direction. He stopped drinking alcohol in 1978 and quit recreational drugs in 1983.\n\nJohnson died on May 24, 2017 from liver cancer at his home in The Sea\nRanch, a community near Gualala, California, at the age of 67. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8936105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8936105", "title": "Deposition (university)", "text": "Deposition (university)\n\nThe deposition (from Latin \"depositio cornuum\", \"taking off the horns\") was a semi-official initiation ritual which was common at universities throughout Europe from the Middle Ages until the 18th century. The ritual was introduced at German universities in the late 15th century, probably from the influential University of Paris. Models may have included the \"Freisprechung\" ritual in artisan guilds, where apprentices were admitted to the status of journeymen.\n\nA basis for the deposition was the idea that the arriving student was still wild and unpolished before his immatriculation – like an animal – and had to be relieved of the signs of his uncivilised state before he could be accepted as part of the University. The student only had to go through the deposition once in his life; he would receive a deposition certificate (\"Depositionsschein\" in German) which he could show in case of transferring to another university.\n\nThe deposition consisted of scolding, in which the unworthiness of the new student would be clarified to him, in ritual removal of animal-like artificial body parts with the help of over-dimensioned tools, as well as beating and other abuse, which would have the function of a purification ritual.\n\nIn the speeches at the ritual, models from classical antiquity for the deposition process would be cited. Reference would be made to the examination of the Spartan youth, to the customs of the Academy of Plato, and the water consecration among the Athenian Sophists of Late Antiquity.\n\nThe arriving student would in the Middle Ages be known by the term \"beanus\", derived from the French \"bec jaune\", \"yellow beak\" (cf. English \"greenhorn\"). The beanus would be treated by his new fellow students as a \"pecus campi\" (\"animal of the field\") and outfitted correspondingly. He would have to don a hood with horns and put the teeth of a boar sticking out of his mouth. He would then have to listen to a speech about his own unworthiness. The animal-like traits would then be knocked off with the help of over-sized tools. The body of the student would be additionally abused, symbolizing the cleansing and beautification. During the process wood-working tools would be used, as the student still was an \"uncouth man\" (German \"ungehobelt\", unplaned).\n\nAt the University of Leipzig, the tools used in the deposition ritual are still preserved and kept in the art collection. The tools include those used for knocking off or polishing away the animal-like parts (axe, pliers, grindstone), tools for woodworking (plane), and for personal hygiene (shaving brush, shaving cream, shaving knife, ear spoon). Injuries to new students were common with the use of these tools.\n\nAfter this, examinations would be carried out, and additional speeches of admonition would be held. Finally, the leader of the ritual would put salt in the mouth of the beanus (\"sal sapientiae\", \"salt of wisdom\"), pour wine over his head (\"vinum laetitiae\", \"wine of joy\") and declare him free of his \"beanism\".\n\nAfter the payment of the relevant fee, an entrance examination would follow, carried out by a professor, and the matriculation by the rector of the university.\n\nNormally a party would be held at the expense of the newly matriculated student or students, which would obviously be a significant burden for them. This custom was maintained even after the deposition had been abolished and would often be used excessively, leading to the prohibition of forcing the new students to participate in these parties.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the deposition was led by the Rector, as the students in question would live and study under monastery-like circumstances.\n\nIn the Early Modern period, as the schools lost their ecclesiastical character and their finances were reduced, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts (later called the Faculty of Philosophy) would take over the task. In this faculty, the basic scholarly concepts (\"septem artes liberales\") were taught. The teachers and the Dean were, as a rule, students in the \"higher\" faculties of medicine, theology or law. It was during the Early Modern period that the custom of deposition slowly deteriorated into a farce. The position of depositor was taken over by the \"pedell\"; at the end of the 17th century, he would still demonstrate the tools and make out the deposition certificate for a fee.\n\nIn the 18th century, the responsibilities and duties of the depositor were still included in the statutes of a university determined by the ruler of the country. There were also detailed prescriptions on how to keep the tools.\n\nThe last known depositor at the University of Marburg was the pedell Johannes Georg Schimmelpfeng (1697–1785). In Jena, the deposition was abolished after the death of the last depositor in 1785. At the University of Leipzig, the deposition was prohibited by 1719, because of the excesses of the students.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, the new craft of book printing would be established in the vicinity of universities, and the printers – who, at the time, had no old traditions of their own – would borrow the custom of deposition. The deposition of book printers was abolished in 1803 because of the excesses. A reminder of it still exists in the custom of \"Gautschen\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14834924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14834924", "title": "Dr. Fox effect", "text": "Dr. Fox effect\n\nThe Dr. Fox effect is a correlation observed between teacher expressiveness, content coverage, student evaluation and student achievement. This effect also allows insight to other related effects, such as those discussed below, and relationships between student achievement and evaluations of the teacher.\n\nThe original experiment was conducted at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in 1970 in which two speakers gave lectures to a classroom of MDs and PhDs (psychiatrists and psychologists) on an irrelevant topic. The topic, \"Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education\", was chosen to eliminate the factor that the students being lectured may know information about the actual subject. Students were divided into two separate classrooms; one classroom would be lectured by an actual scientist and the other by an actor, Michael Fox, who was given the identity \"Dr. Myron L. Fox\", a graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\nIn the first half of the study the actor was instructed to teach his material in a more monotoned and inexpressive voice. This lecture was then compared to the control lecture by the scientist. After the lectures, the students were tested on the information they had learned and the students who attended the lecture taught by the scientist learned more about the material, and performed better on the examination.\n\nHowever, when both \"Dr. Myron L. Fox\" and the scientist presented their material in an engaging, expressive, and enthusiastic manner, the students rated Dr. Fox just as highly as the genuine professor. This lack of correlation between content-coverage and ratings under conditions of high expressiveness became known as the Dr. Fox Effect.\n\nIn a critique of student evaluations of teaching, professor of law Deborah Merritt summarized the \"Dr. Fox effect\" as it was observed in the first experiments: \"The experimenters created a meaningless lecture on 'Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education,' and coached the actor to deliver it 'with an excessive use of double talk, neologisms, non sequiturs, and contradictory statements.' At the same time, the researchers encouraged the actor to adopt a lively demeanor, convey warmth toward his audience, and intersperse his nonsensical comments with humor. ... The actor fooled not just one, but three separate audiences of professional and graduate students. Despite the emptiness of his lecture, fifty-five psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, graduate students, and other professionals produced evaluations of Dr. Fox that were overwhelmingly positive. ... The disturbing feature of the Dr. Fox study, as the experimenters noted, is that Fox’s nonverbal behaviors so completely masked a meaningless, jargon-filled, and confused presentation.\"\n\nA 1980 study found that prestige of research could even be increased by confounding writing style, with research competency being positively correlated to reading difficulty. Anecdotal evidence has since been reported nowadays by researchers.\n\nIn this study, students were randomly assigned to professors, to eliminate the possibility of good students receiving better professors. These professors were then given all the same syllabi, curriculum levels, and final exams so the difficulty was even across the board. There was also a follow-up course given to the students to test the value of deep learning that the students received. These professors taught introductory calculus to a group of over 10,000 students to achieve the proper information.\n\nWhen the evaluations came through, the professors who were less experienced and less qualified had the best evaluations and best performances on the final exam. However the students who attended the examinations given by the more qualified and experienced professors did best on the follow-up examination. This brought speculation that the professors who were more experienced taught more of a broad manner of the material to produce a deeper understanding. This became obvious in the follow-up examinations.\n\nThe results showed that the professors who instilled a deeper meaning of the material appeared worse on the initial exam and evaluations, but in the long run received better academic standing. This finding calls into question the validity of student evaluations.\n\nCriticisms of the original study include the experiment's lack of a control group, the use of a \"Yes/No\" scale, and lack of measurement evaluating learning among the participants. In a recent study published in the \"Journal of Educational Psychology\", researchers Eyal Peer of Carnegie Mellon University and Elisha Babad of Hebrew University of Jerusalem recreated the original 1973 study taking these criticisms into consideration.\n\nThrough their research, they found that the Dr. Fox effect was still present despite the manipulations they added. Manipulations included the use of a more in-depth questionnaire, removal of the first thirty seconds of video describing the credentials of the lecturer, and a warning at the beginning of the questionnaire to ensure that participants responded honestly.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that although the students with a charismatic teacher enjoyed the lecture more, they reported that they had not actually learned anything new. This is in contrast to the original study, which argued that people attending the lecture actually believed they were learning new material. From their research they were able to reason that an enthusiastic speaker may entertain an audience, but much more is required to be a successful teacher.\n\nThe Halo effect shares similar qualities to those of the Dr. Fox effect in relation to student evaluations of teachers. The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about his or her character. For example, attractive-looking people create a halo effect in which we perceive them as kind, smart or successful, but it may not be true because their attractive appearance clouds our judgment of their performance capabilities. In one study examining halo effect on student evaluation, there was a higher rating for teachers who provided more nonverbal immediacy, but the study also found out that a higher evaluation of teachers was related to a greater halo effect. In the Dr. Fox effect study, a similar effect was found when Dr. Fox presented the lecture in an expressive manner.\n\nFrom the experiment of Dr. Fox effect, the expressiveness of a teacher when delivering lecture material can affect student evaluation of the teacher. Other than that, individual differences among teachers such as personality, popularity, lecture fluency, non verbal behavior, and attractiveness can also have an effect on student evaluation of teachers.\n\nInstructor personality is one factor that has been shown to affect course evaluations. For example, in one study examining the big five personality dimensions, teachers who were perceived to be more extroverted, open, agreeable, and conscientious were evaluated more favorably, whereas teachers who were perceived to be more neurotic were evaluated less favorably. Further, Murray and colleagues suggested that the effects of instructor personality on student evaluations of instructor vary across the type of course. Although some traits, like a teacher’s leadership, consistently predicted course evaluations, other traits varied across type of course. For example, a teacher’s sociability positively predicted course evaluations in introductory psychology courses, but not graduate psychology courses, whereas the ambition of an instructor showed the opposite relationship – predicting evaluations of graduate, but not introductory psychology courses.\n\nThe charisma or popularity of a teacher might also be a factor that contributes to teacher effectiveness and teaching quality. In one study that examined the assessment of charisma as a factor in effective teaching, charismatic teachers tended to receive good student evaluation and were also perceived as being more funny, helpful, encouraging, knowledgeable, sympathetic and other traits that are considered charismatic. Besides that, the study of Yun-Chen Huang and Shu-Hui Lin shows that different teaching methods can also increase the charisma rating of a teacher. For example, teachers that are perceived to be more charismatic offer explanations, answer questions by students, vary their teaching methods, and are also interested in and express concern for their students and their learning progress. Charisma of teachers is becoming more recognized recently with the introduction of an instrument to measure charisma, called \"Inventory of Teaching Charisma in the College Classroom\" (ICCT).\n\nThe fluency of a lecturer when delivering teaching materials can contribute to the effectiveness of student evaluation of a teacher. According to the study of Shana K. Carpenter and colleague that examine the effect of lecture fluency on learning perception, a lecture that is considered to be fluent suggested that the teacher stood upright and straight, maintained eye contact, and spoke fluidly without notes whereas reasons for considering a lecture disfluent include teachers that are slumped and stand with a bent back, look away, and speak haltingly with notes. Furthermore, the study also shows that fluent teachers that are prepared and well organized will receive higher ratings than a disfluent teacher that is unprepared and disorganized in student evaluations of the teacher. Although the same study of lecture fluency on learning perception successfully shows that lecture fluency will increase the student rating of a teacher, further interpretation of the results suggests that lecture fluency biases the students’ perceptions of their own learning because lecture fluency did not actually affect the amount of information learned.\n\nNon verbal behavior or non verbal communication is a series of wordless behavior that is projected by the speaker to the listener. Common examples of non verbal behavior include eye contact, smile, facial expression, distance between speaker and listener and any other wordless behavior that can communicate information between people. According to Virginia P. Richmond on 'Teacher Nonverbal Immediacy', teachers that show more positive nonverbal behavior increase the immediacy between students and also contribute to higher student rating. For instance, teachers with higher rating by students were more likely to express non verbal behavior like smiling, walking around, head nodding and touching upper torsos whereas low rating teachers were more likely to touch their head, head shaking rather than nodding, and sitting on a chair. One study by Ambady and Rosenthal shows that subjects were able to form accurate judgement of impression by just watching short video clips of teachers providing non verbal behavior. An example from the study, participants were able to form accurate impressions of the teachers by just watching 10-second, 5-second, and 2-second lengths of short clips about teachers walking to classrooms. Ambady research provides support that nonverbal behavior has a strong influence on impression formation of teachers.\n\nThe way that teachers present themselves or the attire they wear when teaching lectures can be a factor on student evaluation of teachers. According to Virginia P. Richmond, the attire of a teacher influences the way that students perceive their teacher. For example, teachers are perceived to be more competent, organized, prepared and knowledgeable when they dress formally with a coat and tie but they are also presumed to be not receptive to students' needs and low in student–teacher interaction. However, when teachers dress casually with collar-button shirts and jeans, they are perceived to be more friendly, flexible, fair and open but not so competent. From another study about predicting teacher evaluation from physical appearance, attire and appearance may be a factor influencing the rating by students but the effect will somewhat diminish when other more important and significant information is provided. For instance, the study found out that unattractive voices dilute the effects of attractive faces of teachers.\n\n\nThe actor portraying Dr. Fox was given one day to prepare for the lecture and was coached by the authors to present the lecture \"with an excessive use of double-talk, neologisms, non sequiturs, and contradicting statements.”\n\nThere are previous reports and studies that show that the personality of a teacher/lecturer is one of the most important variables when it comes to evaluating the teacher’s effectiveness. Getzels and Jackson, with support from Wallen and Travers, expressed that the personality and patterns of teacher behavior and methods presented represent the main forces for the most significant variable in evaluating the teacher’s effectiveness. Goffman explains that the receptivity of the audience is highly influenced by the person introducing the lecture, the quality of the introduction, and the speaker’s involuntary expressive behavior, which becomes a decisive factor in how the audience responds to the conveying information. One study which looked at the student perceptions of educators from 7th to 12th grade and reported that the students regarded “teacher charisma or popularity” as the most important characteristic when rating teachers.\n\nIf the charisma or popularity of the teachers have such an effect on their effectiveness ratings by junior high and high school students, would the ratings be influenced in the same way with a group of highly trained professional educators in a learning situation? So what the authors were looking to see is that if a sufficiently impressive lecture was given, would it result in an experienced group of high end educators participating in a new learning situation feeling satisfied that they had learned from the lecture despite irrelevant, conflicting, and meaningless content conveyed by the lecturer.\n\n\n"}

Emotion work has use value and occurs in situations in which people choose to regulate their emotions for their own non-compensated benefit (e.g., in their interactions with family and friends). By contrast, emotional labor has exchange value because it is traded and performed for a wage.\n\nIn a later development, Hochschild distinguished between two broad types of emotion work, and among three techniques of emotion work. The two broad types involve evocation and suppression of emotion, while the three techniques of emotion work that Hochschild describes are cognitive, bodily and expressive.\n\nHowever, the concept (if not the term) has been traced back as far as Aristotle: as Aristotle saw, the problem is not with emotionality, but with the \"appropriateness\" of emotion and its expression.\n\nExamples of emotion work include showing affection, apologizing after an argument, bringing up problems that need to be addressed in an intimate relationship or any kind of interpersonal relationship, and making sure the household runs smoothly.\n\nEmotion work also involves the orientation of self/others to accord with accepted norms of emotional expression: emotion work is often performed by family members and friends, who put pressure on individuals to conform to emotional norms. Arguably, then, an individual's ultimate obeisance and/or resistance to aspects of emotion regimes are made visible in their emotion work.\n\nCultural norms often imply that emotion work is reserved for females. There is certainly evidence to the effect that the emotional management that women and men do is asymmetric; and that in general, women come into a marriage groomed for the role of emotional manager.\n\nThe social theorist, Victor Jeleniewski Seidler, argues that women's emotion work is merely another demonstration of false consciousness under patriarchy, and that emotion work, as a concept, has been adopted, adapted or criticized to such an extent that it is in danger of becoming a \"catch-all-cliché\".\n\nMore broadly, the concept of emotion work has itself been criticized as a wide over-simplification of mental processes such as repression and denial which continually occur in everyday life.\n\nRousseau in \"The New Heloise\" suggests that the attempt to master instrumentally one's affective life always results in a weakening and eventually the fragmentation of one's identity, even if the emotion work is performed at the demand of ethical principles.\n"}

ΣΝΔ (SND), lit. \"School of Naval Cadets\") is a military university and has the responsibility to educate and suitably train competent Naval Officers for the Hellenic Navy. Its full name is \"Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy\" and was founded in 1845. The academy is one of the oldest educational institutions in Greece.\n\nThe academy educates Deck and Engineering Naval cadets. It may also educate Supply Officer cadets as well as Coast Guard Officer cadets. Foreign nationals are also accepted to study as naval cadets in the academy.\n\nThe academy has a long history in naval education. Its presence is closely associated with the foundation and evolution of the Hellenic Navy, covering a period of 150 years of educational work. The Academy was founded in 1845 as a naval training school on board the HN corvette . For 50 years, it operated unofficially on board various combat ships, stabilizing its position and improving its work.\n\nIn 1884, the academy was officially reorganized by the Greek State and new facilities were built to house its operations. At the time, the academy's quarters were on board the HN corvette \"Hellas\".\n\nIn 1905 it was transferred to Piraeus, where it has remained ever since. The academy's base was transferred to a new and permanent installation beside the harbour of Piraeus, by the entrance of the main port. The operating conditions were greatly improved by the new quarters and this better facilitated its operation. New cadets were accepted and new Navy ships were appointed to help in the educational process.\n\nSince then, during its 150 years of operation, the Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy has evolved into one of the most prestigious institutions in Greece. More than 5,000 Naval Officers have graduated and led the Hellenic Navy, while many others have distinguished themselves in science, technology and politics. The organization and structure of the academy has made great reforms, always according to the needs of the Hellenic Navy.\n\nThe Academy's organization is divided into two main branches. The first branch deals with education and training and includes four Directorates: The Naval Cadet Administration, the Nautical and Military training, the Athletics and the Academic Studies direcrorate. The second branch is responsible of base support and everything that needs to be done for the academy's proper function.\n\nThe academy is commanded by an officer of the higher naval ranks. Issues involving academic studies are examined by the Superior Educational Council, a body formed of academy professors and naval officers under the chairmanship of the Academy Superintendent.\n\nThe screening procedure for the selection of new cadets is based on the established system of national examinations, undertaken by all university candidates in Greece. The Hellenic Naval Academy runs additional health, intelligence and athletic tests on its candidates. About 400 cadets study in the Academy each year. All lessons are taught in Greek and basic training lasts for 4 years.\n\nGreek nationals are admitted to the Hellenic Naval Academy following both: successful participation to the preliminary examination that includes gymnastics, physical and psychological tests and, successful participation to the annual national examinations, operated by the Ministry of Education. The number of admissions is decided by the Ministry of Defence, which issues an annual call for applications and always according to the Navy needs.\n\nForeign nationals are selected primarily by their governments, following bilateral agreements with the Greek state. Candidates must provide confirmation, issued by their government, that they have been selected for the particular military academy and must hold a birth certificate, a health certificate and a certificate of education equivalent to the \"Greek Secondary Education Certificate\", required for admission to any \"Highest Educational Institution\" (University) in Greece.\n\nUpon arrival, the foreign students attend one-year preparatory courses. The beginners level teaching is conducted in Arabic, English and French. During that year, students take Greek language courses, mathematics, physics and chemistry fundamental courses and undergo military training. After the preparatory year, the foreign cadets join the full academic and military 4-year course, following the same program and obligations as their Greek colleagues. The costs of education are covered by scholarships and include accommodation, tuition, training and clothing expenses, but not travel costs, to and from Greece.\n\nThe Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy offers a 4-year course. Aim of the education offered is to provide graduates (both deck officers and engineers) with adequate skills and knowledge to perform their duties as Navy Officers and keep up with evolving developments in naval science, strategy and technology of naval warfare.\n\nThe day at the academy begins at 6.00 am. For five days every week the cadets attend an intense training program (academic, athletic and marine) while the afternoon is available for the rest of the academy activities as well as various cultural, athletic and social events. The academic year is divided in two semesters.\n\nDuring the winter term, cadets attend academic courses, professional military courses and naval training courses (off board). In addition, they receive practical courses by participating in short training voyages on various naval ships. During the Summer term, cadets of the first three classes embark for a two months training cruise, until recently on board the training ship HN \"Aris\" and for the past few years usually on board a Frigate and a General Support Ship. The trip includes approaching at ports of various countries. Conditions for cadets to familiarize themselves with the profession and duties of an officer, are provided through instractions on professional matters, on board training and application of the theory taught, together with drills carried out during the cruise.\n\nCadets graduate from the academy provided they have concluded successfully all years and courses (academic and practical). Upon their graduation, all naval officers are commissioned to combat units of the Hellenic Navy fleet. During the graduation ceremony the flag of the Hellenic Naval Academy, following tradition, is handed over by new Navy Officers to the 3rd year cadets.\n\nIn the beginning of their career, officers serve in battle-ships and attend certain specialized schools. These schools have as goal to enhance their expertise and make them familiar with the battle-ship operations and function during peace and war.\n\nMore specifically, officers are trained along the following lines:\n\nImmediately after they graduate, officers attend a four to six-month school where they receive additional theoretical and practical training and learn about system and equipment of their appointed battle-ships, as well as their duties as officers on those ships. During the first stages of their career, officers may also choose to serve in submarines, helicopters, marine patrol aircraft and underwater demolition (Special Forces), after being trained in their respective training schools.\n\nFurthermore, when promoted to \"Lieutenant Junior Grade\", they go through a training stage lasting nine to eleven months. There they follow training held by various specialization departments of the Navy. According to the department they choose (or are appointed according to Navy needs), they take a degree of specialization to one of the following subjects: gunnery, navigation, communications and electronic engineering.\n\nLieutenant officers attend the \"Navy Staff Officers School\" and the \"Naval War School\" for 3 to 4 months on each school, where they obtain a \"Staff Officer\" degree. An officer may then serve as staff officer in various departments of the Hellenic Navy.\n\nFinally, officers ranked \"Lieutenant Junior Grade\" and \"Lieutenant\", may be educated abroad (in Europe or in the United States) in schools such as NPS, MIT, the University of Michigan etc., thus becoming further specialized in fields such as electronics, weapon systems, computers, operation research, marine architecture etc.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53687225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53687225", "title": "Kindergarten readiness", "text": "Kindergarten readiness\n\nKindergarten readiness refers to the developmental domains that contribute to children's ability to adapt to the kindergarten classroom, which is often a new and unfamiliar environment. There is no single agreed upon definition of Kindergarten readiness. The domains often included in the definition include, academic skills (e.g., early literacy and mathematics understanding, etc.), social-emotional development (e.g., self-regulation, prosocial behaviour, etc.), and physical development (e.g., motor development, sensory development, etc.). In addition to these competencies, the child's environment and opportunities for learning should also be considered. This includes the child's home environment and their interactions with teachers and peers.\n\nWhen assessing children's readiness for kindergarten, much of the discussion is focused on the emergence of basic academic skills, including reading, writing, and arithmetic, which are commonly referred to as the “three Rs” (United States Department of Education, 2001). This is likely because upon entering kindergarten, academic skills—such as literacy and numeracy—predict later academic success. \n\nReading is an important skill as reading ability during primary school predicts academic achievement and later success. Therefore, particular emphasis is usually placed upon the development of literacy skills for preschool and kindergarten students to prepare them for the future. Children are not expected to read upon entering kindergarten. However, they are expected to have phonemic and phonological awareness, as well as a knowledge of print. Phonemic awareness is the first step in learning to read; it refers to the ability to hear and manipulate the smallest forms of language known as phonemes. Phonemic awareness upon entering kindergarten is the strongest predictor of reading success. Once a child understands phonemes, the next step is to develop phonological awareness, which is the ability to recognize that there is a relationship between sounds and letters, and letters and words. Phonological awareness strongly predicts the development of literacy skills. Upon entering kindergarten, children should also be able to recognize their own name in print, know how to handle a book, recognize letters, and identify words that rhyme. These are all predictors of literacy success.\n\nAnother important aspect of reading development is the understanding of narrative structures, which lends to better comprehension skills. Vocabulary development is closely associated with comprehension skills; those with weaker vocabularies may have difficulties following narratives. \n\nUpon entering Kindergarten, children typically make attempts to write their own name and letters that have been dictated, and are able to master some of the letters (NCLD, Pianta). In order to write letters, children must be able to integrate auditory information (what sound the letter makes) and orthographic skills (knowledge of letters and print convention). Children's developing ability to write letters is related to later literacy outcomes such as reading compression and spelling (Pianta). However, during the transition into Kindergarten the primary focus in terms of relevant writing skills involves the physical ability to draw (i.e., motor skills). Kindergarten aged students can typically draw pictures of themselves and their families and use a variety of different sized lines and shapes in their drawings (NCLD).\n\nIn general, children are expected to have knowledge of numbers to demonstrate kindergarten readiness. Children generally should be able to count to at least 10, count about 5 objects, demonstrate knowledge of adding or taking away objects, and identify basic shapes, such as triangles, circles, and squares (NCLD, 2006). Recent studies in Australia have suggested that children know much more mathematics than kindergarten teachers would expect upon beginning kindergarten. In general, children should demonstrate problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and calculation abilities. Children engage in nonverbal calculation at early ages; however the transition from nonverbal to verbal calculation does not take place until approximately five and half years of age (Mix, Huttenlocher, & Levine, 2002). Therefore, preschool children, including those entering kindergarten, should have a sense of quantitative reasoning. The transition to verbal problem-solving does not occur until they become familiar with conventional symbols (p. 112).\n\nMathematical knowledge during preschool predicts later school success. However, preschool and kindergarten students in low-income settings have been shown to have significantly less developed mathematical skills than students from middle-income homes. As such, particular attention has been given to developing math interventions. \n\nThe transition to Kindergarten often requires children to adapt to a new and different environment. This new environment is typically more structured and filled with more prolonged social engagement than their home environment. Children use their social and emotional abilities in order to navigate this new and unfamiliar environment. Although social and emotional skills are sometimes not included in definitions of Kindergarten readiness, focus groups surveys indicate that teachers often advocate that developed social skills are more important than academic skills as children enter school. Social skills function as tools to help children learn more quickly and promote peer acceptance, contributing to a more positive outlook on school.\n\nBetween the ages of 3-6 children undergo dramatic development in their social and cognitive abilities. The development of these skills provides them with the tools to navigate the social context of a kindergarten classroom. These developments become obvious during children's social interactions that transform from playing alongside of their peers, to more complex and coordinated play amongst peers.  This transformation in social abilities comes about not only from an increase in language abilities, and increasing self-regulation abilities, but also from the quickly developing ability to consider other people's perspectives.  Perspective taking allows children to take into account others’ points of view, and to appreciate that others’ points of view may be different from their own. This ability develops rapidly between ages 3–6 and continues to develop throughout adolescence. Not only is it important for children entering kindergarten to be able to take into account their peers’ points of view, it is also important for them to be able to consider their teacher's perspective\n\nThe ability to consider others’ perspectives also gives way to the development of social empathy. Children begin to appreciate that other people can experience emotions that are different from their own, and that their actions towards others can affect their emotions. This developing understanding, paired with their increasing self-regulation abilities, enables children to interact and develop meaningful relationships, as well as the ability to successfully manage conflicts.\n\nIn addition to promoting positive peer relationships, successfully managing the social environment of the kindergarten classroom also contributes to more positive academic outcomes. Through more positive social interactions, children are better able to access the resources that they need to thrive in the classroom setting. For example, if the child is able to appropriately and effectively interact with the teacher, the child is more likely to receive assistance and attention when necessary. Additionally, if the child is able to engage and participate with her peers, it is more likely that she will be included and form more meaningful relationships, thereby associating school with positive experiences.\n\nChildren's development does not occur in a vacuum. They are constantly being influenced by the environments that they are surrounded by. At the same time, children's behaviours and reactions have an effect on their environments as well. During the preschool years, children spend the majority of their time surrounded by their immediate family. Therefore, the family environment will significantly influence how a child develops during this age period. Therefore, parents play an important role concerning their child's readiness for the kindergarten classroom. In fact, children have better academic skills when their relationship with family is characterized as warm, accepting, involved and when parents value education (Hill, 2001). Furthermore, parent-child interactions that are structured and responsive are positively related to school readiness.\n\nA key aspect in this type of parent-child interaction is being sensitive to the child's skill level in order to provide the appropriate amount of support when guiding the child's learning. This type of guidance is known as scaffolding, in which the level of support given to the child decreases as the child's skill level increases on a given task. Just as scaffolding around a building is removed as the building gets nearer to completion, the amount of help that is provided to the child decreases as the child begins to master a certain task. The decreasing amount of support allows the child to have more autonomy which gives them the opportunity to practice their newly developing skills. Scaffolding can be implemented in any type of learning, but is especially helpful in the preschool age-range to teach about conflict resolution in social settings, emotion regulation, and problem solving.\n\nWhen children enter Kindergarten, they experience a shift from the family acting as a primary influence on the child's development, to an increased influence from their classroom environment. An important factor that contributes to how well a child adapts to the Kindergarten environment is his/her relationship with the teacher. When children form a close relationship with their teacher, they appear better adjusted within the kindergarten context compared to when a conflictual relationship is developed. Children feel more comfortable approaching their teacher, as well as expressing their thoughts and feelings when a warm and open relationship is developed. This allows the child to effectively use the teacher as a means for support. This support can come in the form of social, emotional, or academic assistance which ultimately contributes to promoting the child's opportunities for success in the Kindergarten classroom.\n\nThe teacher-child relationship has also been shown to be affected through intervention strategies. For example, the Chicago School Readiness Project trained teachers in classroom behaviour management strategies in order to promote greater emotional support in the classroom. Children in classrooms whose teachers’ received the intervention showed better self-regulation, fewer behaviour problems, and better academic skills compared to children in classrooms whose teachers had not received the training.\n\nUpon entering kindergarten most children should have passed certain developmental milestones in their motor and sensory development. Fine motor development, which involves manipulating small objects and forming pencil grips are necessary for the development of other academic skills. For example, by age five, children usually possess the fine motor skills to allow them to print some letters, draw a person with a head, a body, legs, and arms, as well as other shapes, such as triangles, squares, and circles. Similarly, they can also manipulate scissors to cut a straight line, use a fork and knife effectively, and tie their shoelaces. Fine motor skills upon entering kindergarten are associated with academic performance in reading and writing in later grades (QLSCD 1998-2010), as well as academic achievement in mathematics. \n\nDevelopmental milestones for gross motor development include learning to skip, catching a ball, jumping over small objects, and walking down stairs using alternate feet and a handrail. The peak period of development for motor skills occurs from birth to age five. As such, children entering kindergarten can walk, run, jump, and climb and are developing control of their bodies.\n\nSensory developmental milestones are also used as indicators of kindergarten readiness. For example, by age five, children should know their colours, count using their fingers, manipulate a book and read it from left to right, and draw pictures that represent animals, objects, or people. \n\nOral-language development involves the development of receptive language, which is the ability to understand when spoken to, and expressive language, which is the ability to produce language. Kindergarten readiness requires development in both. For example, students are expected to have a vocabulary of approximately 2000 words by age five; Canadian Language & Literacy Research Network, 2009). Similarly, they are expected to be using approximately five to eight words in a sentence. In general, however, children entering kindergarten are expected to understand instructions and communications from adults and peers (Pivik, 2012). They are also expected to communicate their needs and ideas in a way that can be understood by others. Simply stated, they must be able to use language as a tool to be functional within the kindergarten setting.\n\nOral language is of particular importance for children entering kindergarten as it is a predictor and necessary requirement of literacy development (Hill, 2011). However, the transition from oral-language development to literacy is not clearly defined and hierarchical. Rather, it is a multidimensional and complex transition (p. 52). Nevertheless, oral language development provides the framework and opportunity for children to develop literacy skills. Children are able to build upon their previously mastered oral skills or vocabulary to help them learn new skills, such as reading or writing.\n\nOral language can be taught explicitly and implicitly through play. For example, dramatic play can allow for the child to take on different roles and use language as a tool in different contexts (Hill, 2011). Play also has a positive impact on literacy, self-regulation, and social-understanding (Van Reet, 2012). For example, play is strongly related to language development in the form of procedural knowledge, such as how to apply proper grammar, which occurs through observation and exposure, as opposed to direct instruction (p. 20). \n\nIn order to learn and engage in a classroom environment, children must be able to direct their attention effectively. Specifically, children need to be able to extract the important messages from the surrounding noise or distractions. Adults are much more adept at blocking out distracting information in their environment compared to children. Therefore, the distractions that might impact a child's ability to focus his or her attention may be difficult for an adult to appreciate. Distractions can present themselves in the form of auditory sounds, such as other children talking in the classroom, noise from a television, cars driving by outside, etc. However, visual information can also be distracting to children, hindering them from properly focusing their attention. For instance, if a child is attempting to concentrate on a given task in a room where there are many interesting things around her, the abundance of visual information will make it harder for her to concentrate on the task at hand. The more distractions that are present in the child's environment, the more effortful it will be for the child to effectively focus her attention.\n\nAnother important aspect of learning involves the ability to discern what is relevant from what is not. In everyday conversation we are continuously picking out the important parts of what is being said in order to commit the relevant information to memory. This skill is particularly important for children to be able to learn and follow instructions in a classroom environment. When young children listen to someone speaking, such as instructions from a teacher,  it is important for them to be able to pick out the important information so that they are able to do what has been asked.\n\nAnother area in which children often show difficulty is engaging in a new task. This is a necessary skill in kindergarten given the continuous switching of activities that happens throughout the day. Many children have little trouble focusing on a particular activity, but when asked to switch, have difficulty on the next. This can decrease their performance on the new task, or hinder their ability to learn from it.\n\nThe cognitive ability that is implicated in these situations is known as inhibitory control (IC). Inhibitory control is known as the ability to inhibit a prepotent (or initial) response, and instead respond with a more appropriate action.  This term is used somewhat interchangeably with related terms such as, self-regulation, effortful control, attentional control, etc. However, the divide between the terms is not substantive (Allan et al. 2014).\n\n The preschool age marks a time of rapid development of inhibitory control, and not surprisingly, plays an important role in children's adjustment to kindergarten. Although there is marked development, the relationship between IC and other developmental outcomes (e.g., academic, social, etc.) remains intact. Inhibitory control is important in many aspects of kindergarten readiness but is particularly relevant to children's academic outcomes. Although IC is implicated in both literacy and math skills, is it particularly important for math.\n\nIC has been measured using a variety of methods. Namely, researchers typically use behavioural methods, in which children are asked to complete short tasks that require the use of IC. Researchers also use reports in the forms of surveys from parents and teachers. Typically, behavioural methods and teacher reports have the closest relationship to children's academic outcomes. Both of these methods can reveal important information when investigating the relationship between IC and academic performance as they lend information from different contexts, with behavioural methods providing information about the child's objective abilities, and teacher reports providing information about the subjective classroom experience. Together these methods provide a more complete understanding of the relationship.\n\n An important consideration is that difficulties that children may have in regards to focusing their attention becomes amplified when they are experiencing strong emotions. It is also important to rule out physical problems (hearing and vision) as they may present themselves as an attention problem but can be easily remedied with heading or visual aid\n\nThere are four key risk factors that are associated with educational disadvantages upon entry into kindergarten in the United States. They include having a mother with less than a high school education, living in a family that receives food stamps or welfare, living in a single-parent home, and having parents whose native tongue is other than English (United States Department of Education, 2001). Individuals with a single risk factor are likely to lag in reading or writing skills; those with multiple risk factors have a 50% chance of scoring in the bottom quartiles in reading, mathematics, or general knowledge. For example, those with multiple risk factors are less likely to know the alphabet or be able to count to 20 before beginning kindergarten, which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison to other students without risk factors (p. 21). Families who live in poverty are generally less able to provide learning opportunities, such as books or toys to their children. Lack of school readiness has been linked with later school dropout. However, longitudinal studies in Quebec suggest that social-emotional and social skills training can help some students improve their academic paths and eventually graduate from high school.\n\nParents and family environments can play a protective role against the risk of educational disadvantage.  In fact, the home and family environments have the greatest impact on whether or not a child is ready to begin school (Pivik, 2012). For example, parents have many roles in preparing children for kindergarten, including providing the child with proper nutrition, health care, and opportunity for growth. Families can also act as advocates, teachers, and providers for their children.\n\nRecent discussions have moved from the traditional focus of developing the “three R’s” to considering skills that are inherent to the digital age. For example, through exposure to tablets, children are learning traditional skills in new ways. As opposed to manipulating books and toys, many children spend their time learning via technology. Literacy apps, videos, and games are most commonly used. However, the manipulation of the iPad itself lends to a different type of motor development than traditional paper instruction, such as swiping, touching, and tapping (Burnett & Daniels, 2016). Nevertheless, children may have similar interactions when reading with adults using tablets as they might when using printed materials (Burnett & Daniels, 2016).\n\nMany efforts by large television networks has been directed at developing media content for pre-schoolers with the aim of fostering healthy social-emotional development (Nikolayev, Clark, & Reich, 2016). However, the online games that are targeted for social-emotional development among pre-school students are mostly focused on recognition of one's own emotional skills, relationships with adults, cooperative play with peers, or formation of self-identity (Nikolayev, Clark, & Reich, 2016). Most games also focus on modeling appropriate social behaviour as opposed to having children practice their own skills through the game. \n\nThe Kindergarten Behaviour and Academic Competency Scale (KBACS):\n\nThe KBACS is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher in order to assess the child's readiness for school. The teacher rates the child across a variety of domains such as following classroom rules, completing work, etc. using a 5-point scale (ranging from poor to excellent). Studies have shown that the KBACS is associated with other measures of school readiness, and has excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .82; Granziano et al. 2015).\n\nThe Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA):\n\nThe BSRA is a widely used kindergarten readiness test that measures a child's exposure to concepts that support learning at school. It contains five subtests assessing knowledge of colours, letters, numbers/counting, size/comparisons, and shapes. Unlike a questionnaire, the BSRA is structured as a set of tests to be completed with the child. The BSRA is used in some public and private schools to determine eligibility for gifted and talented programs. Studies have shown that children's scores on the BSRA are predictive of their later academic outcomes (Panter & Bracken, 2009).\n\nThe Early Development Instrument (EDI):\n\nThe EDI is a questionnaire that is completed by a child's teacher. It was designed to measure children's school readiness and has been described as a holistic, or multidimensional approach as it includes measures outside of the academic domain. It contains 104 items and measures five domains including, physical health and well-being (e.g., gross and fine motor skills, physical independence, etc.), social competence (e.g., responsibility and respect, approaches to learning, etc.), emotional maturity (e.g., prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity and inattention, etc.), language and cognitive development (e.g., basic numeracy, basic literacy, etc.), and communication skills and general knowledge (e.g., ability to communicate needs, ability to tell a story, etc.) (Janus & Offord, 2007). Studies have shown that the EDI is a good predictor of children's early school achievement, especially with children on the extreme ends of the rating scale (i.e., exceptionally low scores or exceptionally high scores.) (Boivin & Bierman)\n\nThe Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness – Revised\n\nThe Diagnostic Screening Test of School Readiness is commonly known as the Lollipop test and is a measure of school readiness that focuses on academic components of readiness. It contains four subtests including, identification of colours and shapes and copying shapes, spatial recognition, identification of numbers and counting, and identification of letters and writing. These subtests are administered to a child individually. The test was designed to be quick and easy to administer and studies have shown that children's scores on the Lollipop test are associated with other measures of school readiness, and is predictive early school achievement (Chew 1987, Boivin & Bierman).\n"}

The family later moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and after working at schools in Newcastle, Bridges-Adams studied at the University of London and in 1882 was awarded a distinction at Bedford College, London, in Greek and Maths. She married Walter Bridges-Adams on 22 October 1887.\n\nBridges-Adams's early career was as a teacher in schools in Birmingham and in London, and she was also the headmistress of a board school (a type of free elementary school established by the Elementary Education Act 1870). In 1894 she stood for election to the London School Board, representing the Greenwich division, supported by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, trade unions (the Gas Workers' Union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers) and the London Nonconformist Council. She failed to be elected, but was successful three years later, and was re-elected in 1900 as the sole Independent Labour Party candidate, with an increased majority, remaining a member of the board until its abolition. The school boards were then one of the few elected bodies of the United Kingdom on which women could serve.\n\nIn 1900, she was involved in the opening of a Fröbel-influenced free \"kindergarten\" in Woolwich, London; this was the first such educational establishment in England. With the closing of the school boards, she became secretary to Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, and with her continued campaigning. In 1905, the two led a motor tour of the country to promote the concept of free school meals. Bridges-Adams founded the first 'Open Air School for Recovery' (which aimed to show the \"therapeutic effects of open air and regular meals on debilitated children\") in Bostall Woods, London in 1907 and another on Shooter's Hill, London, the following year.\n\nShe supported adult education for workers through the Plebs League and the Central Labour College, and founded the Working Women's Movement. Outside of her education-related campaigning, Bridges-Adams was also involved in other causes. She fought for improved living conditions of working class women: as a member of her local Woolwich Women's Co-operative Guild, she campaigned for improved housing and sanitation, and for the building of cultural facilities such as a picture gallery and a free library. In 1917, alongside Joseph King (a Member of Parliament) and Lord Edward Stanley (a peer and former member of the London School Board), she campaigned for the continuation of the right of asylum for refugees from the Russian Empire.\n\nOn 22 October 1887, the then Mary Daltry married Walter Bridges Adams, the son of William Bridges Adams. Together they had one son, William Bridges-Adams (1889–1965). Her husband predeceased her, dying in 1902.\n\nHer husband's family paid for her son to attend Bedales School, a progressive private school. Though this may have conflicted with her own views about education, sending her son to a fee-paying boarding school was likely the only way she could have continued her activism as a single-parent.\n"}

Over the following two decades, his illustrious career included time served as principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre (1947), the Cuban National Ballet (1948–1949), the New York City Ballet (1950–1953), Great Moments of Ballet (1954), and the London Festival Ballet (1955). He was a guest artist at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the summers of 1951, 1953, and 1954.\n\nMaule was not a bravura dancer, but he possessed a sound classical technique, and his fine Scottish looks—a sturdy figure, handsome head, pale complexion, and light red hair—added to his strong stage presence. Particularly noted for his gracious partnering, he often appeared as cavalier and partner to leading ballerinas of his day, including Maria Tallchief, Alicia Markova, Patricia Wilde, Alexandra Danilova, Alicia Alonso, Belinda Wright, and Marilyn Burr, among others. \n\nWith the New York City Ballet. Maule danced many works in the repertory choreographed by George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. He originated roles in two major works by Robbins—the First Intruder in \"The Cage\" (1951) and one of the two Trumpets in \"Fanfare\" (1953)—and was a member of the original ensemble of Balanchine's \"Scotch Symphony\" (1952). On Broadway, he danced Balanchine's choreography again in the 1957 revival of \"The Merry Widow\", partnering Mary Ellen Moylan.\n\nIn 1953, Maule was first choice for the role of Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple, the bridegroom in the movie version of \"Brigadoon\" (1954), a romantic fantasy of an enchanted village in the Scottish Highlands. His chance at Hollywood stardom came to naught, however, when he was replaced by Jimmy Thompson before filming started. On television, he danced on \"The Bell Telephone Hour\" in 1962 and on \"Camera Three\" in 1965. Subsequently, he choreographed ballets for Great Moments of Ballet and London Festival Ballet. \n\nAfter retiring from the stage, Maule taught ballet technique in numerous schools and venues, including the American Ballet Theatre School, the Robert Joffrey School, and the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois, where he served as the first director of dance (1972–1976), having been recommended for the job by Margot Fonteyn. He also taught at the Juilliard School's Dance Division, at the Melissa Hayden studio, and in his own studio in an upper floor of Carnegie Hall. Abroad, he was an invited guest teacher at schools and studios in the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, and the Philippines.\n\nMaule became a permanent resident of the United States in 1956. For several years prior to his death he lived in Vero Beach, Florida, with his second wife, Katherine, who is the mother of ballet dancer John Gardner. He died on 15 March 2017 at the age of 95.\n\n"}

The global initiative aims to bring together young people with different cultural backgrounds from all over the world to promote mutual understanding and inspire in them a long-term enthusiasm for intercultural exchange. Mondialogo is primarily addressing pupils, students and teachers worldwide. The writers Henning Mankell and Paulo Coelho are ambassadors for Mondialogo.\n\nThe Mondialogo School Contest is the world’s largest international contest for pupils between the ages of 14 and 18. All registered school teams are given a partner team previously unknown to them from a different region of the world. The teams establish contact, get to know each other and then develop a mutual project that should deal with topics such as peace, fair play, preventing discrimination, a sustainable future, identity, respectfulness toward cultural diversity or emigration/immigration.\n\nAt the end of a 6-month work phase the results of the teams are judged by an international jury. The top 25 entries are chosen and the teams get invited to a symposium lasting several days. This is an opportunity for pupils and teachers from all over the world to meet and get to know each other in person.\n\nTwo rounds of the Mondialogo School Contest have already been completed: 25,000 pupils from 126 countries took part in the 2003/2004 contest. The awards were given out in 2004 in Barcelona. The second contest saw the participation of 35,000 pupils (in 2,600 teams) from 138 countries. The symposium took place in Rome in 2006. The third round is finished and the symposium took place in Beijing in 2008.\n\nThe Mondialogo Engineering Award calls for engineering students from developed and developing countries to form international project team and enter project proposals addressing the United Nations Millennium Development Goals – proposals that are capable of advancing the quality of life in the developing countries.\n\nThe first two rounds had 3,600 young engineers from 113 countries in 1,500 project teams participating in the Mondialogo Engineering Award. After a six-month project work phase the teams entered project proposals that are judged by an international jury of experts. The top 30 entrees are awarded prizes given out during a symposium lasting several days. The symposia took place in Berlin and Mumbai, respectively. The awards are endowed with a prize money of altogether €300,000, intended to help get the project proposals realised.\n\nThe Mondialogo Internet Portal is the initiative's communications and information platform. In five languages, it offers a global online-community of over 26,000 members from 174 countries many features that allow them to communicate, interact, and network.\n\nTeams participating in the Mondialogo School Contest and the Mondialogo Engineering Award here have virtual project offices that allow them to jointly work on their projects.\n\nDetails about the contests, news surrounding intercultural dialogue, and the Mondialogo Magazine are also provided on the portal, as well as all the latest about current developments and former projects, which can be found in the Inside Mondialogo Blog, written by members of the team and former participants.\n\nSince being founded in 2003, Mondialogo has been awarded several prizes for furthering intercultural dialogue.

{"id": "1857560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1857560", "title": "Musikalisches Würfelspiel", "text": "Musikalisches Würfelspiel\n\nA (German for \"musical dice game\") was a system for using dice to randomly 'generate' music from precomposed options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different games were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a random number.'\n\nThe earliest example is Johann Philipp Kirnberger's ' (German for \"The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer\") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]). Examples by well known composers include C. P. E. Bach's ' (German for \"A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules\") (1758) and Maximilian Stadler's \"\" (French for \"A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice\") (1780).\n\nIn the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable playing cards, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a parlour game.\n\nAccording to Lawrence Zbikowski, \"In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc.\"\n\nAccording to Stephen Hedges, \"The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.\n\nAccording to Leonard Meyer, \"Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]\". See: musical development.\n\nThe way these games work may be understood in analogy to sentence construction.\nOne rolls one die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, \"The pig ran past the marsh.\" Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight variations rather than being entirely different.\n\nThe most well-known was published in 1792, by Mozart's publisher Nikolaus Simrock in Berlin (K. 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated. The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 11 = 45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes. Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).\n\nMozart's manuscript K. 516f, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-bar fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved.\n\nThe titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are:\n\nRobert Xavier Rodríguez composed his \"Musical Dice Game\" for string orchestra based on K. 516f.\n\nThe attribution of Joseph Haydn's \"\" (Italian for \"The game of harmony, or an easy method for composing an infinite number of minuet-trios, without any knowledge of counterpoint\") has also not been authenticated.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3119143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3119143", "title": "National Academic League", "text": "National Academic League\n\nThe National Academic League (NAL) is a popular in junior high schools (middle schools) around the United States. In participating schools, two coaches and anywhere from at least fifteen to approximately forty students compete with other schools in the same district. Students study math, science, geography, world history, and language arts. In the game, students prepare presentations about current events, and/or answer questions from any of the above listed categories. If a championship is won, it is possible to compete all the way to a national level. Most games are played with the two teams, judges, and coaches meeting in person, but in the national competition video conferencing may be used.\n\nThere are also four quarters or rounds in a game. Each quarter is different from all the others in some way which will be explained below. The buzzer team competes in the first, second, and fourth quarters, but the buzzer team members may be different from quarter to quarter. The presentation team competes in the third quarter, and some may compete in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe game begins with a tip off question. The captains of each team are asked a question, and the first captain to answer correctly wins the tip off. They now have the choice of going first or second in the first quarter, or first or second in the third quarter. Captains almost always choose to go first in the first quarter, because it gives the team a decisive advantage. The captain of the other team then chooses whether to go first or second in the remaining\n\nThe buzzer team competes in first quarter. First quarter lasts for exactly ten minutes with fifteen seconds (maximum) for each question. (Until recently, the quarter lasted twelve minutes.) Five members sit in the front row and five in reserve. The first question goes to chair one, the captain. If (s)he answers correctly, two points are added to the team's score. The second question will go to chair two. If (s)he also answers correctly, two more points are added to the score and the question goes to chair three. If (s)he also answers correctly, two more points are added, \"but the team does not get another question.\" After three correct answers, the questions go to the opposing team.\n\nIf one of the questions are answered incorrectly, the other team is given a chance to steal. If they answer correctly, the series of questions goes to the other team and one point is added for a steal. They then have a chance to score up to six points (Three two-point questions), starting with the player who got the steal.\n\nIf any team member answers wrongly, they are given a foul. After two fouls, the first reserve player in line takes the fouled-out player's seat, and the fouled-out player moves to the back of the reserve line.\n\nIn second quarter, five members of the buzzer team work as a team to answer lengthy questions. There is a back row of five reserve players, but this reserve used only at the discretion of the team coach, who can substitute any or all backup players for any or all active players. This quarter lasts ten minutes with 60 seconds (maximum) for each question. The questions are printed on a card, which is carried to the team by a player of the opposite team, the \"runner\". When the judge says \"Drop\", each runner drops the card down on the table. The time starts when the judge reads the question aloud. Players are allowed to talk with each other and write down answers, and collaborate. Although communication is a prime skill in second quarter, no other team member may speak after the captain has buzzed in. Each correct answer is worth three points.\n\nIn third quarter, the presentation team gives a presentation on the question they were given after the tip off question. The third quarter team will have been given a topic one week before the day of the game. This topic is more broad than the question received at the beginning of the game; the topic only gives the presentation team a range of information to research and study before the game day. At the game, they take the question from the judge and a bucket of supplies, including posterboard, construction paper, markers, pencils and paper, and each team works separately in a room for about thirty minutes- until 2nd quarter is over. A parent, teacher or sponsor will give each team a five-minute warning, letting the teams know they have five minutes left before they present. When second quarter is over, the teams present in the order determined by the captains after tip-off. The two judges over the match judge on paper the presentation, on basis of eye contact, memorization, quantity and quality of information, vocabulary, shown interest in the subject, charisma, enthusiasm in speaking, etc. The team must take at least three minutes, but no longer than five in their presentation, or three points are deducted from the team's score. The two scores (each out of a possible 25) are averaged out and added to the team's score.\n\nThere can be a mix of the buzzer team and the presentation team participates in fourth quarter. Five players sit at the buzzers with an additional five in reserve. The first question is given to both teams with members in seat one. the preceding questions continue down to seat two, three, and so forth. When a question is given to seat one, for example, no one but seat one may answer. The students must wait until the judge calls on them. If a student answers correctly, they are awarded two points. If the answer is wrong, however, one point is deducted from the score and a foul is given to the player. If a student does not know the answer, they may pass. This means they receive a foul, but no point deduction. If both students pass, answer wrongly, or time runs out and the right answer has still not been given, the judges declare \"Free for all\". The student must wait until the judge finishes saying \"Free for all.\" Anyone on either team at this point has five seconds (or the remaining time in the 30 seconds, whichever is longer) to buzz in and answer.\n\nAt the end of the game, the judges verify the score, and the team with the highest cumulative score wins. If there is a tie, there is a short 2 minute overtime played under fourth-quarter rules.\n\nStudents in NAL study a broad range of topics in preparation, including math, science, geography, world history, and english. These are the main topics that are studied in each category:\n\nMath: GCF, LCM, probability, Roman numerals, area, and perimeter.\n\nEnglish: Parts of speech, pronouns, poetry terms, gerunds, participles, infinitives, authors, and Greek roots.\n\nGeography: US states and state capitals, postal abbreviations, nicknames, world rivers, world capitals, and currency.\n\nWorld History: Explorers, inventors, branches of US government, requirements for US office, wars, US bill of rights, Current leaders and amendments.\n\nScience: Elements, biology, and compounds.\n\nListed below are sample questions asked in an NAL match: (Answers are given in parenthesis)\n\n\nThis question would NOT be used:\n(It would not be used because first and fourth quarter questions are given purely verbally.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the following animals in the categories of carnivore, omnivore, or herbivore: Fruit bats, white-tailed deer, bears, humans, and frogs.\n\nGive the number of vertices, faces, and edges for the following shapes: Pyramid, rectangular prism, cone, cube, and cylinder.\n\nCapitalize the words in the following sentence that need to be capitalized, then give the animal the capital letters spell:\nSylvia went to Egypt, and while there, gave Alex a book on Lithuania.\n\n"}
{"id": "54017020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54017020", "title": "Open educational resources in Canada", "text": "Open educational resources in Canada\n\nOpen educational resources in Canada are the various initiatives related to open educational resources (OER) and open education established nationally and provincially in Canada, and with international collaboration.\n\nIn Canada, education is exclusively a provincial or territorial responsibility, though the federal government can intervene in areas relevant to open education.\n\nThe open educational resources (OER) movement in Canada can be categorized in different ways, from type of initiative to geographical location to institutional initiative. The initiatives described below are categorized accordingly.\n\nThe Canadian government initiated an open data pilot project in 2012 using an open government licence, similar to the Creative Commons (CC) attribution non-commercial licence (CC BY-NC), allowing for remixing and non-commercial uses. In April 2014 Industry Canada launched Digital Canada 150, which aims to support \"connecting, and protecting Canadians, economic opportunities, digital government and Canadian content.\"\n\nCANARIE is a federally funded corporation that manages and develops digital research infrastructure for research and education, operating the backbone network of Canada's National Research and Education Network. Along with the National Research Council's (NRC) Knowledge Management and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, CANARIE supports Research Data Canada in meeting researcher needs in the coordination and promotion of data management. The strategy includes developing open science and open data to facilitate easy and open access to publications and related data resulting from federally funded research.\n\nThe creation and use of OER benefits from the development and use of Creative Commons licences, which provide the legal framework to share these resources. A non-profit organization, Creative Common Canada (CC Canada) supports a legal and technical infrastructure for openness. It has created a set of free licensing tools permitting authors and developers to share, re-use and remix materials with an explicit \"some rights reserved but others clearly allowed\" approach to copyright. As an affiliate of the larger body, CC Canada is a collaborative initiative made up of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC) at the University of Ottawa, BCcampus, and Athabasca University (AU).\n\nIn addition to helping users choose licences and find Creative Commons-licensed work, CC Canada is a proponent of open government and the philosophy that government data should be accessible, shareable and reusable under open licences by everyone. It is actively involved in this pursuit, studying how CC licences can be used by governments to make data freely available for public use. Another CC Canada project is being spearheaded by its legal team at CIPPIC, which is researching the development of user-friendly tools that will provide comprehensive knowledge on how to analyse and use different open licences. CC Canada has also launched a series of conferences across the country to raise awareness of Creative Commons and its potential for educators, writers, artists, and others. In May 2014, Ryan Merkley, a Canadian, was appointed CEO of Creative Commons worldwide.\n\nThe Council of Ministers of Education of Canada (CMEC) is an organization of 13 provincial and territorial ministries of education. In response to UNESCO's 2012 Paris Declaration on OER, CMEC first discussed OER at a national meeting in 2012. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to open access and to adapt educational practices to the new realities of information sharing. After further discussions in 2013, the ministers unanimously endorsed the Paris Declaration. This has played an important role in the growing support for OER across Canada and has been instrumental in the establishment of OER initiatives in the western provinces.\n\nThe three Canadian research-funding agencies – the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) – have agreed on a draft policy supporting open access in scholarly publications. These agencies strongly support knowledge sharing and research collaboration, both domestically and internationally.\n\nSeveral OER initiatives in Canada feature national and international collaboration.\n\nOER universitas (OERu) offers free online university courses in collaboration with Canadian partners, offering formal credentials from the partner institutions. OERu is a consortium of more than 36 institutions and several organizations on five continents. It is dedicated to widening access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for learners by providing OER pathways to achieve formal credentials. There are seven members of the OERu in Canada: three universities (Athabasca in Alberta and Thompson Rivers and Kwantlen in British Columbia); one community college (Portage College in Alberta); and three organisations (BCcampus, eCampus Alberta, and Contact North in Ontario).\n\nBCcampus, arguably the most-active collaborative Canadian organization in the open practices arena, is a publicly funded service that has turned to open concepts and methods to create a sustainable approach to online learning for the public post-secondary institutions of British Columbia (BC). BCcampus was created to enhance students' ability not only to identify, choose, register for and take courses, but also to apply any academic credits earned to credentials at a selected home institution. It was intended to benefit institutions through the rationalization of demand for academic opportunities from students with the supply of online courses from BC's public post-secondary institutions.\n\nBCcampus has been the leader in Canada in promoting OER with CMEC. BCcampus played a major role in the decision by the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology to support and implement the Open Textbook Project, which started with a commitment to provide 40 open textbooks at the post-secondary level and is now committed to 60. BCcampus hosted a working forum on OER for senior post-secondary institution representatives in Vancouver in October 2012, with the objective of developing a common understanding of what OER could mean for the province and of building a shared vision of how to develop and use the resources. The session also studied ways that BC could take advantage of the promise of OER and, specifically, of open textbooks.\n\nThe BCcampus Shareable Online Learning Resources repository (SOL*R) enables the licensing of, contribution to, and access to free online teaching and learning resources. Other BCcampus initiatives are also underway in support of OER, incluidng: the implementation of an initiative around apprenticeships for the trades, in partnership with BC's Industry Training Authority; and work with the North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO) to build on the success of the Remote Web-based Science Laboratory (RWSL) and open educational science courseware.\n\nThe Campus Alberta Open Educational Resources (ABOER) Initiative was a 3-year $2 million government-funded initiative designed to assist with reducing the costs of a post-secondary education for students; and to provide students and faculty members with flexibility, offering updated, relevant content for learning. In March 2013, the Alberta Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BC and Saskatchewan to collaborate on the development of common OER within their respective advanced-education sectors, recognizing the benefits of sharing existing OER with a focus on mutual areas of interest. This MOU was foundational to the establishment of the ABOER Initiative. Through partnerships with BCcampus, the initiative launched an ABOER Collection within SOL*R for open educational resources created or adapted by Albertans.\n\nThe ABOER Initiative funded over forty grant projects in Alberta across 31 publicly funded post-secondary institutions. In March 2017, program evaluation reported $482,000 in cost savings after one term (fall 2016) of open textbook adoption and forecasted cost savings of $5.5 million over five years. A broader evaluation of cost savings including the adoption of ABOER-funded OER development and results of awareness initiatives remains to be evaluated. The report indicates an estimated one year of OER adoption to recuperate the investment of resource development.\n\neCampus Alberta (closed March 2017) funded the development of an OER awareness course and peer review of BCcampus OER.\n\nThe work of the ABOER Initiative and eCampus Alberta continued through a provincial OER Community of Practice (CoP), intended to encourage open educational practices in Alberta. In May 2017, University of Alberta hosted the first Alberta OER Summit.\n\neCampusOntario.ca is the primary face of the Ontario Online Learning Consortium (OOLC), a not-for-profit corporation whose membership is composed of all publicly-funded colleges and universities in Ontario, and whose funding comes from the Government of Ontario. eCampus Ontario is led by CEO, David Porter. With a background in leading the open education movement in British Columbia with SFU, BCcampus, and BCIT, eCampus Ontario has already begun to bring OER and practices to the forefront of Ontario's education system. OER initiatives from eCampus Ontario include $2.6 million in open research and innovation funding, an open textbook library, and a collaborative project with Ryerson University to create an open publishing platform.\n\nThere has been, and continues to be, significant OER activity at Athabasca University (AU). It was the first university in Canada to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium (now the Open Education Consortium [OEC]) and, as of 2014, remains the only Canadian institutional member. The Province of Alberta and AU hosted the 2015 OEC conference in Banff, with over 250 delegates from more than 26 countries. AU was also given an OEC ACE Award in 2014 for its highly visible OER research website, the OER Knowledge Cloud.\n\nAU is home to the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute (TEKRI) and the UNESCO/COL/ICDE Chair in OER, both of which promote research into, and the implementation of, OER at institutional, national, and international levels. The OER Chair is also a member of the board of the OER Foundation, which hosts the OER universitas (OERu).\n\nAU's adoption of open access began with the creation of the scholarly journal \"International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning\" (IRRODL) in 1999, and continued in 2005 with the implementation of AUSpace, a DSpace repository of scholarly articles, theses and other documents produced within the AU community. AUPress was the first open access university press in Canada, starting in 2010, and offers over 100 volumes. Other AU open initiatives include participating in workshops and conferences, conducting a mapping of open educational activities with POERUP (policies for OER uptake) and eMundus Europrojects, and supporting GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network.\n\nThompson Rivers University (TRU) houses the former BC Open University as its distance education wing, called TRU Open Learning. It is working with several OERu partner institutions to provide initial prototype courses to be released as OER. TRU Open Learning has a robust system for prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) that includes challenge examinations and transfer of credit. This makes it a key partner for OER initiatives nationally and internationally.\n\nThe Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC), a research and development centre at OCAD University (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), consists of an international community of open practice advocates. The learning technologies and products that have been developed at by IDRC are distributed under the GNU General Public Licence. This means that the code is open source and requires users to share products under the same liberal licensing.\n\nA key project, FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education), is currently one of the IDRC's biggest initiatives. It has received substantial funding from the Hewlett Foundation and the European Commission. FLOE takes advantage of the fact that the centre has a set of curricula that is openly licensed and can be repurposed and re-used to make content accessible. This makes FLOE heavily dependent on OER, which presents an optimal learning environment to meet the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities. FLOE advances the strengths and values of open education and encourages pedagogical and technical innovation. It also promotes OER for content portability, ease of updating, internationalization and localization, content re-use and repurposing, and more efficient and effective content discovery. FLOE's work is international and broad. For example, to support adoption in Africa and other areas where mobile devices are more prevalent than Internet access, FLOE creates tools and services for delivery as OER via audio, text messages, and the small screens found on popular cellphones. These same tools and services are intended to support accessibility through inclusive design.\n\nContact North (CN) is Ontario's distance education and training network. It provides programming from public colleges, universities and schools with a focus on smaller towns, rural and remote communities. In 2011, Contact North published \"Open Educational Resources (OER) Opportunities for Ontario\", a major position paper stating the case for a provincial OER initiative. Contact North has also published an OER primer as a video series.\n\nTÉLUQ's policies on the dissemination of educational resources were presented in \"Politique de gestion de la di usion des ressources d'enseignement et d'apprentissage\" (REA). These policies relate to learning content in general and could include OER, but are also designed for proprietary content. Because TÉLUQ faculty retain the intellectual property of all original material they produce for teaching, institutional policy has limited impact on what professors do with their material. Laboratoire en Informatique Cognitive et Environnements de Formation (LICEF) is a research centre at TÉLUQ, and hosts the Banques des ressources éeducatives en réseau (brer), a repository of French-language OER.\n\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) are Canadian in origin. The name dates to an experimental course led by George Siemens at the University of Manitoba and Stephen Downes at the National Research Council in 2008 (Tamburri, 2014). They taught a regular online university credit course, \"Connectivism and Connective Knowledge\", with 25 students; and more than 2,200 additional learners joined the course online. As Siemens reports, this course, delivered in 2008, was the first MOOC to combine open content with open teaching. This concept was developed from the idea of an open wiki pioneered by David A. Wiley at Utah State University and a 2007 open-boundary graduate course facilitated by Dr. Alec Couros at the University of Regina, in which 20 registered students were joined by approximately 200 non-credit international students.\n\n\n"}

Its main campus is located in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta while its postgraduate campus is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta.\n\nThe university was founded in 1966, following the merger of the old Pancasila University (founded in 1963) and Bung Karno University. The university has produced in excess of 50,000 alumni, with an annual graduating class of over 1,500.\n\nThe university was declared on 28 October 1966, following the merger of the older Pancasila University which was itself founded in 1963 and the Bung Karno University which was founded in 1964 (not to be mistaken with another identically named university founded in 1999), partially due to the pressure from the Suharto government against symbolism of the former president.

Most are public-access, run as private business or state-sponsored. Some centres work with venomous reptiles as venom research labs. Others are simply privately run zoos devoted to solely to reptiles or are incorporated into larger zoos or organizations.\n\nOne example is the reptile centre in Alice Springs, Australia, devoted to indigenous reptiles. Many are collected from local homes, yards, or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep summer grass fires from threatening the local homes. Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. The Alice Springs centre also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff coming out to homes to remove venomous snakes from inconvenient places.\n\nIn America, Black Hills Reptile Gardens is the nation's largest collection of reptiles. It is located at Rapid City, South Dakota in the heart of the Black Hills. It was founded in 1937.\nAlso in the United States, the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park is the only complete collection of the world's crocodilians. In 1893 the St. Augustine Alligator Farm started as a small facility, displaying the American Alligator.

She is the mother of Julian Castro and Joaquín Castro. \nBorn to Victoria and Victor Castro, Rosie was raised by her mother and a guardian, Marcia Garcia, in San Antonio. Growing up in the San Antonio barrio, Castro cited the beginning of her interest in social justice in witnessing the racial and economic boundaries that affected her family, especially her mother.\n\nWith a scholarship from her valedictorian title and other financial means, she successfully enrolled at Our Lady of the Lake University, intending to become a teacher, before earning a degree in Spanish in 1971. At OLLU, she joined with the Catholic Youth Association, but took issue with the organization's lack of minority membership.\n\nIt was at OLLU that Castro first became involved in student activism through the Young Democrats, and organizing the campus-required Young Republicans chapter in response. \n\nRosie first worked as a volunteer for Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 presidential campaign. Later she joined with the Mexican American Unity Council. With MAUC, she participated in and helped to organize the organization’s boycott of the San Antonio Savings Association, a savings and loan operation headed by former San Antonio Mayor Walter McAllister.\n\nRosie was active during the \"Free Angela Davis\" Campaign of 1971, and during this period she was under observation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nCastro worked with the Raza Unida Party's 1970s initiative to field Mexican-American candidates in Texas, serving as the Bexar County party chair. At the time, the RUP worked alongside the San Antonio Committee for Barrio Betterment to pursue positions in the city. With the CBB, Castro herself became a candidate in 1971 for the San Antonio City Council, finishing second among four candidates. \n\nCastro received a Master's Degree in Public Administration from The University of Texas at San Antonio and worked at Palo Alto College, where she served as Interim Dean of Student Affairs from 2008 until she retired in 2013.\n\nCastro continues to be involved in community and national organizations such as Latinas Represent, the Texas Organizing Project, and AARP. \n\nIn 2015, she was elected to the San Antonio Women’s Hall of Fame, and in 2017 she was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Our Lady of the Lake University.\n\nCastro is also a published poet, contributing four pieces to the anthology, \"Entre Guadalupe y Malinche: Tejanas in Literature and Art\", published by the University of Texas Press in 2016.\n\nBoth Joaquin Castro and Julian Castro have cited Rosie's activism as the foundation for their political careers. Julian noted in his keynote address that \"my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.\"\n\nIn a later interview with Texas Monthly, Julian also noted “Maria del Rosario Castro has never held a political office ... However, today, years later, I read the newspapers, and I see that more Valdezes are sitting on school boards, that a greater number of Garcias are now doctors, lawyers, engineers and, of course, teachers.”\n"}

{"id": "1614658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1614658", "title": "Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge", "text": "Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge\n\nThe Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) is the oldest Anglican mission organisation, and the leading publisher of Christian books in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1698 by Thomas Bray (an Anglican priest), and a small group of friends including Lord Guilford, Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Mr Justice Hooke, and Colonel Maynard Colchester. The emphasis was on setting up schools. The SPCK was influential in setting up church schools across Britain, when there were few schools for poor childen. In the 21st century, the SPCK is most widely known for its publishing of Christian books.\n\nThe Society was founded to encourage Christian education and the production and distribution of Christian literature. SPCK has always sought to find ways to communicate the basic principles of the Christian faith to a wider audience, both in Britain and overseas. A related Scottish society was founded in 1709. It sent missions to Scotland's Highlands, and a handful to Indians in the American colonies.\n\nIn its first two hundred years, the Society founded many charity schools for poor children in the 7 to 11 age group. It is from these schools that the modern concept of primary and secondary education has grown. The Society also provided teacher training. SPCK continues to support education in the UK by provide free assembly resources via its website.\n\nThomas Bray believed passionately in the power of the printed word. From its earliest days, the SPCK commissioned tracts and pamphlets, making it the third-oldest publishing house in England. (Only the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses have existed longer.)\n\nThroughout the eighteenth century SPCK was by far the largest producer of Christian literature in Britain. The range of its output was considerable—from pamphlets aimed at specific groups such as farmers, prisoners, soldiers, seamen, servants and slave-owners, to more general works on subjects such as baptism, confirmation, Holy Communion, the Prayer Book, and private devotion. Increasingly, more substantial books were also published, both on Christian subjects and, from the 1830s onwards, on general educational topics as well. At present, key authors for SPCK include Anglican New Testament Scholar N. T. Wright, former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, Paula Gooder, and Alister McGrath. Recent exciting additions to SPCK's list include Guvna B, and Ben Cooley, founder of Hope for Justice.\n\nIn the early 21st century, SPCK's publishing team produces around 80 titles per year, for audiences from a wide range of Christian traditions and none. Books range from the academic to the popular, from devotional literature and works on spirituality to books addressing contemporary issues in the Church and society. SPCK also raises funds for and project manages a number of charitable programs, including books for prisoners via Diffusion, and other forms of mission. Recent publishing innovations include the launch of a fiction imprint, Marylebone House, in 2014, and a move to support the InterVarsity Press UK (IVP) in 2015/16.\n\nSPCK's early publications were distributed through a network of supporters who received books and tracts to sell or give away in their own localities. Large quantities of Christian literature were provided for the Navy, and the Society actively encouraged the formation of parish libraries, to help both clergy and laity. By the nineteenth century, members had organized local district committees, many of which established small book depots—which at one time numbered over four hundred. These were overseen by central committees such as the [Committee of General Literature and Education]. In 1899 the addresses of their 'depositories' in London were given as Northumberland Avenue, W.C.; Charing Cross, W.C. and 43 Queen Victoria Street, E.C. Six years later in edition 331 the depository was closed at Charing Cross, but a new one added Brighton: 129, North Street.\n\nIn the 1930s a centrally co-ordinated network of SPCK Bookshops was established, offering a wide range of books from many different publishers. At its peak, the SPCK bookshop chain consisted of 40 shops in the UK and 20 overseas. The latter were gradually passed into local ownership during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nHoly Trinity Church, Marylebone, Westminster, London is a former Anglican church, built in 1828 by Sir John Soane. By the 1930s, it had fallen into disuse and in 1936 was used by the newly founded Penguin Books company to store books. A children's slide was used to deliver books from the street into the large crypt.\n\nIn 1937 Penguin moved out to Harmondsworth, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) moved in. It was their headquarters until 2004, when they relocated to London Diocesan House in Causton Street, Pimlico. The bookshop relocated to Tufton St in 2003.\n\nOn 1 November 2006, St. Stephen The Great Charitable Trust [SSG] took over the Bookshops but continued to trade under the SPCK name, under licence from SPCK. That licence was withdrawn in October 2007. However, some shops continued trading as SPCK Bookshops without licence until the SSG operation was closed down in 2009. After October 2006, SPCK no longer owned or operated any bookshops.\n\nSPCK has worked overseas since its foundation. The initial focus was the British colonies in the Americas. Libraries were established for the use of clergy and their parishioners, and books were frequently shipped across the Atlantic by sail throughout the eighteenth century. By 1709 SPCK was spreading further afield: a printing press and trained printer were sent to Tranquebar in East India to assist in the production of the first translation of the Bible into Tamil. This was accomplished by the German Lutheran missionaries Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Pluetschau from the Danish-Halle Mission. For its time this was a remarkably far-sighted example of ecumenical co-operation. The SPCK has continued to work closely with churches of many different denominations, whilst retaining a special relationship with churches within the Anglican Communion.\n\nAs the British Empire grew in the nineteenth century, so SPCK developed an important role in supporting the planting of new churches around the world. Funds were provided for church buildings, for schools, for theological training colleges, and to provide chaplains for the ships taking emigrants to their new homes.\n\nDuring the twentieth century SPCK's overseas mission concentrated on providing free study literature for those in a number of ministerial training colleges around the world, especially in Africa. It also supported translation in India through its sister organisation there, ISPCK. Today, SPCK is working with a number of partner institutions across Africa to assist in funding and launching an African Theological Network Press, designed to facilitate the writing and distribution of contextual African theology.\n\n\nThe Scottish sister society, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), was formed by royal charter in 1709 as a separate organisation with the purpose of founding schools \"where religion and virtue might be taught to young and old\" in the Scottish Highlands and other \"uncivilised\" areas of the country. It was intended to counter the threat of Catholic missionaries achieving \"a serious landslide to Rome\" and of growing Highland Jacobitism. Their schools were a valuable addition to the Church of Scotland programme of education in Scotland, which was based on a tax on landowners to provide a school in every parish. Some — but by no means all — Society schoolmasters were inferior in comparison to burgh and parish schools, however, \"particularly in [their] acquaintance with the Evangelical System\" rather than more pragmatic literacy, numeracy and teaching ability. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending.\n\nAt first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language, with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. SSPCK rules from 1720 required the teaching of literacy and numeracy \"but not any Latin or Irish\" (then a common term for Gaelic on both sides of the Irish Sea), and the Society boasted \"that barbarity and the Irish language ... are almost rooted out\" by their teaching. In 1753 an act of the Society forbade students \"either in the schoolhouse or when playing about the doors thereof to speak Erse, under pain of being chastised\". \n\nIn 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic–English vocabulary, then in 1767 introduced a New Testament designed with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. In 1766 they allowed their Highland schools to use Gaelic alongside English as languages of instruction. In 1790, a Society preacher still insisted that English monolingualism was a Society goal and a decade later Society schools continued to use corporal punishment against students speaking Gaelic. In the early 19th century the Society's activity declined. Its educational work was taken over by the Gaelic Societies of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company has more than 4,000 teachers and tutors in the United States and Canada and international franchises in 14 other countries. The company is headquartered in New York, NY, and is privately held. It is not associated with Princeton University.\n\nThe Princeton Review was founded in 1981 by John Katzman, who—shortly after leaving college—taught SAT preparation to 15 students in New York City. He served as CEO until 2007, and was replaced by Michael Perik. In March 2010, Perik resigned and was replaced by John M. Connolly. In April 2010, the company sold $48 million in stock for $3 per share, and a short time later was accused of fraud in a class action suit filed by a Michigan retirement fund, which claimed The Princeton Review leadership exaggerated earnings to boost its stock price. In 2012, the company was acquired by Charlesbank Capital, a private equity fund, for $33 million. On August 1, 2014, the Princeton Review brand name and operations were bought for an undisclosed sum by Tutor.com, an IAC company, and Mandy Ginsburg became CEO. The company is no longer affiliated with its former parent, Education Holdings 1, Inc. On March 31, 2017, ST Unitas acquired the Princeton Review for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe Princeton Review offers preparation courses for various tests at the Princeton Review website:\nThe company offers courses worldwide through company-owned and third-party franchises. Countries with Princeton Review franchises include China, India, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTest preparation providers have been criticized in the past on the grounds that their courses claim larger score increases than they deliver.\n\nCollege rankings, including those published by the Princeton Review, have been criticized for failing to be accurate or comprehensive by assigning objective rankings formed from subjective opinions. Princeton Review officials counter that their rankings are unique in that they rely on student opinion and not just on statistical data.\n\nIn 2002 an American Medical Association affiliated program, A Matter of Degree, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, criticized the Princeton Review list of Best Party Schools. \"USA Today\" published an editorial titled \"Sobering Statistics\" in August 2002 and stated, \"the doctor's group goes too far in suggesting that the rankings contribute to the problem (of campus drinking).\" The editorial noted the fact that among the schools the AMA program was then funding as part of its campaign against campus drinking, six of 10 of those schools calling for The Princeton Review to \"drop the annual ranking...had made (Princeton Review's) past top-party-school lists: many times for some. That's no coincidence.\" The editorial commended The Princeton Review for reporting the list, calling it \"a public service\" for \"student applicants and their parents\".\n\nRankings for LGBT-related lists have also been criticized as inaccurate due to outdated methodologies. The Princeton Review bases its LGBT-Friendly and LGBT-Unfriendly top twenty ranking lists, which asks undergraduates: \"Do students, faculty, and administrators at your college treat all persons equally regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identify/expression?\" The Princeton Review also publishes \"The Gay & Lesbian Guide to College Life\".\n\nIn 2016, the company was criticized by privacy rights advocates who worry that a company that owns online dating and college preparation services could amass data and exploit it in a way that preys on unsuspecting consumers, particularly younger people. \"Do parents know that when their underage kids enroll for exam prep or tutoring, personal information may be shared with hookup sites that could then target their kids to become customers?\" asked one critic, who concluded that the company \"makes no guarantee that data sharing among its entities will not include those customers whose sole aim is to improve their grades and test scores.\" Indeed, another critic points out that The Princeton Review \"policy states 'we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit our site'—information like data 'regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests.' That information can be used to 'send you email notices and offers; perform research and analysis about your use of or interest in our products, services or products or services offered by others; [and] develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites.'\"\n"}
