Harry Wheeler\n\nAlbert Harry Wheeler (18 January 1873, Leominster, Massachusetts – 1950) was an American mathematician, inventor, and mathematics teacher, known for physical construction (usually in paper) of polyhedral models and teaching this art to students.\n\nA. Harry Wheeler received in 1894 his bachelor of science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He taught high school in Worcester, Massachusetts from 1894 to 1896 and then was a graduate student in mathematics from 1896 to 1899 at Clark University, but left without a degree. He taught high school mathematics in Worcester from 1899 to 1920. His textbooks are \"First Course in Algebra\" (1907) and \"Examples in Algebra\" (1914).\n\nAt age 47, returned in 1920 to graduate study in mathematics at Clark University, receiving a master's degree in 1921. Wheeler was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto. In 1924 he began part-time teaching (in addition to his high school teaching) as an adjunct instructor of geometry, first at Brown University and then at Wellesley College; however, his college-level adjunct teaching ended by the early 1930s.\n\nWheeler and H. S. M. Coxeter planned to be coauthors (with two other mathematicians) of a short book, which was eventually named \"The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra\" and became a minor classic of mathematical literature. However, in 1938 Wheeler objected to Coxeter's expository style so that Coxeter replaced Wheeler's name on the book's title page by another author, although Wheeler is briefly mentioned in the text. Extending work of Max Brückner, Wheeler actually constructed previously unknown polyhedra. In particular, he produced new stellations of the icosahedron. This achievement impressed Coxeter, who noted Wheeler's achievement in the text.\n\nWheeler continued teaching high school mathematics in Worcester until his retirement. His models continued to attract attention. In 1950 he received an invitation to exhibit part of his model collection at the 1950 ICM in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 30 August to September 6. However, serious illness prevented him from attending the conference, and he died in December 1950.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2632003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2632003", "title": "Adrian Fenty", "text": "Adrian Fenty\n\nAdrian Malik Fenty (born December 6, 1970) is an American politician who served as the sixth mayor of the District of Columbia. He served one term, from 2007 to 2011, losing his bid for reelection at the primary level to Democrat Vincent C. Gray. Though Fenty won the Republican mayoral primary as a write-in candidate, he declined the Republican nomination and said he would likely not seek elected office again. Gray went on to win the general election for Mayor in the largely Democratic District.\n\nSince leaving office, Fenty has become a special advisor to the venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz and a member of the business development team at the law firm Perkins Coie. Fenty has held advisory and business development roles with Rosetta Stone, Everfi and CapGemini. He also serves on the Board of Directors at two nonprofits: Genesys Works-Bay Area and Fight for Children. He has also embarked on a career as a paid speaker, part-time college professor, adviser for the state and local government practice of an information technology consulting firm. Previously, Fenty was a D.C. Council member for six years. A Washington, D.C. native, Fenty is a graduate of Oberlin College and Howard University Law School.\n\nFenty was born in Washington, D.C., the second of the three children of Jeanette Bianchi Perno Fenty and Phil Fenty. Fenty's mother is Italian-American. Her family immigrated to the United States from the comune of Monte San Giovanni Campano in Lazio in 1920. His father, who is originally from Buffalo, New York, has roots in Barbados and Panama. Phil and Jeanette Fenty moved to Washington, D.C., in 1967. Fenty was raised in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood. While he was growing up, his parents owned and ran a Fleet Feet athletic shoe store in the D.C. neighborhood of Adams Morgan.\n\nFenty graduated from Mackin Catholic High School, where he ran track. He earned a B.A. in English and economics from Oberlin College, and a J.D. from the Howard University School of Law. He remains a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity.\n\nBefore becoming involved in local D.C. politics, Fenty worked as an intern for U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), U.S. House of Representatives D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), and U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-MA).\n\nHe then served as an aide to Councilmember Kevin P. Chavous, was elected to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), district 4C, and also was president of the 16th Street Neighborhood Civic Association.\n\nIn 2000, Fenty won a seat on the D.C. Council, defeating longtime Ward 4 Councilmember Charlene Drew Jarvis by a margin of 57 to 43 percent after engaging in an aggressive door-to-door strategy. Unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2004, Fenty was reelected for a second term.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" described Fenty's performance as a Council member as \"independent\" and \"contrarian\". During his time on the Council, he opposed public funding for a new baseball stadium, saying the owners should pay for it. He proposed a $1 billion capital improvement program for the public schools—which the Council initially opposed, but eventually passed. According to the Washington Post, Fenty's legislative style was to focus on constituent services and take attention grabbing positions.\n\nFenty began his campaign to replace retiring mayor Anthony A. Williams in 2005. Then-Council Chair Linda Cropp, businesswoman Marie Johns, then-Councilmember Vincent Orange, and lobbyist Michael A. Brown also vied for the position.\n\nThe race was widely viewed as neck-and-neck between Fenty and Cropp through the spring of 2006. Fenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to city government, advancing bold ideas for change, and sticking to them. Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, \"Consensus is the absence of leadership\". Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy. She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus. She criticized Fenty's proposed approach to governing; being mayor, saying the mayor's job is \"not just standing up and saying, 'This is what I want done,' and miraculously it's going to happen.\" Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money – roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006 – and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums.\n\nBy July 2006 polls showed Fenty with a roughly 10-point advantage; political observers debated whether it was due to Fenty's door-to-door campaign, Cropp's lack of engagement in the campaign, or the electorate's desire for a new direction. Cropp's campaign began running negative attack ads during the month before the primary, painting Fenty as unfit for the job and as a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar, (in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999). The attacks backfired. Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary—a feat unparalleled in earlier mayoral elections—defeating Cropp by a 57 to 31 percent margin. He received 89 percent of the vote in the general election and became the District's sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule.\n\nEducation reform was a major focus of Fenty's mayoral tenure. On the first day of his term, he introduced legislation to vest control of the public schools in himself, rather than the elected school board. Previous attempts to reform the schools, including one in 1996 where a D.C. financial control board took charge of the schools, had failed. At the beginning of Fenty's term, student test performance scores and graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation and District residents had been demanding that the schools be \"fixed\". In April 2007, the D.C. Council approved Fenty's plan; the necessary legislation was approved by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in May 2007.\n\nUnder the new structure, the existing superintendent was replaced by a chancellor selected by the mayor and reporting directly to him. The power shift also allowed Fenty to make swift changes in the system's central office, alter teacher qualification requirements, and implement a school consolidation process. His selection of Michelle Rhee to manage District schools surprised the education establishment. In choosing Rhee, Fenty consulted with national education figures including New York City School Chancellor, Joel Klein.\n\nThe restructuring has been credited with improvements. To better allocate resources, Fenty and Rhee significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff and closed 23 schools with low enrollments. After 2007, student achievement tests at the secondary level reportedly rose 14 points in reading and 17 points in math. Student SAT scores rose 27 points in 2010. Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of District students took the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), which functions as a practice test for college bound students. Fenty's administration had also taken on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to improve school buildings by 2014. Fenty and Rhee successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union that establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.\n\nThe Fenty administration also overhauled District agencies for efficiency. His choice of a woman for police chief, Cathy Lanier, received media attention. Under Fenty, Lanier added police officers to the streets and expanded community policing initiatives, for example, \"beefing up\" the policy of accepting anonymous text message tips from local residents to cut down on potential retaliation. The homicide rate in the District dropped 25% in 2009; the homicide closure rate rose to 70%. with Fenty reporting that homicides were at their \"lowest level since 1964\" and that \"both violent crimes and property crimes\" had experienced a double-digit decline.\n\nFenty championed development efforts including renovating libraries, parks and recreation centers. Under Fenty, 16 neighborhood and school playgrounds were opened and nine play courts and fields were completed. The District's largest shopping center, the DC USA Shopping Center, and the Camp Simms retail development were opened, and thousands of affordable housing units were established or renovated. The \"Housing First\" program to provide permanent supportive housing for the city's homeless was begun. The backlog of Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations was reduced by improving the retention of social workers, building an experienced leadership team, and increasing the recruitment of social workers to fill vacancies. Additionally, the Fenty administration improved the delivery of emergency medical services and expanded health care coverage for the uninsured. It also finalized the sale of Greater Southeast Community Hospital (now United Medical Center) in a public-private partnership that kept the facility open.\n\nIn December 2009, Fenty signed the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Act of 2009 to legalize same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia.\n\nWhile serving as mayor, Fenty was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. Fenty was known to carry three BlackBerry devices: one directly connected him to the police chief, the second was for other city business, and the third was for personal matters.\n\nOn July 31, 2009, Fenty's 2010 mayoral campaign chest passed the 2006 primary fundraising total of $2.4 million. Fenty officially launched his reelection bid in April 2010, defending his management style and pledging to remind voters that had made the types of tough decisions that are necessary for real change.\n\nOn August 1, 2010, the editorial board of \"The Washington Post\" officially endorsed Fenty, citing his attempts to fix the District's struggling public school system. \"Washington City Paper\" followed on September 9.\n\nJanuary 2010 hypothetical polling showed Gray in the lead by 4 points; a \"Washington Post\" poll of August 29 found Gray with a 17-point lead; a Clarus poll conducted September 7 gave Gray a 7-point lead; and a Public Policy Polling survey sponsored by WAMU-FM radio and \"Washington City Paper\" showed an 11 percent lead for Gray on September 8.\n\nFenty lost the September 14 Democratic primary to Gray by a margin of 10 points—54 percent to 44 percent. While Fenty received the most write-in votes for mayor in the Republican primary election, Fenty had previously said he would not accept the Republican nomination. Following the reporting of the primary results, Fenty called it highly unlikely he will run for public office again.\n\nIn August 2011 an investigation into the hiring practices of Mayor Vincent Gray found that during the 2010 primary, a Gray campaign official had paid another candidate, Sulaimon Brown, to disparage Fenty.\n\nFenty, like all District mayors and council members, had a citizen-service fund that is intended to help the residents of the District of Columbia. Much of the cash held by the fund came from the money raised during his 2006 mayoral candidacy.\n\nUpon leaving office, District law required Fenty to donate the remaining funds in his citizen-service fund to a nonprofit organization. Two weeks prior to Fenty's last day as mayor, his chief campaign fundraiser, John Falcicchio, incorporated a social welfare organization called Forward Faster as a legacy organization to carry out Fenty's vision. Fenty donated the $440,709 remaining in his citizen-service fund to Forward Faster.\n\nForward Faster's board of directors consists of Falcicchio; George Simpson, Fenty's appointee to the National Capital Planning Commission); Sara Lasner, a former aide to Fenty; and Jason Washington, a former Fenty advance man. During its first year of existence, Forward Faster spent $88,700 on grants; $88,000 of salary to John Falcicchio as executive director; $49,500 to Tracy Sandler, also as executive director; and $3,000 to Jennifer Nguyen, also as another executive director.\n\nBy 2013, Simpson, Lasner, and Washington were no longer connected to the organization.\n\nSince then, District law was changed to prohibit an elected official from incorporating a nonprofit organization at the end of his or her term in office and transferring consistent-services fund money into it.\n\nAfter his term as mayor was over, Fenty signed with Greater Talent Network, a major speakers bureau, in January 2011. The same month, Fenty became an outside adviser and counsel to Heffler, Radetich & Saitta, an accounting and consulting firm based in Philadelphia. Also in January 2011, it was announced that Fenty would become a distinguished visiting professor of politics, a featured lecturer and a career adviser in the Department of African American Studies at Oberlin College in Ohio. In February 2011, Fenty became an outside adviser to Rosetta Stone, which produces foreign-language software. In March 2011, Fenty became a strategic adviser for the state and local government practice of Capgemini Government Solutions LLC, an information technology consulting firm. In May 2011, Fenty became a member of the advisory board of EverFi Inc., an online education and certification firm. In July 2011, Fenty joined the plaintiff and litigation oriented law firm of Klores Perry Mitchell as special counsel.\n\nOn \"Morning Joe\" on March 8, 2011, Fenty backed Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker's anti-union efforts and broadly condemned the concept of public employee collective bargaining. Saying that \"Most governors and mayors would love to be able to manage their team without the interference of collective bargaining\", Fenty expressed his faith in the ability of managers to set fair wages and hours, and to fairly reward or hold their employees accountable. He also said that the Democratic Wisconsin senators should be held accountable for leaving the state to delay the enactment of Walker's legislation.\n\nIn 1997, Fenty married Michelle Cross Fenty, an attorney. The couple has three children—twin sons Andrew and Matthew born in 2000, and daughter Aerin born in 2008. In January 2013, the couple officially separated.\n\nIn August 2013, the Washington Post reported that Fenty is in a relationship with Laurene Powell Jobs. Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, also has three children.\n\nFenty is an amateur triathlete and runner. During his time as mayor, he participated in events such as the Nation's Triathlon and the Washington, D.C. Triathlon.\n\n"}

Van den Bergh showed talent for music at an early age, took piano lessons at six and published a harpsichord sonata at the age of nine. She studied composition with Johann Burgmüller and piano with Ferdinand Ries.\n\nIn 1809 van den Bergh's father organized a concert tour of the Netherlands for Gertrude and her sister Sophia. The family moved to The Hague about 1813, and afterward Van den Bergh seldom played in public. She continued to perform in private circles and remained well known. In 1830 she was invited to join the Society for the Promotion of Music, which had not been previously open to women.

She directed the first mixed voice choir from The Hague and from 1837 or 1838 the Vocal Society.\n\nAs an unmarried woman, Van den Bergh lived with her mother and gave singing and piano lessons.

It offers education, workshop activities, counseling, accommodation, emergency assistance and relief measures. The aim of the school is to assist people with social problems in improving their social life and relieve them from their underprivileged social situation. The efforts are holistic and the targets tuned to people’s own abilities and qualifications.\n\nKofoeds School is based on the concept that if people are to be assisted socially, they have to be helped educationally, but the terms education and school are understood in the widest sense, not associated exclusively with narrow vocational qualifications. The concept of education is a cornerstone in the work of the school as a principle of development of human resources. \n\nPeople using the service at Kofoed's School are called students to emphasize the pedagogical approach to dealing with social problems. The school helps the students to develop their own strength, self-esteem and abilities, and focus is on possibilities and the students’ own interests and wishes. Basically, the school approaches the students as ordinary human beings who experience social difficulties in their life.\n\nSince its foundation Kofoeds School has been involved in a range of social issues such as homelessness, unemployment, urban immigration, integration problems for ethnic groups, alcoholism, substance abuse, and psychiatric problems.\n\nThe working method of the school emphasizes the importance of the students themselves being active. The aim is not just to help the students but also to help make them take responsibility for their own efforts. The school works on the belief, that help is an ambiguous blessing. Provided without expecting active interplay by the person seeking assistance, it may pacify people and make them dependent. Given the right way, however, it can activate them, make them feel more optimistic and increase their ability to act themselves. \n\nThe concept aims at rebuilding and strengthening the students’ self-esteem while at the same time easing their social problems. On working with the students, the primary focus is on their personal strength and abilities, and the method seeks to move people forward, not just to solve immediate problems.\n\nKofoeds School was founded by pastor Hans Christian Kofoed (1898-1952) in 1928, at a time of economic depression. His goal was to help young unemployed men to come back to society as active citizens. H.C. Kofoed, made the slogan “\"hjælp til selvhjælp\"” (literally: “help to self-help”) the center of his work. He wished to help the unemployed differently compared to usual charities that often placed the unemployed in a role of passive receivers of assistance. \n\nKofoeds himself had experienced unemployment then he was young, and he had remembered since then that if one is being helped in the wrong way, it is possible to cause more damage than benefit. Therefore he based his work on the principle that an unemployed person may receive food or his wages only after performing an activity. When he receives it this way, it is not humiliating but rather brings satisfaction and a sense of justice. At the time Kofoed’s methods were revolutionary. \n\nAmong the first activities of Kofoeds School were a washroom and a laundry, where people could wash and do their laundry for free. And the school opened a workshop where it was possible to repair old garments and shoes. When Kofoed found other collaborators, he opened courses in Danish, English, French, German, counting, humanities, gymnastics and singing. Students could use the services of a legal counselor and a physician. \n\nIn the following years, the number of women learning housework increased. There was a joinery shop, in which men could repair used furniture, and there was a garden in which they could grow vegetables for their needs for free. Kofoed bought a farm in 1940 where a school for adolescents was developed, in which young agricultural workers attended an intensive re-socializing course. \n\nThe number of students grew rapidly in the first decades after its start, and so did the size of the school and the activities offered. Soon Kofoeds School was a well-known institution throughout Denmark, and Hans Christian Kofoed himself became a renowned, public figure. Both the work of H.C. Kofoed and his school received a lot of goodwill and respect from all layers of society, and when Kofoed died following a car accident in 1952, the country was in shock. More than 2000 people attended his funeral.\n\nStudents with yet bigger and cumulative problems started to appear at the school in the 1950s. Often they were unemployed alcoholics, people with psycho-pathological problems and drug addicts. The number of students grew intensively in the 1960s leading to the broadening of the offer of the school by many other activities. \n\nIn the following decade, employers and directors of the school entered a conflict about the perception of the school’s mission. Certain practical and ideological changes followed, but in 1979 a return to the original principle of help to self-help recommenced. \n\nAt the present day, the school in Copenhagen offers assistance to those students who are in a temporarily difficult life situation as well as to those who are in a much deeper crisis. The basic pedagogical principles of activation are still accentuated in order to let students try to deal with the problems on their own.\n\nFrom early on after its start in 1928, Kofoeds School acquired facilities outside the main school in Copenhagen to suit the needs of the different kinds of students and their specific problems. However it was not until the turn of the millennium – in 2003 – that an independent working school opened in Denmark, this time in Århus. The School in Århus today serves about 70 students daily. \n\nDuring the 1990s, Kofoeds School started making more foreign contacts and engaged itself in various international collaborations, but up until 1997 the school in Copenhagen was the only one. However, building on a collaboration between Kofoeds School and Polish social workers begun in the aftermath of World War II and since then progressed, the first sister school opened in Siedlce, Poland in 1997. Since then a string of schools has opened in Central and Eastern Europe and today the organization numbers 15 schools in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Armenia and Ukraine.\n\n"}

{"id": "1955471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955471", "title": "Learning object metadata", "text": "Learning object metadata\n\nLearning Object Metadata is a data model, usually encoded in XML, used to describe a learning object and similar digital resources used to support learning. The purpose of learning object metadata is to support the reusability of learning objects, to aid discoverability, and to facilitate their interoperability, usually in the context of online learning management systems (LMS).\n\nThe IEEE 1484.12.1 – 2002 Standard for Learning Object Metadata is an internationally recognised open standard (published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association, New York) for the description of “learning objects”. Relevant attributes of learning objects to be described include: type of object; author; owner; terms of distribution; format; and pedagogical attributes, such as teaching or interaction style.\n\nThe IEEE working group that developed the standard defined learning objects, \"for the purposes of the standard,\" as being “any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training.\" This definition has struck many commentators as being rather broad in its scope, but the definition was intended to provide a broad class of objects to which LOM metadata might usefully be associated rather than to give an instructional or pedagogic definition of a learning object. \"IEEE 1484.12.1\" is the first part of a multipart standard, and describes the LOM data model. The LOM data model specifies which aspects of a learning object should be described and what vocabularies may be used for these descriptions; it also defines how this data model can be amended by additions or constraints. Other parts of the standard are being drafted to define bindings of the LOM data model, i.e. define how LOM records should be represented in XML and RDF (\"IEEE 1484.12.3\" and \"IEEE 1484.12.4\" respectively). This article focuses on the LOM data model rather than issues relating to XML or other bindings.\n\nIMS Global Learning Consortium is an international consortium that contributed to the drafting of the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (together with the ARIADNE Foundation) and endorsed early drafts of the data model as part of the IMS Learning Resource Meta-data specification (IMS LRM, versions 1.0 – 1.2.2). Feedback and suggestions from the implementers of IMS LRM fed into the further development of the LOM, resulting in some drift between version 1.2 of the IMS LRM specification and what was finally published at the LOM standard. Version 1.3 of the IMS LRM specification realigns the IMS LRM data model with the IEEE LOM data model and specifies that the IEEE XML binding should be used. Thus, we can now use the term 'LOM' in referring to both the IEEE standard and version 1.3 of the IMS specification. The IMS LRM specification also provides an extensive \"Best Practice and Implementation Guide\", and an \"XSL transform\" that can be used to migrate metadata instances from the older versions of the IMS LRM XML binding to the IEEE LOM XML binding.\n\nThe LOM comprises a hierarchy of elements. At the first level, there are nine categories, each of which contains sub-elements; these sub-elements may be simple elements that hold data, or may themselves be aggregate elements, which contain further sub-elements. The semantics of an element are determined by its context: they are affected by the parent or container element in the hierarchy and by other elements in the same container. For example, the various \"Description\" elements (1.4, 5.10, 6.3, 7.2.2, 8.3 and 9.3) each derive their context from their parent element. In addition, description element 9.3 also takes its context from the value of element 9.1 \"Purpose\" in the same instance of \"Classification\".\n\nThe data model specifies that some elements may be repeated either individually or as a group; for example, although the elements 9.2 (\"Description\") and 9.1 (\"Purpose\") can only occur once within each instance of the \"Classification\" container element, the \"Classification\" element may be repeated - thus allowing many descriptions for different purposes.\n\nThe data model also specifies the value space and datatype for each of the simple data elements. The value space defines the restrictions, if any, on the data that can be entered for that element. For many elements, the value space allows any string of Unicode character to be entered, whereas other elements entries must be drawn from a declared list (i.e. a controlled vocabulary) or must be in a specified format (e.g. date and language codes). Some element datatypes simply allow a string of characters to be entered, and others comprise two parts, as described below:\n\nWhen implementing the LOM as a data or service provider, it is not necessary to support all the elements in the data model, nor need the LOM data model limit the information which may be provided. The creation of an application profile allows a community of users to specify which elements and vocabularies they will use. Elements from the LOM may be dropped and elements from other metadata schemas may be brought in; likewise, the vocabularies in the LOM may be supplemented with values appropriate to that community.\n\nThe key requirements for exploiting the LOM as a data or service provider are to:\n\nThere are many metadata specifications; of particular interest is the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (commonly known as Simple Dublin Core, standardised as \"ANSI/NISO Z39.85 – 2001\"). Simple Dublin Core (DC) provides a non-complex, loosely defined set of elements which is useful for sharing metadata across a wide range of disparate services. Since the LOM standard used Dublin Core as a starting point, refining the Simple DC schema with qualifiers relevant to learning objects, there is some overlap between the LOM and DC standards. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is also working on a set of terms which allow the Dublin Core Element Set to be used with greater semantic precision (Qualified Dublin Core). The Dublin Education Working Group aims to provide refinements of Dublin Core for the specific needs of the education community.\n\nMany other education-related specifications allow for LO metadata to be embedded within XML instances, such as: describing the resources in an IMS Content Package or Resource List; describing the vocabularies and terms in an IMS VDEX (Vocabulary Definition and Exchange) file; and describing the question items in an IMS QTI (Question and Test Interoperability) file.\n\nThe IMS Vocabulary Definition and Exchange (VDEX) specification has a double relation with the LOM, since not only can the LOM provide metadata on the vocabularies in a VDEX instance, but VDEX can be used to describe the controlled vocabularies which are the value space for many LOM elements.\n\nLOM records can be transported between systems using a variety of protocols, perhaps the most widely used being OAI-PMH.\n\nFor UK Further and Higher Education, the most relevant family of application profiles are those based around the \"UK LOM Core\". The UK LOM Core is currently a draft schema researched by a community of practitioners to identify common UK practice in learning object content, by comparing 12 metadata schemas. UK LOM is currently legacy work, it is not in active development.\n\n\"CanCore\" provides detailed guidance for the interpretation and implementation of each data element in the LOM standard. These guidelines (2004) constitute a 250-page document, and have been developed over three years under the leadership of Norm Friesen, and through consultation with experts across Canada and throughout the world. These guidelines are also available at no charge from the CanCore Website.\n\nANZ-LOM is a metadata profile developed for the education sector in Australia and New Zealand. The profile sets obligations for elements and illustrates how to apply controlled vocabularies, including example regional vocabularies used in the \"classification\" element. The ANZ-LOM profile was first published by The Le@rning Federation (TLF) in January, 2008.\n\nThe Australian Vocational Training and Education (VET) sector uses an application profile of the IEEE LOM called Vetadata. The profile contains five mandatory elements, and makes use of a number of vocabularies specific to the Australian VET sector. This application profile was first published in 2005. The Vetadata and ANZ-LOM profiles are closely aligned.\n\nNORLOM is the Norwegian LOM profile.\nThe profile is managed by NSSL (The Norwegian Secretariat for Standardization of Learning Technologies)\n\nISRACORE is the Israeli LOM profile.\nThe Israel Internet Association (ISOC-IL) and Inter University Computational Center (IUCC) have teamed up to manage and establish an e-learning objects database.\n\nSWE-LOM is the Swedish LOM profile that is managed by IML at Umeå University as a part of the work with the national standardization group TK450 at Swedish Standards Institute.\n\nTWLOM is the Taiwanese LOM profile that is managed by Industrial Development and Promotion of Archives and e-Learning Project\n\nLOM-FR is a metadata profile developed for the education sector in France.

This application profile was published in July 2014.\n\nLOM-ES is a metadata profile developed for the education sector in Spain.

It was published in 2012 and is currently available in Greek and English. It is maintained by CTI DIOPHANTUS as part of the \"Photodentro Federated Architecture for Educational Content for Schools\" that includes a number of educational content repositories (for Learning Objects, Educational Video, and User Generated Content) and the Greek National Aggregator of Educational Content accumulating metadata from collections stored in repositories of other organizations.

Ashcraft defines math anxiety as \"a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance\" (2002, p. 1). The academic study of math anxiety originates as early as the 1950s, where Mary Fides Gough introduced the term \"mathemaphobia\" to describe the phobia-like feelings of many towards mathematics. The first math anxiety measurement scale was developed by Richardson and Suinn in 1972. Since this development, several researchers have examined math anxiety in empirical studies. Hembree (1990) conducted a meta-analysis of 151 studies concerning math anxiety. It determined that math anxiety is related to poor math performance on math achievement tests and that math anxiety is related to negative attitudes concerning math. Hembree also suggests that math anxiety is directly connected with math avoidance.\n\nAshcraft (2002) suggests that highly anxious math students will avoid situations in which they have to perform mathematical calculations. Unfortunately, math avoidance results in less competency, exposure and math practice, leaving students more anxious and mathematically unprepared to achieve. In college and university, anxious math students take fewer math courses and tend to feel negative towards math. In fact, Ashcraft found that the correlation between math anxiety and variables such as confidence and motivation are strongly negative.\n\nAccording to Schar, because math anxiety can cause math avoidance, an empirical dilemma arises. For instance, when a highly math-anxious student performs disappointingly on a math question, it could be due to math anxiety, or the lack of competency in math because of math avoidance. Ashcraft determined that by administering a test that becomes increasingly more mathematically challenging, he noticed that even highly math-anxious individuals do well on the first portion of the test measuring performance. However, on the latter and more difficult portion of the test, there was a stronger negative relationship between accuracy and math anxiety.\n\nAccording to the research found at the University of Chicago by Sian Beilock and her group, math anxiety is not simply about being bad at math. After using brain scans, scholars confirmed that the anticipation or the thought of solving math actually causes math anxiety. The brain scans showed that the area of the brain that is triggered when someone has math anxiety overlaps the same area of the brain where bodily harm is registered.\n\nThe impact of mathematics anxiety on mathematics performance has been studied in much recent literature. An individual with math anxiety does not necessarily lack ability in mathematics, rather, they cannot perform to their full potential due to the interfering symptoms of their anxiety. Math anxiety manifests itself in a variety of ways, including physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms, that can all disrupt a student's mathematical performance. The strong negative correlation between high math anxiety and low achievement is often thought to be due to the impact of math anxiety on working memory. Working memory has a limited capacity, and when solving mathematical problems, a large portion of this capacity is dedicated to problem solving. However, in individuals with math anxiety, much of this space is taken up by anxious thoughts, thus compromising the individual's ability to perform. In addition, a frequent reliance in schools on high-stakes and timed testing, where students tend to feel the most anxiety, can lead to lower achievement for math anxious individuals. PISA results demonstrate that students experiencing high math anxiety demonstrate mathematics scores that are 34 points lower than students who do not have math anxiety, equivalent to one full year of school. These findings demonstrate the clear link between math anxiety and reduced levels of achievement, suggesting that alleviating math anxiety may lead to a marked improvement in student achievement.\n\nA rating scale for mathematics anxiety was written about in 1972 by Richardson and Suinn. Richardson and Suinn defined mathematical anxiety as \"feelings of apprehension and tension concerning manipulation of numbers and completion of mathematical problems in various contexts\". Richardson and Suinn introduced the MARS (Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale) in 1972. Elevated scores on the MARS test translate to high math anxiety. The authors presented the normative data, including a mean score of 215.38 with a standard deviation of 65.29, collected from 397 students that replied to an advertisement for behavior therapy treatment for math anxiety. For test-retest reliability, the Pearson product-moment coefficient was used and a score of 0.85 was calculated, which was favorable and comparable to scores found on other anxiety tests. Richardson and Suinn validated the construct of this test by sharing previous results from three other studies that were very similar to the results achieved in this study. They also administered the Differential Aptitude Test, a 10-minute math test including simple to complex problems.\n\nCalculation of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the MARS test and Differential Aptitude Test scores was −0.64 (p < .01), indicating that higher MARS scores relate to lower math test scores and \"since high anxiety interferes with performance, and poor performance produces anxiety, this result provides evidence that the MARS does measure mathematics anxiety\". This test was intended for use in diagnosing math anxiety, testing efficacy of different math anxiety treatment approaches and possibly designing an anxiety hierarchy to be used in desensitization treatments. The MARS test is of interest to those in counseling psychology and the test is used profusely in math anxiety research. It is available in several versions of varying length and is considered psychometrically sound. Other tests are often given to measure different dimensionalities of math anxiety, such as the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales (FSMAS). The FSMAS evaluates nine specific domains using Likert-type scales: attitude toward success, mathematics as a male domain, mother's attitude, father's attitude, teacher's attitude, confidence in learning mathematics, mathematics anxiety, affectance motivation and mathematics usefulness. Despite the introduction of newer instrumentation, the use of the MARS test appears to be the educational standard for measuring math anxiety due to its specificity and prolific use.\n\nWhile there are overarching similarities concerning the acquisition of math skills, researchers have shown that children's mathematical abilities differ across countries. In Canada, students score substantially lower in math problem-solving and operations than students in Korea, India and Singapore. Researchers have conducted thorough comparisons between countries, and have determined that in countries such as Taiwan and Japan, parents place more emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability in school success. By parents placing a higher emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability they are helping their child develop a growth mindset. People who develop a growth mindset believe that everyone has the ability to grow their intellectual ability, learn from their mistakes and become more resilient learners. Moreover, parents in these countries tend to set higher expectations and standards for their children. In turn, students spend more time on homework and value homework more than American children.\n\nAnother difference in mathematic abilities often explored in research concerns gender disparities. There has been research examining gender difference in performance on standardized tests across various countries. Beller and Gafni's have shown that children at approximately nine years of age do not show consistent gender difference in relation to math skills. However, in 17 out of the 20 countries examined in this study, 13-year-old boys tended to score higher than girls. Moreover, mathematics is often labeled as a masculine ability; as a result, girls often have low confidence in their math capabilities. These gender stereotypes can reinforce low confidence in girls and can cause math anxiety as research has shown that performance on standardized math tests is affected by one's confidence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006). As a result, educators have been trying to abolish this stereotype by fostering confidence in math in all students in order to avoid math anxiety.\n\nMathematical anxiety is often most directly related to women as younger female scholars are thought to develop anxiety towards mathematics and sciences when they become more interested in social relations in their teen years. It is thought that women experience more anxiety in mathematics as a group than men as a result of societal pressures and views of women and mathematics. It has also been suggested that in primary elementary years, if female students have an anxious female math teacher, they are more likely to confirm the math anxiety as a gender stereotype. Studies have shown that (>90%) of early elementary school teachers in the United States are female. These female teachers' anxieties relate to an increase in girls internalizing the stereotypes that \"boys are good at math\", hindering a girls' math achievement via the beliefs about who is good at math. Girls are more likely than boys to take notice of their female teachers \"negatives and fears about math\", which could negatively influence their future pursuit of the subject. One method to help address this issue is ensuring that teaching programs are reinforcing positive attitudes towards math, and helping teacher candidates solidify their grasp on mathematics.\n\nLarge amounts of research has shown that women are aware of the stereotype surrounding their own math abilities, thus resulting in women's test scores to be lower than that of their male counterparts. The researchers explain that it is not the result of our biology (genes) but rather a social effect as exhibited in their experiments. Based on the results, the researchers doing the experiment believe that gender stereotype threat could be a key factor in explaining the difference in women and men's performance on math exams. Stereotype threat based on gender is often seen as a result of gender references made during an exam and can profoundly affect the results of the test. This is known as gender labeling and was demonstrated in a research study in which the researchers create two experiments to test their theories. In the first exam they included a 33% split between female, male or neutral questions. The results showed that both men and women answered \"male labeled\" questions with better proficiency than the other two types of questions. Male labeled questions would include male names or references to \"he\" or \"him\" whereas female labeled questions would include women's names or \"she\" or \"her\". The results found that even slight references to gender by including a male vs. a female's name in a question could impact test performance. Although this sort of gender labeling seems to affect men positively, women often seem to do worse on exams including these types of questions.\nAdditionally, stereotype threat is confounded in situations where the student is required to tell their gender at the beginning of the exam versus the end of it. Studies have shown that gender stereotype threat is reduced greatly when women are asked to tell their gender at the end of an exam. Stereotype threat can interfere with performance, affecting men positively but women negatively.\n\nThe principles of mathematics are generally understood at an early age; preschoolers can comprehend the majority of principles underlying counting. By kindergarten, it is common for children to use counting in a more sophisticated manner by adding and subtracting numbers. While kindergarteners tend to use their fingers to count, this habit is soon abandoned and replaced with a more refined and efficient strategy; children begin to perform addition and subtraction mentally at approximately six years of age. When children reach approximately eight years of age, they can retrieve answers to mathematical equations from memory. With proper instruction, normally functioning children acquire these basic mathematical skills and are able to solve more complex mathematical problems with more sophisticated training. (Kail & Zolner, 2005).\n\nHigh risk teaching styles are often explored to gain a better understanding of math anxiety. Goulding, Rowland, and Barber (2002) suggest that there are linkages between a teacher's lack of subject knowledge and ability to plan teaching material effectively. These findings suggest that teachers that do not have a sufficient background in mathematics may struggle with the development of comprehensive lesson plans for their students. Similarly, Laturner's research (2002) shows that teachers with certification in math are more likely to be passionate and committed about teaching math than those without certification. However, those without certification vary in their commitment to the profession depending on coursework preparation.\n\nMoreover, a study conducted by Kawakami, Steele, Cifa, Phills, and Dovidio (2008) examined attitudes towards math and behavior during math examinations. The study examined the effect of extensive training in teaching women to approach math. The results showed that women who were trained to approach rather than avoid math showed a positive implicit attitude towards math. These findings were only consistent with women low in initial identification with math. This study was replicated with women who were either encouraged to approach math or who received neutral training. Results were consistent and demonstrated that women taught to approach math had an implicit positive attitude and completed more math problems than women taught to approach math in a neutral manner.\n\nJohns, Schmader, and Martens (2005) conducted a study in which they examined the effect of teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance. The researchers concluded that women tended to perform worse than men when problems were described as math equations. However, women did not differ from men when the test sequence was described as problem solving or in a condition in which they learned about stereotype threats. This research has practical implications. The results suggested that teaching students about stereotype threat could offer a practical means of reducing its detrimental effects and lead to an improvement in a girl's performance and mathematical ability. Concluding that educating female teachers about stereotype threat can reduce its negative effects in the classroom.\n\nA view associated with Francis Galton author of \"Hereditary Genius\" (1869). suggests that \"when asked to explain why some children do better in math than others, Asian children, their teachers, and their parents point to hard work, their American counterparts to ability.\"\n\nAccording to Margaret Murray, female mathematicians in the United States have almost always been a minority. Although the exact difference fluctuates with the times as she has explored in her book [\"Women Becoming Mathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America\"]. \"Since 1980, women have earned over 17 percent of the mathematics doctorates... [In The United States]\". The trends in gender are by no means clear, but perhaps parity is still a way to go. Since 1995, studies have shown that the gender gap favored males in most mathematical standardized testing with boys outperforming girls in 15 out of 28 countries. However, as of 2015 the gender gap has almost been reversed, showing an increase in female presence. This being caused by women steadily increasing their performance on math and science testing and enrollment, but also from males losing ground at the same time. This role reversal can largely be associated with the gender normative stereotypes that are found in the STEM field, deeming \"who math is for\" and \"who STEM careers are for\". These stereotypes can fuel mathematical anxiety that is already present among young female populations. Thus parity will take more work to overcome mathematical anxiety and this is one reason for women in mathematics being role models for younger women.\n\nStudents often develop mathematical anxiety in schools, often as a result of learning from teachers who are themselves anxious about their mathematical abilities in certain areas. Typical examples of areas where mathematics teachers are often incompetent or semi-competent include fractions, (long) division, algebra, geometry \"with proofs\", calculus, and topology. In many countries, would-be math teachers are required only to obtain passing grades of 51% in mathematics exams, so that a math student who has failed to understand 49% of the math syllabus throughout his or her education can, and often does, become a math teacher. His or her fears and lack of understanding then pass naturally to his or her students. As John Taylor Gatto has demonstrated at length, modern Western schools were deliberately designed during the late 19th century to create an environment which is ideal for fostering fear and anxiety, and for preventing or delaying learning.\n\nThe role of attachment has been suggested as having an impact in the development of the anxiety. Children with an insecure attachment style were more likely to demonstrate the anxiety.\n\nMath is usually taught as a right and wrong subject and as if getting the right answer were paramount. In contrast to most subjects, mathematics problems almost always have a right answer. Additionally, the subject is often taught as if there were a right way to solve the problem and any other approaches would be wrong, even if students got the right answer. When learning, understanding the concepts should be paramount, but with a right/wrong approach to teaching math, students are encouraged not to try, not to experiment, not to find algorithms that work for them, and not to take risks. \"Teachers benefit children most when they encourage them to share their thinking process and justify their answers out loud or in writing as they perform math operations. ... With less of an emphasis on right or wrong and more of an emphasis on process, teachers can help alleviate students' anxiety about math\".\n\nWhile teaching of many subjects has changed from rote memorization to the current Constructivist approach, math is frequently taught with a rote learning behaviorist approach. That is,\nConstructivist theory says the learning and knowledge is the student's creation, yet rote learning and a right/wrong approach to teaching math ensures that it is external to the student.\n\nThere have been many studies that show parent involvement in developing a child's educational processes is essential. A student success in school is increased if their parents are involved in their education both at home and school (Henderson & Map, 2002). As a result, one of the easiest ways to reduce math anxiety is for the parent to be more involved in their child's education. In addition, research has shown that a parent's perception on mathematics influences their child's perception and achievement in mathematics (Yee & Eccles, 1988). This means that if a parent makes it apparent that they do not enjoy mathematics or that they are not good at mathematics, this can influence the way in which their child views mathematics.\n\nFurthermore, studies by Herbert P. Ginsburg, Columbia University, show the influence of parents' and teachers' attitudes on \"'the child's expectations in that area of learning.'... It is less the actual teaching and more the attitude and expectations of the teacher or parents that count\". This is further supported by a survey of Montgomery County, Maryland students who \"pointed to their parents as the primary force behind the interest in mathematics\".\n\nClaudia Zaslavsky contends that math has two components. The first component, commonly focused on in many schools, is to calculate the answer. This component also has two subcomponents, namely the answer and the process or method used to determine the answer. Focusing more on the process or method enables students to make mistakes, but not \n'fail at math'. The second component is to understand the mathematical concepts that underlay the problem being studied. \"... and in this respect studying mathematics is much more like studying, say, music or painting than it is like studying history or biology.\"\n\nAmongst others supporting this viewpoint is the work of Dr. Eugene Geist, Associate Professor at Ohio University – Athens, Ohio and an early childhood education specialist. Dr. Geist's recommendations include focusing on the concepts rather than the right answer and letting students work on their own and discuss their solutions before the answer is given. Emphasis is given that young people hate to be wrong and hate situations where they can be embarrassed by being wrong.\n\nNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1989, 1995b) suggestions for teachers seeking to prevent math anxiety include:\n\nHackworth (1992) suggests that the following activities can help in reducing and mitigating mathematical anxiety:\n\nMath (and Statistics) Therapy is a combination of coaching and counseling, provided for adults by people with credentials in both counseling and math education. In Math Therapy the reasons for anxiety are addressed, as well as the mathematical skills which are lacking. New coping skills are introduced and practiced, so that fear, distaste or other negative emotions do not block math (or statistics) learning.\n\nThere are several anxiety reducing techniques that teachers can teach their children and practice periodically throughout the year. Teachers will need to learn these techniques and encourage the students to practice them at home and to use them prior to testing or when feeling anxious during math class.\nSeveral studies have shown that relaxation techniques can be used to help alleviate anxiety related to mathematics. In her workbook Conquering Math Anxiety, 3rd edition, Cynthia Arem offers specific strategies to reduce math avoidance and anxiety. One strategy she advocates for is relaxation exercises and indicates that by practicing relaxation techniques on a regularly basis for 10–20 minutes students can significantly can reduce their anxiety. \nDr. Edmundo Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation taken from the book Mental Toughness Training for Sports, Loehr (1986) can be used in a modified form to reduce anxiety as posted on the website HypnoGenesis.\n\nVisualization has also been used effectively to help reduce math anxiety. Arem has a chapter that deals with reducing test anxiety and advocates the use visualization. In her chapter titled Conquer Test Anxiety (Chapter 9) she has specific exercises devoted to visualization techniques to help the student feel calm and confident during testing.\n\nStudies have shown students learn best when they are active rather than passive learners.\n\nThe theory of multiple intelligences suggests that there is a need for addressing different learning styles. Math lessons can be tailored for visual/spatial, logical/mathematics, musical, auditory, body/kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal and verbal/linguistic learning styles. This theory of learning styles has never been demonstrated to be true in controlled trials. Studies show no evidence to support tailoring lessons to an individual students learning style to be beneficial.\n\nNew concepts can be taught through play acting, cooperative groups, visual aids, hands on activities or information technology. To help with learning statistics, there are many applets found on the Internet that help students learn about many things from probability distributions to linear regression. These applets are commonly used in introductory statistics classes, as many students benefit from using them.\n\nActive learners ask critical questions, such as: \"Why do we do it this way, and not that way\"? Some teachers may find these questions annoying or difficult to answer, and indeed may have been trained to respond to such questions with hostility and contempt, designed to instill fear. Better teachers respond eagerly to these questions, and use them to help the students deepen their understand by examining alternative methods so the students can choose for themselves which method they prefer. This process can result in meaningful class discussions. Talking is the way in which students increase their understanding and command of math. Teachers can emphasize the importance of original thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas. This can be done through class conversations. Teachers can give students insight as to why they learn certain content by asking students questions such as \"what purpose is served by solving this problem?\" and \"why are we being asked to learn this?\"\n\nReflective journals help students develop metacognitive skills by having them think about their understanding. According to Pugalee, writing helps students organize their thinking which helps them better understand mathematics. Moreover, writing in mathematics classes helps students problem solve and improve mathematical reasoning. When students know how to use mathematical reasoning, they are less anxious about solving problems.\n\nHowever, there is still a large part of school math teaching which consists of memorization, repetition, and mechanically performed operations. Times tables are one example, wherein rote learning is essential to mathematics performance. When a student fails to learn the times tables at a young age, they can experience math anxiety later, when all the students' classmates can remember the tables but they cannot.\n\nChildren learn best when math is taught in a way that is relevant to their everyday lives. Children enjoy experimenting. To learn mathematics in any depth, students should be engaged in exploring, conjecturing, and thinking, as well as in rote learning of rules and procedures.\n\n"}

NHA is the largest charter school operator in Michigan and one of the largest charter school operators in the United States. NHA schools are prominent among charter institutions for employing the brick and mortar or traditional school concept.\n\nNHA was formed in 1995 by entrepreneur J. C. Huizenga. J. C.

They are authorized by state-approved institutions such as universities and school boards, and therefore have no geographic boundaries. The schools focus on college preparedness and generally serve students from kindergarten through eighth grade, with some schools also offering pre-kindergarten.This start-up culture dictated the beginning of charters in 1997, when community organizers, educators and local nonprofits opened institutions of learning to envisage their vision of public education. Charters still develop from local programs. Yet, what supporters describe as the “charter school movement” was backed up by networks of schools which included for-profit chains.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes, students in NHA schools were found to show improved spring-to-spring academic growth in the subjects of reading and math, compared with their traditional public school peers.\n\nNHA schools use the NWEA test as a measure of student performance. The Northwest Evaluation Association has instituted an assessment process for both mathematics and reading.

Oralism came into popular use in the United States around the late 1860s. In 1867, the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts was the first school to start teaching in this manner. Oralism and its contrast, manualism, manifest differently in deaf education and are a source of controversy for involved communities. Oralism should not be confused with Listening and Spoken Language, a technique for teaching deaf children that emphasizes the child's perception of auditory signals from hearing aids and/or cochlear implants.\n\nSince the beginning of formal deaf education in the 18th century in the United States, manualism and oralism have been on opposing sides of a heated debate that continues to this day. Oralism as the systematic education of deaf people began in Spain in the mid-1500s and was the byproduct of socioeconomic motives. The church barred deaf people from Holy Communion because they could not confess aloud. Deaf people were also prohibited from inheriting their family's wealth; therefore, to preserve the family wealth, deaf heirs in Spain were sent to Pedro Ponce de Leon after hearing that he taught a deaf man to talk in San Salvador Monastery in Oña. Oralism provided members of the privileged classes with deaf children a way to channel their children's education and an opportunity to keep them away from the deaf community. Speaking has been equated with the higher classes and higher intellect, signing with the lower.\n\nBefore the Clarke School for the Deaf (now the Clarke School for Hearing and Speech) made its mark in deaf American education in the 1860s, there was a popular support of manualism. Manual language soon became a less popular choice for deaf education due to the new Darwinist perspective. Clarke School for the Deaf in 1867 became a \"mainstream service\" for deaf students through creating a \"learn to listen\" mentality. This was done through the proper training of educators in auditory/oral education. Since its start, Clarke School has expanded and provided support for oral communication within deaf education and policy.\n\nIn relation to the early 16th century oralism in Spain, 19th century oralists viewed oral language as a superior form of communication. Gardiner Green Hubbard, Horace Mann, Samuel Gridley Howe and Alexander Graham Bell were popular supporters of oralism and its impact on deaf education and services. Until the end of the 19th century, many educators of deaf America were deaf themselves. However, oralists like Alexander Graham Bell began to wield increasing influence. Bell and others believed in deaf assimilation with the mainstream hearing world. Bell also believed that sign language was an instrument of imprisonment and that its use prevented the \"gesturer\" from being a \"true American\". Bell had no opinion regarding whether or whom deaf people should marry. By contrast, negative eugenicists sought to stop the spread of \"bad genes\" through invasive measures such as mandatory placement in institutions or sterilization. Bell believed oralism was \"an attractive option to sterilization\". To Bell, implementation of oralism meant the possibility of a mainstream and \"normal\" life for deaf individuals.\n\nIn 1878, International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) met in Paris to discuss the use of sign language and other issues within deaf education. During the congregation, no Deaf members were allowed to testify. In 1880, the International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) met again in Milan with 164 educators attending with one of them being deaf. This meeting created the solely oralist classroom preventing any form of sign language from being used. After the Milan conference, the Deaf community referred to this time in history as \"the dark ages for deaf education in America\".\n\nHearing educators who could not sign replaced deaf teachers and, by the mid-20th century, eighty percent of American secondary schools for the deaf used the oral method exclusively. Some strategies, such as Total Communication or SimCom, saw classes conducted in a mixture of spoken and signed English with the teacher signing along, in English word order as they delivered their lecture. For example, \"is\" \"was\" and \"the\", which are not used in sign, were spelled out by the teachers using the manual alphabet. Students were taught using the articulation method, which taught them how to speak and lip read. Oralists believed that signs were no more than gross holistic gestures, which stood for English words in a one-to-one correspondence. Sentences in sign were thought to have no grammar. The facial expressions, such as exaggerated movements of the mouth, tongue, eyes, and lips, suggesting grimacing or excessive emotional display, triggered horror in hearing people. Students were asked to stop moving their faces when they signed, which is equivalent to asking hearing people to speak in declarative sentences uttered in monotone.\n\nEven though students were not allowed to use manual signs within the classroom, many deaf students preferred manual signs and used them frequently in their dorm rooms at residential schools for the deaf. Some deaf children were considered \"oral failures\" because they could not pick up oral language. Others thought that the techniques of oralism actually limited them on what they were taught because they always had to concentrate on the way the words were formed, not what they meant.\n\nLeaders of the manualist movement, including Edward M. Gallaudet, argued against the teaching of oralism because it restricted the ability of deaf students to communicate in what was considered their native language. Moreover, \"attempts to eliminate sign language were tantamount to stripping them of their identity, their community, and their culture.\"\n\nThe retraction of laws forbidding the use of sign language in the classroom occurred in 2010 with the International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) in Vancouver. Deaf grassroots activists and the planning committee of ICED created a solution to provide proper education to the deaf globally.\n\nOralism is no longer used to teach language or communication in the United States. Parental use of the oral approach typically stems from parental desire for their child to use a spoken language to communicate with the majority hearing population. They also feel the use of a spoken language will further their child's literacy and written language skills in the classroom. While some researches believed that success of the oral approach in a classroom setting had not been fully evaluated, recent research has demonstrated that oral education using Listening and Spoken Language can provide most deaf children with spoken language skills that are equivalent to those of their hearing peers.\n\nA strong supporter of oral schools in the United States is the Oberkotter Foundation, whose mission is \"Empowering children who are deaf or hard of hearing to reach their full potential by providing leadership and funding in listening and spoken language.\" The organization provides financial support to institutions that demonstrate a focus on developing skills in listening and using oral language for deaf individuals. This is not limited to oral schools themselves, but also extends to universities, social support programs, and medical centers that are deemed supportive of spoken language development in deaf children. The Foundation believes that developing spoken language proficiency allows deaf individuals to reach their full potential.\n\nClarke Schools for Hearing and Speech: Focus on helping deaf and hard of hearing children develop spoken English and listening skills. The school's goal is to prepare students for the mainstream setting.\n\nCleary School: Focus on ASL and Spoken English in its Elementary, Middle, and High School classrooms. Their Pre-K focuses on spoken English.\n\nMemphis Oral School for the Deaf: Teaching children to develop their spoken and written English skills by teaching children in spoken English.\n\nThere have been few quantitative evaluations regarding the long-term outcomes of oral programs for deaf individuals, but those that do exist tend to study this in relation to children with cochlear implants. One study compared the English development of deaf children with a cochlear implant versus what the English development might have been without the implant. English development was greater and more successful for the implanted deaf child than that of the non-implanted child based on the implementation of a predictive model. The predictive model employs age, residual hearing, and communication mode used by the child to predict the language development. Although deaf implanted children are already at a disadvantage for English development when compared to their hearing counterparts, the implant, on average, reduced what could have been an even larger deficit had the child not been implanted (based on the predictive model). The authors recommend implanting the child as early as possible.\n\nThe studies did not consider how a non-implanted child exposed to a signed language and a bilingual/bicultural education could develop English skills in relation to a hearing child’s English development. Multiple studies find that by ensuring a deaf child has access to American Sign Language, their overall academic performance is better than those who are not.\n\nCommunication in oral-deaf students without cochlear implants is typically less frequent and less complex than hearing peers of the same age. These expressed communications are less clear than that of their hearing peers. Linguistically, these communications are typical of the language skills seen much earlier in their hearing counterparts. Despite efforts to encourage the sole reliance on speech and spoken language in oral schools, some oral-deaf individuals developed sign systems among themselves in non-supervised settings. Additionally, oral-deaf children often used manual gestures/signs simultaneously or in addition to vocalizations during expressive communications at home.\n\nSome studies have called into question the role of developing spoken language skills in relation to developing reading skills. One study in particular demonstrated that while individuals who became deaf before developing spoken language did show a decreased ability to differentiate between the phonological properties of a language, they showed equal capability of recognizing and understanding the orthographic properties of what they were reading. In fact, compared to their hearing counterparts, the deaf individuals showed an increased rate of written word processing skills as they increased in age. Altogether, this research provided evidence contrary to the belief that spoken skills are critical to the development of reading skills, and further proposes that educational approaches should include a stronger focus on building awareness of written language forms separate from the related aural aspects.\n\nThere is little existing research on the social, professional, and mental health of deaf individuals using oral methods in comparison to those using other methods of education and communication. However, some studies suggest that social-emotional outcomes for deaf children who use cochlear implants and spoken language are statistically significantly higher than those of their signing deaf counterparts.\n\nThere also was no accurate predictor of oralism's success in the classroom.\n\nDeaf children growing up in an oral setting are likely to experience cognitive and developmental delays as a result of a deprivation of natural signed-language. The decision to place a child in an oral setting, however, likely stems from pressure parents feel to do so from a doctor or medical practitioner. Pressure is then said to be placed on deaf children, as they are reported to feel embarrassed if they do not master both lip-reading and spoken English. These delays are also not only academic, but also social. Deaf children in an oral setting may feel depressed, anxious and experience aloneness and embarrassment as a result of such language deprivation.\n\n"}

She was named after the Russian victory over the British and the French in the Siege of Petropavlovsk in 1854. The ship was completed during the winter of 1914–1915, but was not ready for combat until mid-1915. Her role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so she spent her time training and providing cover for minelaying operations. Her crew joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet after the February Revolution of 1917 and she was the only dreadnought available to the Bolsheviks for several years after the October Revolution of 1917. She bombarded the mutinous garrison of Fort Krasnaya Gorka and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland in 1918–19. Later, her crew joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and she was renamed Marat\" after the rebellion was crushed.\n\n\"Marat\" was reconstructed from 1928 to 1931 and represented the Soviet Union at the Coronation Naval Review at Spithead in 1937. Two years later, she bombarded a Finnish coastal artillery position during the Winter War once before the Gulf of Finland iced up. Shortly afterwards, her anti-aircraft armament was upgraded. When the Germans invaded on 22 June 1941 she was in Kronstadt and provided gunfire support to Soviet troops in September as the Germans approached Leningrad. Later that month she had her bow blown off and sank in shallow water after two hits by bombs (dropped from a Ju 87 Stuka, piloted by Hans Ulrich Rudel) that detonated her forward magazine. She was refloated several months later and became a stationary battery, providing gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad. Plans were made to reconstruct her after the war, using the bow of her sister \"Frunze\", but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled in 1948. She was renamed \"Volkhov\", after the nearby river, in 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken in 1953 and broken up afterwards.\n\n\"Petropavlovsk\" was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of , more than designed. Her displacement was at load, over more than her designed displacement of .\n\n\"Petropavlovsk\"s machinery was built by the Baltic Works. Four Parsons-type steam turbine sets drove the four propellers. The engine rooms were located between turrets three and four in three compartments. The outer compartments each had a high-pressure ahead and reverse turbine for each wing propeller shaft. The central engine room had two low-pressure ahead and astern turbines as well as two cruising turbines driving each of the two center shafts. The engines had a total designed output of , but they produced during her sister 's full-speed trials on 21 November 1915 and gave a top speed of . Twenty-five Yarrow boilers provided steam to the engines at a designed working pressure of . Each boiler was fitted with Thornycroft oil sprayers for mixed oil/coal burning. They were arranged in two groups. The forward group consisted of two boiler rooms in front of the second turret, the foremost of which had three boilers while the second one had six. The rear group was between the second and third turrets and comprised two compartments, each with eight boilers. At full load she carried of coal and of fuel oil and that provided her a range of at a speed of .\n\nThe main armament of the \"Gangut\"s consisted of a dozen 52-caliber Obukhovskii Pattern 1907 guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship. The Russians did not believe that superfiring turrets offered any advantage, discounting the value of axial fire and believing that superfiring turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast problems. They also believed that distributing the turrets, and their associated magazines, over the length of the ship improved the survivability of the ship. Sixteen 50-caliber Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in casemates as the secondary battery intended to defend the ship against torpedo boats. The ships were completed with only a single 30-caliber \"Lender\" anti-aircraft (AA) gun mounted on the quarterdeck. Other AA guns were probably added during the course of World War I, but details are lacking. Conway's says that four were added to the roofs of the end turrets during the war. Four submerged torpedo tubes were mounted with three torpedoes for each tube.\n\n\"Petropavlovsk\" was built by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. Her keel was laid down on 16 June 1909 and she was launched on 22 September 1911. She entered service on 5 January 1915, six months after the start of World War I, when she reached Helsinki and was assigned to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. \"Petropavlovsk\" and her sister provided distant cover for minelaying operations on 10–11 November and 6 December 1915. She saw no action of any kind during 1916. Her crew joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. \"Petropavlovsk\" and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in what became known as the \"Ice Voyage\".\n\n\"Petropavlovsk\" was the only operable dreadnought belonging to the Soviets and provided cover to smaller ships on raiding missions. On 31 May 1919 she fired in support of the and several minesweepers that had taken the bait laid by the British forces supporting the White Russians. The British destroyer appeared to be operating alone and the Soviets sortied to attack her, but a number of other British destroyers were positioned to sweep in behind the Soviets. \"Azard\" retreated at full speed and \"Petropavlovsk\" opened fire on \"Walker\" at about . She hit \"Walker\" twice, inflicting only minor damage and wounding two sailors, and the British destroyers eventually disengaged when they got too close to Soviet coastal artillery and minefields. A few days later \"Petropavlovsk\" and the pre-dreadnought battleship bombarded Fort Krasnaya Gorka whose garrison had mutinied against the Bolsheviks. She fired no fewer than 568 12-inch shells and the garrison surrendered on 17 June when Leon Trotsky promised them their lives, only to subsequently order them machine-gunned. On 17 August 1919 \"Petropavlovsk\" was claimed as torpedoed and put out of action by the British Coastal Motor Boat \"CMB 88\" during a night attack in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all. The crew of \"Petropavlovsk\" joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. After it was bloodily crushed she was renamed \"Marat\" to honor the French revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat on 31 March 1921. By 1922 her primary rangefinder had been moved to a platform on the foremast and she mounted three 3-inch \"Lender\" AA guns each on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets.\n\"Marat\" was partially reconstructed between the fall of 1928 and 8 April 1931 at the Baltic Works. The most obvious external change was a much more elaborate forward superstructure needed to house new fire control instruments. A KDP-6 fire-control director, with two Zeiss rangefinders, was positioned at the top of the tubular foremast. An Zeiss rangefinder was also added on the rear superstructure. The top of the forward funnel was lengthened by about and angled backwards in an attempt to keep the exhaust gases away from the control and gunnery spaces. A derrick was added to the mainmast to handle a KR-1 flying boat imported from Germany that was stored above the third turret. No aircraft catapult was fitted so the aircraft had to take off and land on the water. A forecastle was added to the bow, which was also given much more sheer and flare to improve her sea-keeping abilities. Her turrets were overhauled, her guns replaced and new 8-meter rangefinders were installed on every turret. Her boilers were converted to only burn fuel oil and the more powerful boilers allowed the forward three boilers to be removed. The space freed up was used for anti-aircraft ammunition and various control spaces. The cruising turbines were also removed which simplified the ship's machinery at a small cost in power. These changes increased her displacement to at full load and her overall length to . Her metacentric height increased to from her designed mainly because she now carried much of her fuel in her double bottom rather than in coal bunkers high on the sides of the ship. More weight was added to her before World War II, including an increase in the thickness of her turret roofs to , that decreased her metacentric height to only . This was unsatisfactory and plans were made to reconstruct her again, but they were cancelled when the Germans attacked in 1941.\n\"Marat\" took part in the 1937 Coronation Review in Britain. Her participation in the Winter War was minimal as she bombarded Finnish coast defense guns one time at Saarenpää in the Beryozovye Islands with 133 high explosive shells before the Gulf of Finland iced over. In early 1940 her anti-aircraft armament was reinforced. She exchanged her elderly 3-inch \"Lender\" guns for modern 34-K guns and two twin 76.2 mm 81-K mounts were mounted on her quarter deck. The magazines for these guns were situated in the rearmost casemates on each beam, which lost their 120 mm guns. At some point six automatic 70-K guns were also added. These additions boosted her displacement to at full load. She sailed to Tallinn shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia, although she returned to Kronstadt on 20 June 1941, two days before the German invasion of Russia began. \"Marat\" opened fire on troop positions of the German 18th Army from the Leningrad Sea Canal on 8 September. She was lightly damaged by German guns on 16 September.\nShe was sunk at her moorings on 23 September 1941 by two near-simultaneous hits by bombs near the forward superstructure. They caused the explosion of the forward magazine which heaved the turret up, blew the superstructure and forward funnel over to starboard and demolished the forward part of the hull from frames 20 to 57. 326 men were killed and the ship gradually settled to the bottom in of water. Her sinking is commonly credited to the Stuka pilot Oberleutnant Hans-Ulrich Rudel of III./StG 2, but Rudel dropped only one of the two bombs. The rear part of the ship was later refloated and she was used as a floating battery although all of her 120 mm guns were removed. Initially only the two rearmost turrets were operable, but the second turret was repaired by the autumn of 1942. She fired a total of 1,971 twelve-inch shells during the Siege of Leningrad. In December 1941 granite slabs thick from the nearby harbor walls were laid on her decks to reinforce her deck protection. Another transverse bulkhead was built behind frame 57 and the space between them was filled with concrete to prevent her sinking if the original bulkhead was ruptured.\n\nShe resumed her original name on 31 May 1943. After the war there were several plans to reconstruct her, using the bow of the \"Frunze\", but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed \"Volkhov\", after the nearby river, on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953. The ship was subsequently broken up.\n\n\n"}

It has been shown that if one believes that war is biologically determined, he or she is less likely to engage in activities to promote peace. Conversely, if one believes that war is not biologically determined, one is more likely to work for peace..\n\nIn fact, about half of all young people believe that war is biologically determined according to international surveys in 1972, replicated by studies in Finland and the United States. If anything, the proportion may have increased in recent years\n\nSteven Pinker has criticized the Seville Statement as being an example of the moralistic fallacy. Some scientists believe both evolutionary psychology and neuropsychology suggest that human violence does indeed have biological roots.\nPinker has used the Seville Statement as an example of the idea of biological determinism, the incorrect idea that genes are solely responsible for \"any\" of our behaviors. A 2008 article in \"Nature\" by Dan Jones stated that \"The decades since have not been kind to these cherished beliefs. A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought.\" Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the Cinderella effect). Chimpanzees have violence between groups, which has similarities to raids and violence between groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower in humans living in small group societies than in chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between ingroup and outgroup, which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies, which suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced blood feuds due to better functioning justice systems may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.\n\n"}

{"id": "2883641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2883641", "title": "Some Thoughts Concerning Education", "text": "Some Thoughts Concerning Education\n\nSome Thoughts Concerning Education is a 1693 treatise on the education of gentlemen written by the English philosopher John Locke. For over a century, it was the most important philosophical work on education in England. It was translated into almost all of the major written European languages during the eighteenth century, and nearly every European writer on education after Locke, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, acknowledged its influence.\n\nIn his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690), Locke outlined a new theory of mind, contending that the gentleman's mind was a \"tabula rasa\" or \"blank slate\"; that is, it did not contain any innate ideas. \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" explains how to educate that mind using three distinct methods: the development of a healthy body; the formation of a virtuous character; and the choice of an appropriate academic curriculum.\n\nLocke wrote the letters that would eventually become \"Some Thoughts\" for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles suggested anyone could acquire the same kind of character as the aristocrats for whom Locke originally intended the work.\n\nRather than writing a wholly original philosophy of education, Locke, it seems, deliberately attempted to popularise several strands of seventeenth-century educational reform at the same time as introducing his own ideas. English writers such as John Evelyn, John Aubrey, John Eachard, and John Milton had previously advocated \"similar reforms in curriculum and teaching methods,\" but they had not succeeded in reaching a wide audience. Curiously, though, Locke proclaims throughout his text that his is a revolutionary work; as Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on \"Some Thoughts\", has pointed out, \"Locke frequently explicitly opposes his recommendations to the 'usual,' 'common,' 'ordinary,' or 'general' education.\"\n\nAs England became increasingly mercantilist and secularist, the humanist educational values of the Renaissance, which had enshrined scholasticism, came to be regarded by many as irrelevant. Following in the intellectual tradition of Francis Bacon, who had challenged the cultural authority of the classics, reformers such as Locke, and later Philip Doddridge, argued against Cambridge and Oxford's decree that \"all Bachelor and Undergraduates in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strives in the Schools, and only follow Aristotle and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude from the Schools all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the ancient and true Philosophy [sic].\" Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying Greek and Latin texts, an increasing number of families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the emerging sciences, mathematics, and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.\n\nIn 1684 Edward Clarke asked his friend, John Locke, for advice on raising his son and heir, Edward, Jr.; Locke responded with a series of letters that eventually served as the basis of \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\". But it was not until 1693, encouraged by the Clarkes and another friend, William Molyneux, that Locke actually published the treatise; Locke, \"timid\" when it came to public exposure, decided to publish the text anonymously.\n\nAlthough Locke revised and expanded the text five times before he died, he never substantially altered the \"familiar and friendly style of the work.\" The \"Preface\" alerted the reader to its humble origins as a series of letters and, according to Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on \"Some Thoughts\", advice that otherwise might have appeared \"meddlesome\" became welcome. Tarcov claims Locke treated his readers as his friends and they responded in kind.\n\nOf Locke's major claims in the \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" and \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\", two played a defining role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes at the opening of his treatise, \"I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.\" In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his \"Essay\" Locke posits an \"empty\" mind—a \"tabula rasa\"—that is \"filled\" by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on Plato's \"Theatetus\", which suggests that the mind is like a \"wax tablet\". Although Locke argued strenuously for the \"tabula rasa\" theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their \"aptitudes,\" and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—\"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for.\"\n\nLocke also discusses a theory of the self. He writes: \"the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences.\" That is, the \"associations of ideas\" made when young are more significant than those made when mature because they are the foundation of the self—they mark the \"tabula rasa\". In the \"Essay\", in which he first introduces the theory of the association of ideas, Locke warns against letting \"a foolish maid\" convince a child that \"goblins and sprites\" are associated with the darkness, for \"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\"\n\nLocke's emphasis on the role of experience in the formation of the mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to Locke's philosophical theory, points out, this is \"one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke.\" As both he and Tarcov highlight, Locke's writings are full of directives to seek out knowledge actively and reflect on received opinion; in fact, this was the essence of Locke's challenge to innatism.\n\nLocke advises parents to carefully nurture their children's physical \"habits\" before pursuing their academic education. As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin \"Some Thoughts\" with a discussion of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep. To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from Juvenal's \"Satires\"—\"a sound mind in a sound body.\" Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: \"Children [should] be not too \"warmly clad or covered\", winter or summer\" (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because \"bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to.\" Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that \"his \"feet to be washed\" every day in cold water, and to have his \"shoes\" so thin that they might leak and \"let in water\" whenever he comes near it\" (Locke's emphasis). Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout John Newbery's children's books in the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England. Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.\n\nLocke dedicates the bulk of \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" to explaining how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: \"that a man is able to \"deny himself\" his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way\" (Locke's emphasis). Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, attempt to create a \"habit\" of thinking rationally in their children. Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\". Throughout the \"Essay\", Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs. His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments. For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason. He argues that \"such a sort of \"slavish discipline\" makes a \"slavish temper\"\" (Locke's emphasis).\n\nWhat is important to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children \"love to be treated as Rational Creatures,\" thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are \"motivated only [by] rewards and punishments\" to achieve that goal.\n\nUltimately, Locke wants children to become adults as quickly as possible. As he argues in \"Some Thoughts,\" \"the only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it, into which a young gentleman should be entered by degrees as he can bear it, and the earlier the better.\" In the \"Second Treatise on Government\" (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their children to become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.\n\nLocke does not dedicate much space in \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" to outlining a specific curriculum; he is more concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children \"how\" to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor \"should remember that his business is not so much to teach [the child] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself.\" But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending \"Aesop's Fables\". Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because it would be useful to them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nWhen Locke began writing the letters that would eventually become \"Some Thoughts on Education\", he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: \"I place \"Vertue\" [sic] as the first and most necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman.\" James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although \"he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to \"all\" children\" (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, \"it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are.\"\n\nWhile it is possible to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that \"Some Thoughts\" applied only to the wealthy and the middle-class (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the \"middling sorts\"). One of Locke's conclusions in \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" is that he \"think[s] a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding.\" As Peter Gay writes, \"[i]t never occurred to him that every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all.\"\n\nIn his \"Essay on the Poor Law,\" Locke turns to the education of the poor; he laments that \"the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old.\" He suggests, therefore, that \"working schools\" be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be \"from infancy [three years old] inured to work.\" He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill a good work ethic in the children.\n\nLocke wrote \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" in response to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's \"principal aim\", as Locke states at the beginning, \"is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy.\" This education \"will not so perfectly suit the education of \"daughters\"; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish\" (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that \"since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [writ for the son].\" Martin Simons states that Locke \"suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes.\" Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and \"should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate.\" Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.\n\nBut Locke does recommend several minor \"restrictions\" relating to the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: \"But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them must have some restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing.\" Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the \"different treatments\" required for girls and boys, if any. Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book \"The Whole Duty of a Woman\" (1696), the female companion to \"The Whole Duty of Man\" (1657), and Rousseau's \"\" (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's \"Some Thoughts\" appears far more egalitarian.\n\nAlong with Rousseau's \"\" (1762), Locke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" was one of the foundational eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" vies with the \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, believed this as well; Leibniz argued that \"Some Thoughts\" superseded even the \"Essay\" in its impact on European society.\n\nLocke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" was a runaway best-seller. During the eighteenth century alone, \"Some Thoughts\" was published in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's \"Pamela\" (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Locke's influence on educational thought was widely acknowledged. In 1772 James Whitchurch wrote in his \"Essay Upon Education\" that Locke was \"an Author, to whom the Learned must ever acknowledge themselves highly indebted, and whose Name can never be mentioned without a secret Veneration, and Respect; his Assertions being the result of intense Thought, strict Enquiry, a clear and penetrating Judgment.\" Writers as politically dissimilar as Sarah Trimmer, in her periodical \"The Guardian of Education\" (1802–06), and Maria Edgeworth, in the educational treatise she penned with her father, \"Practical Education\" (1798), invoked Locke's ideas. Even Rousseau, while disputing Locke's central claim that parents should treat their children as rational beings, acknowledged his debt to Locke.\n\nJohn Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" at the beginning of a tradition of educational theory which they label \"environmentalism\". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac and Claude Adrien Helvétius eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the \"object lesson.\" These lessons focused pupils' attention on a particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners \"if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study.\"\n\nSuch techniques were also integral to Maria Montessori's methods in the twentieth century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show Sesame Street is also \"based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide.\" In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century has been dominated by the \"nature vs. nurture\" debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic \"environmentalism,\" though qualified in his text, is now no longer just a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.\n\n\n\n"}

He began his career in the Football League at Brighton & Hove Albion and after an unsuccessful spell at Brentford, he dropped into non-league football.\n\nMyall grew up in Eastbourne, East Sussex and was head boy at Cavendish School in the town.\n\nBorn in Eastbourne, Myall joined the Brighton & Hove Albion's Centre Of Excellence at age 11. He made his debut for the club during the 1992–93 season and made seven Division Two appearances. He signed his first professional contract in April 1993. He gradually broke through into the first team, making 13 league appearances during the 1993–94 season and 27 in 1994–95, scoring his first two Brighton goals during the latter campaign. In the 1995–96 season, Myall made 33 league appearances and scored two goals. He was released by manager Jimmy Case at the end of the season, after the club's relegation to Division Three was confirmed. During his time at the Goldstone Ground, Myall made 93 appearances and scored four goals. In 2002, Myall recalled that he \"had a great time at Brighton. It was what I always wanted to do and I was at the Albion from a very young age. I had a really fantastic time and I was disappointed when I was released in 1996 because I had played quite a few games for the club. But we got relegated and Jimmy Case wanted to bring in his own players\".\n\nMyall signed a two-year contract with Division Two side Brentford on a free transfer during the summer of 1996. He failed to make even the substitutes' bench during the 1996–97 season under manager David Webb and instead turned out for the club's reserve side, scoring six goals in 20 appearances. Under new manager Eddie May for the 1997–98 season, Myall had to wait until 1 November 1997 to make his debut, with a starting appearance in a 0–0 draw at Bournemouth. Myall started the following game against Carlisle United, but was substituted at half time for Ryan Denys in a 1–0 defeat. Following May's sacking and the appointment of Micky Adams, Myall was an unused substitute for a 4–1 defeat to Bristol City on 8 November. Myall never featured in a first team squad again and departed the club in January 1998, having negotiated a settlement on his contract.\n\nMyall signed for Southern League Premier Division side Hastings Town prior to the start of the 1998–99 season, having previously had a spell on loan at the club during the 1996–97 season. The club resigned from the Southern League in 1999 after a fifth-place finish, but were reinstated to the Southern League Division One East for the 1999–00 season. Myall won the first silverware of his career during the 2001–02 season, helping Hastings to the Southern League Division One East title. Myall suffered an injury hit 2002–03 season, being sidelined with a persistent knee injury and his woes were compounded by the club (now renamed Hastings United) being relegated straight back to the Southern League Division One East. He made 13 appearances and scored three goals during the 2002–03 season. Myall left Hastings in February 2004 after making 18 appearances and scoring four goals during the 2003–04 season. Myall made over 250 appearances during his time with the Arrows.\n\nMyall signed for Southern League Premier Division side Eastbourne Borough in February 2004 and made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Merthyr Tydfil. He made eight appearances in what remained of the 2003–04 season. Despite an 11th-place finish, Eastbourne were elevated to the new Conference South for the 2004–05 season, though Myall would depart the club in February 2005. He made only 9 appearances during the 2004–05 season.\n\nMyall transferred to Isthmian League Premier Division side Folkestone Invicta on 12 February 2005. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Yeading on 19 March, starting the match and playing the full 90 minutes. Myall scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 victory over Slough Town on 21 April. He made 9 appearances and scored one goal during what remained of the 2004–05 season. Myall scored his first goal of the 2005–06 season on 17 September 2005, putting Folkestone 1–0 up in a league match versus Hampton & Richmond Borough, before the Seasiders conceded three second half goals to lose 3–1. He scored his second goal of the season with the winner over AFC Wimbledon on 7 January 2006. Myall was a virtual ever-present during the 2005–06 season and made 41 appearances, scoring three goals. Myall also played a part in the Seasiders' run to the first round proper of the 2005–06 FA Cup, which ended in a 2–1 defeat to League Two side Chester City. Myall made six appearances during the early part of the 2006–07 season, before leaving the club in September. He made 56 appearances and scored four goals during his time with the Seasiders.\n\nMyall signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Horsham in September 2006. He made his debut in a 3–1 win over Leyton on 23 September. He scored his first goal for the club with a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Margate on 27 March 2007. Myall made 31 appearances and scored one goal during the 2006–07 season. Myall was part of the club's historic run to the second round of the 2007–08 FA Cup, playing in the 4–1 first round win over Conference South side Maidenhead United and taking League One side Swansea City to a replay in the second round, which was lost 6–2 at the Liberty Stadium. Myall left Horsham at the end of the 2007–08 season, after making 33 appearances over the course of the campaign. He made 64 appearances and scored one goal during his time with the Hornets.\n\nMyall signed for Sussex County League Division Two side Eastbourne United Association in December 2012. He made his debut as a substitute in a 3–2 victory over Seaford Town on 8 December.\n\nMyall joined Kuala Lumpur Expat & Veterans League club KL International while resident in Malaysia. After moving to Hong Kong, he played for veterans' club Discovery Bay, finishing as champions of the Legal League in the 2014–15 season.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Myall spent time in the United States, coaching children in Atlanta and Chicago.\n\nDuring a Q&A for a Brentford matchday programme in September 1997, Myall revealed he supported Liverpool as a boy. Myall worked office jobs in the early 2000s, but was inspired to become a PE teacher and enrolled on a course at Brighton University in 2002, graduating with a PE degree in 2005. He worked as a Head of Department at a state school in Lambeth and later emigrated to Kuala Lumpur. Myall moved from Kuala Lumpur to take up the position of Head of Secondary Physical Education at the Discovery Bay International School in Hong Kong.

Assessments of teacher quality are currently used for policymaking, employment and tenure decisions, teacher evaluations, merit pay awards, and as data to inform the professional growth of teachers.\n\nTeacher qualifications include a range of variables affecting teacher quality, including: type of teaching certification, undergraduate major or minor, undergraduate institution, advanced degree(s) or certifications (such as certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards AND Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA)), type of preparation program (traditional or alternate route), test scores (various subject matter, licensure, or verbal skills tests), and years of teaching experience. In many countries, teaching credentials represent the main measure of teacher quality. In the United States, one goal of the No Child Left Behind law is to ensure that all teachers meet state-defined standards of highly qualified teachers. Demographic characteristics such as a teacher's gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background may also be characterized as elements of teacher quality as variables impacting student outcomes. These indicators of teacher quality are relatively straightforward to ascertain, as opposed to the student achievement and teacher observation measures described below.\n\nTeacher quality with regard to student achievement—also known as \"teacher effectiveness\"—is measured in terms of student achievement gains. Most extant research on teacher quality pertains to observable attributes, preparation, and credentials (Goldhaber, 2002; McCaffrey et al.,2003; Neild and Ripple, 2008). Probably the most widely studied attributes are experience and education levels, in part because the data can be readily obtained because of their use in salary placement (Goldhaber, 2002). There is mixed evidence, however, that experience and education levels are associated with student learning (Goldhaber, 2002; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997, 2000; Hanushek, 1997; Wenglinsky,2002). Student achievement is measured through the use of standardized tests to determine the academic growth of students over time. Recently, a type of analysis of this growth termed \"value-added modeling,\" following the 1971 approach of Eric Hanushek.has sought to isolate the fraction of student achievement gains attributable to individual teachers, or in some cases groups of teachers.\n\nHowever, it has been argued that student achievement measures do not necessarily correlate entirely with teacher quality, given that there are various factors that influence a student's performance which are not under the control of a teacher.\n\nAssessments of teacher quality may also draw upon evidence collected from observations of teachers' work that lead to the empowering of effective teachers. This evidence may be collected from in-person or video recorded observations of teaching, pre- and post-observation conferences with teachers, and samples of teachers' work with students. Assessments of teacher practice may examine teacher quality for a single lesson or over an entire school year. Such assessments may be holistic or narrative in form, but in rubric-based systems of teacher assessment like the Framework for Teaching, and Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) have become increasingly more common in the United States in order to align with state and federal accountability requirements. Many school districts have developed their own rubrics for this purpose, such as the IMPACT system used in the District of Columbia public schools. Other practice-based assessments of teacher quality require teachers themselves to assemble evidence and self-assess their own indicators of teacher quality according to rubrics as part of the process. Examples include the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT) and its national successor the edTPA, the Oregon-based Teacher Work Sample. and the collection of assessments required by teachers seeking certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.\n\nThe way that most current teacher compensation systems are set up is to reward teachers with salary increases for every year of additional experience they gain. The research literature on the predictive power of teacher experience for student achievement gains, however, reveals modest effects of experience limited to the first few years of a teacher’s career. Research by Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005), Kane et al. (2006), and Rockoff (2004) suggests that teacher effectiveness grows in the initial four or five years in the classroom and then begins to level off.\n\nTeacher evaluation is a process used to measure teacher effectiveness based on students learning and success. Evaluations of teachers over the years have changed. In earlier years, teacher evaluations were based on personal characteristics of the teacher, however, starting in the early 1950s until the 1980s, teacher evaluations took a shift and started to focus on teachers' teaching, observed through students' outcomes. After the 1980s, teacher evaluations were measured based on increased professional development, accountability, and school improvement.\n\nTeacher evaluation has taken numerous approaches that observed teacher practices. Measures of Effective Teaching (MET), Danielson's Framework Model, Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), and the Value added Model (VAM) are all evaluation tools that aim to measure student achievement using teacher evaluation. MET evaluates teacher effectiveness through five measures: students' gains in standardized testing, recorded classroom sessions and teacher reflections afterwards, teachers' knowledge in the pedagogical content, students views of the classroom and instruction of the teacher, and the teachers own views on their working conditions and the support of the school.\n\nWhile the MET approach uses five measures to evaluate teacher effectiveness, the Danielson Framework model evaluates teachers using four domains: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. In this framework of evaluation, teachers are evaluated through a rubric that contains these four domains. They can either be ranked or measured as unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, or distinguished. In this rubric, teachers are being evaluated through critical attributes and examples when being observed.\n\nThe CLASS approach, by Robert Pianta, evaluates teachers based on their interaction with students. To do this, the CLASS model evaluates teachers' interactions using three domains: emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support. It should be noted that this approach is much more flexible, as the domains used within the approach vary based on students' grade levels.\n\nOn the other hand, the VAM approach uses students' test score gains to reflect teachers' effectiveness. Unlike the other approaches that evaluate particular characteristics or style of teaching for teacher evaluations, VAM does not directly evaluate the teacher. Although many of the approaches for teacher evaluations are debated, VAM is said to be inconsistent in its approach due to variation in classes, years, or test since its effectiveness measures are not based on teachers. However, it said that VAM measures are retroactively effective due to teacher practices that influence learning of students.\n\nFinally, an organisation in India called Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) uses two main steps in teacher certification and evaluation. The first step is an Objective Test which is based on the subject chosen, classroom practice, logical ability, communication etc. The second step is a Practical assessment which consists of an e-portfolio submission and a proctored assessment + interview. This evaluation and certification is based on CENTA standards that have been developed after several years of research and feedback.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1879 and became one of the most prestigious education institutions in Europe.\n\nThe university is known for its highly ranked engineering programmes, especially in mechanical engineering and engineering management. The university alumni and professor list include US National Academies members, two National Medal of Science laureates and ten Nobel Prize winners.\n\nThe TU Berlin is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology and of the Top Industrial Managers for Europe network, which allows for student exchanges between leading engineering schools. It belongs to the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research. The TU Berlin is home of two innovation centers designated by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.\n\nThe university is notable for having been the first to offer the now very popular course Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen (which the institute itself translates as Industrial Engineering and Management). The university had conceptualised the course as a response to demands by industrialists to offer a course that provides their offspring with the technical and management expertise to run a company. First offered in winter term 1926/27 it is the oldest and one of the most prestigious programmes of its kind.\n\nTU Berlin has one of the highest proportions of international students in Germany, almost 20% were enrolled in 2016.\n\nOn 1 April 1879, the \"Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg\" (\"TH Charlottenburg\") was formed by the governmental merger of the \"Berlin Building Academy\" (Bauakademie) and the \"Royal Trade Academy\" (\"Königliche Gewerbeakademie\"), two independent Prussian founding colleges established in 1799 and 1821 respectively.\n\nThe \"TH Charlottenburg\" (\"Royal Technical Higher School of Charlottenburg\") was named after the borough Charlottenburg where it is situated just outside Berlin. In 1899, the \"TH Charlottenburg\" was the first polytechnic in Germany to award doctorates, as a standard degree for the graduates, in addition to diplomas, thanks to professor Alois Riedler and Adolf Slaby, chairman of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) and the Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies (VDE).\n\nIn 1916 the long-standing \"Bergakademie Berlin\", the Prussian mining academy created by the geologist Carl Abraham Gerhard in 1770 at the behest of King Frederick the Great, was assimilated into the \"TH Charlottenburg\". Beforehand, the mining college had been, however, for several decades under the auspices of the \"Frederick William University\" (now Humboldt University of Berlin), before it was spun out again in 1860.\n\nAfter Charlottenburg's absorption into Greater Berlin in 1920 and Germany being turned into Weimar Republic, the \"TH Charlottenburg\" was renamed \"Technische Hochschule of Berlin\" (\"TH Berlin\"). In 1927, the Department of Geodesy of the \"Agricultural College of Berlin\" was incorporated into the \"TH Berlin\". During the 1930s, the redevelopment and expansion of the campus along the \"East-West axis\" were part of the Nazi plans of a \"Welthauptstadt Germania\", including a new faculty of defense technology under General Karl Becker, built as a part of the greater academic town (\"Hochschulstadt\") in the adjacent west-wise Grunewald forest. The shell construction remained unfinished after the outbreak of World War II and after Becker's suicide in 1940, it is today covered by the large-scale Teufelsberg dumping.\n\nThe north section of the main building of the university was destroyed during a bombing raid in November 1943. Due to the street fighting at the end of the Second World War, the operations at the \"TH Berlin\" were suspended as of April, 20th 1945. Planning for the re-opening of the school began on June, 2nd 1945, once the acting rectorship led by Gustav Ludwig Hertz and Max Volmer was appointed. As both Hertz and Volmer remained in exile in the Soviet Union for some time to come, the college was not re-inaugurated until April, 9th 1946, now bearing the name of \"Technische Universität Berlin\".\n\nSince 2009 the TU Berlin houses two Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KIC) designated by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.\n\nThe TU Berlin covers 604,000 m², distributed over various locations in Berlin.\nThe main campus is located in the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The seven schools of the university have some 33,933 students enrolled in 90 subjects (October, 2015).\n\nEl Gouna campus:\nTechnische Universität Berlin has established a satellite campus in Egypt to act as a scientific and academic field office. The nonprofit public-private partnership (PPP) aims to offer services provided by Technische Universität Berlin at the campus in El Gouna on the Red Sea.\n\nThe university also has a franchise of its Global Production Engineering course - called Global Production Engineering and Management at the Vietnamese-German University in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nSince 4 April 2005, the TU Berlin has consisted of the following faculties and institutes:\n\nEight-thousand four hundred fifty five people work at the university: 338 professors, 2,598 postgraduate researchers, and 2,131 personnel work in administration, the workshops, the library and the central facilities. In addition there are 2,651 student assistants and 126 trainees (2015).\n\nInternational student mobility is applicable through ERASMUS programme or through Top Industrial Managers for Europe (TIME) network.\n\nThe new common main library of Technische Universität Berlin and of the Berlin University of the Arts was opened in 2004 and holds about 2.9 million volumes (2007). The library building was sponsored partially (estimated 10% of the building costs) by Volkswagen and is named officially \"University Library of the TU Berlin and UdK (in the Volkswagen building)\". A source of confusion to many, the letters above the main entrance only state \"Volkswagen Bibliothek\" (German for \"Volkswagen Library\") – without any mentioning of the universities.\n\nSome of the former 17 libraries of Technische Universität Berlin and of the nearby University of the Arts were merged into the new library, but several departments still retain libraries of their own. In particular, the school of 'Economics and Management' maintains a library with 340,000 volumes in the university's main building (\"Die Bibliothek – Wirtschaft & Management\"/″The Library″ – Economics and Management) and the 'Department of Mathematics' maintains a library with 60,000 volumes in the Mathematics building (\"Mathematische Fachbibliothek\"/\"Mathematics Library\").\n\n\nIn the 2017 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, globally the TU Berlin ranks 82nd overall (7th in Germany), 40th in the field of Engineering & Technology (3rd in Germany) and 36th in Computer science discipline (4th in Germany), making it one of the top 100 universities worldwide in all three measures.\n\nAs of 2016, TU Berlin is ranked 164th overall and 35th in the field of Engineering & Technology according to the British QS World University Rankings. It is one of Germany's highest ranked universities in statistics and operations research and in Mathematics according to QS.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for founding Project 10, an educational support and drop-out prevention program for LGBT youth.\n\nUribe was born in Los Angeles, and lived her entire life in Pasadena, California. She grew up in an Italian family, living with parents and her grandparents in the same household. She went to Catholic school throughout elementary school, high school, and college.\n\nHer grandparents were immigrants and \"intensely\" patriotic and believed the United States to be a land of opportunity. Their sense of fairness, working class sensibilities, and liberal ideals shaped her world view. Uribe felt that her family was supportive of her throughout her childhood, which gave her the mindset and strength needed to advocate for youth.\n\nUribe, while attracted to both men and women, felt her deepest attractions towards women. During her time as a student, she found herself sexually attracted to nuns at the Catholic schools she attended. While these desires remained mostly hidden, Uribe believed that some of the other female Catholic students had similar desires towards nuns, based on their behavior while in their presence. She eventually married a man, but the marriage ultimately ended in divorce.\n\nOccupational choices for women were limited in her youth, so Uribe felt she needed to choose among social work, nursing, and teaching. She chose education. During her job as a science teacher and counselor at Fairfax High School, Uribe became interested in youth LGBT outreach. She decided to form the program after hearing the concerns of a student who had been kicked out of his family's home and dropped out of four high schools due to being sexually harassed. She founded Project 10 in 1984, as a drop-out prevention program for students who were LGBT.\n\nUribe founded Project 10 in 1984 to help schools curtail harassment of homosexual students, therefore reducing the LGBT dropout rate. Project 10, Los Angeles Unified School District program, provides support services and education for gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, and questioning students. Project 10's main goal is to establish voluntary, confidential, peer support groups led by trained facilitators. The support groups provide a safe environment for discussing the coming out process, family relationships, harassment, and health.\n\nThe organization also works to educate young people, educators, and parents on important issues such as HIV/AIDS, STDs, teenage pregnancy prevention, and substance abuse. Services are provided to elementary and secondary advisers and district staff for at-risk youth. According to the organization's mission statement, \"[Project 10] works to assure that public schools are in compliance with state and federal laws regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, and that academic achievement should not be limited by being part of a marginalized social group.\"\n\nProject 10 received backlash from conservative politician Marian La Follette in March 1988, who led the GOP caucus in voting to withhold new funds from the Los Angeles Unified School District until it stopped supporting the program. Despite this, then District Supt. Leonard Britton and school board members voiced strong support for Uribe, the program, and homosexual students. On September 24, 1990 a session to teach some San Diego Unified School District staffers how to help students with the \"curiosity, depression and fear that can surround homosexuality\" drew a crowd outside of about 25 people, many of whom protested the program.\n\nUribe has received recognition for her work from the California State Assembly and State Senate, the Mayor’s office of the City of Los Angeles, National Education Association, the LA Gay & Lesbian Center, GLADD, the Stonewall Scholarship Committee of United Teachers Los Angeles, 1999 Liberty Award from Lambda Legal Defense, Southern California Women for Understanding, the LA Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, the City of West Hollywood, Long Beach Pride, the LA County Human Relations Commission, the Los Angeles Unified School District, Vox Femina LA.\n"}
