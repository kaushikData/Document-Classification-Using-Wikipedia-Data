Iyengar\n\nBellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar (14 December 1918 – 20 August 2014), better known as B.K.S. Iyengar, was the founder of the style of yoga known as \"Iyengar Yoga\" and was considered one of the foremost yoga teachers in the world. He was the author of many books on yoga practice and philosophy including \"Light on Yoga\", \"Light on Pranayama\", \"Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\", and \"Light on Life\". Iyengar was one of the earliest students of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who is often referred to as \"the father of modern yoga\". He has been credited with popularizing yoga, first in India and then around the world.\n\nThe Indian government awarded Iyengar the Padma Shri in 1991, the Padma Bhushan in 2002 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2014. In 2004, Iyengar was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by \"Time\" magazine.\n\nB.K.S. Iyengar was born into a poor Sri Vaishnava Iyengar family in Bellur, Kolar district, Karnataka, India. He was the 11th of 13 children (10 of whom survived) born to Sri Krishnamachar, a school teacher, and Sheshamma. When Iyengar was five years old, his family moved to Bangalore. Four years later, the 9-year-old boy lost his father, who died of appendicitis.\n\nIyengar's home town, Bellur, was in the grip of the influenza pandemic at the time of his birth, and an attack of that disease left the young boy sickly and weak for many years. Throughout his childhood, he struggled with malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and general malnutrition. \"My arms were thin, my legs were spindly, and my stomach protruded in an ungainly manner,\" he wrote. \"My head used to hang down, and I had to lift it with great effort.\"\n\nIn 1934, his brother-in-law, the yogi Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, asked the 15-year-old Iyengar to come to Mysore, so as to improve his health through yoga practice. There, Iyengar learned asana practice, which steadily improved his health. Krishnamacharya had Iyengar and other students give yoga demonstration in the Maharaja's court at Mysore, which had a positive influence on Iyengar. Iyengar considers his association with his brother-in-law a turning point in his life saying that over a two-year period \"he (Krishnamacharya) only taught me for about ten or fifteen days, but those few days determined what I have become today!\" K. Pattabhi Jois has claimed that he, and not Krishnamacharya, was Iyengar's guru. In 1937, Krishnamacharya sent Iyengar to Pune at the age of eighteen to spread the teaching of yoga.\n\nThough Iyengar had very high regard for Krishnamacharya, and occasionally turned to him for advice, he had a troubled relationship with his guru during his tutelage. In the beginning, Krishnamacharya predicted that the stiff, sickly teenager would not be successful at yoga. He was neglected and tasked with household chores. Only when Krishnamacharya's favorite pupil at the time, Keshavamurthy, left one day did serious training start. Krishnamacharya began teaching a series of difficult postures, sometimes telling him to not eat until he mastered a certain posture. These experiences would later inform the way he taught his students.\n\nWith the encouragement of Krishnamacharya, Iyengar, aged 18, moved to Pune in 1937 to teach yoga. He spent many hours each day learning and experimenting with various techniques.\n\nHe taught yoga to several noted personalities including Jiddu Krishnamurti, Jayaprakash Narayan, and Yehudi Menuhin. He taught sirsasana (head stand) to Elisabeth, Queen of Belgium when she was 80.\n\nAmong his other devotees were the novelist Aldous Huxley, the actress Annette Bening, the film maker Mira Nair and the designer Donna Karan, as well as prominent Indian figures, including the cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and the Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor.\n\nIn 1952, Iyengar befriended the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Menuhin gave him the break that transformed Iyengar from a comparatively obscure Indian yoga teacher into an international guru. Because Iyengar had taught the famous philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, he was asked to go to Bombay to meet Menuhin, who was known to be interested in yoga. Menuhin said he was very tired and could spare only five minutes. Iyengar told him to lie down in Savasana (lying on his back), and he fell asleep. After one hour, Menuhin awoke refreshed and spent another two hours with Iyengar. Menuhin came to believe that practising yoga improved his playing, and in 1954 invited Iyengar to Switzerland. At the end of that visit, he presented his yoga teacher with a watch on the back of which was inscribed, \"To my best violin teacher, BKS Iyengar\". From then on Iyengar visited the west regularly, and schools teaching his system of yoga sprang up all over the world. There are now hundreds of Iyengar yoga centres.\n\nIyengar made his first visit to the United States in 1956, when he taught in Ann Arbor, Michigan and gave several lecture-demonstrations.\n\nIn 1966, Iyengar published his first book, \"Light on Yoga\". It became an international best-seller. , it has been translated into 17 languages and sold three million copies. \"Light on Yoga\" was followed by titles on pranayama and aspects of yoga philosophy. Iyengar authored 14 books. (See Bibliography.)\n\nIn 1975, Iyengar opened the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, in memory of his late wife. He officially retired from teaching in 1984, but continued to be active in the world of Iyengar Yoga, teaching special classes, giving lectures, and writing books. Iyengar's daughter, Geeta, and son, Prashant, have gained international acclaim as teachers.\n\nIn 2005, Iyengar visited the United States to promote his latest book, \"Light on Life\", and to teach a special workshop at the Yoga Journal conference in Estes Park, Colorado. 3 October 2005 was declared as \"B.K.S.Iyengar Day\" by San Francisco city's Board of Supervisors. Anthropologist Joseph S. Alter of the University of Pittsburgh stated that Iyengar \"has by far had the most profound impact on the global spread of yoga.\" In June 2011, he was presented with a commemorative stamp issued in his honour by the Beijing branch of China Post. There are now over thirty thousand Iyengar yoga students in 57 cities in China.\n\nThe noun \"Iyengar\" is defined by Oxford Dictionaries as \"a type of Hatha yoga focusing on the correct alignment of the body, making use of straps, wooden blocks, and other objects as aids in achieving the correct postures.\"\n\nOn 14 December 2015, what would have been Iyengar's 97th birthday, he was honoured with a Google Doodle. It was shown in India, North America, much of Europe, Russia, and Indonesia.\n\nIyengar reported in interviews that, at the age of 90, he continued to practice asanas for 3 hours and pranayamas for an hour daily. Besides this, he mentioned that he found himself performing non-deliberate pranayamas at other times.\n\nIyengar attracted his students by offering them just what they sought – which tended to be physical stamina and flexibility. He conducted demonstrations and later, when a scooter accident dislocated his spine, began exploring the use of props to help disabled people practice Yoga. He also drew inspiration from Hindu deities such as Yoga Narasimha and stories of yogis using trees to support their asanas.\n\nIn an interview, Iyengar said of Krishnamacharya’s endorsement of his teaching style:\n\nHe [Krishnamacharya] never taught me much about teaching, but he saw me teach. In 1961, he came to Pune and was teaching my daughter and son. He taught them for many hours, but unfortunately they could not get what he was trying to show them. When I came up and asked what was wrong, my daughter told me what she did not understand about a posture. So, I explained to her, \"You must stretch from this end to that end\". And immediately when Krishnamacharya saw this, he gave me a gold medal known as Yoga Shikshaka Chakravarti, which means \"Emperor of Yoga Teachers, Teacher of Teachers\". He said I must teach like this and not just in private, but in public.\n\nIn 1943, Iyengar married 16-year-old Ramamani in a marriage that was arranged by their parents in the usual Indian manner. He said of their marriage: \"We lived without conflict as if our two souls were one.\" Together, they raised five daughters and a son. Ramamani Iyengar died in 1973 aged 46. Later, Iyengar named his yoga institute, the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, after her.\n\nBoth Iyengar's eldest daughter Geeta (born in 1944) and his son Prashant have become internationally-known teachers in their own right. The other children of B.K.S. Iyengar are Vanita, Sunita, Suchita, and Savita. Geeta Iyengar is the author of \"Yoga: A Gem for Women\" (2002), and Prashant is the author of several books, including \"A Class after a Class: Yoga, an Integrated Science (1998)\", and \"Yoga and the New Millennium\" (2008). Geeta and Prashant co-direct the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI) in Pune. Iyengar's granddaughter, Abhijata Sridhar Iyengar, trained for a number of years under his tutelage, and is now a teacher both at the Institute in Pune and internationally.\n\nIyengar supported nature conservation, stating that it is important to conserve all animals and birds. He donated Rs. 2 million to Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysore, thought to be the largest donation by an individual to any zoo in India. He also adopted a tiger and a cub in memory of his wife, who died in 1973.\n\nIyengar helped promote awareness of multiple sclerosis with the Pune unit of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India.\n\nIyengar's most important charitable project involved donations to his ancestral village of Bellur, in the Kolar district of Karnataka. Through a trust fund that he established, he led a transformation of the village, supporting a number of charitable activities there. He built a hospital, India's first temple dedicated to Sage Patanjali, a free school that supplies uniforms, books, and a hot lunch to the children of Bellur and the surrounding villages, a secondary school, and a college.\n\nIyengar died on 20 August 2014 in Pune, India from heart failure and renal failure, aged 95. He was cremated on the same day at Vaikunth Crematorium near his home.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27109264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27109264", "title": "Co-cultural communication theory", "text": "Co-cultural communication theory\n\nCo-cultural communication theory was built upon the frameworks of muted group theory and standpoint theory. The cornerstone of co-cultural communication theory is muted group theory as proposed in the mid 1970s by Shirley and Edwin Ardener. The Ardeners were cultural anthropologists who made the observation that most other cultural anthropologists practicing ethnography in the field were talking only to the leaders of the cultures, who were by and large adult males. The researchers would then use this data to represent the culture as a whole, leaving out the perspectives of women, children and other groups made voiceless by the cultural hierarchy (S. Ardener, 1975). The Ardeners maintained that groups which function at the top of the society hierarchy determine to a great extent the dominant communication system of the entire society (E. Ardener, 1978). Ardener's 1975 muted group theory also posited that dominant group members formulate a \"communication system that support their perception of the world and conceptualized it as \"the\" appropriate language for the rest of society\".\n\nCommunication faculty Stanback and Pearce (1981) referred to these non-dominant groups as \"subordinate social groups\". They noted 4 ways in which the non-dominant groups tend to communicate with the dominant groups. They also asserted that \"From the perspective of the dominant group, the behaviors in each form of communication are appropriate. However, the meaning of these behaviors to the members of the lower-statused group are quite different, making them different forms of communication with different implications for the relations among the groups\".\n\nIn the study of communication, Stanback and Pearce as well as Kramarae used muted group theory to help explain communication patterns and social representation of non-dominant cultural groups Kramarae (1981) believed that \"those experiences unique to subordinate group members often cannot be effectively expressed within the confinements of the dominant communication system\". She suggested that people within these groups create alternative forms of communication to articulate their experiences. Although, Kramarae used muted group theory to communications strategies of women she suggested that the framework can be applied with equal validity to a number of dominant/non-dominant relationships (Orbe, 1996).\n\nKramarae (1981) presented three assumptions of muted group theory as applied to communication between men and women concluding that women traditionally have been muted by a male-dominated communications system. Additionally, Kramarae proposed seven hypotheses originating in muted group theory.\nStandpoint theory was mainly used as a feminist theoretical framework to explore experiences of women as they participate in and oppose their own subordination, however, (Smith, 1987) suggested that the theory had applications for other subordinate groups. A basic tenet of standpoint theory is that it \"seeks to include the experiences of subordinate groups within the process of research inquiry in meaningful ways\". In other words, the members of the underrepresented groups become co-researchers.\n\nThe theory of co-cultural communication was introduced in 1996 by Mark Orbe, professor in the School of Communication at Western Michigan University, when he found previously used names for the groups under consideration to have negative connotations. He cites previous studies which looked at the communication styles of different co-cultural groups which were referred to by a variety of terms. Orbe was the first to refer to this type of work as \"co-cultural communication theory\". Orbe states, \"in the past researchers have used a variety of terms to describe co-cultural communication: \"intracultural\" (Sitaram and Cogdell, 1976); \"subordinate\", \"inferior\", \"minority\" (Stanban and Pearce, 1981); \"sub-cultural\" (Pearson & Nelson, 1991); (Folb, 1994); and \"muted group\" (Kramarae, 1981).\"\n\nOrbe combined the frameworks of muted group theory with that of standpoint theory to arrive at five fundamental concepts which describe co-cultural theory. Orbe states, \"co-cultural theory seeks to uncover the commonalities among co-cultural group members as they function in dominant society while substantiating the vast diversity of experiences between and among groups.\"\n\nSince the introduction of co-cultural theory in \"Laying the foundation for co-cultural communication theory: An inductive approach to studying \"non-dominant\" communication strategies and the factors that influence them\" (1996), Orbe has published two works describing the theory and its use as well as several studies on communication patterns and strategies based on different co-cultural groups.\n\nIn Orbe's \"A Co-cultural communication approach to intergroup relations\" (1997), he provides an overview of co-cultural theory, including an explanation of the process by which co-cultural group members strategically select different communications styles.\n\nOrbe (1998a) \"Constructing co-cultural theory: an explication of culture, power, and communication\", presents the theoretical framework for co-cultural theory including the development of the theory, clarification of the co-cultural communication process, and limitations and future directions for its use. Orbe (1998b) \"From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model\", in which he designated 9 co-cultural orientations based on the intersections of three communication approaches: Non-assertive, Assertive, and Aggressive with 3 preferred outcomes: Separation, Accommodation and Assimilation.\n\nIn 2000, Orbe and C. M. Greer presented a paper: \"Recognizing the diversity of lived experience: The utility of co-cultural theory in communication and disabilities research\" at the annual meeting of the Central States Communication Association, in Detroit. In 2001, Heuman presented \"Multiracial/ethnic identity: A co-cultural approach\" during the annual meeting of the Central States Communication Association in Cincinnati. During the same meeting Dixon presented \"Naming issues in the future of intercultural communication research: The contributions of Mark Orbe's co-cultural theory\".\n\nOrbe (2004) used co-cultural theory as a foundation to explore the processes by which public dialogue can be facilitated across cultural boundaries. Orbe and Spellers (2005) reflected in this book chapter on the origins of co-cultural theory from the perspectives of their different areas of research as well as point to implications for future work.\n\nOrbe & Lapinski (2007) published the design of a self-report measure of the two components of co-cultural theory, preferred outcome and communication approach, and provides evidence from two studies for the construct validity and reliability of the co-cultural theory scales (C-CTS).\n\nRamirez-Sanchez (2008) examines the possibility of applying co-cultural theory to co-cultural groups that are marginalized in a larger co-cultural context and to \"offer a complex cultural context to which co-cultural theory can be applied and generate questions that could serve to enrich the analytical scope of co-cultural theory and its implications\".\n\nIn 2010, Camara and Orbe published the article \"Analyzing Strategic Responses to Discriminatory Acts: A Co-Cultural Communicative Investigation\" in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication. Two authors utilized Orbe's (1998) co-cultural theory model of the 9 communication orientations and 26 communication practices to identify how co-cultural group members response to the acts of discrimination. Two authors used qualitative content analysis to code the participants’ stories. The paper also oriented the directions of future research.\n\nIn 2012, Jungmi Jun, an assistant professor of Department of Communication at Wayne State University, published her article \"Why Are Asian Americans Silent? Asian Americans' Negotiation Strategies for Communicative Discriminations\" in the \"Journal of International and Intercultural Communication\". The author utilized Orbe's co-cultural theory model to explore two questions. One is what types of racially discriminatory messages target Asian Americans; another one is what communicative approaches do Asian Americans apply to negotiate those messages. The paper used content analysis to code 176 stories gained through an online survey. The research found that Asian Americans tend to use nonassertive approaches to respond to racially discriminatory messages due to internal/environmental factors including emotional shock and humiliation, a lack of knowledge of proper responses, peer pressure, and strategic intent.\n\n\n"}

Many recent examples are \"backronyms\" (acronyms made up to explain a term), as in \"snob\", and \"posh\" for \"port outward, starboard homeward\"; many other sourced examples are listed in the article on backronyms.\n\nErroneous etymologies can exist for many reasons. Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false. For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances. The results of medieval etymology, for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have often been rejected by modern linguists. The etymologies of humanist scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have also been superseded.\n\nOther false etymologies are the result of specious and untrustworthy claims made by individuals, such as the unfounded claims made by Daniel Cassidy that hundreds of common English words such as \"baloney\", \"grumble\", and \"bunkum\" derive from the Irish language.\n\nSome etymologies are part of urban legends, and seem to respond to a general taste for the surprising, counter-intuitive and even scandalous. One common example has to do with the phrase \"rule of thumb\", meaning \"a rough guideline\". An urban legend has it that the phrase refers to an old English law under which a man could legally beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.\n\nIn the United States, some of these scandalous legends have had to do with racism and slavery; common words such as \"picnic\", \"buck\", and \"crowbar\" have been alleged to stem from derogatory terms or racist practices. The \"discovery\" of these alleged etymologies is often believed by those who circulate them to draw attention to racist attitudes embedded in ordinary discourse. On one occasion, the use of the word \"niggardly\" led to the resignation of a US public official because it sounded similar to the unrelated word \"nigger\".\n\nGhil'ad Zuckermann proposes a clear-cut distinction between Derivational-Only Popular Etymology (DOPE) and Generative Popular Etymology (GPE):\n\n\n"}

He is a co-founder and former executive director of the non-profit Central Asia Institute and the founder of the educational charity Pennies for Peace.\n\nMortenson is the co-author of The New York Times Bestseller, \"Three Cups of Tea\", which stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 220 weeks. \"Three Cups of Tea\" has been published in 47 languages. Mortenson is also the author of \"Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan\".\n\nMortenson was accused of financial irregularities in handling donations to the CAI and falsehoods in his books. In 2012, Mortenson repaid $1 million to the CAI after an inquiry by the Montana Attorney General, though no criminality was found.\n\nMortenson was born in 1957 in St. Cloud, Minnesota. His parents, Irvin and Jerene, went with the Lutheran Church to Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in 1958 to be teachers in at a girls' school in the Usambara mountains. In 1961, Dempsey became a fundraiser and development director for the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, the first teaching hospital in Tanzania. Jerene was the founding principal of International School Moshi. Spending his early childhood and adolescence in Tanzania, Mortenson learned to speak fluent Swahili.\n\nIn the early 1970s, when he was 15 years old, Mortenson and his family left Tanzania and moved back to Minnesota. He attended Ramsey High School in Roseville, Minnesota, from 1973–75, where he graduated.\n\nAfter high school, Mortenson served in the U.S. Army in Germany from 1975–77 and was awarded the Army Commendation Medal. Following his discharge, he attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, from 1977-79 on an athletic (football) scholarship.\n\nIn 1978, Concordia College's football team won the NAIA Division III national championship with a 7-0 win over Findlay, Ohio. Mortenson graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in liberal studies and an associate degree in nursing.\n\nMortenson describes the origins of his humanitarian work in his best-selling (but later discredited) book, \"Three Cups of Tea\". He states he traveled to northern Pakistan in 1993 to climb the world's second-highest mountain, K2, as a memorial to his sister, Christa. After more than 70 days on the mountain located in the Karakoram range, Mortenson failed to reach the summit. Earlier, Mortenson and fellow climber, Scott Darsney, were also involved in a 75-hour life-saving rescue of another climber, Etienne Fine, which put them in a weakened state. After the rescue, he descended the mountain and set out with a local Balti porter, Mouzafer Ali, to the nearest city.\n\nAccording to the now-discredited account in \"Three Cups of Tea\", Mortenson stated he took a wrong turn on the trail and ended up in the small village of Korphe. Physically exhausted, ill, and alone at the time of his arrival there, Mortenson was cared for by some of Korphe's residents while he recovered. As a gesture of gratitude to the community for their assistance to him, Mortenson said he would build a school for the village after he noticed local students attending school in an outdoor location and writing out their lessons in the dirt.\n\nMortenson has since admitted in a 2011 interview that the timing in the Korphe account in \"Three Cups of Tea\" is inaccurate, and that the events actually took place long after his descent from K2, over a longer period of time and during separate trips.\n\nMortenson has written and spoken widely about the importance of education and literacy for girls worldwide. He has further stated that girls' education is the most important investment all countries can make to create stability, bring socio-economic reform, decrease infant mortality and population explosion, as well as improving health, hygiene, and sanitation standards. His view is that \"fighting terrorism\" perpetuates a cycle of violence where there should instead be a global priority to \"promote peace\" through education and literacy, with an emphasis on educating girls.\n\n\"Three Cups of Tea\" describes his travels in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province including his escape from a 2003 firefight between Afghan opium warlords, how he was subject to two \"fatwās\" by conservative Islamist clerics for educating girls, and receiving hate mail and threats from fellow Americans for helping educate Muslim children.\n\nAccording to op-ed columnist and friend of Mortenson's, Nicholas D. Kristof, the schools built by CAI have local support and have been able to avoid retribution by the Taliban and other groups opposed to girls' education because of community \"buy-in\", which involves getting villages to donate land, subsidized or free labor (\"sweat equity\"), wood and resources.\n\nAs of 2014, CAI reports it has established or significantly supported over 300 projects, including 191 schools, in rural and often volatile regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.\n\nAfter experiencing frustration in his efforts to raise money for the school, Mortenson convinced Silicon Valley computer pioneer Jean Hoerni to fund the building of the Korphe school.\n\nHoerni, who was critically ill at the time, formed the Central Asia Institute so that he and others could make tax-exempt donations to support Mortenson's work, and Mortenson became its first executive director. The mission of the non-profit organization is to promote education and literacy, especially for girls, in remote mountain regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2011, Greg Mortenson promoted his book as well as fundraising and promoting girls' education through public speaking events at schools throughout the United States. Travel expenses for his speaking engagements were paid for by Central Asia Institute through the end of 2010. Mortenson personally kept the money received in exchange for his service as a public speaker as well as royalties from the sale of his book. In 2009, the total cost of his book promotion, fundraising, and awareness-building for girls education paid for by CAI amounted to $4.6 million.\n\nIn April 2012, after a year long investigation by the Montana attorney general, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to the CAI. The Montana inquiry had found that he had misspent over $6 million of the organization's money, although no criminality was found. Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock said: \"Mr Mortenson may not have intentionally deceived the board or his employees, but his disregard for and attitude about basic record-keeping and accounting for his activities essentially had the same effect.\"\n\nBullock also wrote in the report that \"CAI's mission is worthwhile and important,\" and \"Its accomplishments, driven by the vision and dedication of Mortenson, are significant – as even their harshest critics acknowledge.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement agreement, Mortenson was required to resign as executive director and could no longer serve as a voting member of CAI's board. However, he was allowed to remain with CAI as an employee.\n\nMortenson and David Oliver Relin are co-authors of the \"New York Times\" bestselling book \"Three Cups of Tea\". \"Listen to the Wind\", a 32-page book Young Reader's version of \"Three Cups of Tea\" for ages 4–8, was written by Greg Mortenson and illustrated by Susan Roth. It was a \"New York Times\" bestseller for 97 weeks. As detailed in a \"New York Times\" article, Relin \"suffered emotionally and financially as basic facts in the book were called into question\" and ultimately committed suicide on November 15, 2012. In 2009, \"Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan\" was written by Greg Mortenson as a sequel to \"Three Cups of Tea\".\n\nMortenson has been criticized by writers such as Peter Hessler and Jon Krakauer for financial mismanagement of his charity, for \"dodging accountability\" and for writing a book Krakauer described as \"riddled with lies\".\n\nIn April 2011, \"60 Minutes\" and author Jon Krakauer accused Mortenson of fabrication in his non-fiction books and of financial improprieties at his charity, Central Asia Institute. After a one-year investigation, Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock did not file criminal charges. Bullock sought restitution for book royalties, speaking and travel fees, promotional costs, and inappropriate personal bills Mortenson charged to the CAI. Mortenson was ordered to reinstate $1 million to the charity, which included credits for repayments already made. In October 2013, Mortenson completed the repayments to CAI, fulfilling the terms of the 2012 settlement with Bullock.\n\nOn the April 17, 2011 broadcast of CBS News' \"60 Minutes\", correspondent Steve Kroft alleged inaccuracies in Mortenson's books \"Three Cups of Tea\" and its sequel, \"Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan\" as well as financial improprieties in the operation of the Central Asia Institute.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" made the following allegations:\n\n\n\"60 Minutes\" asked Mortenson for an interview prior to their broadcast. Mortenson did not respond to their requests; however, he answered their questions in writing. Mortenson refused to talk to Steve Kroft and, reportedly, the CAI staff requested that the hotel hosting the \"60 Minutes\" crew ask them to leave the facility. Mortenson also canceled the speaking engagement that was scheduled that afternoon in the Atlanta convention facility.\n\nIn an April 2011 \"Outside\" magazine interview, Greg Mortenson insisted that Krakauer contacted him only once and inaccurately claimed that he had been trying to get a hold of him for some time. He claimed although he arranged to meet with Krakauer, the interview was eventually cancelled \"once I realized how deep and dirty this whole thing was\".\n\nMortenson wrote a statement in response to the allegations against him that were published in the \"Bozeman Chronicle\": \"I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students\", and added, \"The time about our final days on K2 and ongoing journey to Korphe village and Skardu is a compressed version of events that took place in the fall of 1993...\" However, writing for \"Outside Online\", Grayson Schaffer investigated Mortenson's claims regarding Korphe, and found them likely spurious, as there was no plausible way for Mortenson to have ended up in Korphe while descending K2 in the route he claimed. Additionally, Schaffer concludes that there is no evidence that Mortenson was actually an accomplished Himalayan climber, even though he claimed to have climbed six Himalayan peaks.\n\nJon Krakauer, a former financial supporter of CAI, questioned Mortenson's accounts of his exploits independently and was interviewed for the \"60 Minutes\" segment mentioned above. The day after the broadcast, Krakauer released his own allegations in a lengthy online article, \"Three Cups of Deceit - How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way\". Krakauer explored financial improprieties at CAI in great detail, reporting that a former board treasurer had left the organization because \"Greg regards CAI as his personal ATM,\" routinely charged personal expenses to the organization, and rarely provided any receipts or documentation.\n\nIn response to Krakauer's allegations, CAI produced a comprehensive 'Master Project List' on work CAI had completed, or currently was then working on. The list was released in December 2011.\n\nIn January 2014, Mortenson was interviewed on \"Today\" by Tom Brokaw. He apologized and acknowledged that he had let a lot of people down, and said \"I failed in many ways, and it's an important lesson.\"\n\nIn August 2014 Krakauer wrote a follow-up article for The Daily Beast in which he stated that an audit of CAI's overseas projects indicated that the charity was still \"beset by widespread corruption\" and that Mortenson remaining as the public face of the charity was not \"in the best interest of the charity or the people it serves\". He concluded that \"anyone thinking about donating to CAI should probably reconsider\".\n\nIn May 2011, Jean Price and Michele Reinhart, and Dan Donovan, a Great Falls attorney, filed a class action lawsuit against Mortenson on behalf of readers, asking federal judge James Malloy in Missoula to place all proceeds from the purchases of Mortenson's books into a trust to be used for humanitarian purposes. Several named plaintiffs dropped the lawsuit after confessing they had never read the books. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in federal court in May 2012. U.S. District Judge Sam Haddon chided the plaintiffs for presenting arguments that he called imprecise, flimsy, and speculative. An appeals suit was dropped by the 9th District Federal Circuit Court on October 10, 2013.\n\nOn October 6, 2013, after a lengthy lawsuit filed by Central Asia Institute, Philadelphia Insurance company was ordered by Magistrate Judge Jeremy Lynch to repay Central Asia Institute $1.2 million to pay for legal costs involved in the lawsuits and investigations.\n\nIn May 2015, the Montana Attorney General stated that Central Asia Institute and Mortenson had completed the terms of a three-year compliance monitoring period, and CAI stated that the IRS had completed its examination of the nonprofit. The organization reported that it was having a return in donors and rise in contributions.\n\nJennifer Jordan (Mortenson's longtime friend) and Jeff Rhoads began attempting to refute the claims against Mortenson and made a 2016 documentary \"3000 Cups of Tea\". In the film and interviews Jordan claims that the extensively-researched and sourced accusations against Mortenson put forward by \"60 Minutes\" and Jon Krakauer are largely not true.\n\nJordan said in 2014: \"We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission.\" However, the \"documentary\" she and Rhoads produced consisted of little more than friends of Mortenson claiming that he was a good person who would never do the things the \"60 Minutes\"/Krakauer investigation uncovered.\n\n\n\n\nMortenson lives in Bozeman, Montana, with his wife Tara Bishop, a clinical psychologist, and their two children, Amira and Khyber. In 2011, Mortenson was diagnosed with hypoxia and had surgery for an aneurysm and an atrial septal defect, an event which exactly coincided with the airing of the \"60 Minutes\" expose and the release of Krakauer's accompanying book.\n\n"}

It does not enroll students and does not award any degrees. It was founded in 1597 under the will of Sir Thomas Gresham, and it hosts over 140 free public lectures every year. Since 2001, all lectures have also been made available online.\n\nSir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange, left his estate jointly to the City of London Corporation and to the Mercers' Company, which today support the college through the Joint Grand Gresham Committee under the presidency of the Lord Mayor of London. Gresham's will provided for the setting up of the College – in Gresham's mansion in Bishopsgate, on the site now occupied by Tower 42, the former NatWest Tower – and endowed it with the rental income from shops sited around the Royal Exchange, which Gresham had established.\n\nThe early success of the College led to the incorporation of the Royal Society in 1663, which pursued its activities at the College in Bishopsgate before moving to its own premises in Crane Court in 1710. The College remained in Gresham's mansion in Bishopsgate until 1768, and moved about London thereafter until the construction in 1842 of its own buildings in Gresham Street EC2. Gresham College did not become part of the University of London on the founding of the University in the 19th century, although a close association between the College and the University persisted for many years. Since 1991, the College has operated at Barnard’s Inn Hall, Holborn EC1.\n\nSince 2000, the college regularly welcomes visiting speakers who deliver lectures on topics outside its usual range, and it also hosts occasional seminars and conferences. Today the college provides in the region of 130 lectures a year, all of which are free and open to the public.\n\nAlthough many of the lectures are held in Barnard's Inn Hall, the majority are now held in the lecture hall at the Museum of London, for reasons of capacity.\n\nSince 2001, the college has been recording its lectures and releasing them online in what is now an archive of over 2,000 lectures. Since 2007, lectures have also been available through YouTube with 20,755,968 views .\n\nAnnual lectures series of particular note hosted by the college include: the Gresham Special Lecture, the Annual Lord Mayor's Event, and the Gray’s Inn Reading.\n\nThe College does not enroll any students and awards no degrees.\n\nThe seven original Gresham College Professorships that date back to the origins of the college are as follows:\n\n\nThese original endowed chairs reflect the curriculum of the medieval university (the trivium and quadrivium); but as a place for the public and frequent voicing of new ideas, the college played an important role in the Enlightenment and in the formation of the Royal Society. Early distinguished Gresham College professors included Christopher Wren, who lectured on astronomy in the 17th century and Robert Hooke, who was Professor of Geometry from 1665 until 1704.The professors received £50 a year, and the terms of their position were very precise, for example:\n\nToday three further Professorships have been added to take account of areas not otherwise covered by the original Professorships:\n\n\nThe professors currently hold their positions for three years, extendable for a fourth year, and give six lectures a year. There are also regular visiting professors appointed to give series of lectures at the College, and a large number of single-lecture speakers.\n\nThe Gresham Special Lecture originated in 1988 as a free public lecture delivered by a prominent speaker. It was devised as a focus-point among the other 126 free public lectures offered every year.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1949, his family moved out of Mainland of China to Taiwan. Yang earned a B.S. in civil engineering from National Taiwan University in 1962, and later moved to the U.S. to earn an M.S. in structural engineering from West Virginia University in 1965 and a Ph.D. in structural engineering from Cornell University in 1968.\n\nRegarded as an expert in aerospace structures, structural dynamics, transonic aeroelasticity, wind and earthquake structural engineering, intelligent manufacturing systems, and finite elements, Yang was on the staff of Purdue University for 25 years. He first joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1969, before being elevated to the head of the Purdue University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics which he served for five years from 1980 to 1984. Yang was named the dean of the Purdue University College of Engineering on July 1, 1984, a role he held for 10 years until his departure to UC Santa Barbara.\n\nYang is an eight-time winner of the Elmer F. Bruhn Award, which honors outstanding teachers at the Purdue University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He was named as the university's Neil A. Armstrong Distinguished Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a title bestowed on him from 1988 through 1994.\n\nAfter a seven-month search process by the University of California, Santa Barbara of over 150 applicants, Yang was named as the school's fifth chancellor in March 1994. He began his post on June 23, 1994.\n\nHe has authored or co-authored 170 articles for scientific journals, as well as a widely used textbook on finite element structural analysis. He has guided 54 Ph.D. and 20 M.S. recipients. In addition to his role as chancellor, he is also a professor of mechanical engineering at UC Santa Barbara, and continues to teach an undergraduate engineering course each year. He is currently supervising three Ph.D. students with support from National Science Foundation grants. He is also a co-principal investigator for the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program of the University of California.\n\nYang has served on scientific advisory boards for the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, NASA, and the National Academy of Engineering.

{"id": "39338454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39338454", "title": "Hopscotch (programming language)", "text": "Hopscotch (programming language)\n\nHopscotch is a visual programming language developed by Hopscotch Technologies, designed to allow young or beginner programmers to develop simple projects. Its simple UI allows its users to drag and drop blocks to create scripts of which can be played when activated. Although the language is easy to use, to develop more advanced pieces of code is almost impossible and requires more powerful languages. The use of the language is through an iPad or iPhone supporting Hopscotch. \n\nThe idea sprang from an already existing programming tool, Scratch, where the user drags blocks into scripts in succession to create a script. This is found much easier by children than typing out the code manually like other programming languages tend to use. Though the developers wanted to take a step back from Scratch and make it slightly easier to grasp the concepts and make Hopscotch easier to use, therefore removing many blocks and adding some of their own in hope to make it easier to use.\n\nHopscotch includes basic programming blocks and functionalities such as variables, sprites (called objects) and text objects, but also features considered more advanced such as self variables, math functions like sine, cosine, modulo, tangent, inversed tangent and more.\n\nThe app is updated frequently with more and more features. See \"Editor history\" below for a short summary of the app updates.\n\nThe Hopscotch app uses a UI very similar to that of Scratch. Use of the editor is simple, all one has to do is open the editor, tap the object and script you wish to edit, open one of the block tabs, and drag out code blocks. Most code blocks can have numeric, text, or math inputs. e.g. the \"move\" block. The editor work area is mainly based on a grid divided in X- and Y-coordinates.\n\nThe Hopscotch Editor is available on iPhone and iPad. The iPhone version only supported viewing projects until early 2016, when an update supporting editing and account functionality was released. The Hopscotch iPhone projects play in an iPhone format even in the iPad and web player.\n\nWhen inputs are the trigger for the script to activate, when a \"when\" block's input is true (the \"when project starts\" when block is triggered when one opens the player or taps the refresh button)\n\nlist of \"when\" blocks:play button is tappedcharacter is tappediPad (iPhone) is tapped() is tapped() is pressed() bumps ()() is touching ()iPad (iPhone) is tilted (up, down, left, right)iPad (iPhone) detects a loud noiseiPad is shaken() is swiped (up, down, left, right)() equals ()() > ()() < ()() != ()object is cloned(>,<,=,!=) (and, or) (>,<,=,!=)\n\nCode blocks are the actions completed when the blocks are triggered, code blocks fall into 6 categories: abilities, movement, drawing, looks & sounds, values, and control flow. \nDrag these into and out of the scripts to modify them. Movement blocks make the character move physically on the screen. Ability blocks let you make your own subprogram blocks to duplicate code in a Hopscotch project. Drawing blocks make an object draw stuff. There are 2 “draw” blocks, Draw a Trail and Clear. Draw a trail obviously draws a trail of selected color and width. There are HSB and RGB options for color. Width is determined by the amount of pixels in that trail (citation needed). Looks & sounds blocks are blocks which change the object’s looks (such as size, invisibility and color). Value blocks are blocks that set a value to a specific number or change a value by a specific number. Finally, control flow blocks are blocks that either repeat a code multiple or infinite times, or add a condition which will make the code inside it execute only if the condition is matched. There is 1 exception, the “Create a Clone” block creates a clone of the object. The clone will not execute any of the code programmed for the original object. That’s the job of the “When object is cloned” block.\n\nDrawing blocks in Hopscotch work similar to the turtle module in Python, allowing easy and more complex art to be coded.\n\nThe Hopscotch player activates the blocks in the scripts upon activation of their individual triggers.\n\nThe \"player\" is also available on the web (known as the \"Webplayer\"). The webplayer brings Hopscotchs projects to almost any browser. It is designed to work the same as the in-app player. Although, the webplayer does not have any functionality for coding, uploading or liking projects. The web version of a project is only accessible via it´s unique link that is formatted like this: <nowiki>https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/(project</nowiki> id)\n\nSupported languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish.\n\nHow to change languages in Hopscotch: iPad » Settings » General » Language & Region » iPad Language » (Select a Hopscotch-supported language).\n\n 2.

An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.\n\nThe USA based Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering Production Planning & Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.\n\nATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in\nthe United States.(2011)\n\n\"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management\".\n\nIndustrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of industrial engineering and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.\n\nTypical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on manufacturing process, technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, quality assurance and control, materials science, packaging, production and operations management, and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more vocational-style education in the form of courses on CNC manufacturing, welding, and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.\n\nIndustrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented. Since \"industrial technologist\" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.\n\nA technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes electronics, manufacturing, construction, graphics, automation/robotics, CADD, nanotechnology, aviation, etc.\n\nA major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:\nStudies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of business and economic growth (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In engineering, construction, textiles, food and drugs, chemicals and petroleum, and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.\n\nHow and When Technological development in industry Performed :\n"}

JSS competitions are sponsored by the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP), and administered by the Technology Student Association (TSA). Objectives of JSS are to create the fastest, most interesting, or best crafted vehicle. Skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are fostered when designing and constructing the vehicles, as well as principles of alternative fuels, engineering design, and aerodynamics.\n\nJunior Solar Sprint was created in the 1980s by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to teach younger children about the importance and challenges of using renewable energy. The project also teaches students how the engineering process is applied, and how solar panels, transmission, and aerodynamics can be used in practice.\n\nSince 2001, the AEOP has funded JSS events. TSA began hosting competitions in 2011, and it became a middle school-level event in 2014. In association with TSA, Pitsco Education has sold recommended materials for the project.\n\nSince Junior Solar Sprint became a TSA event, the rules for creating the vehicle have been defined in the TSA rulebook. At the conference, the total cost of creating each car must be less than US$50. The team must also document their process in a notebook.\n\nDuring the time trials section, each car is raced three times down a lane long, on a hard surface like a tennis court. To keep the vehicle pointed straight ahead, a guide wire is run across every lane attached by an eyelet. When the cars are racing, they must remain attached to the wire with no external control. During the race, no modifications are allowed, though anyone may watch.\n\nThe fastest time of the three trials is used for qualification to the semifinal round. In the next stage, a single- or double-elimination tournament, cars are raced against each other at the same time, until one of the 16 semifinalists is determined the fastest.\n\nJunior Solar Sprint competitions are held at the national-, state-, and some regional-level TSA conferences, as well as other AEOP-hosted locations. In the event that the site is overcast, and the solar panels won't work, two 1.5 volt AA batteries will be given to each team. Judges determine the three best vehicles for each category: speed, craftsmanship, and appearance.\n\nThe 2017 national TSA conference was held June 21–25, in Orlando, Florida, and many middle school students across the country traveled to compete with their vehicles. The team from Joan MacQueen Middle School in Alpine, California, won first place.\n\n"}

A speech synthesiser is also used to provide speech output.\n\nFor people who are unable to use a keyboard, some models of Lightwriter offer the option of an on-screen keyboard with selection made by a switch using a scanning technique.\n\nSome models of Lightwriter offer the facility to connect to a printer to provide printed output.\n\nWord prediction is included to make a significant reduction in the number of keystrokes.\n\nThe latest model of Lightwriter, the SL40, has a built-in mobile phone which provides text messaging and the option of voice telephony with the synthesised speech sent to the person on the other end and the incoming speech message being broadcast through the Lightwriter's loudspeaker.\n\nLightwriters are available in a wide range of European languages.\n\nLightwriters are text-to-speech devices and so require some degree of literacy.\n\nLightwriters are used by many people with acquired speech loss following laryngectomy, tracheostomy, stroke, head injury, or with progressive neurological diseases such as Motor Neurone Disease (also known as Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS), Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Huntington's Chorea.\n\nLightwriters are also used by people with congenital speech loss with conditions such as Cerebral Palsy after literacy has been gained.\n\nDiane Pretty was a British woman diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease who attempted to change British law so she could end her own life with the assistance of her husband without it being classed as assisted suicide, which is illegal in the United Kingdom.\nPretty went to the House of Lords and the European Court on Human Rights using her Lightwriter to argue her case, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn the 1998 film The Theory of Flight starring Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter, she used a Lightwriter while playing the part of a young woman with Motor Neurone Disease.\n\n\nIn 1969 Toby Churchill was working in France when he fell ill after swimming in a polluted lake. The doctors initially believed he had sunstroke and that the symptoms would soon pass, but became perplexed as he began to deteriorate rapidly and decided to get him back to England as quickly as possible for further treatment, and he was transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge where doctors could not decide whether the problem was neurological or vascular, and their diagnostic tools were limited since this was before the days of CT and MRI scanners which nowadays can look inside someone's body non-invasively.\n\nWithin a few days the only voluntary movement Toby had left was an eyeblink, all other physical movement and speech being frozen. He was then in a state of ‘locked-in syndrome’, where he was perfectly aware of everything that was said to him but unable to respond, a condition eloquently described by Jean-Dominique Bauby in his book \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\". Toby’s family and friends had to quickly learn new communication techniques: the use of ‘closed’ questions (ones to which only a “yes” or “no” reply is required - with 1 eyeblink for “yes” or 2 eyeblinks blinks for “no”), and using an alphabet board with auditory scanning “first row?, second row? etc” until Toby blinked to select that row, and the same for each letter across the row. It was a tedious process but all that was available at that time.\n\nGradually, some movement returned to his left hand and arm, and a little to his legs, so he was no longer bed-bound and after a few months was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospital (National Spinal Injury Unit) for further physiotherapy and rehabilitation and was there introduced to the early POSSUM Row/Column scanner. While this was less tiring for the communication partner, it was not portable and became unnecessarily slow after Toby had regained hand movement and the ability to type. Toby then quickly put his engineering skills into practice to design a portable communication aid - a typewriter which instead of typing on paper, typed the message on a display, and this was the logically named the Lightwriter. Toby had no plans at that time to make more than just for himself but, as he met other people in a similar position, realised that there was a demand for them and started to manufacture them for other people, founding the Company in 1973.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23889019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23889019", "title": "Monsieur Pierre", "text": "Monsieur Pierre\n\nMonsieur Pierre was the professional name of Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher-Margolle (born c. 1890, Toulon, France – died 1963, London). He was a professional dancer and dance teacher, largely responsible for introducing the Latin American dances to England, and for codifying them, and laying the groundwork for their use in competitions and in social dance. The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin and American competitions held under the World Dance Council (WDC).\n\nAs a young man, Pierre's engineering studies at Zurich University were abruptly halted when he was struck in the eye by a tennis ball. This accident resulted in the loss of sight in that eye. After this accident he went to live in Paris where his spare time was spent in the night clubs where Cuban and other Latin immigrants enjoyed their music and dances. He next worked in the French consular service in Liverpool, but was forced to resign when the eye strain began to affect the sighted eye. He moved to London, where he enjoyed ice skating and dancing. After World War I ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer. Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London, Pierre remained a French citizen for his entire life.\n\nThe rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars. Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style. In Latin dances, his repertoire first consisted of the Argentine tango, the Paso doble and the Samba.\n\nFor a number of years Pierre's studio was in or near Regent Street. Later, Doris Lavelle went to him to learn the tango. He quickly realised her potential and after training she became his next dance partner. They demonstrated as often as three nights a week at London restaurants, ballrooms and night clubs, of which there were many at that time. \n\nBy the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances, and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba. The studio stayed open all through World War II, and was a popular meeting place for the Free French fighters on leave in London.\n\nAfter the war, the studio was re-established at 15, Greek Street, Soho. A small studio on the top floor with a good maple floor, and a sound system installed by James Arnell, who later became International Latin American dance champion. \n\nThe ballroom rumba is so called despite the music, and the dance, being of a different genre from the authentic Cuban rumba. The rumba danced in America and Europe was, and is, a music of the \"son\" type: 'rumba' was a marketing term to cover several terms used by Cubans; salsa is a comparable case today.\n\nIn 1932, Monsieur and Madame Chapoul, well known French demonstrators, gave an exhibition of rumba at the \"Café de Paris\" in London, followed by Don Azpiazú and his band, the very group who had had such a hit with their recording of \"Peanut Vendor\". Pierre was present and later went to the \"Cabine Cubaine\" club in Paris to take a look at the dancers.\n\nOriginally, Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba. He discovered they used a system devised in the USA, the \"square rumba\", so called after its basic figure. By 1934 he was featuring the rumba in his demonstrations, his adverts, his classes and in magazine articles. \n\nFollowing the war, in 1947, Pierre visited Cuba, where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently. When he danced with Suzy of Pepe and Suzy Rivera, the then Cuban champions, according to Lavelle's diary, the first thing she said was \"you are out of time\". So he had a lesson every day and danced at the \"acadamias\" [sic] every night. After this period of study he returned to London determined to replace the square rumba with the Cuban rumba, \"el sistema cubano\".\n\nTo this end, Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the \"son\", and other similar rhythms, was, and still is, their method of taking three steps to four beats of music (whether 2/4 or 4/4). Whereas the Square rumba had been danced on beat 1, the Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2, counting (pause) 2, 3, 4-1 as (pause) quick, quick, slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1. All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. \n\nThe \"Latin and American section\" of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman, his partner Doris Lavelle, and their colleague, Doris Nichols. They were the first examiners, soon joined by Gwenethe Walshe and Dimitri Petrides. This small band of specialists worked to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. Walter Laird and Peggy Spencer, were other important members, among others, added a few years later. The syllabus which was finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the samba, paso doble and jive as well, but it was the composition of the rumba which was critical. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the cha cha cha was added to make the five Latin American dances that are still the basis of teaching and competition today in the international dance community.\n\nOn Monsieur Pierre's death in 1963, his colleague Doris Nichols commented:\n\"The Latin American dancing world was so influenced, fostered and built up by him that the names of 'Pierre' and 'Latin American' became virtually synonymous.\" \n\nMonsieur Pierre was a Fellow, Examiner and committee member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) and a Member of the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing (OBBD).\n\n\n \n"}

The tripos includes a wide range of Natural Sciences from physical sciences to biology which are taught alongside the history and philosophy of science. The tripos covers several courses which form the University of Cambridge system of Tripos. It is known for its broad range of study in the first year, in which students cannot study just one discipline, but instead must choose three courses in different areas of the natural sciences and one in mathematics. As is traditional at Cambridge, the degree awarded after Part II is a Bachelor of Arts (BA). A Master of Science degree (MSci) is available to those who take the optional Part III. It was started in the 19th Century.\n\nTeaching is carried out by 16 different departments. Subjects offered in Part IA in 2010 are Biology of Cells, Chemistry, Computer Science, Elementary Mathematics for Biologists, Evolution and Behaviour, Earth Sciences, Materials Science, Mathematics, Physics, Physiology of Organisms and Mathematical Biology; students must take three experimental subjects and mathematics. There are three options for the compulsory mathematics element in IA: \"Mathematics A\", \"Mathematics B\" and \"Mathematical Biology\".\n\nStudents specialize further in the second year (Part IB) of their Tripos, taking three subjects from a choice of twenty, and completely in their third year (Part II) in, for example, genetics or astrophysics, although general third year courses do exist – Biomedical and Biological Sciences for biologists and Physical Sciences for chemists, physicists, etc. Fourth year options (Part III) are available in a number of subjects, and usually have an entry requirement of obtaining a 2:1 or a First in second year Tripos Examinations, and is applied for before the commencement of the third year. As of 2008, options with an available Part III option are: Astrophysics; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Geological Sciences; Materials Science and Metallurgy; and Experimental and Theoretical Physics. the tripos is delivered by sixteen different departments including:\n\nThe University of Cambridge believes that their course's generalisation, rather than specialisation, gives their students an advantage. First, it allows students to experience subjects at university level before specialising. Second, many modern sciences exist at the boundaries of traditional disciplines, for example, applying methods from a different discipline. Third, this structure allows other scientific subjects, such as Computer sciences, Mathematics (traditionally a very strong subject at Cambridge), Medicine and the History and Philosophy of Science, to link with the Natural Sciences Tripos so that once, say, the two-year Part I of the Medical Sciences tripos has been completed, one can specialise in another biological science in Part II during one's third year, and still come out with a science degree specialised enough to move into postgraduate studies, such as a PhD.\n\nAs a result of this structure, the Natural Sciences Tripos has by far the greatest number of students of any Tripos. Undergraduates who are reading for the NST in order to gain their degrees are colloquially known in University slang as \"'NatSci\"s (pronounced \"Nat-Ski\"'s), being broadly nicknamed physical science ('phys') or biological science ('bio') NatScis, according to their course choices. (Of course, many students choose both physical and biological options in first year.) The split tends to be about 50:50 between the physical and biological sciences.\n\nIn 2007, 2112 students applied and 639 were admitted to the Natural Sciences Tripos.\n"}

In 1946, it was transformed into the Ministry of Education. Its first head was Anatoly Lunacharsky. However he described Krupskaya as the \"soul of Narkompros\". Mikhail Pokrovsky and Evgraf Litkens also played important roles.\nLunacharsky protected most of the avant-garde artists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Despite his efforts, the official policy after Joseph Stalin put him in disgrace.\n\nNarkompros had seventeen sections, in addition to the main ones related to general education, e.g.,\nSome of these evolved into separate entities, others discontinued.\n\nPavel Lebedev-Polianskii, as chair of the organizing bureau for the national Proletkult argued that Narkompros, as a state organ, had responsibilities for the whole of society, whereas Proletkult asserted its autonomy as an organisation set up specifically for workers. However, there was concern with \"parallelism\" - the situation which arose when similar work was carried out in parallel by different organisations. In early 1918 Narkompros gave Proletkult a budget of over 9,200,000 rubles, whereas the entire Adult Education Division received 32,500,000 rubles.\n\nThe Izo-Narkompros (Изо-наркомпрос), or the section of visual arts (отдел изобразительных искусств) created in May 1918, consisted of two parts: the collegium (deliberative organ) and the section proper (executive organ). The first collegium was headed by Vladimir Tatlin and included Kasimir Malevich, I. Mashkov (И. Машков), N. Udaltsova (Н. Удальцова), O.Rozanova (О. Розанова), Alexander Rodchenko, Wassily Kandinsky. It was subdivided into a number of subsections.\n\nLunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the agit-trains and agit-boats, that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts.\n\nHe also gave support to Constructivism's theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the \"ROSTA Windows\", revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, and others.\n\n\n"}

Project GRAD's mission is to improve lives in low-income communities by helping individuals develop and achieve their educational aspirations.\n\nFounded in 1994 by James and Kathryn Ketelsen, Project GRAD originally worked in five Houston ISD high schools: Northside High School (Houston), Wheatley High School (Houston), Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center, Heights High School, and Yates High School offering scholarships through their GRAD Scholar Program to students who met certain requirements as a way to increase graduation rates. From there, GRAD began working in the high school feeder patterns offering educators, math and reading curriculum, and strict disciplinary practices to 70 HISD schools.\n\nNearly 20 years after its founding and after becoming a \"nationally renowned college-prep program\", Project GRAD shifted away from the scholarship provider model to a community based model outside of the school district. In 2015, in partnership with the City of Houston and Houston Public Library, Project GRAD brought cafécollege, originally a San Antonio \"'one-stop-shop' for free college access advice, guidance, and workshops\" to Houston in the form of cafécollege Houston. Staffed by Project GRAD advisors, cafécollege Houston provides free college and career information in English and Spanish to anyone in the greater Houston area.\n\nProject GRAD has had more than 6,800 of its GRAD Scholars enroll in a community college or university and over 2,100 Scholars who have earned a certificate, associate degree or bachelor's degree. cafécollege Houston has welcomed over 10,000 visitors and GRAD has provided its services to more than 4,000 Houstonians.\n\nIn December 27, 2013, The Houston Chronicle reported that Project GRAD Houston phased out its local scholarship grants and pulled out staff from the Houston Independent School District. This is where the college preparatory program was founded more than two decades ago to assist financially needy students at problematic institutions. However, this model continued to be practiced in some areas which include Alaska, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. The non-profit organization maintained a hundred employees during its peak. The ISD also gave Project GRAD a subsidy of $5 million until the platform was scrutinized. The last fund grant worth $1.3 million for the Project came in during the 2011 – 20112 school year. After this, the non-profit deemed it necessary to create a different model. Project GRAD uses its yearly budget ($4 million) for 18 employees and 23 AmeriCorps (voluntary civil society program that the US federal government supports) members in area non-profit offices as well as universities. \n"}

Recyclebank claims to bring together people, businesses, and communities to achieve real world impact by participating in household recycling and teaching how to live more sustainable lifestyles. Over 2 million people have signed up through Recyclebank's rewards program, which offers magazine subscriptions and discounts among other goods. Recyclebank’s online shop, OneTwine.com claims to enable members to make more green choices when purchasing products. A Certified B Corporation, Recyclebank is headquartered in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, New York City was considering cancelling its recycling program. Then Fordham Law student Patrick FitzGerald realized that there was no true economic incentive to encourage people to recycle. He drafted a business model wherein people would be financially incentivized to recycle, businesses would be able to promote sustainability and cities and municipalities could see the results of dramatically increased recycling rates. In 2003, he contacted an old high school friend of his, Ron Gonen, who was then pursuing his MBA at Columbia. Together, the two of them set out to build Recyclebank and a year later, they completed the company’s founding business plan. By 2004, they rolled out a pilot recycling rewards program in Philadelphia. Today, Recyclebank partners with communities all over the country and offers new ways for one to learn, earn points, and shop online.\n\nFurther, since 2009, Recyclebank has been a certified B Corporation, meeting B Corporation's standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.\n\nRecyclebank also partners with NativeEnergy, a company that helps businesses reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in order to offset its own carbon footprint. Between 2011 and 2012, Recyclebank reduced its carbon footprint by nearly 30% by making smarter travel decisions and being more conscious of its waste and recycling habits.\n\n\nRecyclebank claims that it uses the idea of \"gaming for good,\" which combines game mechanics with environmental good, as they believe it can have a measurable impact on consumer behavior and the environment.\n\nGamification can be used by brands to motivate employees, create healthy competition among teams, generate buzz or social proof, and encourage customer loyalty, among other benefits.\n\nWhen Recyclebank was founded in 2004, gamification was not a well-known term, however elements of gamification, such as points and rewards,\nhave been embedded in Recyclebank from the start. These gaming elements make recycling easy for people to relate to, it provides motivation and it helps put behavior in context of the larger community. Though Recyclebank started by focusing on curbside recycling, there are now many more ways to earn points. Members can earn by pledging to do various things: unplugging appliances, choosing greener products, taking shorter showers, and making green travel decisions (like carpooling and taking public transportation), or by taking quizzes to learn more about how to recycle certain things, or even by simply reading a slideshow for tips or more information about new advances in sustainability.\n\nEach year, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program awards grants for unique environmental projects that positively affect students, schools and communities. Through the Green Schools Program, Recyclebank teaches children how to turn sustainable ideas into action and inspire them to make a real impact in their classrooms and communities. Recyclebank's partner Domtar Corporation, the sustainable paper company, helped make more green projects a reality by contributing additional donation dollars to participating schools. As part of its support for the Green Schools Program, in 2014 Domtar also planned to award a year's supply of Domtar EarthChoice® Office Paper to the school with the most innovative project.\n\nSince 2007, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program has awarded close to $500,000 to more than 150 schools for projects designed to creatively improve their schools. Each year participating schools, their students and their communities work to encourage residents to donate Recyclebank points that the company then transfers into real dollars for schools—turning a community's green actions into funds for a local school. Because of this year's impressive submissions, Recyclebank is also funding up to 50 percent of each proposal that did not meet its goal.\n\nIn addition to providing a year's supply of paper to the C.W. Henry School, Domtar awarded $500 to each school that was able to reach 50 percent of its donation goal. More than half of the 29 participating schools reached 50 percent of their fundraising goals and will receive funds from Domtar.\n\nWith the launch of the new online shop, One Twine, Recyclebank also announced that it will donate 5% of profits to the Green Schools Program.\n\nOn Earth Day 2014 (April 22), Recyclebank launched One Twine, a new online shop to discover carefully vetted products that are better for your home, your wallet and the planet. In addition to discovering socially and environmentally conscious goods, customers will also find great deals on the products they love on OneTwine.com. To get even more value, Recyclebank members can apply the points they've earned for learning how to live more sustainably and taking actions toward purchases on One Twine.\n\nBuilding on Recyclebank's expertise in sustainability, every item on One Twine has been evaluated through their Impact Lens, a list of nine criteria that consider the product's total environmental impact. To help people make more informed choices, One Twine clearly displays icons next to each product that highlight which criteria it meets, and includes insightful content related to those principles.\n\nOne Twine's Impact Lens considers the following criteria for each product:\nThe name One Twine is a nod to the traditional corner store, the community hub where shopkeepers connected individuals with high-quality, all-natural goods. Purchases at this store were often bound by brown paper and twine—a single thread woven from many fibers. Recyclebank feels this image ties into the online shop’s theme because just like those durable, interwoven threads of twine, they believe that through making small actions and buying great products, people and the brand can be collectively bound for a better future.\n\nAt launch, One Twine featured more than 400 products from nearly 30 brands across household, health and beauty, children, pets, and gear and gadgets categories. Shoppers can find a mix of established brands as well as up-and-coming companies.\n\nOne Twine now has 1,000 products on the site.\n\n\n"}

Originally built as a German cargo ship, \"Sedov\" is today a sail training vessel, training cadets from the universities of Murmansk, Saint Petersburg and Arkhangelsk. She participates regularly in the big maritime international events as a privileged host and has also been a regular participant in The Tall Ships' Races.\n\n\"Sedov\", originally named \"Magdalene Vinnen II\", was launched at Kiel, Germany in 1921 by the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft for the shipping company F. A. Vinnen & Co. of Bremen, one of the largest German shipping companies at the beginning of the 20th century. The shipping company initially objected to have an engine installed in the ship, but the ship yard (with backing from a Government committee) successfully argued for an engine, making the ship the first sailing ship with auxiliary engine designed to modern principles. \n\n\"Magdalene Vinnen II\" was at the time the world’s largest auxiliary barque and exclusively used as a cargo ship with a crew that was partially made up of cadets. She sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 September 1921. Her voyage took her from Bremen via Cardiff, where she took on coal, to Buenos Aires. Despite bad weather, the journey from England to Argentina with holds full of coal took just 30 days. \"Magdalene Vinnen II\" carried all sorts of cargo: apart from coal, she took timber from Finland, wheat from Australia, pyrite from Italy and unit load from Belgium. The four-masted barque made two voyages around Cape Horn to Chile. Until her last voyage as \"Magdalene Vinnen II\" in 1936, the ship sailed to Argentina, South Africa, Australia, Reunion and the Seychelles.\n\nOn 9 August 1936, \"Magdalene Vinnen II\" was sold to Norddeutscher Lloyd of Bremen and renamed \"Kommodore Johnsen\". The new owner modified her to a cargo-carrying training ship. More accommodation was provided, as the ship, apart from her permanent crew, was to have a complement of 50 to 60 trainee officers on each journey.\n\nShe came under Russian state ownership after the surrender of Germany — on 20 December 1945, the British handed over the ship to the Soviet Union as war reparation. In the Soviet Union, she was converted into a sail training vessel of the Soviet Navy. Renamed \"Sedov\" after the Arctic explorer Georgy Sedov who died during an investigation in the Arctic in 1914, she was used as a training ship of the Navy from 1952 to 1957. She made several friendly visits to South America and Africa during this period. From 1957 to 1966 she was used as an oceanographic research ship in the North Atlantic. During these voyages, the Soviet Navy also used her for training of young cadets. In 1966 when she was transferred to the reserve in Kronstadt, formally under the civil ownership of the Ministry of Fisheries. In the 1970s, she was only infrequently used as a training ship, sailing in the Gulf of Finland.\n\nIn 1981, \"Sedov\" reappeared after renovation which had new features added such as a glass-domed banquet hall with a stage and a movie theater. She was now based at the Baltic Division of Training Ships in Riga. She embarked cadets from schools of navigation of Kaliningrad and Murmansk. After the declaration of independence of Latvia in 1991, she left Riga for Murmansk, transferred to the Murmansk naval school with the city of Murmansk ensuring her management and maintenance.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, \"Sedov\" was in collision with the caravel \"Lisa von Lübeck\" off Texel, North Holland, Netherlands. Both vessels put into Den Helder. In 2017, \"Sedov\" changed her home port to Kaliningrad and she is managed by the Kaliningrad State Technical University.\n\n\"Sedov\" has regularly been targeted by unpaid creditors of the Russian Federation such as Nissim Gaon (of now defunct Swiss group NOGA, an anagram of Gaon) and also by French holders of defaulted Russian bonds; in 2002 \"Sedov\" was forced to precipitously and unexpectedly leave Marseilles in the dead of night to avoid being served a writ by AFPER (French association of holders of Russian Empire bonds) the following morning.\n\nFor over a year French holders of defaulted Russian bonds were warning they were going to reorganize and export their claim to Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, more friendly to private citizens than the French.\n\nIn May 2008, in the wake of British-Russian tension, \"Sedov\" was instructed by Moscow not to dock as planned at Southend-on-Sea. The September 2008 visit to Falmouth, the starting point of FUNCHAL 500 race to Madeira, also seemed to be in jeopardy.\n\nIn 2011 \"Sedov\" celebrated her 90th anniversary.

{"id": "2118929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118929", "title": "Solidarity", "text": "Solidarity\n\nSolidarity is unity (as of a group or class) that produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies. It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one. The term is generally employed in sociology and the other social sciences as well as in philosophy or in Catholic social teaching. In addition, solidarity is a core concept in Christian democracy political ideology.\n\nWhat forms the basis of solidarity varies between societies. In simple societies it may be mainly based on kinship and shared values. In more complex societies there are various theories as to what contributes to a sense of social solidarity.\n\nSolidarity is also one of six principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and December 20 of each year is International Human Solidarity Day recognized as an international observance.\n\nAccording to Émile Durkheim, the types of social solidarity correlate with types of society. Durkheim introduced the terms \"mechanical\" and \"organic solidarity\" as part of his theory of the development of societies in \"The Division of Labour in Society\" (1893). In a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity, its cohesion and integration comes from the homogeneity of individuals—people feel connected through similar work, educational and religious training, and lifestyle. Mechanical solidarity normally operates in \"traditional\" and small scale societies. In simpler societies (e.g., tribal), solidarity is usually based on kinship ties of familial networks. Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people—a development which occurs in \"modern\" and \"industrial\" societies.\n\nAlthough individuals perform different tasks and often have different values and interest, the order and very solidarity of society depends on their reliance on each other to perform their specified tasks. Organic here is referring to the interdependence of the component parts. Thus social solidarity is maintained in more complex societies through the interdependence of its component parts (e.g., farmers produce the food to feed the factory workers who produce the tractors that allow the farmer to produce the food).\n\nA connection between the biological and the social was of principal importance for the idea of solidarity as expressed by the anarchist ideologist and former Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921). In his most famous book, \"\" (1902), written partly in response to Huxleyan Social Darwinism, Kropotkin studied the use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies at their various stages, as well as with animals. According to him, mutual aid, or cooperation, within a species has been an important factor in the evolution of social institutions. Solidarity is essential for mutual aid; supportive activity towards other people does not result from the expectation of reward, but rather from instinctive feelings of solidarity.\n\nIn his introduction to the book, Kropotkin wrote: \"The number and importance of mutual-aid institutions which were developed by the creative genius of the savage and half-savage masses, during the earliest clan-period of mankind and still more during the next village-community period, and the immense influence which these early institutions have exercised upon the subsequent development of mankind, down to the present times, induced me to extend my researches to the later, historical periods as well; especially, to study that most interesting period – the free medieval city republics, whose universality and influence upon our modern civilization have not yet been duly appreciated. And finally, I have tried to indicate in brief the immense importance which the mutual-support instincts, inherited by mankind from its extremely long evolution, play even now in our modern society, which is supposed to rest upon the principle \"every one for himself, and the State for all,\" but which it never has succeeded, nor will succeed in realizing\". Kropotkin advocated an alternative economic and social system, which would be coordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations with goods distributed in compliance with the physical needs of the individual, rather than according to labour.\n\nSolidarity is an emerging concept in contemporary philosophy – it is subject to ongoing studies in various subfields of ethics and political philosophy.\n\nOne notable approach in bioethics is to identify solidarity primarily as a three-tiered practice enacted at the interpersonal, communal, and contractual and legal levels. This approach is driven by the quest to differentiate between the diverse applications of the concept and to clarify its meaning, both historically and in terms of its potential as a fruitful concept for contemporary moral, social and political issues.\n\nSolidarity is an integral element of Catholic social teaching. According to Pope Francis:\nThe Church's teaching on solidarity is explained in the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, and briefly summarised in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "240876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240876", "title": "Sophie Scholl", "text": "Sophie Scholl\n\nSophia Magdalena Scholl (9 May 1921 – 22 February 1943) was a German student and anti-Nazi political activist, active within the White Rose non-violent resistance group in Nazi Germany.\n\nShe was convicted of high treason after having been found distributing anti-war leaflets at the University of Munich (LMU) with her brother, Hans. As a result, she was executed by guillotine. Since the 1970s, Scholl has been extensively commemorated for her anti-Nazi resistance work.\n\nScholl was the daughter of Magdalena (Müller) and liberal politician and ardent Nazi critic Robert Scholl, who was the mayor of her hometown of Forchtenberg am Kocher in the Free People's State of Württemberg, when Scholl was born. She was the fourth of six children:\n\n\nScholl was brought up in the Lutheran church. She entered junior or grade school at the age of seven, learned easily, and had a carefree childhood. In 1930, the family moved to Ludwigsburg and then two years later to Ulm where her father had a business consulting office.\n\nIn 1932, Scholl started attending a secondary school for girls. At the age of twelve, she chose to join the \"Bund Deutscher Mädel\" (League of German Girls), as did most of her classmates. Her initial enthusiasm gradually gave way to criticism. She was aware of the dissenting political views of her father, friends, and some teachers. Even her own brother Hans, who once eagerly participated in the Hitler Youth program, became entirely disillusioned with the Nazi Party. Political attitude had become an essential criterion in her choice of friends. The arrest of her brothers and friends in 1937 for participating in the German Youth Movement left a strong impression on her.\n\nShe had a talent for drawing and painting and for the first time, came into contact with a few so-called \"degenerate\" artists. An avid reader, she developed a growing interest in philosophy and theology.\n\nIn spring 1940, she graduated from secondary school, where the subject of her essay was \"The Hand that Moved the Cradle, Moved the World.\" Scholl nearly did not graduate, having lost any desire to participate in the classes which had largely become Nazi indoctrination. Being fond of children, she became a kindergarten teacher at the Fröbel Institute in Ulm. She also had chosen this kindergarten job hoping that it would be recognized as an alternative service to \"Reichsarbeitsdienst\" (National Labor Service), a prerequisite to be admitted to the university. This was not the case, though, and in spring 1941 she began a six-month stint in the auxiliary war service as a nursery teacher in Blumberg. The military-like regimen of the Labor Service caused her to think very hard about the political situation and to begin practicing passive resistance.\nAfter her six months in the National Labor Service, in May 1942, she enrolled at the University of Munich as a student of biology and philosophy. Her brother Hans, who was studying medicine there, introduced her to his friends. Although this group of friends eventually was known for their political views, they initially were drawn together by a shared love of art, music, literature, philosophy, and theology. Hiking in the mountains, skiing and swimming were also of importance to them. They often attended concerts, plays, and lectures together.\n\nIn Munich, Scholl met a number of artists, writers, and philosophers, particularly Carl Muth and Theodor Haecker, who were important contacts for her. The question they pondered the most was how the individual must act under a dictatorship. During the summer vacation in 1942, Scholl had to do war service in a metallurgical plant in Ulm. At the same time, her father was serving time in prison for having made a critical remark to an employee about Hitler.\n\nBased upon letters between Scholl and her boyfriend, Fritz Hartnagel (reported and analyzed by Gunter Biemer and Jakob Knab in the journal \"Newman Studien\"), she had given two volumes of Cardinal John Henry Newman's sermons to Hartnagel when he was deployed to the eastern front in May 1942. This discovery by Jakob Knab shows the importance of religion in Scholl's life and was highlighted in an article in the \"Catholic Herald\" in the UK. Scholl learned of the White Rose pamphlet when she found one at her university. Realizing her brother helped write the pamphlet, Scholl herself began to work on the White Rose.\n\nThe group of authors had been horrified by Hartnagel's reports of German war crimes on the Eastern Front where Hartnagel witnessed Soviet POWs being shot in a mass grave and learned of mass killings of Jews. Her correspondence with Hartnagel deeply discussed the \"theology of conscience\" developed in Newman's writings. This is seen as her primary defense in her transcribed interrogations leading to her \"trial\" and execution. Those transcripts became the basis for a 2005 film treatment, \"Sophie Scholl – The Final Days\".\n\nWith six core members, three more White Rose pamphlets were created and circulated over the summer of 1942.\n\nThe core members initially included Hans Scholl (Sophie's brother), Willi Graf, Christoph Probst and Alexander Schmorell (Schmorell was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2012.) Initially, her brother had been keen to keep her unaware of their activities, but once she discovered them, she joined him and proved valuable to the group because, as a woman, her chances of being randomly stopped by the SS were much smaller. Calling themselves the White Rose, they instructed Germans to passively resist the Nazi government. The pamphlet used both Biblical and philosophical support for an intellectual argument of resistance. In addition to authorship and protection, Scholl helped copy, distribute, and mail pamphlets while also managing the group's finances.\n\nShe and the rest of the White Rose were arrested for distributing the sixth leaflet at the University of Munich on 18 February 1943. In the People's Court before Judge Roland Freisler on 22 February 1943, Scholl was recorded as saying these words:\n\nThere was no testimony allowed for the defendants; this was their only defense.\n\nOn 22 February 1943, Scholl, her brother, Hans, and their friend, Christoph Probst, were found guilty of treason and condemned to death. They were all beheaded by a guillotine by executioner Johann Reichhart in Munich's Stadelheim Prison only a few hours later, at 17:00 hrs. The execution was supervised by Walter Roemer, the enforcement chief of the Munich district court. Prison officials, in later describing the scene, emphasized the courage with which she walked to her execution. Her last words were:\n\nFritz Hartnagel was evacuated from Stalingrad in January 1943, but did not return to Germany before Sophie was executed. In October 1945, he married Sophie's sister Elisabeth.\n\nFollowing her death, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to the UK by German jurist Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, where it was used by the Allied Forces. In mid-1943, they dropped over Germany millions of propaganda copies of the tract, now retitled \"The Manifesto of the Students of Munich\".\n\nIn a historical context, the White Rose's legacy has significance for many commentators, both as a demonstration of exemplary spiritual courage, and as a well-documented case of social dissent in a society of violent repression, censorship, and conformist pressure.\n\nPlaywright Lillian Garrett-Groag stated in \"Newsday\" on 22 February 1993, that \"It is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century ... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why.\"\n\nIn the same issue of \"Newsday\", Holocaust historian Jud Newborn noted that \"You cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell ... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that's a very important value.\"\n\nElse Gebel shared Sophie Scholl's cell and recorded her last words before being taken away to be executed. \"It is such a splendid sunny day, and I have to go. But how many have to die on the battlefield in these days, how many young, promising lives. What does my death matter if by our acts thousands are warned and alerted. Among the student body there will certainly be a revolt.\"\n\nOn 22 February 2003, a bust of Scholl was placed by the government of Bavaria in the Walhalla temple in her honor.\n\nThe Geschwister-Scholl-Institut (\"Scholl Siblings Institute\") for Political Science at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) is named in honour of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans. The institute is home to the university's political science and communication departments, and is housed in the former Radio Free Europe building close to the city's Englischer Garten.\n\nMany local schools as well as countless streets and squares in Germany have been named after Scholl and her brother.\n\nIn 2003, Germans were invited by television broadcaster ZDF to participate in \"Unsere Besten\" (Our Best), a nationwide competition to choose the top ten most important Germans of all time. Voters under the age of forty helped Scholl and her brother Hans to finish in fourth place, above Bach, Goethe, Gutenberg, Bismarck, Willy Brandt, and Albert Einstein. If the votes of young viewers alone had been counted, Sophie and Hans Scholl would have been ranked first. Several years earlier, readers of \"Brigitte\", a German magazine for women, voted Scholl \"the greatest woman of the twentieth century\".\n\nOn May 9, 2014, Google depicted Scholl for its Google Doodle on the occasion of what would have been her 93rd birthday.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there were three film accounts of Sophie Scholl and the White Rose resistance. The first film was financed by the Bavarian state government and released in the 1970s, entitled \"Das Versprechen\" (\"The Promise\"). In 1982, Percy Adlon's \"Fünf letzte Tage\" (\"Five Last Days\") presented Lena Stolze as Scholl in her last days from the point of view of her cellmate Else Gebel. In the same year, Stolze repeated the role in Michael Verhoeven's \"Die Weiße Rose\" (\"The White Rose\"). In an interview, Stolze said that playing the role was \"an honour\".\n\nIn February 2005, a movie about Scholl's last days, \"Sophie Scholl – Die letzten Tage (Sophie Scholl – The Final Days)\", featuring actress Julia Jentsch in the title role, was released. Drawing on interviews with survivors and transcripts that had remained hidden in East German archives until 1990, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in January 2006. For her portrayal of Scholl, Jentsch won the best actress at the European Film Awards, best actress at the German Film Awards (Lolas), along with the Silver Bear for best actress at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nIn 2018, Scholl is featured in Dinesh D'Souza's Film \"Death of a Nation\". Her bravery and heroism is shown, as well as her interrogation and execution. She is portrayed by Victoria Chilap. \n\nJud Newborn and Annette Dumbach's 1986 book about the White Rose, \"Shattering the German Night\" (Little, Brown) was reissued in an expanded, updated, and illustrated edition in 2006, \"Sophie Scholl and the White Rose\", to accompany the new film's release and provide an account of the history behind the White Rose.\n\nIn February 2009, The History Press released \"Sophie Scholl: The Real Story of the Woman who Defied Hitler\" by Frank McDonough.\n\nIn February 2010, Carl Hanser Verlag released \"Sophie Scholl: A Biography\" (in German), by Barbara Beuys.\n\nAmerican playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag's play \"The White Rose\" features Scholl as a major character.\n\n\"We Will Not Be Silent\", a dramatization by David Meyers of Scholl's imprisonment and interrogation, premiered at the Contemporary American Theater Festival in Shepherdstown, West Virginia in July, 2017.\n\nGeorge Donaldson, a Scottish folk singer wrote a song called 'The White Rose' on an Album titled the same, about Sophie and the White Rose movement.\n\nThe English punk band Zatopeks released an eponymous love song for Sophie Scholl on their debut album (2005).\n\nMickey 3D, a French rock band, wrote a song called \"La Rose Blanche\" on an album titled \"Sebolavy\" (2016).\n\nRock band Sheer Mag recorded a song called \"(Say Goodbye to) Sophie Scholl\" on its 2017 debut album \"Need to Feel Your Love\".\n\nReg Meuross, UK folk singer/songwriter wrote \"For Sophie\" which features on his album \"Faraway People\" - released 28 July 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

O'Carroll also set up a \n\"Naked Scientists\" spin-off podcast, \"Naked Archaeology\", which launched in 2008. A second spin-off, \"Naked Astronomy\", featuring Cambridge University-based space scientists and astronomers, has been podcast since December 2009. Naked Astronomy also hosts the Space Boffins podcast, produced by journalists Richard Hollingham and Sue Nelson. A combined video and audio programme, \"Naked Engineering\", produced by Dave Ansell and Meera Senthilingam and supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering, launched in September 2010. For Christmas 2010 the group also showcased a new video podcast strand, the \"Naked Science Scrapbook\". In 2012, a Naked Neuroscience strand was unveiled, and in 2013 the Material Chef video series, showcasing materials science, was launched.\n\nEach episode of the main \"Naked Scientists\" programme is one hour long and includes a digest of topical science news stories, audience questions answered live on the air and interviews with guest scientists. These individuals join the hosts in the studio to talk about their work and to take questions live from listeners. Previous featured guests include the discoverer of the DNA fingerprint, Alec Jeffreys, the Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees, and the co-discoverer of DNA structure, James D. Watson.\n\nThe show also features on-location reports and interviews, and an ad-hoc interactive segment called \"Kitchen Science\" where listeners are encouraged to attempt a science experiment at home during the show. Kitchen Science experiments have included building a desktop trebuchet, a chocolate teapot and a Liver powered Bottle Rocket. The Kitchen Science segment also hosts experiments that listeners may not be able to do at home, such as generating X-rays from Sticky Tape with Dr Carlos Camara of UCLA and testing how much fat would stop a bullet with researchers at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory.\n\n\"The Naked Scientists\" have won eight national and international awards for science communication since 2006. The show won the Biosciences Federation Prize for Science Communication, 2006, the Joshua Phillips Award for Innovation in Science Engagement in 2007, the Society for General Microbiology's Peter Wildy Prize 2008, the Royal Society Kohn Award for 2008, the Best Radio Show Award at the Population Institute's 29th Global Media Awards, 2008, the European Podcast Award for UK Non-Profit podcast, the inaugural Royal College of Pathologists Furness Prize for science communication 2010 and the Society of Biology Science Communication Prize 2012.\n\n\"The Naked Scientists\" was also in the five finalists in the 2006 World Podcast Awards and received two nominations, for \"best produced\" and \"best science and technology podcast\" in the 2007 awards. It was also a top five finalist in the 2008 and 2009 awards.\n\nBandwidth consumed by the programme's podcast exceeds 28TB (terabytes) of downloads per month and more than 40 million copies have been downloaded since 2007.\n\nThe Naked Scientists appeared on TV Channel Five's panel game \"The What in the World? Quiz\" and have contributed to the 2007 Channel 4 programme \"The Farm Revealed\". In September 2008, with the Open University, the Naked Scientists launched a new UK national radio edition of their programme, \"The Naked Scientists - Up All Night\" (subsequently renamed \"Breaking Science\") which was broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live for 12 months before finishing in 2009.\n\nIn November 2008, with the Royal Society of Chemistry, a series entitled \"The Naked Scientists In Africa\" began on Channel Africa, the international broadcasting service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. \"The Naked Scientists in Africa\" was produced by Naked Scientist team-member Meera Senthilingam, incorporating international science news and a focus on science stories originating in, or pertinent to, African countries. This project ran until 2010.\n\nIn August 2012, BBC East announced an impending change to the Sunday schedule, which would see the show discontinued. In response to public reaction, the head of BBC East, Mick Rawsthorne, was interviewed on national radio about the decision to end the programme. Rawsthorne explained that the \"Naked Scientists\" did not fit the station's core purpose of providing \"local radio\". However, Rawsthorne did acknowledge the quality of the \"Naked Scientists\" programming and recognised that, with Cambridge University at the heart of Cambridgeshire, special consideration should be made for science in Cambridgeshire. Consequently, the BBC reconsidered their decision to terminate the programme and developed a proposal for it to continue as well as a way for enhanced scientific coverage and content to be integrated within the other mainstream mid-week outputs of BBC Cambridgeshire, significantly increasing the reach of the programme and the representation of science within the outputs of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.\n\nFrom January 2013, a new initiative involving the Naked Scientists began on BBC Radio Norfolk. A dedicated hour of science Q and A was included within the station's Tea Time output (hosted by Matthew Gudgin) on alternate Wednesday evenings from 1800-1900. Listeners call, text, tweet or email with questions on any scientific subject and the team answer them.\n\nFrom January 2013, the \"Naked Scientists\" programme also began to air across Australia on ABC Radio National, initially on a Sunday morning. From January 2014 the first airing of the programme was moved to a Friday evening 10pm slot, repeated on Sundays at 1500. This show is also released as the Naked Scientists Podcast.\n\nLaunched in May 2014, \"5 live Science\" is a new weekly one-hour programme from the Naked Scientists aired by BBC 5 live. Under the banner \"5 live Science\" it's a newly formatted version of the show produced by the Naked Scientists team and fronted by Dr Chris Smith; it airs nationally every Sunday morning. The programme is also released as a podcast under the same name. \n\nThe Naked Scientists regularly host paid internships including positions supported in the past by Cambridge University, the Royal Academy of Engineering, MRC (Medical Research Council), STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council), the UK's Genetics Society and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The present programme targets science PhD students. Applicants are \"bought out\" from their research projects for two months to join the Naked Scientists team where they learn to participate in the programme-making process, including presenting, writing and publishing skills.

{"id": "32923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32923", "title": "Western canon", "text": "Western canon\n\nThe Western canon is the body of Western literature, European classical music, philosophy, and works of art that represents the high culture of Europe and North America: \"a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, Socrates to Wittgenstein in philosophy, and from Homer to James Joyce in literature\". The word canon is derived from ancient Greek \"κανών, kanṓn\", meaning a measuring rod, or standard. The Bible, a product of ancient Jewish culture, from western Asia, has been a major force in shaping Western culture, and \"has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art\".\n\nThe canon of books has been fairly stable, although it has expanded to include more women and racial minorities, while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the Middle Ages and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked. But some examples of newer media such as cinema have attained a precarious position in the canon. Also during the twentieth century there has been a growing interest in the West as well as globally, in major works, both in literature and in the other arts, of the cultures of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America and the former colonies of European countries.\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate internationally, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in critical theory, feminism, critical race theory, and Marxism. In particular, postmodern studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased because the traditional main focus of academic studies of Western culture and history has only been on works produced by Western men.\n\nA classic is a book, or any other work of art, accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an imprimatur such as being listed in a list of great books, or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature, music and art, etc. from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Vedas. A related word is masterpiece or \"chef d'œuvre\", which in modern use refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, or workmanship. Historically, the word refers to a work of a very high standard produced in order to obtain membership of a Guild or Academy.\n\nThe first writer to use the term \"classic\" was Aulus Gellius, a 2nd-century Roman writer who, in the miscellany \"Noctes Atticae\" (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a \"classicus scriptor, non proletarius\" (\"A distinguished, not a commonplace writer\"). Such classification began with the Greeks' \"ranking\" their cultural works, with the word \"canon\" (ancient Greek κανών, kanṓn: \"measuring rod, standard\"). Moreover, early Christian Church Fathers used \"canon\" to rank the authoritative texts of the New Testament, preserving them, given the expense of vellum and papyrus and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a \"canon\" ensured a book's preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization. Contemporarily, the Western canon defines the best of Western culture. In the ancient world, at the Alexandrian Library, scholars coined the Greek term \"Hoi enkrithentes\" (\"the admitted\", \"the included\") to identify the writers in the canon.\n\nWith regard to books, what makes a book \"classic\" has concerned various authors, from Mark Twain to Italo Calvino, and questions such as \"Why Read the Classics?\", and \"What Is a Classic?\" have been considered by others, including Calvino, T. S. Eliot, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Michael Dirda, and Ezra Pound.\n\nThe terms \"classic book\" and Western canon are closely related concepts, but are not necessarily synonymous. A \"canon\" is a list of books considered to be \"essential\", and it can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, Everyman's Library, or Penguin Classics), presented as a list with an academic's imprimatur (such as Harold Bloom's,) or be the official reading list of a university.\n\nSome of the writers who are generally considered the most important in Western literature are Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Geoffrey Chaucer, Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, François Rabelais, Jean Racine, Molière, Miguel de Cervantes, Michel de Montaigne, Lope de Vega, John Milton, Samuel Johnson, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, Stendhal, Ivan Turgenev, Walt Whitman, Gustave Flaubert, Emily Dickinson, Honoré de Balzac, Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Sigmund Freud, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Marcel Proust, Anton Chekhov, Thomas Mann, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Mikhail Bulgakov, Jorge Luis Borges, Pablo Neruda, Vladimir Nabokov, Fernando Pessoa, Albert Camus and Samuel Beckett.\n\nHarold Bloom has divided the body of Western Literature into four ages:\n\n\n\n\n\nA university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by Prof. John Erskine of Columbia University, which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western liberal arts tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included Robert Hutchins, Mortimer Adler, Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Jacques Barzun, and Alexander Meiklejohn. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of higher education by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.\n\nThe essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's \"Republic\", or Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.\n\nOver 100 institutions of higher learning, mostly in the United States, offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate, especially in the US, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in critical theory, feminism, critical race theory, and Marxism. In particular, postmodern studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased, because the main focus traditionally of the academic studies of history and Western culture has only been on Europe and men. American philosopher Jay Stevenson argues:\n\nClassicist Bernard Knox made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his 1992 Jefferson Lecture (the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities). Knox used the intentionally \"provocative\" title \"The Oldest Dead White European Males\" as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name, in both of which Knox defended the continuing relevance of classical culture to modern society.\n\nSome intellectuals have championed a \"high conservative modernism\" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths. Many argued that \"natural law\" was the repository of timeless truths. Allan Bloom, in his highly influential \"The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students\" (1987) argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great classics that shaped Western culture. Bloom further comments: \"But one thing is certain: wherever the Great Books make up a central part of the curriculum, the students are excited and satisfied.\" His book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativists. Yale University Professor of Humanities and famous literary critic Harold Bloom (no relation) has also argued strongly in favor of the canon, in his 1994 book \"\", and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions, though its implications continue to be debated.\n\nDefenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests, and that such criticisms are misguided and/or disingenuous. As John Searle, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, has written:\nOne of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority; who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading? Searle's rebuttal suggests that \"one obvious difficulty with it [i.e., arguments against hierarchical ranking of books] is that if it were valid, it would argue against any set of required readings whatever; indeed, any list you care to make about anything automatically creates two categories, those that are on the list and those that are not.\"\n\nCharles Altieri, of the University of California, Berkeley, states that canons are \"an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes.\" It is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society. American historian Todd M. Compton argues that canons are always communal in nature; that there are limited canons for, say a literature survey class, or an English department reading list, but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature. Instead, there are many conflicting canons. He regards Bloom's \"Western Canon\" as a personal canon only.\n\nThe process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless. The philosopher John Searle has said, \"In my experience there never was, in fact, a fixed 'canon'; there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality. Such judgments are always subject to revision, and in fact they were constantly being revised.\" One of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the English-speaking world was the \"Great Books of the Western World\" program. This program, developed in the middle third of the 20th century, grew out of the curriculum at the University of Chicago. University president Robert Maynard Hutchins and his collaborator Mortimer Adler developed a program that offered reading lists, books, and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public. An earlier attempt had been made in 1909 by Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot, with the Harvard Classics, a 51-volume anthology of classic works from world literature. Eliot's view was the same as that of Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle: \"The true University of these days is a Collection of Books\". (\"The Hero as Man of Letters\", 1840)\n\nThe canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th and early 17th century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers. However, the central figures of the British renaissance canon remain, Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and John Donne. Spenser, Donne, and Jonson were major influences on 17th-century poetry. However, poet John Dryden condemned aspects of the metaphysical poets in his criticism. In the 18th century Metaphysical poetry fell into further disrepute, while the interest in Elizabethan poetry was rekindled through the scholarship of Thomas Warton and others. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed in the Victorian period with anthologies like Palgrave's \"Golden Treasury\".\n\nIn the twentieth century T. S. Eliot and Yvor Winters were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance English literature. Eliot, for example, championed poet Sir John Davies in an article in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" in 1926. During the course of the 1920s, Eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work. However, by 1961 A. Alvarez was commenting that \"it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals. The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the Anglo-American experimental movement in modern poetry.\" Two decades later, a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a 'high Anglican and royalist literary history' on 17th-century English poetry.\n\nThe American critic Yvor Winters suggested in 1939 an alternative canon of Elizabethan poetry, which would exclude the famous representatives of the Petrarchan school of poetry, represented by Sir Philip Sidney and Edmund Spenser. Winters claimed that the Native or Plain Style \"anti-Petrarchan\" movement had been undervalued and argued that George Gascoigne (1525–1577) \"deserves to be ranked […] among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher\".\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century the established canon was increasingly under fire.\n\nIn the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the literary canon, including women's writing, post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of historically marginalized groups. This reassessment has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered \"literature\", and genres hitherto not regarded as \"literary\", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.\n\nThe Western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. Writers from countries like Turkey, China, Egypt, Peru, and Colombia, Japan, etc., have received Nobel prizes since the late 1960s. Writers from Asia and Africa have also been nominated for, and also won, the Booker prize in recent years. \n\nThe feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction and created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. \n\nHowever, in Britain and America at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century, and many major nineteenth-century British novelists were women, including Jane Austen, the Brontë family, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot. There were also three major female poets, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti and Emily Dickinson. In the twentieth century there were also many major female writers, including Katherine Mansfield, Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, Eudora Welty, and Marianne Moore. Notable female writers in France include Colette and Simone de Beauvoir; and in Russia, Anna Akhmatova.\n\nMuch of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the Western literary canon started to include black writers not only from black American writers, but also from the wider black diaspora of writers in Britain, France, Latin America, and Africa. This is largely due to the shift in social and political views during the civil rights movement in the United States. The first global recognition came in 1950 when Gwendolyn Brooks was the first black American to win a Pulitzer Prize for Literature. Chinua Achebe's novel \"Things Fall Apart\" helped draw attention to African literature. Nigerian Wole Soyinka was the first African to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, and American Toni Morrison was the first black woman to win in 1993.\n\nSome early American Black writers were inspired to defy ubiquitous racial prejudice by proving themselves equal to white American authors. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has said, \"it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture.\"\n\nAfrican-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States. Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as \"something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity.\" This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination. By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the African diaspora, African-American literature broke \"the mystique of connection between literary authority and patriarchal power.\" In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, most famously by W. E. B. Du Bois.\n\nSince the 1960s the Western literary canon has been expanded to include writers from Asia, Africa, the Middle East. This is reflected in the Nobel prizes awarded in literature.\n\nYasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972) was a Japanese novelist and short story writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz (1911 – 2006) was an Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature. He is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of Arabic literature, along with Tawfiq el-Hakim, to explore themes of existentialism. He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career. Many of his works have been made into Egyptian and foreign films.\n\nKenzaburō Ōe (b. 1935) is a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary Japanese literature. His novels, short stories, and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and literary theory, deal with political, social, and philosophical issues, including nuclear weapons, nuclear power, social non-conformism, and existentialism. Ōe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994 for creating \"an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today\".\n\nGuan Moye (b. 1955), better known by the pen name \"Mo Yan\", is a Chinese novelist and short story writer. Donald Morrison of the U.S. news magazine \"TIME\" referred to him as \"one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely pirated of all Chinese writers\", and Jim Leach called him the Chinese answer to Franz Kafka or Joseph Heller. He is best known to Western readers for his 1987 novel \"Red Sorghum Clan\", of which the \"Red Sorghum\" and \"Sorghum Wine\" volumes were later adapted for the film \"Red Sorghum\". In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work as a writer \"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary\".\n\nOrhan Pamuk (b. 1952) is a Turkish novelist, screenwriter, academic, and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. One of Turkey's most prominent novelists, his work has sold over thirteen million books in sixty-three languages, making him the country's best-selling writer. Pamuk is the author of novels including \"The White Castle\", \"The Black Book\", \"The New Life\", \"My Name Is Red\", \"Snow\", \"The Museum of Innocence\", and \"A Strangeness in My Mind\". He is the Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches writing and comparative literature.\nBorn in Istanbul, Pamuk is the first Turkish Nobel laureate. He is also the recipient of numerous other literary awards. \"My Name Is Red\" won the 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger, 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour, and 2003 International Dublin Literary Award.\n\nOctavio Paz Lozano (1914 – 1998) was a Mexican poet and diplomat. For his body of work, he was awarded the 1981 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1982 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nGabriel García Márquez (1927 – 2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the best in the Spanish language, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. \n\nGarcía Márquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" (1967), \"The Autumn of the Patriarch\" (1975), and \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude. On his death in April 2014, Juan Manuel Santos, the President of Colombia, described him as \"the greatest Colombian who ever lived.\"\n\nMario Vargas Llosa, (b. 1936) is a Peruvian writer, politician, journalist, essayist, college professor, and recipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature. Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom. Upon announcing the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy said it had been given to Vargas Llosa \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".\n\n \n\nThe discussion of the literary canon above, especially with regard to \"Great Book\" and the \"debate\" over the canon, is also relevant.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy has consistently held a prominent place in the canon. Only a relatively small number of works of Greek philosophy have survived, essentially those thought most worth copying in the Middle Ages. Plato, Aristotle and, indirectly, Socrates are the primary figures. Roman philosophy is included, but regarded as less significant (as it tended to be even by the Romans themselves). The ancient philosophy of other cultures now receives more attention than before the 20th century. The vast body of Christian philosophy is typically represented on reading lists mainly by Saints Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, and the 12th-century Jewish scholar Maimonides is now usually represented, mostly by \"The Guide for the Perplexed\". The academic canon of early modern philosophy generally includes Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period.\n\nWomen have engaged in philosophy throughout the field's history. There were female philosophers since ancient times, notably Hipparchia of Maroneia (active c. 325 BC) and Arete of Cyrene (active 5th–4th century BC), and some were accepted as philosophers during the ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary eras, but almost no female philosophers have entered the philosophical Western canon. In the early 1990s, the Canadian Philosophical Association claimed that there is gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy. In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that \"out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total. While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics.\"\n\nMany philosophers today agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Early Islamic philosophy, the European Renaissance, and the Age of Enlightenment. Greek philosophy was probably influenced by the philosophy and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient Near East, as well as Indian Vedanta philosophy, but philosophy, as we understand it, is a Greek creation.\"\n\nPlato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition, unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries.\n\nAristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist. His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government—and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.\nAristotle's views on physical science had a profound influence on medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and his views were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. In metaphysics, Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as \"The First Teacher\" (). His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.\n\nMajor Western writers and philosophers have been influenced by Eastern philosophy. \n\nThrough his teacher Ammonius Saccas (died , the Greek speaking philosopher Plotinus may have been influenced by Indian thought, because of the similarities between neoplatonism and the Vedanta philosophies of Hinduism.\n\nAmerican modernist poet T S Eliot wrote that the great philosophers of India \"make most of the great European philosophers look like schoolboys\". Arthur Schopenhauer, in the preface to his book \"The World as Will and Representation\", writes that one who \"has also received and assimilated the sacred primitive Indian wisdom, then he is the best of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him\" The 19th-century American philosophical movement Transcendentalism was also influenced by Indian thought.\n\nMajor philosophers of the Renaissance include Niccolò Machiavelli, Pico della Mirandola, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei.\n\nThe seventeenth century was important for philosophy, and the major figures were Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), René Descartes (1596–1650), Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), John Locke (1632–1704), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), and Isaac Newton (1642– c.1726).\n\nMajor philosophers of the eighteenth century include George Berkeley (1685–1753), David Hume (1711–1776), Adam Smith (1723–1790), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), Voltaire (1694–1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), and Edmund Burke (1729–1797).\n\nImportant nineteenth century philosophers include Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Karl Marx (1818–1883) and Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900).\n\nMajor twentieth century figures are Henri Bergson (1859–1941), Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951). A porous distinction between analytic and continental approaches emerged during this period. The term \"continental\" is misleading, as many prominent British philosophers such as R. G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott were non-analytic, and many non-British European philosophers like Wittgenstein were analytic. Moreover, analytic approaches are dominant in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, and parts of east-central Europe today. Some argue in English-speaking countries, it is better to distinguish between the dominant approaches of university departments, where Modern Language departments tend to favor continental methods and philosophy department tends to favor analytic ones. However, the humanities/social sciences departments in general such as history, sociology, anthropology, and political science departments in English-speaking countries tend to favor continental methods such as those by Michel Foucault (1926-1984), Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) and Jürgen Habermas (1929- ).\n\nFemale philosophers have begun to gain prominence in the last hundred years. Notable female philosophers from the contemporary period include Susanne Langer (1895–1985), Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986), and Martha Nussbaum (1947– ).\n\nThe term \"classical music\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age. In addition to Bach and Beethoven, the other major figures from this period were Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The earliest reference to \"classical music\" recorded by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is from about 1836.\n\nIn classical music, during the nineteenth century a \"canon\" developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since 1600, with a great concentration on the later part of this period, termed the Classical period, which is generally taken to begin around 1750. After Beethoven, the major nineteenth-century composers include Robert Schumann, Frédéric Chopin, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner, Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\n\nIn the 2000s, the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras, chamber music groups, and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly 18th- and 19th-century male composers. Many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most \"serious\", such as the symphony, concerto, string quartet, and opera. Folk music was already giving art music melodies, and from the late 19th century, in an atmosphere of increasing nationalism, folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways, before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself.\n\nSince the early twentieth century non-Western music has begun to influence Western composers. In particular, direct homages to Javanese gamelan music are found in works for western instruments by Claude Debussy, Béla Bartók, Francis Poulenc, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, John Cage, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. Debussy was immensely interested in non-Western music and its approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese Gamelan, which he first heard at the 1889 Paris Exposition. He was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the \"shimmering\" effect created by a gamelan ensemble. American composer Philip Glass was not only influenced by the eminent French composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, but also by the Indian musicians Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha, His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive. \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century the canon expanded to cover the so-called Early music of the pre-classical period, and Baroque music by composers other than Bach and George Frideric Handel. including Antonio Vivaldi, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Heinrich Schütz, and Dieterich Buxtehude. Earlier composers, such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Orlande de Lassus and William Byrd, have also received more attention in the last hundred years.\n\nThe absence of female composers from the canon has been debated in the twentieth century, even though there have been female composers throughout the classical music period. Marcia J Citron, for example, has examined \"the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women [sic] composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works.\" More recently the music of Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), a German Benedictine abbess, has been rediscovered, and both the Russian Sofia Gubaidulina (born 1931) and Finnish Kaija Saariaho (born 1952) have achieved international reputations. Saariaho's opera \"L'amour de loin\" has been staged in some of the world's major opera houses, including The English National Opera (2009) and in 2016 the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\nThe backbone of traditional Western art history are artworks commissioned by wealthy patrons for private or public enjoyment. Much of this was religious art, mostly Roman Catholic art. The classical art of Greece and Rome has, since the Renaissance, been the fount of the Western tradition.\n\nGiorgio Vasari (1511–1574) is the originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies. His \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" covers only artists working in Italy, with a strong pro-Florentine prejudice, and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries. Northern European art has arguably never quite caught up to Italy in terms of prestige, and Vasari's placing of Giotto as the founding father of \"modern\" painting has largely been retained. In painting, the rather vague term of Old master covers painters up to about the time of Goya.\n\nThis \"canon\" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection present in art history textbooks, as well as the prices obtained in the art trade. But there have been considerable swings in what is valued. In the 19th century the Baroque fell into great disfavour, but it was revived from around the 1920s, by which time the art of the 18th and 19th century was largely disregarded. The High Renaissance, which Vasari regarded as the greatest period, has always retained its prestige, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, but the succeeding period of Mannerism has fallen in and out of favour. \n\nIn the 19th century the beginnings of academic art history, led by German universities, led to much better understanding and appreciation of medieval art, and a more nuanced understanding of classical art, including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late Roman copies rather than Greek originals. The European tradition of art was expanded to include Byzantine art and the new discoveries of archaeology, notably Etruscan art, Celtic art and Upper Paleolithic art.\n\nSince the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women; vernacular creativity, especially in printed media; and an expansion to include works in the Western tradition produced outside Europe. At the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of non-Western traditions, including their place with Western art in wider global or Eurasian traditions. The decorative arts have traditionally had a much lower critical status than fine art, although often highly valued by collectors, and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print.\n\nEnglish artist and sculptor Barbara Hepworth DBE (1903 – 1975), whose work exemplifies Modernism, and in particular modern sculpture, is one of the few female artists to achieve international prominence. In 2016 the art of American modernist Georgia O'Keefe has been staged at the Tate Modern, in London, and is then moving in December 2016 to Vienna, Austria, before visiting the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada in 2017.\n\nWomen were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream Western traditions. In addition, since the Renaissance the nude, more often than not female, has had a special position as subject matter. In her 1971 essay, \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\", Linda Nochlin analyzes what she sees as the embedded privilege in the predominantly male Western art world and argues that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability. Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.\n\nIn the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, and questioned which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy. This position is articulated by artist Judy Chicago:\n\"[I]t is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves.\"\n\n\n\n"}
