Panicking, the group drag Melvin's body into a wooded area, and stage it to look like he was the victim of a random gang-related attack. Exactly one year later, DeAnna is stabbed to death by a hooded figure while interning at a hospital. After murdering DeAnna, the killer writes \"April Fools\" on a wall with her blood.\n\nHearing about DeAnna's death, Missy meets up with the others, convinced that DeAnna's murder may have something to do with Melvin's death, though her worries are dismissed. Later, Eva is stabbed in a locker room after dance practice by the same hooded assailant, who once again writes \"April Fools\" on a wall in blood. Unaware of Eva's death, Missy goes to the high school's Spring Jam, despite being unnerved by surveillance footage of DeAnna's murder, accidentally left in her room by her detective father. \n\nAt the Spring Jam, Missy recognizes the attending killer from the surveillance footage, and looks for help from Malik after witnessing Diego and a teacher be murdered. Malik and the killer fight, sparking a brawl on the dance floor that covers the killer's escape after he fatally stabs Malik. Along with the other revelers, Missy is rounded up by the authorities, and at the police station she admits to her and her friends' involvement in Melvin's death to her father. A police officer escorts Missy home, where she is confronted by \"the April Fools Killer\" - Marlin, who has killed the officer, and the one stationed at his house. Marlin claims that he was only one affected by Melvin's death, his life falling to shambles after it while everyone else easily moved on, enraging him. Marlin attacks Missy, but she manages to briefly incapacitate him and get outside, a recovered Marlin giving chase.\n\nMarlin soon catches up with Missy, only to die when she hits him with a rock, and turns his own blade on him. Stumbling away from Marlin's body, Missy collapses into the arms of her father, who had gone out looking for her after piecing together the April Fools Killer's identity.\n\n\nBlack Horror Movies wrote, \"You have to love \"April Fools\". Otherwise, you might end up blowing your brains out. What feels like a film with production values above typical 'urban horror' fare turns out to be frustratingly devoid of quality. But where quality is lacking, camp appeal reigns supreme, and if camp is \"April Fools\"' ultimate goal, it's downright brilliant. This is a perfect storm of incompetence on all fronts: acting, writing, direction, editing, continuity, special effects, and basic human decency.\" The acting and script were criticized by Blogcritics, which gave the closing statement, \"\"April Fools\" fooled the hell out of me. I thought it was a horror film, but it turned out to be a bad joke.\" \"April Fools\" was described as being like \"a glorified YouTube video\" that had \"no style, no substance\" by Direct to Video Connoisseur.\n\nFilm Critics United said, \"The young actors struggle with their lines, the story – though liberally stolen – stole only the worthless parts of movies that weren't that good anyway, the ending was completely outlandish, the camera work was spotty at best, and it wasn't scary. In fact it was quite funny.\" Horror Movie a Day found the film terrible and awkward, and wrote that \"it's so short (72 minutes, with lots of easily skippable padding) and lovingly stupid that I can't really muster up the energy to go off on it\" and that to do so would be like \"berating an infant for not knowing how to drive\". A score of one out of a possible five was given by Slasherpool, which said the story was thin, the actors incompetent, the direction dreadful, the death scenes pathetic, and the picture quality extremely poor.\n"}
{"id": "312446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312446", "title": "Baccalauréat", "text": "Baccalauréat\n\nThe baccalauréat (), often known in France colloquially as bac, is an academic qualification that French students take after high school. Introduced by Napoleon I in 1808, it is the main diploma that is required to pursue university studies.\n\nThere is also the European Baccalaureate, which students take at the end of the European School education. It confirms a rounded secondary education and gives access to a wide range of university education. It differs from British A levels and Scottish Highers but is similar to a US two-year college diploma in that it is earned comprehensively and can be obtained in streams requiring a high level in a number of different subjects, depending on the stream.\n\nThe general streams are Sciences, Economics and Social Sciences and Literature.\n\nMuch like British A levels or European Matura, the \"baccalauréat\" allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18. It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to tertiary education, or acquire some other professional qualification or training.\n\nAlthough it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam. Unlike some US high school diplomas, this exam is not for \"lycée\" completion but university entrance.\n\nThe word \"bac\" is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their \"baccalauréat\" diploma: \"le bac de philo\", for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study.\n\nWithin France, there are three main types of \"baccalauréat\":\nFor entrance to regular universities within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of baccalauréat that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the \"bac\" by taking a special exam, the \"diploma for entrance to higher education\".\n\nThough most students take the \"bac\" at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a \"candidat libre\" (literally, \"free candidate\") without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the bac upon completion of secondary school (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the bac would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option. The exam is the same as the one administered to secondary-school students except that free candidates are tested in Physical Education, but students' Physical Education grade is calculated based on evaluation throughout the year.\n\nThe students who sit for the \"baccalauréat général\" choose one of three streams (termed \"séries\") in the penultimate \"lycée\" year. Each stream results in a specialization and carries different weights (\"coefficients\") associated with each subject. Another terminology is sometimes used, which existed before 1994 and further divided the different \"séries\". Until then, it was possible to sit for a \"bac C\" or \"D\" (which is now S), \"B\" (now ES), or \"A1, A2, A3\" (now L). People who passed the \"baccalauréat\" before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma. However, the streams for the \"baccalauréat général\" are now as follows:\n\nThe \"baccalauréat\" permits students to choose to sit for exams in over forty world languages or French regional languages (such as Alsatian, Catalan or Norman).\n\nThe S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as medicine, engineering and the natural sciences. Natural sciences students must specialise in either Mathematics, Physics & Chemistry, Computer science or Earth & Life Sciences.\n\nStudents of the Baccalauréat économique et social prepare for careers in the social sciences, in Philosophy (and other human sciences) in management and business administration, and in economics. The subject Economics & Social Sciences is the most heavily weighed and is only offered in this stream. History & Geography and Mathematics are also important subjects in ES.\n\nStudents in the L stream prepare for careers in the humanities such as education, linguistics, litterature, law, history (and the other social sciences) and public service. They also have interests in the arts. The most important subjects in the literary stream are Philosophy and French language and literature and other languages, usually English, German and Spanish.\n\nThe majority of the \"baccalauréat\" examination takes place in a week in June. For \"lycée\" students, that is the end of the last year, \"terminale\".\n\nMost examinations are given in essay-form. The student is given a substantial block of time (depending on the exam, that is from two to five hours) to complete a multiple-page, well-argued paper. The number of pages varies from exam to exam but is usually substantial considering all answers have to be written down, explained and justified. Mathematics and science exams are problem sets but some science questions also require an essay-type answer. Foreign-language exams often have a short translation section, as well. In the S stream, the Mathematics and the Earth & Life Sciences examinations sometimes contain some multiple-choice questions (\"choix multiples\").\n\nAll students also have to work on a scientific research project (\"travaux personnels encadrés\", or TPE). Those are generally conducted in groups of 2, 3 or 4 and focus on a subject determined by the students, under the supervision of a faculty member.\n\nWhen taken in mainland France, the \"baccalauréat\" material is the same for all students in a given stream. Secrecy surrounding the material is very tight, and the envelopes containing the exams are unsealed by a high-ranking school officer (usually a principal or vice-principal) in front of the examinees only a few minutes prior to the start of the examination. The procedure is the same for each subject, in each stream. Students usually have an identification number and an assigned seat. The number is written on all exam material and the name is hidden by folding and sealing the upper right-hand corner of the examination sheet(s). That way, anonymity is respected. The correcting staff is usually a member of the teaching staff in the same district or, at a larger scale, in the same \"académie\". To avoid conflicts of interests, a teacher who has lectured to a student or group of students cannot grade that exam. Also, to ensure greater objectivity on the part of the examiners, the test is anonymous. The grader sees only an exam paper with a serial number, with all personally identifying material stripped away and forbidden from appearing, thus curbing any favoritism based upon sex, religion, national origin, or ethnicity.\n\nUnlike the English GCSEs, Scottish Standard Grades or the American SAT, the French \"baccalauréat\" is not a completely-standardised test. Since most answers, even for biology questions, are given in essay form, the grades may vary from grader to grader, especially in subjects like philosophy and French literature.\n\nStudents generally take the French language and literature exam at the end of \"première\" since that subject is not taught in \"terminale\", where it is replaced with a philosophy course. It also has an oral examination component, along with the written part. The oral exam covers works studied throughout \"première\".\n\nEach \"baccalauréat\" stream has its own set of subjects that each carry a different weight (\"coefficient\"). That allows some subjects to be more important than others. For example, in the ES stream, Economics & Social Science carry more weight than the Natural Sciences and so the former is more important than the latter. Students usually study more for exams that carry heavier weights since the grade that they obtain in these exams have a bigger impact on their mean grade. Whether or not one passes the \"bac\" and/or receives eventual honours are determined in the calculation of that mean.\n\nThe general baccalauréat offers several additional variants. The best-known subset is the \"option internationale du baccalauréat\" (OIB). Sometimes confusingly translated as the \"French international baccalaureat\", it is, however, unrelated to the International Baccalaureate (IB).\n\nThe OIB adds further subjects to the French national exam. Students choose one of the L, ES or S streams. It differs, as students take a two-year syllabus in literature, history and geography in a foreign language. That syllabus and the way that it is examined is modelled on the national exam of the target nation. For instance, the British Section (administered by the University of Cambridge) models the programmes on A-levels in English, History and Geography. It is therefore necessary to be fully bilingual to complete this qualification. To date there are 15 different sections supporting 14 different languages. The list is as follows: American (US), Arabic, British, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.\n\nAt the end of \"terminale\", OIB students have extra exams in Literature and History/Geography. Those exams have a high weight in the final mark of the baccalaureate and do not give extra points to OIB students. Overall, these students work much more (up to an additional 10 hours per week of classes, with a significant amount of required reading and homework attached as well) than the other general baccalauréat students, and many of them tend to go to foreign universities. University admissions tutors often consider reducing the entrance requirements for students taking the OIB compared with those taking the standard French baccalaureate to reflect the additional demands of the OIB.\n\nSince the students that attend these schools make up a fairly-small demographic, they tend to be spread over a far larger area than would traditionally be expected of a normal lycée or secondary school. As a consequence, many of these students must commute long distances, with one-hour trips each way being fairly common. The long commutes to the longer days and the increased workload that come with the OIB make system be highly demanding of students, and many students cannot handle the workload and so transfer to schools teaching the standard French baccalaureate. Thus, many consider the OIB qualification to be highly challenging and a sign of not only academic prowess but also one of tenacity and hard work.\n\nTo test their foreign or regional language students can choose among these different languages (not at all schools): English, German, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, Modern Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese; regional languages: Basque, Breton, Catalan, Corsican, Auvergnat, Gascon, Languedoc, Limousin, Niçard, Provençal, Vivaro-Alpine, regional languages of Alsace regional languages of Moselle), Tahitian, Albanian, Amharic, Melanesian languages, Bambara, Berber, Bulgarian, Cambodian, Korean, Croatian, Hausa, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Laotian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malagasy, Persian, Fulani, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, Swahili, Tamil, Czech.\n\nThe pass mark is 10 out of 20. The 2014 success rate for the \"baccalauréat\" in mainland France was 87.9%.\n\nFor the \"baccalauréat\", three levels of honours are given:\nExcellent candidates who score over 18 can be awarded by the jury the unofficial and extremely-rare \"félicitations du jury\" (highest honours with praise), which is mentioned by hand on the official \"baccalauréat\" document. \n\nHonours are prestigious but not crucial, as admissions to the \"classes préparatoires\" (preparatory classes), which prepare students for the grande école examinations, are decided months before the examination.\n\nFrench educators seldom use the entire grading scale. The same applies when marking the \"baccalauréat\". Therefore, students are very unlikely to get a 20 out of 20 or more (it is actually possible to get more than 20 because of options). It is also very rare to see scores lower than 5.\n\nGrade inflation has become a concern. Between 2005 and 2016, the proportion of students who received an honour in the general baccalaureate doubled.\n\nEuropean section is an option in French high schools to teach a subject through a European language other than French. It also gives pupils the opportunity of having more hours in the language studied. It is also an opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country of which the language is being spoken. For example, learning History in Spanish the history of Spain and that of Central and South America would be emphasized. Teachers present their lessons in English, German, Italian or Spanish.\n\nAt the end, students can receive a \"European section\" mention on their baccalaureat. To have that mention, they need to get at least 12/20 on their language examination and at least 10/20 at an additional oral examination on the subject in the language.\n\nFor example, those who choose History in Spanish as an additional subject would take their Spanish examination like the rest of their classmates, who do not have History in Spanish, and get at least 12/20. They then have to pass an oral examination on history in Spanish and get at least 10/20.\n\nA student who averages between 8 and 10 is permitted to sit for the \"épreuve de rattrapage\" (also called the \"second groupe\"), a supplemental oral examination given in two subjects of the student's choice. A student who does well enough in those examinations to raise the overall weighted grade to a 10 gets the \"baccalauréat\". A student who does poorly in the orals and receives below a 10 may choose to repeat the final year of lycée (\"terminale\").\n\nStudents may not redo the entire examination in September; the September examinations may be taken only by those who have not been able to take the June examinations for serious reasons (such as illness).\n\nThere are a small number of schools which prepare students for the \"baccalauréat\" in the United States. Otherwise, it is possible to prepare for the \"baccalauréat\" with the CNED, a French public institution under the oversight of the department of education dedicated to providing distance learning material. It can, of course, be taken only after completion of the necessary coursework, which is entirely in French. Upon receiving the \"baccalauréat\", students wishing to pursue postsecondary studies in the US generally will submit their lycée/high school transcripts to a college or university office of undergraduate admissions. If it is decided that the coursework, along with American standardized test scores, application essays, and letters of recommendation, merits admission, students holding the baccalauréat will be admitted to the undergraduate program to which they have applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In French universities, the position was frequently open to purchase. In the medieval English universities in Oxford and Cambridge, the \"bedel\" was an administrative assistant of the chancellor and the proctors. The bedel was, among other things, to collect fines and fees, keep rolls of scholars with the license to teach, and participate in ceremonial dress in academic processions and on other similar occasions. There were six bedels at Oxford, one superior and one inferior bedel for each faculty, while Cambridge had only two (Cobban, p. 231f); Oxford today has four bedels representing Divinity, Law, Medicine, and Arts. The University of St Andrews has six bedels at official ceremonies and still maintains at least a single Bedel at the weekly United College chapel service. The office of Esquire Bedell is still preserved for purely ceremonial purposes at some other universities, including the University of Southampton in the UK.\n\nThe Pedell at German universities would also function as a notary, and had a relatively prominent position. At the University of Tübingen, the \"Pedell\" was responsible both for arresting and detaining students in the karzer and for acting as prosecutor in the university court.\n\nIn universities in the Netherlands the pedel acts as a master of ceremonies. the office is an entirely ceremonial one, the pedel leading public processions and acting as the master of ceremonies at graduations and Ph.D. examinations. As a master of ceremonies, the pedel is largely mute. The only words that a pedel utters in public are \" \", announcing that the allotted time for a Ph.D. examination has expired.\n\nAt the University of Uppsala in Sweden the function of \"pedell\" is mentioned for the first time in the statutes of 1626, with a function similar to that of the cursor; in Uppsala there were several pedells, one of which was each morning to appear in front of the rector, serve him at official functions and hold the silver sceptre of the university. He was also to keep a ledger over the students and keep guard over incarcerated students. The \"pedell\" at Uppsala wore a richly decorated livery in blue and yellow with silver embroidery, and carried a wooden staff with a silver button.\n\nThe word Beadle, the name for various similar but not identical offices in Scotland and England, is of the same origin.\n\nThe Italian word \"bidello\", the person whose work is to check classrooms and schedules and, in the past, to signal the end of the class, has the same origin. The function of announcing the end of each hour-long lesson by uttering the word \"finis\" (Latin for \"end\") has long been abandoned due to the introduction of electrical bells and public address systems.\n\n"}

It started off as a pastoral training institute in 1988. It was then known as the Central Bible College by June 1991. It later became the Central Christian College in 1993 and eventually became the Central University College in 1997. It was founded in 1998 as a pastoral school in Dansoman. Among the stated aims of the university is to provide an \"integrated and biblically-based tertiary education with particular reference to the needs of the African continent\". It is currently the biggest private university in Ghana.\n\nIn 1988, the \"Central Bible College\" was born. In 1993, it became the \"Christian University College\" and became the Central University College (CUC) in the year 1997 after a change of name.\n\nCentral University College (CUC) is a privately owned university colleges in Ghana. Owned by the International Central Gospel Church, its founder and Chancellor, Rev. Dr. Mensa Otabil has within the last two decades, emerged as a leading voice in African Christianity advocating for a proper synthesis of Christian religious expression and the translation of spirituality into practical everyday action. The Idea of CUC was birthed in 1988.\n\nCUC started as a short-term pastoral training institute mainly for pastors of ICGC. It became a Christian University College in 1993 expanding its programs over the years to include the academic study of Christian Theology, Business Administration, Economics, Computer Science and a select number of modern languages including French. Most of its current programs are offered up to the graduate level and has seen the establishment of the schools of architecture and pharmacy in the 2008/2009 academic year. In 1998, the university college was accredited by the (NAB). A Ghanaian newspaper feature on CUC that appeared in \"The Spectator\" of Saturday 16 October 2007 described CUC as \"a University college in a class of its own\". The Valley View University of the Seventh Day Adventist Church was established before CUC.\n\nTen (10) years down the line, CUC's development has been phenomenal with the construction of a permanent campus in Miotso, near Dahwenya. On 26 October 2007 CUC relocated a greater part of its campus from the heart of Accra, the capital to Miotso a community near Dawhenya in the Greater Accra Region.\n\nThe University's first Registrar Mr. Johnson Kanda was the first employee of the university who drafted and put together almost all the documentation needed for the university he served a period of 10 years between 1998 and 2008.\n\nThe university's chancellor Rev.

He took over from Rev. Prof. Kingsley Larbi who was the principal of Central Christian College, Ghana. His distinguished pioneering efforts at the then Central Christian College led to the establishment of Central University College, Ghana, where he served as its first President or Vice-Chancellor from November 1998 until July 2003. The university is now headed by Prof. Kwesi Yankah, who serves as the university's new president. He took over from Prof V. P. Y.

{"id": "55008943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55008943", "title": "Critical university studies", "text": "Critical university studies\n\nCritical university studies (CUS) is a new field examining the role of higher education in contemporary society and its relation to culture, politics, and labor. Arising primarily from Cultural Studies, it takes a critical stance toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong public model of higher education to a neoliberal privatized model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are corporatization, academic labor, and student debt, among other issues.\n\nLike those doing research under the banner of Critical Legal Studies (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent. CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes.\n\nIn contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like Harvard and Yale, CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them tenured professors, graduate students, and adjunct instructors.\n\nThe term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\". The piece, “An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe,” describes the “new wave of criticism of higher education” that came to the fore in the 1990s and has gained momentum in the ensuing decades. This new work has primarily come from literary and cultural critics, as well as those in education, history, sociology, and labor studies. As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to Thorstein Veblen’s \"The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men\" (1918) and Upton Sinclair’s \"The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education\" (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and Gilded Age wealth on the emerging university system.\n\nIn addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and anti-war and civil rights protests were a major presence on US campuses. The Critical Pedagogy movement, inspired by Paolo Freire and furthered by Henry Giroux and others, arose from this moment. The feminist movement also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like Adrienne Rich calling for “a women-centered university.”\n\nIn 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement. Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the University of Minnesota (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian autonomist movement.\n\nThis first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's \"Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University\" (1997), David Noble's \"Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education\" (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and \"How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation\" (2008). In addition, \"Steal This University: The Rise of the Corporate University and the Academic Labor Movement\", edited by Benjamin Johnson et al. (2003), Stefano Harney and Fred Moten's “The University and the Undercommons\" (2004), Williams’ “The Post-Welfare State University” (2006) and “Student Debt and the Spirit of Indenture” (2008), and Christopher Newfield's \"Unmaking the Public University: The Forty-Year Assault on the Middle Class\" (2008).\n\nMore recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of entrepreneurial values, and globalization. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's \"The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them\" (2016), Benjamin Ginsberg's \"The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters\" (2011), Robert Samuels’ \"Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities\" (2013). In addition, Jacob Rooksby's \"The Branding of the American Mind\" (2016), Avery Wiscomb's “The Entrepreneurship Racket” (2016), and Heather Steffen's \"Inventing Our University: Student-Faculty Collaboration in Critical University Studies” (2017).\n\nIn addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in \"The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education\" (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume \"The Transnational Politics of Higher Education\" (2016) looks at globalization.\n\nAlthough continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes:\n\n\nCritical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty-student advocacy group, and the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic Andrew Ross has worked).\n\nCUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like Jacobin, the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB), Salon and HuffPost. Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation.\n\nAlongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the National Labor Relations Act and could unionize. Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the United Automobile Workers (UAW) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).\n\nThe journal \"Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor\", co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism. In addition, 2015 saw the formation of \"Academic Labor: Research and Artistry\", a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.\nIn book publishing, The Johns Hopkins University Press initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, Palgrave also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.\n\nOn the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university.\n\nScholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.\n\n"}

{"id": "96009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96009", "title": "Emotional intelligence", "text": "Emotional intelligence\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI), Emotional leadership (EL), Emotional quotient (EQ) and Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ), is the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s).\n\nAlthough the term first appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by author and science journalist Daniel Goleman. Since this time, EI, and Goleman's 1995 analysis, have been criticized within the scientific community, despite prolific reports of its usefulness in the popular press.\n\nEmpathy is typically associated with EI, because it relates to an individual connecting their personal experiences with those of others. However, a number of models exist that aim to measure levels of (empathy) EI. There are currently several models of EI. Goleman's original model may now be considered a \"mixed model\" that combines what has since been modeled separately as \"ability EI\" and \"trait EI\". Goleman defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance. The \"trait model\" was developed by Konstantin Vasily Petrides in 2001. It \"encompasses behavioral dispositions and self perceived abilities and is measured through self report\". The \"ability model\", developed by Peter Salovey and John Mayer in 2004, focuses on the individual's ability to process emotional information and use it to navigate the social environment.\n\nStudies have shown that people with high EI have greater mental health, job performance, and leadership skills although no causal relationships have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to general intelligence and specific personality traits rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ. Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is non-significant when ability and personality are controlled for, and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership. Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade. In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.\n\nCriticisms have centered on whether EI is a real intelligence and whether it has incremental validity over IQ and the Big Five personality traits.\n\nThe term \"emotional intelligence\" seems first to have appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, and in the 1966 paper by B. Leuner entitled \"Emotional intelligence and emancipation\" which appeared in the psychotherapeutic journal: \"Practice of child psychology and child psychiatry\".\n\nIn 1983, Howard Gardner's \"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences\" introduced the idea that traditional types of intelligence, such as IQ, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He introduced the idea of multiple intelligences which included both \"interpersonal intelligence\" (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and \"intrapersonal intelligence\" (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).\n\nThe term subsequently appeared in Wayne Payne's doctoral thesis, \"A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence\" in 1985.\n\nThe first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987 in the British Mensa magazine.\n\nIn 1989 Stanley Greenspan put forward a model to describe EI, followed by another by Peter Salovey and John Mayer published in the following year.\n\nHowever, the term became widely known with the publication of Goleman's book: \"Emotional Intelligence – Why it can matter more than IQ\" (1995). It is to this book's best-selling status that the term can attribute its popularity. Goleman has followed up with several further popular publications of a similar theme that reinforce use of the term.\nTo date, tests measuring EI have not replaced IQ tests as a standard metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.\n\nThe distinction between trait emotional intelligence and ability emotional intelligence was introduced in 2000.\n\nEmotional intelligence has been defined as \"the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior\" by Peter Salovey and John Mayer. This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities are distinct yet related. Emotional intelligence also reflects abilities to join intelligence, empathy and emotions to enhance thought and understanding of interpersonal dynamics. However, substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:\n\nDifferent models of EI have led to the development of various instruments for the assessment of the construct. While some of these measures may overlap, most researchers agree that they tap different constructs.\n\nSpecific ability models address the ways in which emotions facilitate thought and understanding. For example, emotions may interact with thinking and allow people to be better decision makers (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005). A person who is more responsive emotionally to crucial issues will attend to the more crucial aspects of his or her life. Aspects of emotional facilitation factor is to also know how to include or exclude emotions from thought depending on context and situation. This is also related to emotional reasoning and understanding in response to the people, environment and circumstances one encounters in his or her day-to-day life.\n\nSalovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence. Following their continuing research, their initial definition of EI was revised to \"The ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions and to regulate emotions to promote personal growth.\" However, after pursuing further research, their definition of EI evolved into \"the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth.\" \n\nThe ability-based model views emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment. The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to relate emotional processing to a wider cognition. This ability is seen to manifest itself in certain adaptive behaviors. The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:\n\nThe ability EI model has been criticized in the research for lacking face and predictive validity in the workplace. However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to standard performance scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.\n\nThe current measure of Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items. Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based IQ tests. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.\n\nCentral to the four-branch model is the idea that EI requires attunement to social norms. Therefore, the MSCEIT is scored in a consensus fashion, with higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 emotion researchers.\n\nAlthough promoted as an ability test, the MSCEIT is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items do not have objectively correct responses. Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means that it is impossible to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally \"intelligent\" only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.\n\nIn a study by Føllesdal, the MSCEIT test results of 111 business leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was found that there were no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to empathy, ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the MSCEIT test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.\n\nVarious other specific measures have also been used to assess ability in emotional intelligence. These measures include:\n\nThe model introduced by Daniel Goleman focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs (for more details see \"What Makes A Leader\" by Daniel Goleman, best of Harvard Business Review 1998):\n\n\nGoleman includes a set of emotional competencies within each construct of EI. Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance. Goleman posits that individuals are born with a general emotional intelligence that determines their potential for learning emotional competencies. Goleman's model of EI has been criticized in the research literature as mere \"pop psychology\" (Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade, 2008).\n\nTwo measurement tools are based on the Goleman model:\n\nKonstantinos Vasilis Petrides (\"K. V. Petrides\") proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a trait based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications. Trait EI is \"a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality.\" In lay terms, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by self report, as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a personality framework. An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional self-efficacy.\n\nThe trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the taxonomy of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.\n\nThere are many self-report measures of EI, including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence. The most widely used and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the BarOn EQ-i, it was the first self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.\n\nThe TEIQue provides an operationalization for the model of Petrides and colleagues, that conceptualizes EI in terms of personality. The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: well-being, self-control, emotionality, and sociability. The psychometric properties of the TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally normally distributed and reliable.\n\nThe researchers also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning (Raven's matrices), which they interpreted as support for the personality trait view of EI (as opposed to a form of intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness) as well as inversely related to others (alexithymia, neuroticism). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores. Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.\n\nA review published in the journal of \"Annual Psychology\" found that higher emotional intelligence is positively correlated with:\n\nGoleman's early work has been criticized for assuming from the beginning that EI is a type of intelligence or cognitive ability. Eysenck (2000) writes that Goleman's description of EI contains unsubstantiated assumptions about intelligence in general, and that it even runs contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence:\n\n\"[Goleman] exemplifies more clearly than most the fundamental absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits that they might be quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis.\"\nSimilarly, Locke (2005) claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp abstractions—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.\n\nThe essence of this criticism is that scientific inquiry depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and that before the introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states. Thus, some scholars believe that the term \"EI\" merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.\n\nAdam Grant warned of the common but mistaken perception of EI as a desirable moral quality rather than a skill, Grant asserting that a well-developed EI is not only an instrumental tool for accomplishing goals, but has a dark side as a weapon for manipulating others by robbing them of their capacity to reason.\n\nLandy (2005) claimed that the few incremental validity studies conducted on EI have shown that it adds little or nothing to the explanation or prediction of some common outcomes (most notably academic and work success). Landy suggested that the reason why some studies have found a small increase in predictive validity is a methodological fallacy, namely, that alternative explanations have not been completely considered:\n\n\"EI is compared and contrasted with a measure of abstract intelligence but not with a personality measure, or with a personality measure but not with a measure of academic intelligence.\" Landy (2005)\nSimilarly, other researchers have raised concerns about the extent to which self-report EI measures correlate with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits. Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the Big Five that stand out as most related to self-report EI – neuroticism and extroversion. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and anxiety. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.\n\nThe interpretations of the correlations between EI questionnaires and personality have been varied. The prominent view in the scientific literature is the Trait EI view, which re-interprets EI as a collection of personality traits.\n\nOne criticism of the works of Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001), which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).\n\nFurther criticism has been leveled by Brody (2004), who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT \"tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed\". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.\n\nNew research is surfacing that suggests that ability EI measures might be measuring personality in addition to general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies)[cite source]. For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004), showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.\n\nThey gave a multiple correlation (R) of .81 with the MSCEIT (perfect prediction would be 1). This result has been replicated by Fiori and Antonakis (2011),; they found a multiple R of .76 using Cattell’s \"Culture Fair\" intelligence test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI); significant covariates were intelligence (standardized beta = .39), agreeableness (standardized beta = .54), and openness (standardized beta = .46). Antonakis and Dietz (2011a), who investigated the Ability Emotional Intelligence Measure found similar results (Multiple R = .69), with significant predictors being intelligence, standardized beta = .69 (using the Swaps Test and a Wechsler scales subtest, the 40-item General Knowledge Task) and empathy, standardized beta = .26 (using the Questionnaire Measure of Empathic Tendency)--see also Antonakis and Dietz (2011b), who show how including or excluding important controls variables can fundamentally change results—thus, it is important to always include important controls like personality and intelligence when examining the predictive validity of ability and trait EI models.\n\nMore formally termed socially desirable responding (SDR), faking good is defined as a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias has long been known to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland & Ryan, 2000; Peebles & Moore, 1998; Nichols & Greene, 1997; Zerbe & Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols & Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).\n\nIt has been suggested that responding in a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls & Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus & Reid, 2001).\n\nThere are a few methods to prevent socially desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe it is necessary to warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a personality test (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales in order to determine the likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.\n\nLandy distinguishes between the \"commercial wing\" and \"the academic wing\" of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI as seen by the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that \"the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership\". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions \"the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards.\" Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in \"proprietary databases\", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification. Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.\n\nIn an academic exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership have not done so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ. Antonakis argued that EI might not be needed for leadership effectiveness (he referred to this as the \"curse of emotion\" phenomenon, because leaders who are too sensitive to their and others' emotional states might have difficulty making decisions that would result in emotional labor for the leader or followers). A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only ρ = 0.11 with measures of transformational leadership. Ability-measures of EI fared worst (i.e., ρ = 0.04); the WLEIS (Wong-Law measure) did a bit better (ρ = 0.08), and the Bar-On measure better still (ρ = 0.18). However, the validity of these estimates does not include the effects of IQ or the big five personality, which correlate both with EI measures and leadership. In a subsequent paper analyzing the impact of EI on both job performance and leadership, Harms and Credé found that the meta-analytic validity estimates for EI dropped to zero when Big Five traits and IQ were controlled for. Joseph and Newman meta-analytically showed the same result for Ability EI.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that self-reported and Trait EI measures retain a fair amount of predictive validity for job performance after controlling Big Five traits and IQ. Newman, Joseph, and MacCann contend that the greater predictive validity of Trait EI measures is due to their inclusion of content related to achievement motivation, self efficacy, and self-rated performance. Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the predictive ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.\n\nThe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has recognized that because there are divisions about the topic of emotional intelligence, the mental health community needs to agree on some guidelines to describe good mental health and positive mental living conditions. In their section, \"Positive Psychology and the Concept of Health\", they explain. \"Currently there are six competing models of positive health, which are based on concepts such as being above normal, character strengths and core virtues, developmental maturity, social-emotional intelligence, subjective well-being, and resilience. But these concepts define health in philosophical rather than empirical terms. Dr. [Lawrence] Becker suggested the need for a consensus on the concept of positive psychological health...\".\n\nBullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence. They also have shown that emotional intelligence is a key factor in the analysis of cases of cybervictimization.\n\nby demonstrating a relevant impact on health and social adaptation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: \"accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion\". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.\n\nResearch of EI and job performance shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one. This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006) to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, & Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.\n\nA more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.\n\nAlthough studies between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance has shown mixed results of high and low correlations, EI is undeniably better predictor than most of the hiring methods commonly used in companies, such as letter of references, cover letter, among others. By 2008, 147 companies and consulting firms in U.S had developed programmes that involved EI for training and hiring employees. Van Rooy and Viswesvaran (2004) showed that EI correlated significantly with different domains in performance, ranging from .24 for job performance to .10 for academic performance. These findings may contribute organisations in different ways. For instance, employees high on EI would be more aware of their own emotions and from others, which in turn, could lead companies to better profits and less unnecessary expenses. This is especially important for expatriate managers, who have to deal with mixed emotions and feelings, while adapting to a new working culture. Moreover, employees high in EI show more confidence in their roles, which allow them to face demanding tasks positively.\n\nAccording to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ. Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase. According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006), EI contributes to develop strong and positive relationships with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles. Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations. For instance, Law et al. (2004) found that EI was the best predictor of job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006) found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.\n\nIn the job performance – emotional intelligence correlation is important to consider the effects of managing up, which refers to the good and positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor. Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the subjective rating of job performance evaluation. Emotional intelligent employees devote more of their working time on managing their relationship with supervisors. Hence, the likelihood of obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI. Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills. O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011) found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality (Five Factor model) and general cognitive ability. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below general cognitive ability. Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of publication bias.\n\nDespite the validity of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is not as strong as suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.\n\nA 2007 meta-analysis of 44 effect sizes by Schutte found that emotional intelligence was associated with better mental and physical health. Particularly, trait EI had the stronger association with mental and physical health. This was replicated again in 2010 by researcher Alexandra Martin who found trait EI as a strong predictor for health after conducting a meta-analysis based on 105 effect sizes and 19,815 participants. This meta-analysis also indicated that this line of research reached enough sufficiency and stability in concluding EI as a positive predictor for health.\n\nA 2012 study cross examined emotional intelligence, self-esteem and marijuana dependence. Out of a sample of 200, 100 of whom were dependent on cannabis and the other 100 emotionally healthy, the dependent group scored exceptionally low on EI when compared to the control group. They also found that the dependent group also scored low on self-esteem when compared to the control.\n\nAnother study in 2010 examined whether or not low levels of EI had a relationship with the degree of drug and alcohol addiction. In the assessment of 103 residents in a drug rehabilitation center, they examined their EI along with other psychosocial factors in a one-month interval of treatment. They found that participants' EI scores improved as their levels of addiction lessened as part of their treatment.\n\nIt has been noted that having EI as a skill can increase one's own well being. In other words, individuals who are conscious of the emotions of themselves and others have the privilege of enhancing relationships. It also allows people to see the multiple perspectives of a given situation, and acknowledge others' feelings about the event.\n\n"}

Founded in 1976 and accredited by the Cyprus Ministry of Education, the School provides a continuous education for boys and girls from the age of 3 years and 8 months until graduation at the age of 18. A full 15 years can be spent at the School, and \"Falcon 15ers\" receive an award at the end of their schooling.\n\nThe School profile on its website describes its aims as promoting traditional values, while looking to the future. In recent years, an ambitious renovation project has been taking place, rewiring and networking the buildings, and upgrading facilities, such as the swimming pool, which is now run on solar energy. In addition to a complete refit of the pool, the gymnasium has been re-roofed and re-floored, and a new climate-control system has been installed.\n\nExamination successes are announced on the School's website, with pass rates comparing very favourably to other similar schools in Cyprus and in the UK. Students tend to choose UK universities as their ultimate destination, with Russell Group Universities a high priority. Students are mainly prepared for UK qualifications at IGCSE/GCSE, and Advanced level for entry to UK and other universities allied to the British system, although a small minority of students choose universities in the US or countries in the EU. In 2016, the School was proud to announce that one of its students was the only undergraduate from Cyprus to gain a place at Oxford University. Each year, the School sends students to Higher Education institutions such as Cambridge, Harvard, Imperial College London, LSE, Manchester, Edinburgh, King's London, UCL, Bath, Bristol, Nottingham, Caltech, MIT, among others.\n\nThe Falcon School is one of the most diverse schools in Cyprus, with students coming from a variety of backgrounds including the UK, France, Russia, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, India, the Philippines, and the US. The school takes pupils from all ages (from kindergarten to secondary education).\n\nIn 2015, the School was the subject of a documentary-style film produced by MediaBox Productions http://mediabox.com.cy/our-work/the-falcon-school-nicosia-cyprus/\n\nNotable alumni are Apoorv Bhargava, member of the Forbes 30/30 list for 2019; Dr Emma Kelly of Nottingham University; Joanna Loizou of the Research Centre for Molecular Medicine in Austria; Sirine Saba of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Borna Alikhani, winner of a 2007 Documentary Emmy Award; Andros Papacharalambous, Mayor of Strovolos; Marlene Angelides, Eurovision Contestant; Roman Kosarev, RT Reporter; Simon Kassianides, Actor; Christiana Kafaridou, set designer with the BBC; Aaron Coatsworth, Hansard reporter at the House of Lords; Athena Markides of the Bar Council.\n\n"}

There are many different kinds of fellowships which are awarded for different reasons in academia and industry, often indicating an advanced level of scholarship.\n\nIn education and academia there are several kinds of fellowships, awarded for different reasons:\n\nThe title of research fellow is used to denote an academic research position at a university or a similar institution and is roughly equivalent to the title of lecturer in the teaching career pathway. Research fellow is also used to refer to the holder of a research fellowship. These are often shortened to the name of the programme or organization, e.g. Dorothy Hodgkin Fellow rather than Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow, except where this might cause confusion with another fellowship, e.g. Royal Society University Research Fellowship).\n\nIn the context of graduate school in the United States and Canada, a fellow is a recipient of a postgraduate fellowship. Examples include the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Rosenthal Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship and the Presidential Management Fellowship. It is granted to prospective or current students, on the basis of their academic or research achievements.\n\nIn the UK, research fellowships are awarded to support postdoctoral researchers such as those funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). At ETH Zurich, postdoctoral fellowships support incoming researchers. The MacArthur Fellows Program (aka \"genius grant\") as prestigious research fellowship awarded in the United States.\n\nThe title of (senior) teaching fellow is used to denote an academic teaching position at a university or similar institution and is roughly equivalent to the title of (senior) lecturer. The title \"(senior) fellow\" can also be bestowed to an academic member of staff upon retirement who continues to be affiliated to a university in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe term teaching fellow or teaching assistant is used, in the United States and United Kingdom, in secondary school, high school and middle school setting for students or adults that assist a teacher with one or more classes.\n\nFellowships can be awarded as a prize in their own right, e.g. the Fellowship of the Royal Society (FRS) and Fellows are often the highest grade of membership of many professional associations or learned societies, for example, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators or Royal College of Surgeons. Lower grades are referred to as members (who typically share voting rights with the fellows), or associates (who may or may not, depending on whether \"associate\" status is a form of full membership). How a fellowship is awarded varies for each society, but may typically involve some or all of these:\n\nExclusive learned societies such as the Royal Society have Fellow as the only grade of membership, others like the Faculty of Young Musicians (now defunct) have members holding the post of Associate and posts \"Honoris Causa\". The Management and Strategy Institute has two membership grades titled Fellow and Senior Fellow. Examples of Fellowship in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada include:\n\nAppointment as an honorary fellow in a learned or professional society can be either to honour exceptional achievement and/or service within the professional domain of the awarding body or to honour contributions related to the domain from someone who is professionally outside it. Membership of the awarding body may or may not be a requirement.\n\nAt the ancient universities of the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and Trinity College, Dublin, members of the teaching staff typically have two affiliations: one as a reader, lecturer, or other academic rank within a department of the university, as at other universities, and a second affiliation as a fellow\nof one of the colleges of the university.\nThe fellows, sometimes referred to as University dons, form the governing body of the college. They may elect a council to handle day-to-day management. All fellows are entitled to certain privileges within their colleges, which may include dining at High Table (free of charge) and possibly the right to a room in college (free of charge).\n\nAt Cambridge, retired academics may remain fellows. At Oxford, however, a Governing Body fellow would normally be elected a \"fellow emeritus\" and would leave the Governing Body upon his or her retirement. Distinguished old members of the college, or its benefactors and friends, might also be elected 'Honorary Fellow', normally for life; but beyond limited dining rights this is merely an honour. Most Oxford colleges have 'Fellows by Special Election' or 'Supernumerary Fellows', who may be members of the teaching staff, but not necessarily members of the Governing Body.\n\nSome senior administrators of a college such as bursars are made fellows, and thereby become members of the governing body, because of their importance to the running of a college.\n\nAt Harvard University and some other universities in the United States, \"fellows\" are members of the Board of Trustees who hold administrative positions as non-executive trustee rather than academics.\n\nIn US medical institutions, a fellow refers to someone who has completed residency training (e.g. in internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, etc.) and is currently in a 1 to 3 year subspecialty training program (e.g. cardiology, pediatric nephrology, transplant surgery, etc.).\n\nCorporations in research and development - intensive industries (e.g., IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Google or Apple in information technology, Bell Labs, Northrop Grumman or L3 Technologies in telecommunications, United Technologies in aerospace, and Boston Scientific in medical devices, for example) and large scientific organizations (e.g., NASA, ORNL) appoint a very small number of top senior researchers as corporate or technical Fellows, either in Science or in Engineering. These are internationally recognized R&D leaders who are among the smartest individuals in the world in their respective fields.\n\nFellow is the most senior rank or title one can achieve in a scientific or engineering career, though some fellows also hold business titles such as Vice President or Chief Technology Officer.\n\nExamples of Science and Engineering Fellows in research and development - intensive organizations include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe title fellow can be used for participants in a professional development program run by a nonprofit or governmental organization. This type of fellowship is a short term work opportunity (1–2 years) for professionals who already possess some level of academic or professional expertise that will serve the nonprofit mission. Fellows are given a stipend as well as professional experience and leadership training.\n"}

It was established by an Act of the State Parliament of Victoria in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies to establish the second university in the state of Victoria.\n\nMonash University is a commissioned Victorian university. It was established by an Act of the State Parliament of Victoria in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies to establish the second university in the state of Victoria. The university was named after the prominent Australian general Sir John Monash. This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city or state.\n\nThe original campus was in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Clayton (falling in what is now the City of Monash). The first University Council, led by Monash's first Chancellor Sir Robert Blackwood, selected a British professor of engineering, Sir Louis Matheson, to be the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976. The University was granted an expansive site of 115 hectares of land at Clayton, after it had argued that, in the distant future, it was possible that Monash would have up to 12,000 students.\n\nFrom its first intake of 347 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967, it had enrolled more than 21,000 students since its establishment. It was originally intended to have an emphasis on science and technology. However, it quickly expanded beyond this. In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics and politics, education and law. Initially, it was best known for its strong research capacity in the sciences and for its innovative teaching in law and medicine. Along with the University of New South Wales and the Australian National University, it also attracted interest for its focus on Asia. Along with UNSW, it was the major provider for international student places under the Colombo Plan, which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.\n\nIn its early years of teaching, research and administration, Monash had the advantage of no entrenched traditional practices. This enabled it to adopt modern approaches without resistance from those who preferred the status quo. Matheson had also deliberately selected young, talented staff to fuel the rapid rise of the University. A modern administrative structure was set up, Australia's first research centres and scholarships devoted to Indigenous Australians were established, and, thanks to Monash's entirely new facilities, students in wheelchairs were able to enroll. By contrast, Melbourne University struggled to enter the modern educational era, to the point that there was talk of a Royal Commission to overcome its antiquated style. In other respects, however, the youth of Monash was a burden. While Louis Matheson had good relations with government, Monash in the 1960s existed in a city where almost all professionals had attended Melbourne University. This meant that many officials and heads of professional bodies were \"unsympathetic\" to Monash's requests. For example, it was many years before the Faculty of Medicine received funding for Monash Medical Centres to complement its teaching and research.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of student radicalism in Australia. It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia's role in Vietnam War and conscription. The origins of mass student demonstrations in Melbourne were those against capital punishment, and some of the largest protests occurred at Monash in the final years before it was abolished in Victoria. By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins. In 1971, for example, over 4500 students—a substantial proportion of the Monash student population at the time—carried out a blockade on University Council chambers. The student meetings held at Monash during this time remain the largest in Australia's history. In May 1969, one meeting saw over 6,000 gather to vote against a disciplinary statute passed by the University Council. The most famous student radical was Albert Langer, who regularly made newspaper headlines and caused major disruptions at the Clayton Campus. So great was publicity surrounding the protests that many in Australia and around the world first heard of Monash not because of its teaching and research, but because of its protests. In one extraordinary event that came to be known as the Monash Siege, students forced then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to hide in a basement at the Alexander Theatre, in a major protest over the Whitlam dismissal. In recent years, student radicalism has died down, although there have been occasional protests on government higher education policy.\n\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, Monash's most publicised research came through its pioneering of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Led by Professors Carl Wood and Alex Lopata, the Monash IVF Program achieved the world's first early IVF pregnancy in 1973. In 1980, the first IVF baby in Australia was born at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne as a result of the work of Alex Lopata and Ian Johnston. This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the University at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down. In addition to the Medicine Faculty's work in IVF, Monash academics shaped the practice in other ways. Professor Louis Waller of the Law School created the model IVF legislation adopted in Victoria, and philosophers Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse led the world in their consideration of the ethical implications of IVF, establishing the Centre for Human Bioethics in 1980.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Dawkins Reforms changed the landscape of higher education in Australia. All Australian universities either sought to expand and consolidate their teaching and research bases, or merged with larger institutions. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Mal Logan, Monash transformed dramatically. In 1988, Monash University had only one campus, Clayton, with around 15,000 students. Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.\n\nThe expansion began in 1990, with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. In 1991, Monash, to the surprise of many, merged with the Victorian College of Pharmacy, which most people had predicted would merge with the University of Melbourne. Monash University's expansion continued in 1994, with the establishment of the Berwick Campus. So great was the University's expansion that it was reported at the time that Monash might attempt a takeover of La Trobe University, but this did not happen.\n\nIn 1998, the University opened the Malaysia Campus, its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in Malaysia, after a longstanding presence in South East Asia. In 2001, the Johannesburg Campus opened its doors, making Monash the first foreign university in South Africa. The same year, the University secured an 18th-century Tuscan Palace to open a research and teaching centre in Prato, Italy. This expansion made Monash one of the world's most internationalised universities, but in fact the University administrators in the late 1990s contemplated going even further than they did. They explored the possibility of, and devoted much energy to, opening campuses in Thailand, Laos and Indonesia, but these plans were not followed through. While the University has established the IITB-Monash Research Academy with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, and has made its international focus explicit, it has stated that no further large-scale international campuses are planned within the next few years. Monash has also established study and research exchange links with over 120 partner universities around the world.\n\nAt the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most, to the point that today around 30% of its students are from outside Australia. Today, Monash students come from over 100 different countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with its expansion, meant that Monash's income skyrocketed throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia's top 200 exporters.\n\nIn recent years, the University has been particularly prominent in medical research. A highlight of this came in 2000, when Professor Alan Trounson led the team of scientists which first announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of stem cells. To capitalise on its medical research capacity, the University has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to develop large research facilities at its Clayton Campus. In 2006, the University began developing the $138 million Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, which will be one of the largest stem cell research centres in the world when it opens in 2008. In addition to this, the University now houses the Australian Stem Cell Centre, Nanotechnology Victoria Limited (NanoVic), Stem Cell Sciences Limited and the largest monoclonal antibody production facility in the Southern Hemisphere. Such developments have made Monash the main location of stem cell research in Australia. It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine. In 2010, the John Monash Science School, Victoria's first specialist select-entry high school for students gifted in maths, science and technology, opened at the Clayton Campus.\n\nOn 21 October 2002 Huan Yun \"Allen\" Xiang shot two people dead and injured five others on the Clayton campus.\nThe current Vice-Chancellor of Monash University Professor Margaret Gardner. On 30 May 2008, Monash University celebrated its 50th Anniversary.\n\n"}

The WPA workers housed at the camp built the nearby Holliday Lake State Park, and also worked on a New Deal reforestation demonstration project begun in 1935 to reclaim depleted farmland in the surrounding area. At the completion of the federal project, the WPA camp was turned over to the state of Virginia over a number of years for use as a state forest and park.\n\nThe WPA camp was not in use by 1941, it was owned by the Federal government but operated by the Virginia State Conservation Commission. The local Lions Club asked the State Conservation Commission to make improvements to the roads and buildings and complete Rural Electrification Administration hookups in the area. The 4-H Club took over the camp in 1941 and has used and expanded the facility up to the present. The 4-H Club currently leases the camp from the State Department of Forestry.\n\nThe historic portion of the camp includes 23 contributing buildings, 2 contributing sites, and 1 contributing structure. They include a dining center, 15 cabins and associated cabin site, a girl's bunk house and boy's bunk house, and a covered open-air amphitheater. Much of the historic area of the camp is contained within two natural ridges surrounding a man-made terraced field.\n\nThe Camp is one of the few surviving examples of a WPA camp in Virginia, mainly due to its continuous operation as a 4-H camp since 1941. Survival of camp residential areas is unusual as they were intended as temporary facilities, most were disassembled by the 1950s. While an individual building was sometimes maintained, only one other complex of buildings as been noted in Virginia, a former CCC camp now called Natural Bridge Juvenile Correction Center in Rockbridge County. The Holiday Lake WPA camp differs from the CCC camp in that CCC camps were generally organized in military style and favored larger barracks-style accommodations. The WPA camp features several eight-person cabins and only one larger barracks.\n\nThe Camp was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\n\nThe state park uses the double L spelling \"Holliday\", after the family that owned land in the area. One of the three creeks that fills adjacent man-made lake in the area is also spelled \"Holliday Creek\" for the same reason. Some sources call the lake \"Holliday Lake\", while some online maps refer to it as \"Holiday Lake\".\n\nThe name of the 4-H camp is spelled with one L, Holiday Lake 4-H Camp, as is the name of the NRHP listing, Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center.\n\n"}

It is aiming and organizing the multifold scientific research of the recent past and the present age. Besides history it is widening its focus on other social sciences as well. It helps the birth of new scientific results with tenders, scholarships, support of individual and team researches. It enables the public usage of the documents of national value kept in the Archives and Library of the Institute. Besides the historical and societal research works, it hosts scientific conferences and cultural events as well. It is a kind of intellectual center that is concentrating first of all on renewing and popularizing social criticism in the widest range of the term. For the publication of the results of the researches the Foundation operates a detached publishing house, \"Napvilág Kiadó\", and publishes the historical quarterly \"Múltunk\" (Our Past).\n\nThe precursor of the Archives was established in 1948. It served as a department of the Institute of Labour Movement of the Hungarian Workers' Party until 1955, of the Institute of Party History of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party from 1957, of the Institute of Political History of the Hungarian Socialist Party between 1989 and 1998, and as a part of the non-profit organization of the Institute of Political History from 1998. Its maintainer is the Foundation of Political History. Before the year 1989, the Archives had been collecting primarily the documents of the pre-1945 legal and illegal movements of the Hungarian labour movement, of the parties of the popular democratic period following the First World War, of the left-wing youth organizations, and of the people connected to these movements and organizations. Now it is storing the documents of the Hungarian Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party as well until 1992. Since 1998 it has been storing the documents of the Hungarian trade-unionist movement that were produced during the period of 1945 to 1989 and which had previously been stored in the Central Archives of Trade Unions. Nowadays the Archives are focusing not merely on the political Left, but also on the entire Hungarian history of the modern age.

She attended local schools and the Wheeling Female Seminary in Wheeling, Virginia (now in West Virginia).\n\nIn 1866, after she had taught for several years, Isabella was invited by her brother James Mills Thoburn, a Methodist Episcopal missionary in India, to assist him in his educational and missionary work in India. She delayed her departure until 1869, when the formation of the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church enabled her to undertake missionary work under denominational affiliation and auspices.\n\nIn India, Thoburn's work culminated in the founding of an important woman’s college, Isabella Thoburn College in Lucknow (1870), as well as a Methodist High School in Kanpur. These two educational establishments were among the first in colonial India, catering to the educational and religious needs of an emergent Anglo Indian population in Awadh.\n\nThoburn returned to the United States for a period to study at Lucy Rider Meyer's Chicago Training School for City, Home, and Foreign Missions in Illinois. In 1887, Meyer appointed her as the first house mother and superintendent of the school's new Methodist Deaconess Home for training female deacons.\n\nShe died in 1901 in Lucknow, India.\n\n\n\n"}

During the first 36 years of his career his paintings were entirely non-figurative. His style changed in 1995 when he moved his studio from New York City to a rural community in upstate New York. While continuing to be abstract his paintings thereafter contained figurative elements and were seen to have greater emotional content. Throughout his career his work frequently appeared in solo and group exhibitions in both commercial and public galleries. It has been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum, National Gallery of Art, and other major American art museums. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981 and a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1983.\n\nBerthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York, and, from age two, was raised on a truck farm in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, 175 miles to the south. As a child, he received his first drawing lessons from his maternal grandmother who was also his primary caregiver. Having completed his education at local public schools, he briefly enrolled in a commercial art school in Pittsburgh before moving on to New York where, from 1960 to 1962, he attended evening classes at Pratt Institute and from 1960 to 1961 at the New School for Social Research. Berthot later credited a Pratt instructor, Hank Raleigh, with getting him a start as a professional painter. The classes he took gave him relatively little grounding in the technique or history of art, but he learned much from hours spent in museums. He also learned much from other artists, particularly Milton Resnick who, as he later said, took him under his wing and through his friendship and guidance I became more aware of the real possibility of painting.\"\n\nBerthot began his career making abstract paintings in the minimalist tradition. He would apply a thick painterly surface to large shaped canvases that were seen to employ the reductive means of minimalism, but expressing instead of restraining emotion. Despite its simplicity of means, his work was said to deal \"more in feelings than in analysis.\" Painted in 1969, \"Lovella's Thing\" is a good example of his style at this time. Shortly before his death, Berthot explained the way in which it evolved: \"With Lovella's Thing I originally thought of painting the middle a flat, blank color, but when I got into it, putting down a lot of acrylic washes, I just started to paint it in a more felt way. So it became a kind of dialect between something very concrete and something very felt. I liked the blunt presence the shape had on the wall and then penetrating the surface in the middle in what I suppose could be called a Rothkoesque kind of way.\"\n\nIn the mid-1970s Berthot's style evolved. His work continued to have a painterly, lyrical quality, but he added bright colors to the muted palette of earlier work and introduced rectangular bars and ovals into canvases that were now simple rectangles. Regarding the bars, he later said that he worked to uncover the tension points, or focal points, that were inherent in the vertical and horizontal axes of a grid. He said he sought \"a balance between the object and the opening,\" and thereby \"to gradually achieve balance between my two influences: the systemic and the felt.\" \"Yellow Bar With Red,\" of 1977 is typical of paintings in this period. Another well-known painting from this period, \"Walken's Ridge,\" 1975-1976, is somewhat unusual. Although a pure abstraction, it has the size and shape of Monet's Water Lily paintings—14 feet wide in two equal sections— and has, as Berthot said, the feel of a landscape. \nDuring the 1980s Berthot began to exhibit etchings and drawings along with his paintings. The drawings were often graphite on a background of a gray enamel. The lines frequently formed ovoid shapes and were accompanied by quasi-calligraphic markings. A critic said this work contained a \"poetic lyricism\" that could be accessed \"not at a cognitive level but at a more elemental, intuitive one.\" Berthot later told an interviewer that in it \"gradually feeling began to predominate.\" The paintings of this period continued to employ ovals and rectangles in canvases on which the \"materiality of pigment,\" as one critic noted, produced \"a highly tactile surface.\" Another critic wrote that \"the shimmering, encrusted surfaces of the 'ovals' are reminiscent of Claude Monet's late Waterlilies. The use of gold with deep reds and bright blues recall Medieval icons.\" Of his work at this time, Berthot said: \"I try to break the code of painting and let it take on its own life without any code.\"\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Berthot continued to employ bars and ovals in paintings. Of this period in his career, Berthot later said, \"I reached another point where the idea was closing in on itself, there was too much idea; the paintings started to feel too literal, too much like a figure in space. I wanted something more organic, more felt.\" He said that he wanted to \"make the painting something you experience rather than just see.\" His \"Hard Line\" of 1980-83 is an early example of this approach, showing a rectangle in a muted background having bright accents that a critic said were and unexpected fiery flame. In 1994, Pepe Karmel, writing in the \"New York Times\", said of works like these: \"Despite the lack of recognizable imagery, the paintings seem haunted by a nostalgia for representation.\" The oval shape appears as well in Berthot's drawings and etchings of this period some of which had representational content, including most often an ovoid skull.\n\nApart from a brief period spent in Maine, Berthot had lived in New York City from the time he moved there in 1959 until the day in 1994 when he moved his home and studio about 100 miles north of the city to a rural spot in Ulster County along the Hudson Valley in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. At this time he made a gradual transition from abstract paintings that had no clear subject to ones that, while continuing to be abstract in character, had the natural environment as their subject. Of this transition, Berthot said: \"Even though my work now is landscape-based, it is more abstract than it was a few years ago. It is dealing with the space in the middle. At first I was painting the volume of the tree in space. Next, what I felt was that space itself has volume. And now, it is the light that has volume.\" The painting, \"Chapel Trail Near Alter Road\" shows the direction that his work took at this time. His drawings similarly enlarged the scope of their subjects as the untitled tree drawing of 2002 shows.\n\nThroughout his career, Berthot consciously kept aloof from the labeled art movements of his time. He once said, \"I am not interested in the new but in trying to make paintings that refuse to grow old,\" and on another occasion, speaking of an affinity he felt with Cézanne's approach to his work, he said: \"His clear method ... is not a closure but an opening... You have to have a form and method and within that form and method, at a certain point you have to become the servant of the painting.\" Summing up this attitude on another occasion he said that as he worked a time would come when he felt that a painting would take over his consciousness \"to dictate what it wanted to be.\" His paintings were his companions as well as the focus of his life. When the Phillips Collection asked to mount a major retrospective of combining the many works of his that it owned along with the work then in his studio, he declined saying he could not live without having the paintings around him.\n\nDuring the course of his career critics had pointed to an increasing emotional impact in his paintings and one or two of them had said that while the paintings could be comprehended entirely on their own merits, it was possible to see in them Berthot's responses to the personal difficulties he encountered over the years of his career. While he was undergoing treatment for leukemia during the last few years of his life, Berthot produced paintings that have been seen to possess a high level of emotional content. Writing in 2015, a friend of his, the artist Elisa Jensen, referred to them as \"haunting, haunted, living, breathing, and absolutely undeniably alive.\" Concerning one of them, called \"Night, Wood, and Rock,\" a friend said it was \"pure essence, stripped of all inessentials,\" and that his close observation of it infused him with a \"serene acceptance of life's glory, suspended always above death, no matter death's imminence or seeming finality.\"\n\nBerthot's earliest exhibitions were at the Feiner, Park Place, and O.K. Harris galleries and the Jewish and Whitney museums in New York. He was given solo shows at the Feiner Gallery, 42 Fifth Avenue, in 1963, and the O.K. Harris Gallery, 465 West Broadway, in 1970, and was included in group exhibitions at the Jewish Museum, in 1970, the Whitney Museum, in 1971. Before showing at O.K. Harris Berthot had been supporting himself as an art instructor. He later said the gallery's owner, Ivan Karp had enabled him to work full-time in his studio by giving him a living allowance equal to his teaching salary.\n\nDuring the 1970s he exhibited frequently in commercial galleries and museums. He was given a solo show at O.K. Harris in 1975, appeared in a charity exhibition at the Cayman Gallery in 1977, was selected to appear in a show called \"Artists Choose Artists\" at the CDS Gallery (1982), and appeared in a solo exhibition at the McKee Gallery (1983). In addition, paintings of his appeared in shows at the Whitney Museum Downtown Branch (1974), Corcoran Gallery (1975), Baltimore Museum of Art (1975), Venice Biennale (1976), Aldrich Museum (1978), Brockton Art Museum (1980), and the Hudson River Museum (1983).\n\nDuring the 1980s Berthot continued to show at the McKee Gallery. He also showed at the Cava Gallery, Philadelphia, in 1987 and the Nielson Gallery, Boston, in 1998 and 2000. During this time his work continued to appear in museum exhibitions including the Museum of Modern Art. The Museum of Modern Art included works by Berthot in \"New Works on Paper\" (1981), \"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\" (1984), and \"Contrasts of Form: Geometric Abstract Art, 1910-1980\" (1985). His work was also included in exhibitions at the Berkeley Art Museum (1984), the galleries of Muhlenberg and Lafayette colleges (1984), Mandeville Gallery, University of California, San Diego (1986), the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1987). In 1988 he was given a retrospective exhibition at the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University.\n\nUntil about 2004 he continued to be represented by the McKee Gallery and thereafter by the Betty Cunningham Gallery which, since his death, has also represented his estate. Museum exhibitions from the early 1990s include: \"Slow Art: Painting in New York Now\" at P.S.1, Long Island City, New York (1992), \"Square Painting/Plane Painting at the Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle, Washington (1997), \"Jake Berthot\" at the Phillips Collection (1998), \"Against The Grain\" at Museum of Modern Art (2006), an exhibition at Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth (2009), an exhibition at the gallery of SUNY Ulster (2010), and \"Jake Berthot: From the Collection and Promised Gifts\" at the Phillips Collection (2016).\n\nBerthot's works are owned by the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Guggenheim Museum, National Gallery of Art, Houston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. Not long before he died, he bequeathed the paintings that remained in his studio to the Phillips Collection. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981, and a National Endowment for the Arts Grant in 1983.\n\nWhile Berthot was in evening school at Pratt, a teacher asked him to take over a class for another teacher who had not shown up. He did well enough so that he was offered a job in the fall of 1961. He later said he liked the work partly because it required him to tell people what to do, \"rather than them telling me what to do.\" Berthot subsequently taught classes at Cooper Union (1974–81), Yale University (1982-92), the University of Pennsylvania (1993) and the School of Visual Arts (1994 -2013).\n\nBerthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York. His father was Earl H. Berthot (1911–1962) and his mother Sara Catherine Barr Berthot (1912–2002). His birth name was John Alex Berthot. When he was two years old his parents separated and his mother took him to her parents' eight-acre truck farm in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. At this time his grandmother, Cora Barr (1887–1969) became his primary caregiver. His grandfather, Thomas Barr (1886–1967), owned and worked the farm. Including Sara, his grandparents had three of their eleven children living with them when she returned home. The youngest of them was thirteen years older than Berthot and in that rural setting he had no companions his own age. The farm was self-sufficient but austere; there was electricity but no indoor plumbing. Before her marriage Cora had a relationship with a boyfriend who was an artist. She encouraged Berthot's early interest in drawing.\n\nHe went through the public school system where he lived and afterwards attended a commercial art school in Pittsburgh. At the age of 20 in 1959, he moved to New York City, enrolled in a school to learn window display, and got a job in that occupation in a store in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards, he married his first wife, the poet, Ginny MacKenzie, whose job, teaching at Pratt Institute, enabled him to take evening art classes there. In the early 1980s he and MacKenzie divorced and he moved briefly to Maine. Sometime later he married Kristin Flynn and some years later they too divorced.\n\nIn 2006, 11 years after his move to the rural home and studio in Accord, N.Y., Berthot seriously injured his right wrist when he fell from a ladder while pruning a tree and about six years after that he was diagnosed with a virulent form of leukemia from which he did not recover. He died on December 30, 2014.\n\nOther names used\n\nNamed John Alex Berthot at birth, he used Jake Berthot as his professional name all his life. His surname is pronounced BEAR-TOE.\n"}

Frank was born months before the family fled from Nazi Germany’s persecution of Jewish people in their native Poland Legislation to allow the family and others into the country was passed by the US Congress twice, the first having been vetoed by President Roosevelt. His father died of kidney failure when Joe was five years old. The next year his mother married Teddy Frank and changed Joe's last name.\n\nIn his twenties, Frank studied at Hofstra University in New York and later at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. In 1964, he taught five grades of English at the Sands Point Academy for Gifted Children in Sands Point, NY. From 1965-1975, Joe taught English and Russian literature and philosophy at the Dalton School in Manhattan and later, while working as a music promoter (1976-1977), became interested in the power of radio.\n\nIn 1977, Frank started volunteering at Pacifica Network station WBAI in New York, performing experimental radio involving monologues, improvisational actors, and live music during late-night, free-form hours. In 1978, he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a co-anchor for the weekend edition of National Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\", his first paying radio job.\n\nDuring this period he wrote, performed in, and produced 18 dramas for the \"NPR Playhouse,\" which won several awards. His 1982 monologue \"Lies\" was used, without permission, as the inspiration for the Martin Scorsese movie \"After Hours\". (He later settled out of court for a \"handsome\" settlement.)\n\nIn 1986, on the invitation of Ruth Hirschman Seymour, the general manager of NPR's Santa Monica, California affiliate KCRW, Frank moved to Santa Monica, where he wrote, produced, and performed in his own weekly hour-long radio program, \"Joe Frank: Work In Progress.\"\n\nWhile at KCRW, Frank received several accolades.\n\nJoe Frank continued to work at KCRW until 2002, and his work evolved, as evidenced by the diverse series he produced. The first was \"Work in Progress,\" then \"In The Dark,\" followed by \"Somewhere out There\", and finally \"The Other Side.\"\n\nBeginning in 2004, Frank began creating full-length shows for subscribers to his web site.\n\nIn 2012, Frank started producing periodic half-hour shows for KCRW's \"UnFictional\" series. He continued to produce all-new shows for the series until months before his death.\n\nStarting in 2003, Frank performed on stage at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, CA, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago, Illinois; at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco; and in Los Angeles at the Hammer Museum and Largo at the Coronet, as well as other venues.\n\nHis 230-hour body of work continues to be re-aired on the Pacifica Radio affiliate station KPFA in Berkeley, California and many NPR stations including WNYC New York, and KCRW Santa Monica. The radio station at the University of California at Davis, KDVS and the independent station WFMU in Jersey City also re-air shows.\n\nIn 2012, Frank returned to KCRW for episodes of the station's \"UnFictional\" program.\n\nFrank had surgery to treat colon cancer in May 2014. Frank was hospitalized in December 2015 due to a gastrointestinal perforation following a routine medical procedure. This led to heart issues and Joe's complete recovery took a full year. His colon cancer returned in July 2017; he had surgery in October 2017 to excise a tumor in his colon in October 2017. He died on January 15, 2018 after multiple reversals following the surgery.\n\nFrank's radio programs are often dark and ironic and employ a dry sense of humor and the sincere delivery of ideas or stories that are patently absurd. Subject matter often includes religion, life's meaning, death, and Frank's relationships with women.\n\nFrank's voice is distinctive, resonant, authoritative, and, because of his occasional voice-over work, often oddly familiar. At the 2003 Third Coast Festival, he explained that he was recording in Dolby and playing back without it, which created Joe's now familiar intimate and gritty sound. A 1987 Los Angeles Times article described it as a voice \"like dirty honey\" and \"rich as chocolate.\"\n\nThe repetitive cadence of the music, drones and Frank's dry, announcer-like delivery are sometimes mixed with recorded phone calls with actor/friends such as Larry Block, Debi Mae West and Arthur Miller (not the playwright), broken into segments over the course of each hour-long program.\n\nFrank's series \"The Other Side\" included excerpts from Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield's Dharma talks at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. In an interview on KPFA's \"Morning Show,\" Kornfield was asked about working with Joe Frank. Kornfield explained that, although he had never met or talked to Joe Frank or heard his show, he didn't mind Frank using the lectures and that many of his meditation students had found Kornfield through the show.\n\n\nA feature-length film, \"Joe Frank: Somewhere Out There\", about Frank's life and work, is scheduled for release in 2018. The film was completed prior to Frank's death and includes interviews with collaborators and other personalities.\n\nFrank's body of work has inspired a variety of other artists including:\n\n\nJoe Frank performed voice overs for commercials including Zima and the Saturn Corporation. He was the voice of the computer in Galaxy Quest and provided voiceovers for:\nHe also had a small acting role in \"The Game\".\n\n\n\n\nAfter his passing, there was an outpouring among radio producers especially:\n\n"}

It is widely recognised as one of his most important works, and as one of the most significant Norwegian literary works of the post-war era. The novel has a complex narrative taken from several different environments from the 1920s Weimar Republic and the Nazi era to the 1950s Norwegian society.\n\nThe novel's title character, \"Jonas,\" is a first grader in Norway, who early in the novel encounters a public school system that according to Bjørneboe is increasingly controlled by the \"salamanders,\" a term used metaphorically for the bigoted enemies of culture which Bjørneboe sees in Norway at the time.\n\"Jonas\" is usually interpreted as a harsh critique of the Norwegian public school system and the social democratic society of the 1950s, and has a warm portrayal of an alternative form of education, which is a thinly veiled reference to Waldorf education. At the time, Bjørneboe and his wife Lisel Bjørneboe both worked as Waldorf teachers in Oslo, and the central character \"Johannes Marx\" is inspired by Lisel. The novel however has a much broader focus than the education debate, Bjørneboe's intention was to portray the topic of humanity. To this end, he uses four main biographies, which are all ultimately linked, with a particular emphasis on the character of \"Jonas.\"\n\nIn this novel, Bjørneboe articulates his often cited idea that Nazism, broadly construed to mean hostility to the idea of humanity, could manifest itself anywhere and any time, for example in Norway in the 1950s.\n\nBjørneboe, a proponent of the conservative Riksmål language (the traditional language of the educated elite of Norway), uses the radical Samnorsk language as an expression of the lack of culture of the salamanders.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31721564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31721564", "title": "Louisiana Science Education Act", "text": "Louisiana Science Education Act\n\nThe Louisiana Science Education Act, Act 473 (SB733) of 2008 is a controversial law passed by the Louisiana Legislature on June 11, 2008 and signed into law by Governor Bobby Jindal on June 25. The act allows public school teachers to use supplemental materials in the science classroom which are critical of theories such as the theory of evolution and global warming. Louisiana was the first state to have passed a law of this type.\n\nProponents of the law state that it is meant to promote critical thinking and improve education. State Senator Ben Nevers said the law is intended to allow educators to create an environment that \"(promotes) critical thinking skills, logical analysis, and open and objective discussions of scientific theories such as evolution, the origins of life, global warming, and human cloning.\"\n\nCritics argue that SB733 simply opens a backdoor to teaching creationism in public schools, which is illegal under federal law. Alan Leshner, the executive publisher of \"Science\", condemned the bill as the \"latest effort to insert religious, unscientific views into science classrooms.\" Leshner stated the bill would, \"unleash an assault against scientific integrity, leaving students confused about science and unprepared to excel in a modern workforce.\"\n\nIn 2010, high school student Zack Kopplin launched a high-profile campaign sponsored by Louisiana State Senator Karen Carter Peterson to repeal the law. Kopplin's campaign has been endorsed by 78 Nobel laureates, the New Orleans City Council, and more than a dozen scientific and educational associations. Bills to repeal the LSEA have failed to advance past the Senate Education committee five years in a row from 2011 through 2015.\n\nThe Louisiana Science Education Act is an \"academic freedom law\" based on the Discovery Institute's academic freedom model statute The LSEA allows teachers in public schools to use supplemental materials in the science classroom that are critical of established scientific theories \"including, but not limited to, evolution, the origins of life, global warming and human cloning.\"\n\nSenator Nevers originally pre-filed the bill as the Louisiana Education Freedom Act (SB 561), at the behest of the Louisiana Family Forum to allow creationism to be taught in public schools. \"They (the Louisiana Family Forum) believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory. This would allow the discussion of scientific facts,\" Nevers said. The Louisiana Science Education Act, SB 733, introduced April 17, 2008, is a renumbered and renamed version of SB 561, which was introduced earlier by Senator Nevers. Gene Mills, president of the Louisiana Family Forum, states that the bill is necessary to allow teachers to \"critically present\" evidence and \"quit choosing sides when it comes to teaching students this controversial subject matter.\"\n\nCritics of the bill suggest that it is intended as an end-run around the federal ban on the teaching of creationism in public schools, and say that the sole purpose of the law is to provide legal cover to educators who want to introduce things other than science to the teaching of evolution in contravention of court rulings in cases such as \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" and \"Kitzmiller v. Dover\", something opposed by the scientific community.\n\nOn June 3, 2008, The American Institute of Biological Sciences sent a letter to House Speaker Jim Tucker opposing SB 733. On June 20, 2008, AIBS and seven other societies sent a letter to Governor Bobby Jindal requesting that he veto SB733. The requesting societies included the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the American Ornithologists Union, the American Society of Mammalogists, the Botanical Society of America, the Natural Science Collections Alliance, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the Society for the Study of Evolution.\n\nSenator Ben Nevers, Chairman of the Louisiana Senate Education Committee, a Bogalusa Democrat, filed the \"Louisiana Academic Freedom Act,\" (SB 561) on March 21, 2008. The bill was heard by the Senate Education committee on April 17. When introducing his legislation to the education committee, Senator Nevers substituted the original bill with SB733, the \"Louisiana Science Education Act\" or LSEA. After hearing two proponents in addition to Senator Nevers and approximately twenty opponents, the Education committee voted in favor of the legislation. On April 22, the Education committee presented the substitute bill to the Senate. The bill was passed by the Senate on April 28 by a unanimous vote of 35 to 0.\n\nThe Louisiana House referred LSEA to the Committee on Education on April 30. The House Committee on Education reported the bill favorably on May 21 by a unanimous vote of 14 to 0. The full House passed the legislation by a vote of 94 to 3 on June 11, 2008.\n\nOn June 16 the Senate unanimously accepted the House's amendments. Governor Bobby Jindal signed the legislation into law on June 25 making the LSEA Act 473 of 2008.\n\nBills that would have repealed the LSEA were introduced by Senator Karen Carter Peterson as SB70 in 2011, SB374 in 2012, SB26 in 2013 and SB175 in 2014. SB70 failed to pass on a 1-5 vote by the Senate Education committee after an hour-long hearing. The bill was then deferred by the committee ending consideration on the legislation for the year. SB374 was rejected by the Senate Education committee in a 2-1 vote with four abstentions. The third attempt to repeal the measure met again with failure when the Senate Education Committee voted 3-2 to defer the bill on May 1, 2013. The fourth attempt was rejected in a 3-1 vote on April 24, 2014. The fifth attempt was rejected in a 4-3 vote on April 22, 2015.\n\nThe scientific community in the United States has called the Louisiana Science Education Act an \"anti-science\" law with the purpose of allowing creationism into public school science classrooms.\n\nThe Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology had planned to host a conference in New Orleans in 2011, but decided to change the location of the conference \"in large part\" because of the LSEA, stating that it was their \"firm opinion ... that this law undermines the integrity of science and science education in Louisiana.\" They also announced that they would not consider hosting further conferences in New Orleans. The New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that losing the conference caused an economic loss to Louisiana of at least $2.7 million. SICB lifted their boycott in early 2013 after the New Orleans City Council and Orleans Parish School Board both rejected the teaching of creationism in science classes.\n\nProminent critic of the Louisiana Science Education Act Zack Kopplin has stated that the law \"leaves our students at a disadvantage when competing for jobs in the global economy. To illustrate this, he often humorously refers to the fact that when you search creationism on Monster.com or CareerBuilder you get \"zero jobs,\" while when you search biology, you find over 1000.\n\nDr. Barbara Forrest, professor of philosophy at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, a prominent critic of the Discovery Institute and the intelligent design movement, has explained that she thinks the law itself passed because,\n\nIn Louisiana, we had no organizational framework to respond to [the Louisiana Science Education Act]. One of the ways that Florida, for example, has kept [creationism] out is they have a very active, well organized Florida Citizens for Science. At the time we didn't have that. I and a couple of people, very, very quickly, had to get something together. [Although] there weren't very many of us... we did put up some opposition, but Louisiana Family Forum had been planning such a move probably since their founding in 1998.\n\nZack Kopplin began an effort to repeal the LSEA while he was a Senior in high school in 2010. His repeal bill was sponsored by Senator Karen Carter Peterson.\n\nCritics of the Louisiana Science Education Act call the law a creationism law, because it singles out specific scientific theories, which happen to be politically controversial, for teachers to \"critique and review\" using \"supplemental materials.\" The theories in question include \"evolution, the origins of life, global warming, and cloning.\"\n\nJerry Coyne, a prominent biologist and President of the Society for the Study of Evolution sarcastically illustrated what he perceived as problematic about the law by saying,\n\nYep, we don't need more critical thinking in areas like physics, chemistry, or medicine—just human cloning, evolution, and global warming.\n\nProminent critic of the law, Zack Kopplin explained:\n\nYou don't need a law to teach critical thinking. That's what science is. You need a law to teach creationism.\n\nAnother prominent critic, Dr. Barbara Forrest, is also wary of the law because the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's initial draft policy to implement the Louisiana Science Education Act was changed under pressure from a local conservative Christian group, the Louisiana Family Forum. The initial draft would have explicitly prohibited teaching religion under the guise of 'critical thinking' and using creationist materials in public school science classrooms. Dr. Forrest said,\n\nThe Americans United for Separation of Church and State is also worried about the process for parents to challenge supplemental materials brought into the classroom, because \"the proposed procedure for reviewing challenged supplemental materials... appears designed to provide a forum for promoting creationism. Barbara Forrest is the current Secretary for Americans United.\n\nAlso, supporters of the law have openly admitted that its purpose is to bring creationism into public school science classrooms. In July 2010, the Livingston Parish school board discussed using this law to teach creationism in public school science class. The National Center for Science Education reported,\n\nThe director of curriculum for [Livingston Parish] reportedly told the board that, under the Louisiana Science Education Act, schools are allowed to present \"critical thinking and creationism\" in science classes. The response from the board was enthusiastic, with David Tate asking, \"Why can't we get someone with religious beliefs to teach creationism?\" and Clint Mitchell adding, \"Teachers should have the freedom to look at creationism and find a way to get it into the classroom.\"\n\nSenator Ben Nevers, the sponsor of the Louisiana Science Education Act, has also said that the Louisiana Family Forum suggested the bill because \"They believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin's theory.\"\n\nThe law was written with a caveat: it says that it should not be construed \"to promote any religious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion.\"\n\nCritics like James Gill, who writes for the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\" dismiss this clause. Gill says the line was \"written with a nod and a wink, and it just goes to show how much craftier the obscurantists have become.\" This wording is a religion disclaimer from the Discovery Institute's model bill and is in all of the different variants of the bill in every state where it has been introduced.\n\nIn early June 2010, a student at Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Zack Kopplin, launched a campaign to repeal the law as his high school senior project. He started working on a repeal with Barbara Forrest, who was an expert witness at the \"Kitzmiller v. Dover\" trial and was responsible for demonstrating intelligent design was simply creationism dressed up to appear scientific.\n\nAccording to Kopplin, he is organizing Louisiana \"students, scientists, clergy, teachers, and business leaders in support of repealing the Louisiana Science Education Act.\"\n\nThey convinced Senator Karen Carter Peterson, a Democrat from New Orleans, to sponsor their repeal bill. Representative Walt Leger III, who represents part of Senator Peterson's district, agreed to handle the legislation in the House. Senator Peterson introduced SB 70 to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act on April 14, 2011.\n\nThe repeal effort gained support nationally and internationally. It is supported by 78 Nobel laureate scientists, the City of New Orleans, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest general science organization in the world with over 10 million members, and many other organizations.\n\nSB 70 was heard in the Senate Education Committee on May 26, 2011. After a heated debate, where in response to being presented the Nobel laureate letter, Senator Julie Quinn declared she was \"tired of seeing little letters behind everyone's names,\" the Senate Education Committee voted 5-1 to defer action on SB 70, in effect killing it. The sole vote for SB 70 was Senator Yvonne Dorsey.\n\nThe bill was introduced and rejected again from 2012 through 2015, see section Repeal attempts. In 2013 Kopplin said about Bobby Jindal: \"I expect this law bothers him as much as it bothers me. He's a Brown biology major.\"\n\nNine academic freedom bills were proposed in various state legislatures in 2011. The effort to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act may have had an effect in dampening the pressure to pass those bills.\n\nAlso, the Louisiana Coalition for Science was able to stop two new efforts to put creationism in Louisiana classrooms after the passage of the Louisiana Science Education Act. First, they convinced the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to adopt new biology books after creationists attempted to have the books thrown out. Then they also succeeded in killing a Louisiana House bill (HB 580) which was meant to weaken the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's oversight of public school biology books and supplementary materials.\n\nIn 2011, Louisiana College biology professor Wade Warren gave testimony in favor of the LSEA and opposed the repeal, along with challenging the ideological motives of many of the scientists who have opposed the LSEA. He also distributed to the Committee a letter from 15 Ph.D. scientists supporting academic freedom.\n\nAdvocates of the bill argue that it does not concern Creationism. The LSEA allows teachers to supplement additional information into the curricula that is not in the textbook. In fact, the bill does not even mention Creationism, and Section D states: \"This section shall not be construed to promote any religious doctrine, promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion.\"\n\nFurthermore, advocates of the bill argue it is necessary for three reasons. First, the supplementation provided for by the LSEA is needed to keep the science textbooks updated, because Biology textbooks are often already falling behind modern research by the time they are written, edited, and published. Second, most science textbooks have several, if not dozens, of known errors that can be solved with supplementation. Third, many science books are faulty of focusing on only one viewpoint when discussing controversial issues, and further do not accurately critique their proposed theory. The LSEA aids both in supplying the necessary critiques of the scientific theories, and also in providing the other viewpoints that are disregarded.\n\n"}

NCISS operates as a training establishment for both NATO Strategic Commands and since 2004 it is responsible to the NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA), in consultation with Allied Command Transformation (ACT).\n\nThe NCISS is due to be transferred from its present location in Latina, Italy to Oeiras, Portugal.\n\nIt was created in 1959 as a Contractor Training Facility to conduct ACE HIGH instruction, the school was hosted by an Italian Air Force Base in Latina (at that time the Centro Tecnico Addestrativo Difesa Aerea – CTA-DA), with the transformation of the Alliance was later modified to become the present day NATO Communications and Information Systems School.\n\nIn January 1963 Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) assumed full control of this still relatively small facility and recruited NATO civilian instructional staff to replace those of the civil contractor. In 1964 the training responsibility was extended into the area of Command and Control with the introduction of the \"Status, Control Alert and Reporting System\" (SCARS). The facility at this time was named the \"SHAPE Centralised Training Facility\" (SCTF). A further expansion occurred in the early 1970s with the addition to the training curriculum of Satellite Communications (SATCOM).\n\nIn April 1974 the title of the SCTF was changed to \"NATO Communications School Latina\" (NCS). To satisfy the increasing requirements arising from NATO's Integrated Communications System (NICS) concept, a project for a custom built training facility was initiated in 1976. This project called for a facility comprising a training and administrative building and a separate student accommodation block. The new complex was opened in 1983. It enabled the School to take on additional training associated with NICS such as TARE, IVSN and TCF, and allowed the School to cater for future developments within NATO CIS.\n\nThe School entered the area of Officer Training in the late 1970s with courses for NATO CIS Staff Officers, Officers CIS Orientation, Communications Security Officers and ADP Site/Terminal Area Security Officers.\n\nOn the occasion of the 30th Anniversary in 1989 the School was renamed \"NATO Communications and Information Systems School\" (NCISS) since with the introduction and increased use of specific Command and Control Information Systems within NATO, a requirement arose for software engineering and programming. In the 1990s the School entered the area of ADP, project management and information systems training, part of it being offered as off-site courses throughout NATO Europe.\n\nIn October 1994, the first CIS Officers' Course for Cooperation Partner (CP) Nations was conducted at Latina. This course is now included in our annual training schedule. The School successfully introduced Computer Assisted Training (CAT) modules on all its courses and analyzed the parameters for future contractor produced CAT and Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) programmes.\n\nAdditionally, in the last ten years, the lessons learned from NATO operations introduced the requirement of more deployable and mobile systems, to which the relative training is now being conducted in Latina.\n\nConcurrently, in 2004 the NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) was established within NATO, with the mission to ensure the provision of secure \"end-to-end\" information exchange services required for NATO Consultation, Command, and Control (NC3) functions, using fielded communications and information systems in the most cost-effective manner, and the School was put under its organisation.\n\nIn the recent past and to date, the School is challenged with supplementary training, as a result of NATO involvement in \"Beyond NATO's Area of Responsibility\" operations.\n\n\nWithin the Systems Approach to Training Methodology conduct Course Design and Development and Internal Evaluation for those courses assigned to and delivered by NCISS and, when requested by ACT (JET) or NCSA HQ, provide assistance with the External Evaluation process Contribute professional expertise to NATO projects and related training matters.\n\nIn accordance with NATO mission and NCSA guiding principles and in the framework of NATO System Approach to Training methodology, the School today delivers cost-effective advanced formal training to military and civilian personnel from the NATO Nations and PfP/MD/ICI to obtain efficient operations and maintenance of NATO Communications and Information Systems training on NATO CIS.\n\nAdditionally, it conducts orientation courses and management training on NATO CIS for selected (Staff) personnel and contributes with its professional expertise to NATO projects for training related matters. Recently, with the introduction of e-learning methodology, the School has also expanded the way training is delivered, associating the newly born Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) to the traditional theoretical training in the classrooms and the practical hands-on in the laboratories, which is the added value of the School. Furthermore, even more requested is the off-site training, especially in Theatre of Operations, and the training on deployable, transportable and scalable systems, that is unavoidably the most flexible and efficient answer for the future of NATO operations.\n\nThe courses, covering both static systems and deployable communications equipment, are subject to continuous development and improvement to meet the new tasks assigned to NATO in Out-of-Area contingency operations, with emphasis on mobility and interfacing with national defence networks.\n\nTraining in Latina, using state-of-the art systems employing advanced techniques, and the professionalism of its instructors have also granted recognition to the School as an accredited CISCO Academy. Furthermore, NCISS is frequently available as a forum for important meetings and seminars, to increase knowledge and share experience.\n\nNCISS's offers more than 90 different courses and over 370 sessions are scheduled. The courses, of various duration up to 6 weeks, range from the Communication area (SATCOM, DLOS, COM Systems, BME/NCN, Video Tele Conferencing, etc.), to the Information Systems (Functional Area Sub-Systems, MCCIS, AIFS, Geo-spatial IS, WISE, etc.), and the Security on Communications/AIS (Compusec, Information Assurance, Crypto, PTC, Cyber Defense, etc.) or simply on specific equipment (Fiber Optics, Crypto Devices, HF Radios, etc.) or even tailored on particular requirements (e.g. Frequency Management for Theatre of Operations, etc.).\n\nThe School response to NATO exercises and especially to SFOR, KFOR and ISAF operations, some of which even with short notice, was decisive for the deployment of qualified technicians and engineers in the new Theatres of Operation. Consequently, the overall student throughput is in continuous increase by a factor of about 15-20% a year.\n\nThe NCISS motto is \"Sapére Aude\" which is Latin for \"dare to know\".\n"}

{"id": "5635847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5635847", "title": "SEKEM", "text": "SEKEM\n\nThe organization SEKEM (Ancient Egyptian: 'vitality from the sun') was founded in 1977 by the Egyptian pharmacologist and social entrepreneur Dr. Ibrahim Abouleish in order to bring about cultural renewal in Egypt on a sustainable basis; Located northeast of Cairo, the organization now includes:\n\nSEKEM's goals are to \"restore and maintain the vitality of the soil and food as well as the biodiversity of nature\" through sustainable, organic agriculture and to support social and cultural development in Egypt. Revenue from the trading companies grew from 37 million Egyptian pounds in 2000 to 100 million in 2003. By 2005, the organization had established a network of more than 2,000 farmers and numerous partner organizations in Egypt and began increasingly to seek to extend its \"experience and acquired knowledge\" to other countries, including India, Palestine, Senegal, Turkey, and - in partnership with the Fountain Foundation - South Africa.\n\nAfter a stay of 19 years in Austria, Dr. Abouleish returned to Egypt for a cultural trip in 1975. Touched by the deplorable economic and social situation of his country of origin, he decided to begin a project of cultural renewal on the basis of a synthesis of Islam and anthroposophy. Two years later he bought a plot of land in what was, at the time, desert bordering farmland of the Nile valley. The original goal was to develop the land and improve crop yields using biodynamic methods. A thick border of trees was planted to encircle the seventy hectares of land, and trees were planted along all the roads built; a forest was also planted on part of the land. (The initial planting included 120,000 casuarina, eucalyptus and Persian lilac seedlings.) The Bedouins who lived nearby, and sometimes on the land, were brought into the project, given work and helped with their living needs. Buildings were built using traditional adobe; some of these were designed by Hassan Fathy. The initial farm animals were Egyptian buffalo. The organization sold milk products produced from the buffalo milk and produce from the farm.\n\nThe first large economic venture of the community initiative was production of a medicinal compound, ammoidin, an extract of Ammi majus (Laceflower). The manufacture of herbal teas and a company to market fresh biodynamic produce in Europe followed. The needs of these companies led to many farms throughout Egypt switching to biodynamic methods; the SEKEM organization began an active advisory service to aid these farms in the transition to and the maintenance of biodynamic standards. Sekem leased many of these lands.\n\nCommunity projects began early in the initiative's history: a medical clinic using anthroposophic medicine, and a Society for Cultural Development sponsoring lectures, concerts and other cultural activities.\n\nIn 1987, the center for adult education (Mahad) began its work; children with handicaps are also educated in this center. In 1988, SEKEM opened a kindergarten also open to the local Bedouin community; this grew into the SEKEM school, educating children from kindergarten through twelfth grade (about 18 years of age) on the basis of Waldorf education. \"The school serves Muslim and Christian children alike encouraging them to live in harmony and have respect for the other's religious practices.\" The school also operates a literacy center for illiterate children between ten and fourteen years of age.\n\nIn response to the use of child labor in Egypt, SEKEM founded the project \"Chamomile Children\", which offers children between ten and fourteen an education, vocational training, meals, and medical care in conjunction with their work; the children's teachers look after the children the whole day. There is also a cooperative for employees to organize the social processes (the Cooperative of SEKEM Employees), an independent organization with members from all the businesses and cultural institutions associated with SEKEM.\n\nIn 1990, SEKEM founded the Centre of Organic Agriculture in Egypt (COAE), an independent organization that inspects organic farms in Egypt, Iran and Sudan.\n\nFaced with pesticide residues in their products that came from aerial spraying on nearby farms, SEKEM took up an initiative to eliminate such spraying in Egypt. As cotton production depended upon the sprays, SEKEM explored organic cotton production on initially small fields. The experiments were successful and yields actually were better than non-organic production achieved. The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture sponsored further and more extensive tests. Within three years, the ministry agreed that organic pest suppression was superior for cotton farming and began converting the entire area of Egyptian cotton, 4,000 square kilometres, to organic methods for controlling pests; the conversion took two years. The conversion resulted in a reduction in the use of synthetic pesticides in Egypt by over 90% and an increase in the average yield of raw cotton of almost 30%. SEKEM then created a company to process organic cotton using mechanical rather than chemical methods, NatureTex.\n\nIn response to increasing publicity about the novel methods employed by the community in many realms, the association of Muslim sheiks in Egypt gave the community a plaque verifying that SEKEM is an Islamic initiative. This was the result of intensive meetings between SEKEM and Muslim religious leaders.\n\nSEKEM's next initiative was the first private pharmaceutical company in Egypt, specializing in medicinal teas. The medical center had now grown to the point where it needed its own building; concurrently it considerably expanded its outreach into the Bedouin community, helping establish sanitary facilities and clean water supplies.\n\nIn 1997, SEKEM established a vocational training center offering trainings in metalwork, carpentry, mechanical work, electrical work, tailoring, biodynamic farming and trading. The vocational center also includes an art school. The German Society for Technical Cooperation helped establish this project. In 1999 the SEKEM Academy (now Sekem University) opened. Originally a center for agricultural, pharmaceutical and medical research, the University now also conducts studies and offers training in other areas.\n\nIn 2001, a holding company was established to administer the finances of all the SEKEM companies and to oversee developmental projects. The holding company includes a department to help each individual company with its developmental process, and is also responsible for the education and training programs for employees.\n\nAll SEKEM companies have a policy of ensuring transparency in the production, distribution and consumption of their goods. They work to ensure fair and secure prices for the farmers supplying them, basing their operations on the principle that the health of the economy depends upon producers, distributors and consumers cooperating to generate stable businesses. SEKEM hosts a monthly gathering of all farmers working together with it; about 200 farmers attended these sessions as of 2004.

No other known Canadian university that uses this title. The term Senior Stick is also sometimes used to refer to the actual stick of office carried by a Senior Stick.\n\nThe stick of office is a staff of office carried by the Senior Stick as a symbol of their position.\n\nWhile the styles of sticks of office vary greatly between student associations, they are typically composed of an elongated wooden rod, painted or stained dark, with a metal bottom cap and an ornamental metal top in either silver or gold.\n\nThe University of Manitoba Engineering Society (UMES) has been electing a Senior Stick to serve as its head since 1909. Every spring at the annual UMES graduation ceremony the ceremonial passing of the Stick-of-Office takes place. During this ceremony the outgoing Senior Stick passes the newest Stick-of-Office to the incoming Senior Stick and whispers words of wisdom that have been passed down from Senior Stick to Senior Stick. These words are only known by the Senior Sticks and no one else. At the end of every year the name of the outgoing Senior Stick is added to the Stick-of-Office along with the year that they served as Senior Stick.\n\nThe tradition of having a Senior Stick as president of UMES was brought to the University of Manitoba by Professor E.E. Brydon-Jack who was named as the first professor of engineering at the University of Manitoba in 1906. After starting in engineering this tradition of having a Senior Stick quickly spread to all faculties at the University of Manitoba. There was insufficient funds for the creation of the first Stick-of-Office until 1927. At this point all the names of the previous Senior Sticks dating back to 1907 were added retroactively. In 1987 the first Stick-of-Office no longer had any room for additional names. A new Stick-of-Office was commissioned and the names of all the Senior Sticks since 1988 have been added to this Stick-of-Office instead.\n\nThe Faculty of Arts followed the Faculty of Engineering and started electing a Senior Stick in 1915. The Faculty of Arts elected both a Senior Stick and a lady stick until 1974. In 1975 the Faculty of Arts then decided to drop the position of lady stick and simply allow both male and female students to run for Senior Stick.\n\nAt the University of Manitoba there are meetings that are called between all of the Senior Sticks. These meetings are called by the University of Manitoba Students' Union. These meetings are called Board Of Senior Stick or BOSS for short.\n"}

{"id": "442213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442213", "title": "Steven Erikson", "text": "Steven Erikson\n\nSteven Erikson (born October 7, 1959) is the pseudonym of Steve Rune Lundin, a Canadian novelist, who was educated and trained as both an archaeologist and anthropologist.\n\nHe is best-known for his ten-volume spanning epic fantasy series \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\", which began with the publication of \"Gardens of the Moon\" (1999) and was completed with the publication of \"The Crippled God\" (2011). By 2012 over 1 million copies of the series had been sold worldwide, and over 3 million copies by 2018. \"SF Site\" has called the series \"the most significant work of epic fantasy since Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,\" and \"Fantasy Book Review\" described it as \"the best fantasy series of recent times.\" Fellow author Glen Cook has called the series a masterwork, while Stephen R. Donaldson has praised him for his approach to the fantasy genre and has compared him to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\nSet in the Malazan world, Erikson has written a prequel trilogy, \"The Kharkanas Trilogy\", six novellas, and is currently working on a sequel trilogy, \"The Witness Trilogy\", the first book of which, titled \"The God is Not Willing\", is expected to be published in 2019. \n\nHis foray into \"Science Fiction\" has produced a comedic trilogy, the \"Willful Child Trilogy\", a spoof on \"Star Trek\" and other tropes common in the genre, and a First Contact novel titled \"Rejoice, a Knife To the Heart\", published in 2018.\n\nErikson was born in Toronto, Ontario, and grew up in Winnipeg. He subsequently lived in the UK with his wife and son, but has since returned to Winnipeg. He is an anthropologist and archaeologist by training and is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. For his thesis at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Erikson wrote a \"story cycle\" of short stories titled \"A Ruin of Feathers\" about an archaeologist in Central America. Subsequently, he received a grant to finish the work which was published by TSAR, a small Canadian publishing house. For his next work he co-won the Anvil Press International 3-Day Novel Contest for which he signed away the rights, a mistake he attributes to inexperience. Erikson's third book was also published by TSAR, and consisted of a novella and short stories titled \"Revolvo and other Canadian Tales\". Later, upon moving to England, he sold what he refers to as his \"first real novel\" to Hodder and Stoughton — \"This River Awakens\" — written when he still lived in Winnipeg. Before assuming his pseudonym, Erikson published his first four books, currently out of print, under his real name. In addition to writing, he paints using oil paints.\n\nErikson and Esslemont initially devised the Malazan world as a backdrop for a table-top role-playing game. Unhappy with the lack of quality adult oriented fantasy movies at the time, the duo decided to write their own movie script using their gaming experience and the world they had created. The script, titled \"Gardens of the Moon\", was deemed too risky and failed to sell. With interest in the script seeming nonexistent, Erikson, with Esslemont's go ahead, reworked it into a fantasy novel, which he completed around 1991–92.\nAfter meeting almost a decade of rejection, the novel was finally sold to Transworld, a division of Random House. The publisher was pleased with the work and requested Erikson write additional books in the series. Using the history of the Malazan world Erikson plotted nine additional novels. After the publication of \"Gardens of the Moon\", reviews spread via the internet, and Orion publications attempted to lure Erikson away from Transworld. However, Transworld retained an option on additional novels in the series and offered £675,000 for the remaining nine books of the series.\n\nWhile there are many plotlines woven through the whole series, the main storyline focuses on a period in time where the Malazan Empire is facing resistance to their conquest of the world. When gods and ascendants come into play, everything that follows has repercussions for the whole world. The series was completed with the publication of \"The Crippled God\", the tenth novel in the series, in 2011.\n\nErikson's background as an archeologist and anthropologist also shaped how he crafted the story. His approach was to use as many perspectives and point of views as possible in terms of interpreting history, which without a doubt has given the Malazan world more layers and has created a sense of reality. He also drew inspiration from \"Homer\"'s \"Illiad\", where gods constantly meddled into mortal affairs, adding the twist that it doesn't always workout as planned for the god, since even a lowly thief has the power to bring him down.\n\nAs of 2018, 3 million copies have been sold.\n\nAfter the publication of the seventh novel in the \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\" series, \"Reapers Gale\", Erikson and his publisher reached an agreement for him to write two trilogies and novellas set in the Malazan world. This consequently led Erikson to the choose to write a prequel trilogy, titled the Kharkanas Trilogy, set almost three hundred thousand years before the events of the main series, elements of which he began introducing in \"Toll the Hounds\" and in \"The Crippled God\".\n\nThe series deals with numerous founding or elder races from the Malazan World, with the narrative anchored around the circumstances that would ultimately lead to the split of the Tiste race. It sheds light and demystifies the events that are often hinted at in the background of \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\". Primarily focusing on characters such as Anomander Rake, Draconus, Gothos, Krull and Hood, mainly through the eyes of secondary characters.\n\nAs of 2018, two novels have been published, \"Forge of Darkness\" (2012) and \"Fall of Light\" (2016), with the third taking a backseat to the first novel in the Witness trilogy. In a post on his official Facebook account, the author explained that the dismal sale figures for the previous novels and the creative toll employing the writing style used throughout the previous books was what had led to his decision to take a break from it in order to do it justice.\n\nThe second trilogy Erikson planned on writing centres around the popular Karsa Orlong character. This trilogy will be a sequel to the main series, set, according to the author, a decade after the main narrative.\n\nThe first novel is titled \"The God is Not Willing\", which is set to be released in November, 2019.\n\nErikson wrote side stories centering on two necromancers and their butler, characters he introduced in \"Memories of Ice\", the third novel in the \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\" series. These side stories take place in the Malazan world, but have no connection to the series' overall plot. \n\nAs of 2018, six novellas have been published, the first in 2002, titled \"Blood Follows\", and the latest in 2016, tilted \"The Fiends of Nightmaria\". In 2009, the first three novellas were collected and published together as \"The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach\". And in 2018, books four to six were collected and published together as \"The Second Collected Tales of Bauchelain & Korbal Broach\".\n\nErikson, as per his agreement with his publisher, is expected to write three more novellas featuring these characters.\n\nErikson is a huge fan of the \"Star Trek\" series, especially the first iteration which he credits as being his gateway to Science Fiction in general. But he finds himself feeling disenfranchised by some of the later iterations, especially from \"\" onward. In an interview he goes into detail regarding this issue, concluding that among other things creative compromises were to blame for the dip in quality. But while criticizing the series' current state, he affirms that he nonetheless still is a fan.\n\"Willful Child\", published in September, 2014, is Erikson's \"response\" to the overused tropes and caricature of \"Captain Kirk\" esque characters in science fiction, with the main character, Captain Hardrian, being the most recognizable reflection. While the novel is a spoof of science fiction in general, it is rife with often times poignant social commentary.\n\n\"The Wrath of Betty\", the follow-up, was published in 2016.\n\nHaving written a three million words spanning fantasy series and having dealt with all the tropes that came with it, Erikson feels desensitized by most works found in the genre, which is why he prefers reading Science Fiction. For more than a decade, he has also had aspirations to write a First Contact science fiction novel. In 2017, UK based publisher \"Gollancz\" revealed in a press release that they had acquired the right to this project, titled \"Rejoice, A Knife to the Heart\". In Canada, the publishing rights are owned by Promontory Press Inc. \n\nSimilar to his fantasy work, Erikson revealed that he would be playing with and overturning the conventions and dismantling a few tropes. It was his opinion that far too often the invading aliens would seek contact with an authority figure, someone in power. His goal was to flip that by asking what would happen if the aliens made contact with someone completely opposite.\n\nThe novel was released on October 16, 2018, and was received with critical acclaim, with science fiction author Robert Sawyer praising its concept and its execution.\n\nErikson has stated that apart from examining the \"human condition\", all his literary work share \"compassion\" as a theme, or main driving force.\nFurthermore, when envisioning the Malazan world, both Esslemont and he agreed to create societies and cultures that never knew sexism and gender based hierarchies of power.\n\nOther themes include social inequality, egalitarianism, death, life, history, historical accuracy .\n\nErikson has stated explicitly that he enjoys playing with and overturning the conventions of fantasy, presenting characters that violate the stereotypes associated with their roles. They embody the multidimensional characteristics found in human beings, making them more realistic and giving the story more depth, which is why his books are anything but predictable. He deliberately began \"Gardens of the Moon\" mid-plot rather than beginning with a more conventional narrative. Erikson's style of writing includes complex plots with masses of characters. In addition, Erikson has been praised for his willingness to kill central characters when it enhances the plot.\n\nErikson's first novel of the \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\" series, \"Gardens of the Moon\" (1999), was well received. It was short-listed for a World Fantasy Award It has also earned him the reputation as one of the best authors in the fantasy genre, and was described as \"An astounding début\". The novel was acclaimed for its \"combination of originality and intelligent, strong and exciting storytelling\". The second book in the series, \"Deadhouse Gates\" (2000), was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by \"SF Site\".\n\nFellow author Glen Cook has called the series a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high water mark of the epic fantasy genre. In his treatise written for \"The New York Review of Science Fiction\", fellow author Stephen R. Donaldson has also praised Erikson for his approach to the fantasy genre, the subversion of classical tropes, the complex characterizations, the social commentary — pointing explicitly to parallels between the fictional Letheras Economy and the US Economy — and has referred to him as \"an extraordinary writer\", comparing him to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. \n\nErikson attributes paper and pen Role-Playing games, specifically AD&D and GURP, as being the biggest influence in his writing career, and even calls it the fundament the Malazan Empire, from his \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\" series, is based on. Stephen R. Donaldson's, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and Glenn Cook's The Black Company, both ushering post-Tolkien style of writing, are among some of the works that have influenced his storytelling. He also credits the works of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Homer, Arthur C. Clarke, Roger Zelazny, John Gardner, Gustav Hasford, Mark Helprin and Robin Hobb as some of the influences he used in the Malazan works.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13040536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13040536", "title": "Sustainable MBA", "text": "Sustainable MBA\n\nThe traditional MBA degree (Masters in Business Administration) requires coursework and other study of business from a primarily financial standpoint, with some attention to management of people, to conventional economic theory, and to business ethics. A sustainable MBA program includes these subjects, and also study of managing for environmental and social sustainability. These programs are sometimes called \"green MBAs\".\n\nSustainability in these programs is generally defined to include economic, environmental, and social sustainability, collectively known as the Triple Bottom Line. For each of these domains, sustainability means that it will be possible to continue through the foreseeable future, at least, without major breakdowns, such as\n\n\nThe environmental and social justice movements are sources for many of the issues, arguments, and research on sustainability, but the idea has firm roots in classical economics.\n\n\nOne of the themes of sustainable MBA education is the extent to which environmental and social sustainability can be achieved at a profit, a question by no means answered fully.\n\nSustainability MBA programs can vary significantly from one school to another, some may stress management, some may stress entrepreneurship, others simply add a few \"green\" classes to their existing MBA program. Many advise to look at a program's curriculum, history, vision, mission, and most of all, to go and attend a class before fully enrolling in a program, as transparency is espoused as core to a sustainable MBA.\n\nThe longest running fully integrated sustainability graduate school (founded 2003) is Presidio Graduate School with MBA programs in San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe following are some of the current business programs explicitly offering MBA degrees in sustainability. Although many traditional MBA programs have incorporated sustainability-related topics into their curriculum, this list only includes schools offering a specific degree or concentration in sustainability areas: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs interest in sustainability within MBA programs has increased, so has an interest on assessing their quality and different approaches. \"Beyond Grey Pinstripes\", a biennial ranking and program survey, published by the Aspen Institute is based on the integration of social, environmental, and ethical stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. The ranking also weights significantly the extent to which students are exposed to these topics throughout their studies. Participation in the survey requires US-based schools possess accreditation; international schools must also be accredited or be recognized as leading institutions. The 2009-2010 cycle consisted of 149 participating universities. The top-ranked school with a specialization in sustainability, Schulich, is Canadian. 63% of these schools were based in the US, while the remaining 37% were located throughout 24 countries. Although survey information from all participating schools is made available online, the top participating schools were ranked in the \"Aspen's Global 100\" list. The 2011-2012 survey and ranking again include data from 149 universities.\n\nAlthough not a ranking of business programs, Net Impact annually produces and publishes a graduate program guide titled \"Business as UNusual\". The guide seeks to provide information about what graduate programs offer their students within the realm of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Data for the guide come from surveys completed by graduate student Net Impact chapter leaders and from chapter member surveys. The most recent report contains profiles of 95 business schools.\n\nMany MBA programs which offer sustainability degrees or concentrations also appear in general business school rankings. \"US News & World Report\", \"Business Week\", \"Financial Times\", \"The Economist\", and the \"Wall Street Journal\" all publish rankings of selected MBA programs. While the methodologies of each differ, most weight ranks heavily by employment and salary statistics, standardized test scores, and surveys of corporate recruiters.\n\nFollowers of Milton Friedman and the Chicago school of economics often claim that business has no other duty than profits to shareholders, and that business therefore has a duty not to pursue environmental and social sustainability except where it increases profits. The extent to which such actions are profitable is much disputed. On the other hand, Friedman actually did not say that the duty to shareholders was absolute: corporations also had a duty to obey the law and compete fairly. Friedman's criticism has been debunked by legal scholars (e.g., Stout 2002), who have shown that Friedman had no legal basis for his conclusion. Corporate executives do not legally need to run the corporation for shareholders and could, in fact, operate the corporation to benefit society and environment. The fact that Friedman misunderstood corporate governance is no surprise as it was not his area of expertise, and the fact that the NYT Magazine allowed the mistake is not a surprise as it is not a double blind peer reviewed academic journal.\n\nThe debate must then turn to the question of what laws may properly be placed on corporate behavior to prevent fraud and other forms of malfeasance, and to ensure open and free competition, with what enforcement mechanisms. Also, whether corporate lobbying for subsidies and other legally-mandated advantages is fair, given that it is economically inefficient and indeed harmful. This question turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of governments, where results are decidedly mixed. It also turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of public pressure groups. Results there are also decidedly mixed.\n\nCriticism of sustainable or \"green MBAs\" has also been heard from environmentalists and social activists. Some complain of corporate greenwashing, that is, of companies pretending to be sustainable or green by hiring graduates of these programs when the companies really are not. Some complain that the programs themselves are not sustainable enough, pointing to weaknesses in their curriculum and core proposition.\n\nAnother criticism relates to the sustainability skills gap. A recent study shows that business schools are too slow to adjust and the skills gap is broadening, regardless the recent surge of sustainable MBA programs. The report states that \"environment and sustainability skills will be essential to plan the adaptations needed to survive and stay competitive\", businesses unfortunately are ill prepared for these growing challenges and business schools are failing to offer enough environmental and ecological education, despite the increasing demand from businesses. In line with the IEMA report, several academics also criticize business schools emphasizing that the gap will be finally closed by those programs with sustainability at the core, which in most cases are emerging outside the business school world.\n\n"}

The work done by teaching fellows can vary enormously from institution to institution, depending on the requirements and position of individual institutions.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, teaching fellows are typically full members of academic staff who are involved in teaching. Teaching fellows can undertake the full range of teaching, pastoral and administrative duties, and can also be involved in research activity, specifically pedagogic research. Their responsibilities can include developing innovative learning materials, mentoring colleagues and contributing to staff development activities, shaping the faculty's and the university's agenda in learning and teaching and spreading good practice in learning, teaching and assessment. Other UK institutions may use the title of teaching fellow as an additional accolade, awarded to a member of academic staff who has shown excellence in teaching.\n\nTeaching fellows may have the same rank and pay as 'traditional' research-active academic staff, although this depends on the attitude of the individual department and the institution. The equivalence in rank and status is relatively new in some institutions, since teaching fellows in the past were sometimes paid at a grade lower than their research-active colleagues.\n\nTeaching fellows are present at a number of institutions across the UK. Institutions such as UCL as well as The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen and the universities of Aberdeen, Stirling, Bristol and Manchester all employ academics known as teaching fellows. Thus, a senior teaching fellow may have the same salary, status and teaching responsibilities as a senior lecturer. Teaching fellows in institutions such as the University of Aberdeen may also potentially reach the rank of professor.\n\nThe University of Reading runs a University Teaching Fellowship scheme that was launched in 2007/8. The scheme is open to academic and support staff across the university and it has awarded so far 21 University and 11 Early Career Teaching Fellowships since it was launched. The criteria for the scheme is consistent with the Higher Education Academy's National Teaching Fellowship Scheme (NTFS).\n\nThe National Teaching Fellowship Scheme recognises and rewards individual excellence in teaching in higher education in the UK and supports individuals' professional development in learning and teaching. The National Teaching Fellows (NTFs) are an active community, currently consisting of 643 NTFs from more than 40 disciplines.\n\nThe Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF) promotes innovation and supports the sharing of best practice. National Teaching Fellows automatically become a member of the ANTF. The Committee of the Association of the National Teaching Fellows (CANTF) organises the ANTF's work and is the official voice of the association.\n\nIn the U.S. a teaching fellow is an advanced graduate student who serves as the primary instructor for an undergraduate course. Known as teaching fellows at many universities, such as Harvard University, Boston College and Boston University, they are also referred to as 'graduate student instructors' (GSIs) at some other universities, such as the University of Michigan and the University of California system. Typically, TFs teach courses in their area of research specialty, in which they hold a master's degree or equivalent. Teaching fellows differ from teaching assistants in that they are responsible for all aspects of the course, including lecture, whereas TAs \"assist\" the instructor by performing ancillary course-related tasks such as grading and holding discussion section or laboratory. Many (about two-thirds) of the graduate students who have served as TAs serve as a TF for one or more classes each semester. Although TFs are fairly autonomous in their duties, many universities, such as the University of Pittsburgh, require supervision of TFs by professors experienced in teaching the course content, with whom TFs must hold regular meetings and receive feedback about the quality of their teaching. As a general rule, TFs receive a higher stipend than TAs in accordance with the greater responsibility and time commitment of a teaching fellowship, but like TAs, their contracts are renewed on a semester-by-semester basis, and they cannot be granted tenure.\n\nA teaching associate is an academically qualified and registered graduate student, usually in full-time residence, employed temporarily to teach freshman- and sophomore-level courses (or occasionally more advanced undergraduate courses) in an American university. They are an advanced form of graduate teaching assistant, normally doctoral students, and are paid better than teaching assistants.\n\nTo tackle faculty shortage in the university departments, Anna University recruits postgraduates on contract basis and allow them to complete their doctoral degrees on the job. Candidates are shortlisted through a written test and an interview. Candidates are given the opportunity to pursue their PhD in the university departments simultaneously as they teach. Technically they are employed only for six months, but contracts get renewed through the years, they do almost the same job as regular staff, but receive what has been described as an \"abysmally low\" salary.\n\n\n"}

The fair takes place annually in March. It is led by EngineeringUK in partnership with over 200 organisations across government, industry, education and the wider science and engineering community.\n\nThe Big Bang programme exists to bring science and engineering to life for young people. The Big Bang celebrates and raises the profile of young people’s achievements in science and engineering and encourages more young people to take part in science, technology, engineering and maths initiatives with support from their parents and teachers.\n\nBig Bang Near Me events take place across the UK to enable young people to discover close to home the exciting and rewarding science and engineering careers that their science and maths subjects can lead to.\n\nIn 2012, the Big Bang Fair was hosted in the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. An all-girls team of pupils from a state school in the Highlands- Alness Academy were awarded the prestigious title of UK Young Engineers of the Year for their work on health and safety prototypes to be used in Haiti, which had recently suffered major earthquake damage alongside an outbreak of cholera. The six girls were Josie Tolliday, Emma Roddick, Cassie Armstrong, Meg Beattie, Holly Henderson and Kayleigh MacDonald.\n\nThe all-girl team have continued to excel in their extra-curricular activities. Cassie Armstrong is now an elected Member of Scottish Youth Parliament; Emma Roddick went on to become Donald Dewar Debater of the Year; Kayleigh MacDonald has been successful in dance competition Rock Challenge.\n\nThe Big Bang Fair has been criticised by NGOs such as the Campaign Against the Arms Trade and Friends of the Earth due to the heavy involvement of arms manufacturers and fossil fuel companies at the event. The event has also been described as being led by the PR of companies rather than education, and for presenting a \"distorted view of the value of science\" in reference to the involvement of arms manufacturers and oil companies.\n"}

Each Venture Café is independently managed and runs the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. Recently, Venture Café Providence recently was announced through a partnership with the city of Providence.\n\nThe Venture Café was originally conceived as a restaurant located in the CIC in Boston, Massachusetts. The restaurant failed to attract investment and was reimagined as a gathering for the entrepreneurial community based on the book Venture Café by Teresa Esser. Venture Café Kendall launched in 2009 bringing together hundreds of entrepreneurs each week for the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. \n\nIn 2014, Venture Café expanded to the Cortex Innovation Community in St. Louis, Missouri, to bring together the emerging startup community. The success of the St. Louis location prompted the launch of Venture Cafés in other cities and ultimately the creation of Venture Café Global Institute, a public benefit corporation based in both St. Louis and Boston.\n\nIn 2014, the City of Boston and Venture Café Kendall opened District Hall, a free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs, including an event venue, restaurant and coffee shop. In 2018, as part of St. Louis Cortex District's new 4220 Duncan building anchored by Microsoft, Venture Cafe launches Innovation Hall in St. Louis based upon Boston's District Hall. The St. Louis location will also be the first to launch the Education Hub, also known as EdHub STL, a program supporting and bringing together innovators in education to benefit youth access to education. EdHub STL is inspired by the Forward Through Ferguson report which calls for an innovation education hub to address the region's most entrenched educational issues.\n\nThe flagship program of Venture Café, is the Thursday Gathering, a weekly, community-focused event that provides opportunities for new and experienced entrepreneurs the ability to exchange ideas and support. The Thursday Gathering includes several free educational sessions aimed at entrepreneurs to learn how to start and run a business. The Gatherings are intentionally informal allowing for more opportunity to engage in creative and speculative ideas and look for collaborators, co-founders, mentors, or investors.\n\nVenture Cafés in St. Louis, Boston, and Philadelphia currently offer free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs to work and collaborate in addition to paid event and meeting rooms and restaurants and coffeeshops.\n\nVenture Café Foundation in Boston currently runs the Roxbury Innovation Center and St. Louis is launching EdHub STL in 2018. Both programs focus on bringing together innovators in education including students, parents, administration, and teachers to help solve inequities in education and introduce youth to entrepreneurship and STEAM activities.\n\nCafé Nights are monthly or quarterly versions of the Thursday Gathering located outside the weekly event.\n\n\n"}

It is one of several types of productivity that economists measure. Workforce productivity, often referred to as labor productivity, is a measure for an organization or company, a process, an industry, or a country.\n\nWorkforce productivity is to be distinguished from employee productivity which is a measure employed at \"individual level\" based on the assumption that the overall productivity can be broken down to increasingly smaller units until, ultimately, to the individual employee, in order be used for example for the purpose of allocating a benefit or sanction based on individual performance (see also: Vitality curve).\n\nIn 2002, the OECD defined it as \"the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input\". Volume measures of output are normally gross domestic product (GDP) or gross value added (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for inflation. The three most commonly used measures of input are:\n\nWorkforce productivity can be measured in 2 ways, in physical terms or in price terms.\n\nThese aspects of productivity refer to the \"qualitative\" dimensions of labour input. If an organization is using labour much more intensely, one can assume it's due to greater labour productivity, since the output per labour-effort may be the same. This insight becomes particularly important when a large part of what is produced in an economy consists of services. Management may be very preoccupied with the productivity of employees, but the productivity gains of management itself is very difficult to prove. While labor productivity growth has been seen as a useful barometer of the U.S. economy’s performance, recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008–2009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted.\n\nThe validity of international comparisons of labour productivity can be limited by a number of measurement issues. The comparability of output measures can be negatively affected by the use of different valuations, which define the inclusion of taxes, margins, and costs, or different deflation indexes, which turn current output into constant output. Labor input can be biased by different methods used to estimate average hours or different methodologies used to estimate employed persons. In addition, for level comparisons of labor productivity, output needs to be converted into a common currency. The preferred conversion factors are Purchasing Power Parities, but their accuracy can be negatively influenced by the limited representativeness of the goods and services compared and different aggregation methods. To facilitate international comparisons of labor productivity, a number of organizations, such as the OECD, the Groningen Growth Centre, International Labor Comparisons Program, and The Conference Board, prepare productivity data adjusted specifically to enhance the data’s international comparability.\n\nIn a survey of manufacturing growth and performance in Britain and Mauritius, it was found that:\n\"The factors affecting labour productivity or the performance of individual work roles are of broadly the same type as those that affect the performance of manufacturing firms as a whole. They include: (1) physical-organic, location, and technological factors; (2) cultural belief-value and individual attitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors; (3) international influences – e.g. levels of innovativeness and efficiency on the part of the owners and managers of inward investing foreign companies; (4) managerial-organizational and wider economic and political-legal environments; (5) levels of flexibility in internal labour markets and the organization of work activities – e.g. the presence or absence of traditional craft demarcation lines and barriers to occupational entry; and (6) individual rewards and payment systems, and the effectiveness of personnel managers and others in recruiting, training, communicating with, and performance-motivating employees on the basis of pay and other incentives.\"\nIt was further found that:\n\"The emergence of computers has been noted as a significant factor in increasing labor productivity in the late 1990s, by some, and as an insignificant factor by others, such as R.J. Gordon. Although computers have existed for most of the 20th century, some economic researchers have noted a lag in productivity growth caused by computers that didn't come until the late 1990s.\"\n\n"}

A maximum of five national awards had been presented annually while local awards continue to be unlimited. Each local council made the determination for nominating its candidates for national competition. Recipients of the national award also received a $7,500 cash award that was primarily funded by Learning for Life. Membership in any of the BSA or Learning for life programs is not obligatory.\n\nThe national award consisted of a silver medallion suspended from a red, white and blue ribbon worn around the neck. The medallion bears the images of young man and a young woman above a wreath. Local recipients receive a gold version of the medallion affixed to a wooden plaque. Recipients may wear the corresponding square knot insignia, with a silver knot on a red, white and blue background, on the BSA uniform.\n\nThe award was first presented in 1954 by the United States Department of Justice as the Young American Award for Service and the Young American Award for Bravery. Each of these awards were to be presented to two young people from each state and territory annually. The Justice Department had trouble promoting the award and approached the BSA for assistance in 1966.\n\nWith the launch of coeducational Exploring in 1968, the BSA took on the role of soliciting and receiving nominations, and assumed the program in 1971. The awards were originally available to youth ages 15 through 25; in 2005, it was changed to college students ages 19 through 25.\n\nThe original medals were suspended from neck ribbons, but the BSA soon changed them to a table medal, with the medallion placed in a block of acrylic glass. The ribbon version of the medal was restored for the national award after the introduction of Venturing.\n\nThe square knot insignia is the same as was used for three former Exploring awards: the Explorer Silver Award, Exploring Achievement Award and the Exploring G.O.L.D. Award. This knot may also be worn by those Scouting and Venturing leaders who have earned the predecessor awards.\n\nFrom 1968 through 2008, there have been 188 recipients of the national award.\n\n1968\n\n1969\n\n1970\n\n1971\n\n1972\n\n1973\n\n1974\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\n1977\n\n1978\n\n1979\n\n1980\n\n1981\n\n1982\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nPer the national office national awards will no longer be given.\n\n"}
