The process is focused on enabling teachers to translate teaching theory into practice. The questions were developed by Professor David E. Lynch in 1998. The 8 questions, which are organised into three design phases, are answered in their numerical sequence.\n\nOUTCOMES PHASE\nLMQ1: What have my students achieved to date?\nLMQ2: What do I am to achieve in my students\nSTRATEGY PHASE\nLMQ3: How do my students best learn?\nLMQ4: What resources do I have at my disposal?\nLMQ5: What are my teaching strategies?\nLMQ6: Who will do what to support the teaching strategy?\nEVIDENCE PHASE\nLMQ7: How will I check that students have achieved the defined learning outcomes?\nLMQ8: How will I report student progress?\n\nThe 8 LMQs have two key purposes. Firstly, they act as a ‘professional knowledge organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt as part of their preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.\n\nThe second purpose of the 8LMQs is to transition ‘teaching’ from ‘teacher centred activities’ to a more responsive ‘student-centred learning' approaches. The 8 LMQs are therefore a deliberate strategy to draw the teacher to the nuances of each student and away from ‘the one-size-fits all’ approaches that are characteristic of ‘teaching’ and ‘curriculum planning’ and lesson planning.\n\nThe 8 LMQs are underpinned by the Dimensions of Learning (DoL) pedagogic framework. DoL provides a bank of evidence-based teaching strategies for developing and delivering specific learning experiences or lessons. By this is meant a series of ‘step-by-step’ teaching strategies that have been confirmed by research as underpinning successful learning experiences.\n\nThe reference to learning management is strategic as the questions were developed as a subset of the learning management teaching knowledge base. The learning management concept is further explained at www.aaclm.com\n\nThe 8 Learning Management Questions underpin teacher training at Central Queensland University and Charles Darwin University in Australia and inform teaching in the Northern Territory. \n"}

AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.\n\nCommonly used textbooks that meet the curriculum requirements include:\nAmerican conservatives have criticized the curriculum for downplaying American exceptionalism and failing to foster patriotism. In 2014, there were protests against it in the Jefferson County Public Schools district in Colorado. In 2015, a bill to replace the curriculum was passed by the Oklahoma House of Representatives’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.\n\nThe AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts. Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from just before European contact with Native Americans to the present day. Moreover, section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.\n\nSection II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two essays. Section II, part A, is a document-based question (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. \n\nEach long essay essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical thinking skills: patterns of continuity and change over time, comparison, or causation. Both of the essay questions will address the same historical thinking skill. In addition, neither essay's time frame will be exclusively before 1607 (the founding of Jamestown) or after 1980 (President Reagan's election). There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm; but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.\n\nIn May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide, making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.\n\nThe AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.\n\nThe score distributions since 2007 were:\nThe College Board has released information on the composite score range (out of 180) required to obtain each grade:\nNote: The above composite score cut points reflect the pre-2011 grading formula which deducted 0.25 points for every incorrect multiple choice answer.\n\n"}

{"id": "16387185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16387185", "title": "Anganwadi", "text": "Anganwadi\n\nAnganwadi is a type of rural child care centre in India. They were started by the Indian government in 1975 as part of the Integrated Child Development Services program to combat child hunger and malnutrition. \"Anganwadi\" means \"courtyard shelter\" in Indian languages. \n\nA typical Anganwadi centre provides basic health care in Indian villages. It is a part of the Indian public health care system. Basic health care activities include contraceptive counseling and supply, nutrition education and supplementation, as well as pre-school activities. The centres may be used as depots for oral rehydration salts, basic medicines and contraceptives.\nAs many as 13.3 lakh (a lakh is 100,000) Anganwadi and mini-Anganwadi centres (AWCs/mini-AWCs) are operational out of 13.7 lakh sanctioned AWCs/mini-AWCs, as of 31 January 2013. These centres provide supplementary nutrition, non-formal pre-school education, nutrition and health education, immunization, health check-up and referral services of which later three services are provided in convergence with public health systems.\n\nThe Ministry of Women and Child Development has laid down guidelines for the responsibilities of Anganwadi workers (AWW). These include showing community support and active participation in executing this programme, to conduct regular quick surveys of all families, organize pre-school activities, provide health and nutrition education to families especially pregnant women on how to breastfeed, etc., motivating families to adopt family planning, educating parents about child growth and development, assist in the implementation and execution of Kishori Shakti Yojana (KSY) to educate teenage girls and parents by organizing social awareness programmes etc., identify disabilities in children, and so on.\n\nEvery 40 to 65 Anganwadi workers are supervised by one Mukhya Sevika. They provide on-the-job training. In addition to performing the responsibilities with the Anganwadi workers, they have other duties such as keeping track of who are benefiting from the programme from low economic status — specifically those who belong to the malnourished category; guide the Anganwadi workers in assessing the age and weight of children and how to plot their weights; demonstrate effective methods, for example, in providing health and nutrition education to mothers; and maintain statistics of Anganwadis and the workers to determine what can be improved. The Mukhya Sevika then reports to the Child development Projects Officer (CDPO).\n\nDespite decades of impressive growth, India has a acute shortage of doctors. The doctor population ratio in 2013 was 1:1800, the recommended level is 1:1000. Through the Anganwadi system, the country is trying to meet its goal of enhanced health facilities that aren't affordable and accessible for local populations. \n\nIn many ways an Anganwadi worker is better equipped than a physician in reaching out to the rural population. Since the worker lives with the people she is in a better position to identify the cause of health problems and hence counter them. She has a very good insight of the health status in her region. Secondly though Anganwadi workers are not as skilled or qualified as professionals they have better social skills thus making it easier to interact with the people. Moreover, since these workers are from the village, they are trusted which makes it easier for them to help the people. Last but not the least, Anganwadi workers are well aware of the ways of the people, are comfortable with the language, know the rural folk personally etc. This makes it very easy for them to figure out the problems being faced by the people and ensure that they are solved.\n\nThere have been public policy discussions over whether to make Anganwadis universally available to all eligible children and mothers who want their children there. This would require significant increases in budgetary allocation and a rise in Anganwadis centers to over 16 lakh.\n\nAnganwadis are staffed by officers and their helpers, who are typically women from poor families. The workers do not have permanent jobs with comprehensive retirement benefits like other government staff. Worker protests (by the All India Anganwadi Workers Federation) and public debates on this topic are ongoing. There are periodic reports of corruption and crimes against women in some Anganwadi centers. There are legal and societal issues when Anganwadi-serviced children fall sick or die.\n\nIn announcing the 2008-2009 budget, Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram stated that salaries would be increased for Anganwadi workers to ₹15000 per month and helpers to ₹6500 per month. In March 2008 there was debate about whether packaged foods (such as biscuits) should become part of the food served. Detractors, including Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, disagreed saying it will become the only food consumed by the children. Options for increasing partnership with the private sector are continuing.\n\nIn a major initiative, the centre is set to digitise the work of Anganwadis starting with 27 most-backward districts in Uttar Pradesh: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Anganwadis will be provided with tablet computers to record data that will be integrated with the health ministry which is involved in carrying out immunisation, health check-ups, and nutrition education under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).\n\nThe Integrated Child Development Services (India) Scheme did not have provision for construction of AWC buildings as this was envisaged to be provided by the community except for the North Eastern States. For them, financial support was provided for construction of AWC buildings since 2001-02 at a unit cost of ₹175,000.\n\nAs part of the strengthening and restructuring the ICDS Scheme, the government approved a provision of construction of 200,000 Anganwadi centre buildings at a cost of ₹450,000 per unit during XII Plan period in a phased manner with cost sharing ratio of 75:25 between centre and states (other than the NER, where it will be at 90:10).\n\nFurther, construction of AWC has been notified as a permissible activity under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). The construction of AWC buildings can be taken up in convergence with MNREGA.\n\nThe Anganwadi is functioning as indicated by a collection of reports by the leading daily newspaper, \"The Times of India\". To quote from the first report,\n\n\"Two children of an anganwadi centre in Angul district died in a freak accident on Friday. They drowned in a rainwater-filled pit dug near their anganwadi centre. The children are Priyanka Dash (3) and Monalisa Naik (4) of Tentulihata village within Banarapala police limits, 20 km from here. The incident comes two months after seven children of an anganwadi centre were killed in Nayagarh district when rain-soaked brick wall of the centre fell on them while they were having their mid-day meals.\"\n\nIn a desperate attempt to improve the poor state of governance of the Anganvadi scheme in his budget speech for the financial year 2011-12, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee increased the salary for Anganwadi workers to ₹3000 per month and helpers to ₹1500 per month — about one tenth of the salary of government office assistant.\n\nUNICEF and the UN Millennium Development Goals of reducing infant mortality and improving maternal care are the impetus for increasing focus on the Anganwadis.\n\nWorkers and helpers are expected to be trained per WHO standards.\n\n\n\nedited on 2018-06-11 by abhilasha chhabra"}

It is graded on a 20-point scale.\n\nTerminology: Apolytirio, Απολυτήριο (Dhimotiki), 1976–present); Apolytirion, Απολυτήριον (Katharevousa (up until 1976)).\n\nThe system and examinations accepted for entrance into highest (Greek: ανὠτατη, \"anotati\") and higher (Greek: ανώτερη, \"anoteri\") education in Greece went through major changes since 1980.\n\nThe most common/known Lyceum is the General Lyceum (Greek: Γενικὀ Λύκειο, \"Geniko Lykeio\").\n\nIn the first 2 grades, all students are taught the same subjects. In 3rd grade, students followed a core programme of\ngeneral education and each \"Desmi\" (Α, Β, Γ, and Δ) followed a specialized program (Greek: Δέσμη, Δέσμες / \"Desmi\" (singular), \"Desmes\" (plural)).\n\nAn Apolytirio of \"Geniko Lykeio\" included the GPA (scale 1–20), student's conduct information and consisted of:\n\nFrom 1984 until 1998 \"only\" the \"total score\" of the \"Panhellenic Examinations\" (Greek: Πανελλήνιες / Πανελλαδικές Εξετάσεις) was accepted for the highest/higher education, Universities and Polytechnics (\"Highest Education\") or the Technological Educational Institutes (T.E.I.) (\"Higher Education\"; by law Π.Δ. 2916/2001 in 2001 were considered to be at the same rank as Universities.\n\nThe total Score was calculated from the individual scores, with one of the subjects having a higher weight percentage.\ne.g. for A Desmi: Mathematics, B Desmi: Biology, etc.\n\nThe 4 \"Desmes\" (A,B,Γ and Δ) were:\n\nStudents had to preselect their choices in a numerical order of preference—using the bases of last year's Panhellenic Examinations' only as a guide—and submit them to their school on a given deadline, using a 4-pages machine-readable document (Greek: μηχανογραφικό δελτίο, \"michanografiko deltio\").\nThe results of the National Examinations determined not only who will pass into highest/higher education but also next year's bases.\n\nThe total individual score for every subject was 0–160 which was the sum of the 2 examiners' scores based on the scale 0–80 each. A remarking by a 3rd examiner would determine the final score if there was a large difference between the first two scores.\nMaximum total score = ((160 x 1.15)+ (160 x 0.95) + (160 x 0.95) + (160 x 0.95)) x 10 = 6400 units\n\n\nFirst, the scores for every student and later the bases for each course were published in every school across the country, directly from the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs. Bases were also being broadcast on Greek TV during the day.\n\nIt was allowed to keep the individual subjects' scores (up to 3) and resit on exams to increase the total score, but only for 2 more examinations.\n\nThere are three grades in \"Eniaio Lykeio\" and each grade is divided in classes.\n\nThe 1st grade of \"Eniaio Lykeio\" operates as an orientation year with a general knowledge programme.\n\nThe 2nd grade includes three directions: Humanities (Θεωρητική Κατεύθυνση), Science (Θετική Κατεύθυνση) and Technology (Τεχνολογική Κατεύθυνση).\n\nIn the 3rd grade we have again the three directions but the Technology direction operates in two courses: i) the Technology and the Production course and ii) the Information Science and Services course.\n\nIn \"Eniaio Lykeio\", there is the Support Teaching Programme. This programme can be attended by those pupils who wish to do so, regardless of their performance.\n\nAttendance in Eniaio Lykeio is obligatory for those students who wish to continue their education in a Greek University.\n\nThe access to tertiary education (highest education) is permitted only with the system of \"Eniaio Lykeio\". Right of entrance have only the holders of the \"Apolytirio\".\n\nThe written examinations in the subjects, either at school's level or at national level, count equivalently towards the Apolytirio's GPA. On the contrary, for entrance in highest education \"only\" the subjects examined nationally in written form are being considered. The Apolytirio is detached completely from highest education's entrance.\n\nDirection Subjects (11 Hours)\n\nPanhellenic National Level Examinations involve 6–7 subjects of the General Lyceum (3rd grade).\n\nBesides the Lyceum Diploma (\"Apolytirio\") the achievement score on a certificate awarded (Βεβαίωση, \"Bebaiosi\") takes into account final year school grade (school level evaluation) and the grades on 6 subjects of the National Examinations.\n\nDirection: 4 subjects\n\nGeneral Education: 2 subjects\n\nThere are 3 directions (Human Sciences, Economy and Computer Sciences, Natural Sciences).\n\nThe Panhellenic national level exams involve 4 or 5 main subjects with which you compete in one or two scientific fields.\n\nThe Apolytirio may be accepted in UK and other universities.\n\nIndividuals holding this qualification can check the comparability of this award with UK NARIC; the National Agency, managed to provide (on behalf of the UK Government) the only official source of information on international qualifications to organizations recruiting from overseas and to individuals wishing to work or study in the UK if they are going to study or work in the UK.\n\nAlthough the total score from Panhellenic Examinations determined the entrance in higher/highest education in Greece, the GPA of the Apolytirio, is the entry qualification most often requested in order to be accepted in higher education abroad.\nThe results of the Panhellenic Examinations are usually not requested or are referred by different names such as \"General Entrance Examinations\".\n\n"}
{"id": "35151113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35151113", "title": "Automated essay scoring", "text": "Automated essay scoring\n\nAutomated essay scoring (AES) is the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to essays written in an educational setting. It is a method of educational assessment and an application of natural language processing. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades—for example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of statistical classification.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to a growing interest in AES. Among them are cost, accountability, standards, and technology. Rising education costs have led to pressure to hold the educational system accountable for results by imposing standards. The advance of information technology promises to measure educational achievement at reduced cost.\n\nThe use of AES for high-stakes testing in education has generated significant backlash, with opponents pointing to research that computers cannot yet grade writing accurately and arguing that their use for such purposes promotes teaching writing in reductive ways (i.e. teaching to the test).\n\nMost historical summaries of AES trace the origins of the field to the work of Ellis Batten Page. In 1966, he argued for the possibility of scoring essays by computer, and in 1968 he published his successful work with a program called Project Essay Grade™ (PEG™). Using the technology of that time, computerized essay scoring would not have been cost-effective, so Page abated his efforts for about two decades.\n\nBy 1990, desktop computers had become so powerful and so widespread that AES was a practical possibility. As early as 1982, a UNIX program called Writer's Workbench was able to offer punctuation, spelling, and grammar advice. In collaboration with several companies (notably Educational Testing Service), Page updated PEG and ran some successful trials in the early 1990s.\n\nPeter Foltz and Thomas Landauer developed a system using a scoring engine called the Intelligent Essay Assessor™ (IEA). IEA was first used to score essays in 1997 for their undergraduate courses. It is now a product from Pearson Educational Technologies and used for scoring within a number of commercial products and state and national exams.\n\nIntelliMetric® is Vantage Learning's AES engine. Its development began in 1996. It was first used commercially to score essays in 1998.\n\nEducational Testing Service offers e-rater®, an automated essay scoring program. It was first used commercially in February 1999. Jill Burstein was the team leader in its development. ETS's Criterion Online Writing Evaluation Service uses the e-rater engine to provide both scores and targeted feedback.\n\nLawrence Rudner has done some work with Bayesian scoring, and developed a system called BETSY (Bayesian Essay Test Scoring sYstem). Some of his results have been published in print or online, but no commercial system incorporates BETSY as yet.\n\nUnder the leadership of Howard Mitzel and Sue Lottridge, Pacific Metrics developed a constructed response automated scoring engine, CRASE®. Currently utilized by several state departments of education and in a U.S. Department of Education-funded Enhanced Assessment Grant, Pacific Metrics’ technology has been used in large-scale formative and summative assessment environments since 2007.\n\nMeasurement Inc. acquired the rights to PEG in 2002 and has continued to develop it.\n\nIn 2012, the Hewlett Foundation sponsored a competition on Kaggle called the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP). 201 challenge participants attempted to predict, using AES, the scores that human raters would give to thousands of essays written to eight different prompts. The intent was to demonstrate that AES can be as reliable as human raters, or more so. This competition also hosted a separate demonstration among 9 AES vendors on a subset of the ASAP data. Although the investigators reported that the automated essay scoring was as reliable as human scoring, this claim was not substantiated by any statistical tests because some of the vendors required that no such tests be performed as a precondition for their participation. Moreover, the claim that the Hewlett Study demonstrated that AES can be as reliable as human raters has since been strongly contested, including by Randy E. Bennett, the Norman O. Frederiksen Chair in Assessment Innovation at the Educational Testing Service. Some of the major criticisms of the study have been that five of the eight datasets consisted of paragraphs rather than essays, four of the eight data sets were graded by human readers for content only rather than for writing ability, and that rather than measuring human readers and the AES machines against the \"true score\", the average of the two readers' scores, the study employed an artificial construct, the \"resolved score\", which in four datasets consisted of the higher of the two human scores if there was a disagreement. This last practice, in particular, gave the machines an unfair advantage by allowing them to round up for these datasets.\n\nFrom the beginning, the basic procedure for AES has been to start with a training set of essays that have been carefully hand-scored. The program evaluates surface features of the text of each essay, such as the total number of words, the number of subordinate clauses, or the ratio of uppercase to lowercase letters—quantities that can be measured without any human insight. It then constructs a mathematical model that relates these quantities to the scores that the essays received. The same model is then applied to calculate scores of new essays.\n\nRecently, one such mathematical model was created by Isaac Persing and Vincent Ng. which not only evaluates essays on the above features, but also on their argument strength. It evaluates various features of the essay, such as the agreement level of the author and reasons for the same, adherence to the prompt's topic, locations of argument components (major claim, claim, premise), errors in the arguments, cohesion in the arguments among various other features. In contrast to the other models mentioned above, this model is closer in duplicating human insight while grading essays.\n\nThe various AES programs differ in what specific surface features they measure, how many essays are required in the training set, and most significantly in the mathematical modeling technique. Early attempts used linear regression. Modern systems may use linear regression or other machine learning techniques often in combination with other statistical techniques such as latent semantic analysis and Bayesian inference.\n\nAny method of assessment must be judged on validity, fairness, and reliability. An instrument is valid if it actually measures the trait that it purports to measure. It is fair if it does not, in effect, penalize or privilege any one class of people. It is reliable if its outcome is repeatable, even when irrelevant external factors are altered.\n\nBefore computers entered the picture, high-stakes essays were typically given scores by two trained human raters. If the scores differed by more than one point, a third, more experienced rater would settle the disagreement. In this system, there is an easy way to measure reliability: by inter-rater agreement. If raters do not consistently agree within one point, their training may be at fault. If a rater consistently disagrees with whichever other raters look at the same essays, that rater probably needs more training.\n\nVarious statistics have been proposed to measure inter-rater agreement. Among them are percent agreement, Scott's π, Cohen's κ, Krippendorf's α, Pearson's correlation coefficient r, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient.\n\nPercent agreement is a simple statistic applicable to grading scales with scores from 1 to n, where usually 4 ≤ n ≤ 6. It is reported as three figures, each a percent of the total number of essays scored: exact agreement (the two raters gave the essay the same score), adjacent agreement (the raters differed by at most one point; this includes exact agreement), and extreme disagreement (the raters differed by more than two points). Expert human graders were found to achieve exact agreement on 53% to 81% of all essays, and adjacent agreement on 97% to 100%.\n\nInter-rater agreement can now be applied to measuring the computer's performance. A set of essays is given to two human raters and an AES program. If the computer-assigned scores agree with one of the human raters as well as the raters agree with each other, the AES program is considered reliable. Alternatively, each essay is given a \"true score\" by taking the average of the two human raters' scores, and the two humans and the computer are compared on the basis of their agreement with the true score.\n\nSome researchers have reported that their AES systems can, in fact, do better than a human. Page made this claim for PEG in 1994. Scott Elliot said in 2003 that IntelliMetric typically outperformed human scorers. AES machines, however, appear to be less reliable than human readers for any kind of complex writing test.\n\nIn current practice, high-stakes assessments such as the GMAT are always scored by at least one human. AES is used in place of a second rater. A human rater resolves any disagreements of more than one point.\n\nAES has been criticized on various grounds. Yang et al. mention \"the overreliance on surface features of responses, the insensitivity to the content of responses and to creativity, and the vulnerability to new types of cheating and test-taking strategies.\" Several critics are concerned that students' motivation will be diminished if they know that no human will read their writing. Among the most telling critiques are reports of intentionally gibberish essays being given high scores.\n\nOn March 12, 2013, HumanReaders.Org launched an online petition, \"Professionals Against Machine Scoring of Student Essays in High-Stakes Assessment\". Within weeks, the petition gained thousands of signatures, including Noam Chomsky, and was cited in a number of newspapers, including \"The New York Times\", and on a number of education and technology blogs.\n\nThe petition describes the use AES for high-stakes testing as \"trivial\", \"reductive\", \"inaccurate\", \"undiagnostic\", \"unfair\", and \"secretive\".\n\nIn a detailed summary of research on AES, the petition site notes, \"RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOW THAT no one—students, parents, teachers, employers, administrators, legislators—can rely on machine scoring of essays ... AND THAT machine scoring does not measure, and therefore does not promote, authentic acts of writing.\"\n\nThe petition specifically addresses the use of AES for high-stakes testing and says nothing about other possible uses.\n\nMost resources for automated essay scoring are proprietary. \n"}

According to the aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified for its own sake rather than for its extra-musical benefits.\n\n\nRichard Colwell edited \"Basic Concepts in Music Education II\" in 1991.

Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 100 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales.\n\nCORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors Wendy Carlin of University college London and Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute, and , who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that \"altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing.\"\n\nFollowing the global economic crisis of 2008, students had formed groups, such as the International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics (ISIPE) and Rethinking Economics, to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that \"teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum\". Professor Carlin has written that:\n\n\"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral and self-interested, perfectly competitive market prices equate supply to demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while environmental degradation, instability, and inequality are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted on the public’s mind.\"\n\nLaunched in October 2013 at HM Treasury, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was \"humbler, more empirical and more topical\". Professor Carlin wrote that students \"are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology\", and that CORE would ensure that \"digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an empirical discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies.\"\n\nCORE's courses are offered through open access online ebooks published on its web site. Its ebooks use a Creative Commons license so that \"any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students.\"\n\n\"The Economy\" was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. In 2017, a print version of \"The Economy\" was published by Oxford University Press.\n\nIn 2018, CORE posted the first units of \"ESPP\", an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like \"The Economy\", it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the Nuffield Foundation.\n\nAlso in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of \"Doing Economics\", a collection of empirical projects designed to teach quantitative methods in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation.\n\nCORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees.\n\nThe day-to-day running of the project is based at University College London. The course and support materials have been created by academic economists who volunteer their time, including Yann Algan (Sciences Po, Paris), Timothy Besley (London School of Economics), Diane Coyle (University of Manchester), Cameron Hepburn (University of Oxford), and Kevin O’Rourke (University of Oxford).\n\nThe steering group is Wendy Carlin (University College London), Samuel Bowles (Santa Fe Institute), Margaret Stevens (head of the Department of Economics, University of Oxford), and Oscar Landerretche, the president of Codelco. In 2017, CORE USA, based at Barnard College, was set up to improve outreach in the US.\n\nOther prominent economists have contributed to the published material, including Nobel laureates James Heckman, Alvin Roth and Joseph Stiglitz, who recorded videos for it on inequality in education, matching markets and the financial crisis.\n\nCORE funds its projects through grants. Startup funding was provided by the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Current Funders include the Nuffield Foundation, HM Treasury, Friends Provident Foundation, The Bank of England, and the International Economic Association.\n\nCORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as \"Principles of Economics\" by Greg Mankiw are little different in content to the first modern text book, \"Economics\" by Paul Samuelson, which was published in 1948., meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then:\"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and John Nash – initiated a process that eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course.\"CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as asymmetric information, strategic social interactions and incomplete contracts should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are \"mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics.\"\n\n\"The Economy\" has been received favourably. \"The Economist\" wrote that \"[e]arly results are promising\":\n\n\"The Economy\" does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.In The New Yorker, John Cassidy wrote that \"The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them.\"\n\nThe Times Higher Education Supplement called the course \"a bold revamp\" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at University College London:The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year microeconomics module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. ... In macroeconomics, the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in 2015-16.\"\n\nSome curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the Rethinking Economics welcomed CORE’s \"incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical pluralism that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done.\"\n\nYuan Yang, one of the founders of Rethinking Economics, told The Financial Times that: “Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.” \n\nUniversities who are using CORE include:\n\n\nCORE Team, The (2017). \"The Economy, Economics for a Changing World\".

{"id": "187472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187472", "title": "Certified Public Accountant", "text": "Certified Public Accountant\n\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA) is the title of qualified accountants in numerous countries in the English-speaking world. In the United States, the CPA is a license to provide accounting services to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, almost every state (49 out of 50) has passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination, 150 semester units of college education, and one year of accounting related experience.\n\nContinuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or who have requested conversion to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation \"CPA Inactive\" or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide attestation (including auditing) opinions on financial statements. Many CPAs are members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and their state CPA society.\n\nState laws vary widely regarding whether a non-CPA is even allowed to use the title \"accountant.\" For example, Texas prohibits the use of the designations \"accountant\" and \"auditor\" by a person not certified as a Texas CPA, unless that person is a CPA in another state, is a non-resident of Texas, and otherwise meets the requirements for practice in Texas by out-of-state CPA firms and practitioners.\n\nMany other countries also use the title CPA to designate local public accountants.\n\nOne important function performed by CPAs relates to assurance services. The most commonly performed assurance services are financial audit services where CPAs attest to the reasonableness of disclosures, the freedom from material misstatement, and the adherence to the applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in financial statements. CPAs can also be employed within corporations (termed \"the private sector\") in finance or operations positions such as financial analyst, finance manager, controller, chief financial officer (CFO), or chief executive officer (CEO). These CPAs do not provide services directly to the public.\n\nAlthough some CPA firms serve as business consultants, the consulting role has been under scrutiny following the Enron scandal where Arthur Andersen simultaneously provided audit and consulting services which affected their ability to maintain independence in their audit duties. This incident resulted in many accounting firms divesting in their consulting divisions, but this trend has since reversed. In audit engagements, CPAs are (and have always been) required by professional standards and Federal and State laws to maintain independence (both in fact and in appearance) from the entity for which they are conducting an attestation (audit and review) engagement. Although most individual CPAs who work as consultants do not also work as auditors, if the CPA firm is auditing the same company that the firm also does consulting work for, then there is a conflict of interest. This conflict voids the CPA firm's independence for multiple reasons, including: (1) the CPA firm would be auditing its own work or the work the firm suggested, and (2) the CPA firm may be pressured into unduly giving a positive (unmodified) audit opinion so as not to jeopardize the consulting revenue the firm receives from the client.\n\nCPAs also have a niche within the income tax return preparation industry. Many small to mid-sized firms have both a tax and an auditing department. Along with attorneys and Enrolled Agents, CPAs may represent taxpayers in matters before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Although the IRS regulates the practice of tax representation, it has no authority to regulate tax return preparers.\n\nMany states also allow unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants. For example, California allows unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants if they work under the control and supervision of a CPA. However, the California Board of Accountancy itself has determined that the terms \"accountant\" and \"accounting\" are misleading to members of the public, many of whom believe that a person who uses these terms must be licensed. As part of the California Poll, survey research showed that 55 percent of Californians believe that a person who advertises as an \"accountant\" must be licensed, 26 percent did not believe a license was required, and 19 percent did not know.\n\nWhether providing services directly to the public or employed by corporations or associations, CPAs can operate in virtually any area of finance including:\n\nTo become a CPA in the United States, the candidate must sit for and pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (Uniform CPA Exam), which is set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and administered by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA). The CPA designation was first established in law in New York State on April 17, 1896.\n\nEligibility to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam is determined by individual state boards of accountancy. Many states have adopted what is known as the \"150 hour rule\" (150 college semester units or the equivalent), which usually requires an additional year of education past a regular 4 year college degree, or a master's degree. Some universities offer a 5-year combined bachelor's/master's degree program, allowing a student to earn both degrees while receiving the 150 hours needed for exam eligibility.\n\nThe Uniform CPA Exam tests general principles of state law such as the laws of contracts and agency (questions not tailored to the variances of any particular state) and some federal laws as well.\n\nAlthough the CPA exam is uniform, licensing and certification requirements are imposed separately by each state's laws and therefore vary from state to state.\n\nState requirements for the CPA qualification can be summed up as the \"Three Es\"—Education, Examination and Experience. The education requirement normally must be fulfilled as part of the eligibility criteria to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam. The examination component is the Uniform CPA Exam itself. Some states have a two-tier system whereby an individual would first become certified—usually by passing the Uniform CPA Exam. That individual would then later be eligible to be licensed once a certain amount of work experience is accomplished. Other states have a one-tier system whereby an individual would be certified and licensed at the same time when both the CPA exam is passed and the work experience requirement has been met.\n\nTwo-tier states include Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Montana, and Nebraska. The trend is for two-tier states to gradually move towards a one-tier system. Since 2002, the state boards of accountancy in Washington and South Dakota have ceased issuing CPA \"certificates\" and instead issue CPA \"licenses.\" Illinois planned to follow suit in 2012.\n\nA number of states are two-tiered, but require work experience for the CPA certificate, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe experience component varies from state to state:\n\nOver 40 of the state boards now require applicants for CPA status to complete a special examination on ethics, which is effectively a \"fifth exam\" in terms of requirements to become a CPA. The majority of these accept the AICPA self-study \"Professional Ethics for CPAs\" CPE course or another course in general professional ethics. Many states, however, require that the ethics course include a review of that state's specific rules for professional practice.\n\nLike other professionals, CPAs are required to take continuing education courses toward continuing professional development (continuing professional education [CPE]) to renew their license. Requirements vary by state (Wisconsin does not require any CPE for CPAs) but the vast majority require an average of 40 hours of CPE every year with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. The requirement can be fulfilled through attending live seminars, webcast seminars, or through self-study (textbooks, videos, online courses, all of which require a test to receive credit). In general, state boards accept group live and group internet-based credits for all credit requirements, while some states cap the number of credits obtained through the self-study format. All CPAs are encouraged to periodically review their state requirements. As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course at some frequency (such as every or every other renewal period). Ethics requirements vary by state and the courses range from 2–8 hours. AICPA guidelines (which are adopted by many state boards) grant licensees 1 hour of CPE credit for every 50 minutes of instruction.\n\nA CPA license may be suspended or revoked for various reasons. Common reasons include these:\n\nMany states had (although a few still do) a second tier of accountant qualification in addition to that of CPA, usually entitled \"Public Accountant\" or \"Licensed Public Accountant\" (with designatory letters \"PA\" or \"LPA\"), although other titles have included \"Registered Public Accountant\" (RPA), \"Accounting Practitioner\" (AP), and \"Registered Accounting Practitioner\" (RAP). Such designations served to help regulate the practice of public accounting in that state by grandfathering through licensure non-CPA accountants who were already practicing public accounting before a regulatory state accountancy law was enacted. The majority of states have closed the designation \"Public Accountant\" (PA) to new entrants, with only five states continuing to offer the designation. Many PAs belong to the National Society of Accountants.\n\nMany states prohibit the use of the designations \"Public Accountant\" or \"Licensed Public Accountant\" (or the abbreviations \"PA\" or \"LPA\") by a person who is not certified as a PA in that state.\n\nIn Australia the designation \"Public Accountant\" is used by members of the Institute of Public Accountants of Australia.\n\nAn accountant is required to meet the legal requirements of any state in which the accountant wishes to practice.\n\nIn recent years, practice mobility for CPAs has become a major business concern for CPAs and their clients. Practice mobility for CPAs is the general ability of a licensee in good standing from a substantially equivalent state to gain practice privilege outside of their home state without getting an additional license in the state where the CPA will serve a client or an employer. In today's digital age, many organizations requiring the professional services of CPAs conduct business on an interstate and international basis and have compliance responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, the practice of CPAs often extends across state lines and international boundaries.\n\nDiffering requirements for CPA certification, reciprocity, temporary practice and other aspects of state accountancy legislation in the 55 U.S. licensing jurisdictions (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) make the interstate practice and mobility of CPAs more complicated. By removing boundaries to practice in the U.S., CPAs are able to more readily serve individuals and businesses in need of their expertise. At the same time, the state board of accountancy's ability to discipline is enhanced by being based on a CPA and the CPA firm's performance of services (either physically, electronically or otherwise within a state), rather than being based on whether a state license is held.\n\nThe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) have analyzed the current system for gaining practice privileges across state lines and have endorsed a uniform mobility system. This model approach is detailed through the substantial equivalency provision (Section 23) of the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The UAA is an \"evergreen\" model licensing law co-developed, maintained, reviewed and updated by the AICPA and NASBA. The model provides a uniform approach to regulation of the accounting profession.\n\nUnder Section 23 of the UAA, a CPA with a license in good standing from a jurisdiction with CPA licensing requirements essentially equivalent to those outlined in the UAA is deemed to be “substantially equivalent,” or a licensee who individually meets the requirements of:\n\nUniform adoption of the UAA's substantial equivalency provision creates a system similar to the nation's driver's license program by providing CPAs with mobility while retaining and strengthening state boards’ ability to protect the public interest. The system enables consumers to receive timely services from the CPA best suited to the job, regardless of location, and without the hindrances of unnecessary filings, forms and increased costs that do not protect the public interest.\n\nAs of October 2012, a total of 49 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed mobility laws and are now in the implementation and navigation phases. Only the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam have not passed mobility laws. On September 20, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that permits cross-border mobility for CPAs. The law went into effect July 1, 2013. The District of Columbia passed mobility laws that went into effect on October 1, 2012.\n\nThe CPA designation is granted by individual state boards, not the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Membership in the AICPA is not obligatory for CPAs, although some CPAs do join. To become a full member of AICPA, the applicant must hold a valid CPA certificate or license from at least one of the fifty-five U.S. state/territory boards of accountancy; some additional requirements apply.\n\nAICPA members approved a proposed bylaw amendment to make eligible for voting membership individuals who previously held a CPA certificate/license or have met all the requirements for CPA certification in accordance with the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The AICPA announced its plan to accept applications from individuals meeting these criteria, beginning no later than January 1, 2011.\n\nCPAs may also choose to become members of their local state association or society (also optional). Benefits of membership in a state CPA association range from deep discounts on seminars that qualify for continuing education credits to protecting the public and profession's interests by tracking and lobbying legislative issues that affect local state tax and financial planning issues.\n\nCPAs who maintain state CPA society memberships are required to follow a society professional code of conduct (in addition to any code enforced by the state regulatory authority), further reassuring clients that the CPA is an ethical business professional conducting a legitimate business who can be trusted to handle confidential personal and business financial matters. State CPA associations also serve the community by providing information and resources about the CPA profession and welcome inquiries from students, business professionals and the public-at-large.\n\nCPAs are not normally restricted to membership in the state CPA society in which they reside or hold a license or certificate. Many CPAs who live near state borders or who hold CPA status in more than one state may join more than one state CPA society.\n\nState Associations\n\n\n"}

These nurses work in a variety of settings such as jails, prisons, and juvenile detention centers. In these correctional settings, nurses are the primary healthcare providers.\n\nBecause of the varying size of correctional facilities, there is a wide range of roles correctional nurses fill.. Some facilities are as large as small cities and include an in-house hospital with inpatient and emergency facilities. Most correctional nurses fall into four categories: Reception Screening, Chronic Care Clinicians, Medication Administration, and Ambulatory Care (often called, \"sick call\").\n\nIntake Screening is often called, \"R&R Screening\" for, \"Reception and Release\". This is the process where nurses screen inmates entering the facility for a variety of immediate medical and mental health needs such as alcohol or drug withdrawal, suicide potential, trauma, infectious diseases, and necessity for chronic medications. Custody uses this information in order to decide which part of the facility is appropriate for housing, sometimes initiating movement to another facility if the inmate's needs cannot be met at the initial placement. The nurse performing intake screening generally schedules the inmate for an appointment with a healthcare provider for a detailed history and physical depending on the inmate's needs and presence of chronic diseases.\n\nInmates with chronic health care concerns (asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) generally have regularly scheduled appointments in chronic care clinics. Generally overseen by a physician or other mid level provider such as a nurse practitioner. Nurses here provide patient assessments and education about chronic health concerns. \n\nMedications, even over-the-counter ones, can be misused in a correctional environment. Most frequently, medications are be administered to patients via a medication pass or pill line process. At scheduled times during the day, inmates requiring medication either report to a nurse located centrally in a medical unit or receive their doses in a housing unit.\n\nInmates requiring episodic health care generally follow a process called Sick Call. Inmates request treatment, generally by completing a form (a \"Sick Call Slip\") and are seen by a nurse. Most facilities have standardized protocols which allow administration of over-the-counter medications for simple conditions like headache, athlete’s foot, and constipation without the need for communication with a medical provider. An assessment of a more serious condition, or one that falls outside the protocols, would be referred to a provider for further evaluation.\n"}
{"id": "475460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475460", "title": "Culture industry", "text": "Culture industry\n\nThe term culture industry () was coined by the critical theorists Theodor Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter \"The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception\", of the book \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1944), wherein they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—films, radio programmes, magazines, etc.—that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity. Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the mass communications media, renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their economic circumstances. The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer especially perceived mass-produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts. In contrast, true psychological needs are freedom, creativity, and genuine happiness, which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by Herbert Marcuse. (See \"Eros and Civilization\", 1955).\n\nMembers of The Frankfurt School were much influenced by the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of Karl Marx, as well as the revisitation of the dialectical idealism of Hegel; both events are studied not in isolation, but as part of the process of change. As a group later joined by Jürgen Habermas, they were responsible for the formulation of critical theory. In works such as \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" and \"Negative Dialectics\", Adorno and Horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of mass culture has a political implication, namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single \"culture industry\" whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the \"masses\" to market interests.\n\nThe essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the supply-driven nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system. Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art. The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture.\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno make consistent comparisons between Fascist Germany and the American film industry. They highlight the presence of mass-produced culture, created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive, homogenised audience in both systems. This illustrates the logic of domination in post-enlightenment modern society, by monopoly capitalism or the nation state. Horkheimer and Adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that 'integrates its consumers from above', arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order, the holistic power of the individual is undermined.\n\nAdorno and Horkheimer's work was influenced by both the broader socio-political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists. Written in California in the early 1940s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically Jewish, German émigrés, The Culture Industry is influenced by European politics and the war by which the continent was consumed. Simultaneously, the American film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation, it was \"Hollywood at its most classical, American mass culture at its most Fordist\".\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social, political and economic theory, most notably:\n\n\nAnything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions. There will also be a use value: the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility. The exchange value will reflect its utility and the conditions of the market: the prices paid by the television broadcaster or at the box office. Yet, the modern soap operas with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass-produced cultural product. Only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value, e.g. \"Patton\" (1970), starring George C. Scott as the eponymous American general, was released at a time of considerable anti-war sentiment. The opening shot is of Patton in front of an American flag making an impassioned speech. This was a form of dialectic in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely (the thesis) or ironically (the antithesis) and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film. However, the film is manipulating specific historical events, not only as entertainment, but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities. Given that the subtext was instrumental and not \"value free\", ethical and philosophical considerations arise.\n\nNormally, only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries, but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight. A film like \"Patton\" is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which, according to Adorno, is regressing into a cultural blandness. To Hegel, order is good \"a priori\", i.e. it does not have to answer to those living under it. But, if order is disturbed? In \"Negative Dialectics\", Adorno believed this tended towards progress by stimulating the possibility of class conflict. Marx's theory of Historical Materialism was teleological, i.e. society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism. But Adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the \"status quo\" and stimulate the final communist state to emerge.\n\nA central point of the \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" is the topic of \"the Enlightenment as the deception of the masses\". The term \"culture industry\" is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture, the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to \"authentic culture\".\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them. The culture industry delivers the \"goods\" so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them. Through mass production, everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities. Everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what's best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible. Psychological drives become stoked to the point where sublimation is no longer possible.\n\nMovies serve as an example. \"All films have become similar in their basic form. They are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible. Even fantasy films, which claim to not reflect such reality, don't really live up to what they claim to be. No matter how unusual they strive to be, the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas. Also, for example, erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible.\"\nThe aims of the culture industry are—as in every industry—economic in nature. All endeavors become focused on economic success.\n\nAuthentic culture, however, is not goal-oriented, but is an end in itself. Authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities, but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought. Authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such. Authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre-formed schemas.\n\nAs for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry, Horkheimer and Adorno contend that it arises from companies' pursuit of the maximization of profit, in the economic sense. However, this cannot be said to be culture, or what culture is supposed to be. It can only be described as being a form of commerce, just like any other kind of commerce.\n\nThe culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn \"mass media\" and their consumers. \nHowever, for Adorno, the term \"culture industry\" does not refer to \"mass culture\", or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses. On the contrary, such involvement of the masses is only apparent, or a type of seeming democratic participation. Adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of \"defrauding of the masses\". Horkheimer and Adorno deliberately chose the term \"culture industry\" instead of \"mass culture\" or \"mass media\". \"The culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises.\" The culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity: \"Amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism.\" Horkheimer and Adorno, above all, in their critical analyses, delve into what they call \"the fraying of art\" and the \"de-artification of art\", and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry. Works of art have become commodified: Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement. According to Critical Theory, \"selling out\" is not the decisive factor involved, but rather it's the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue.\n\n\"Culture today is infecting everything with sameness.\" For Adorno and Horkheimer, subversion has become no longer possible.\n\nWiggershaus Rolf say that the products of mass culture would not be popular if people did not enjoy them, and that culture is self-determining in its administration. This would deny Adorno contemporary political significance, arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought. He also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore Adorno's work which, in part, stems from Adorno's inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories. For instance, Wiggershaus states: \"The other side of Adorno's apparently paradoxical definition was ignored: that only rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art was only possible, in any significant sense, as a product of subjectivity\"\n\nAdorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing Marxism. Whereas he accepted the classical Marxist analysis of society showing how one class exercises domination over another, he deviated from Marx in his failure to use dialectic as a method to propose ways to change. Marx's theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class, but Adorno and Horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement. \nAdorno's idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over. \nOther critics note that \"High culture\" too is not exempt from a role in the justification of capitalism. The establishment and reinforcement of elitism is seen by these critics as a key element in the role of such genres as opera and ballet.\n\n\n\n"}

It is awarded after two years of full-time study at a university or other higher education institution and is rated as a Level 5 qualification on both the Regulated Qualifications Framework and the European Qualifications Framework.\n\nThe Diploma certifies that a student has achieved a minimum standard for 2nd Year courses in science and liberal arts. If a student is undertaking a full Bachelor of Arts, a Diploma of Higher Education marks two-thirds of their undergraduate degree. Thus allowing the British Diploma to rank ahead of the American Associate of Arts (which in American parlance is a two-year undergraduate, or half of a BA/BS). That being said, American universities generally consider UK Diplomas equivalent to a college level Associate of Arts even though a British student typically holds more credit hours (and therefore more study time) in the arts, humanities and/or sciences.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Diploma is also the academic equivalent of the more vocational Higher National Diploma, awarded following further education and training courses.\n\nIn Scotland, a DipHE is worth 240 credit points (at least 120 at Level 7 and at least 80 at Level 8) on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework. (As a guide an ordinary degree is worth 360 credit points and an Honours degree is worth 480 credit points.)\n\nThey are accredited by the universities, except in the case of nurse and community and youth work education where the curriculum is prescribed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, students are permitted to use the postnominals DipHE after their name, sometimes followed by the course name in brackets and the University from which they earned their qualification.\n\nSometimes, having a DipHE can exempt the holder from some of the requirements of a bachelor's degree; for example, it might reduce the length of study or number of courses necessary to complete the qualification. This typically allows a Diploma holder to obtain a BA/BSc in one-third of the time.\n\nDiplomas are generally awarded on a pass/fail basis, and occasionally are awarded with honours when a student has distinguished themself. The two highest honours are Merit and Distinction.\n\n"}

Its population is just over 7 million inhabitants, of which 47% is less than 15 years old. Life expectancy is 55.8 years old for men and 58.9 years for women, and 33% of the population lives in rural areas.\n\n12.6% of the Congolese budget is spent on education; 40% on primary education, 31% on secondary level, and 27% on tertiary level. Only 1% goes to pre-primary education.\n\nEducation in Congo takes 13 years, from the first level of Primary School to the Higher Certificate.\n\nAccording to the 2005 UNDP report, 66.8% of Congolese are literate.\n\nPrimary level education in the Republic of the Congo takes six years. The average age at which children arrive at school is 5½ years. Primary school consists of six grades; two preparatory, two elementary, and two medium classes. At the end of the second medium class, the young learner is required to do the Secondary School Entry Test, on which his entry to secondary level is hinged.\n\nSecondary school takes seven years. It consists of two parts, the first one being \"college\", and the second \"lycée\".\n\nIn the republic of the Congo, a French-speaking country, the term \"college\" refers to the first four grades of the Secondary School, including Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10.\n\nThe term \"lycée\" (or lycee) on the other hand refers to the three subsequent grades of Secondary Level, including Grades 11, 12 and 13. There are three kinds of lycées in the country: Agricultural, Technical and General Lycées.\n\nThe Agricultural Lycée welcomes students interested in agriculture. At Technical Lycée, students are provided with skills on technological field, including mechanics, engineering and architecture, among others. All other students go to the General Lycée.\n\nBoth Agricultural and Technical Lycées welcome students through a special test, whereas the general lycée is open to all who succeed at the GCSE examination, which occurs at the end of Grade 10.\n\nUpon entering General Lycée, students are asked to choose in Grade 10 which division they want to enter in. In fact, General Lycée consists of two sections with three grades each. Those interested in sciences go to the S division, whereas others go to LE division.\n\nStudents in Grade 11LE interested in economics, go to Subdivision B (for Business), while those interested in languages go to Subdivision A2. Those interested in human sciences enter sub-division A3. Other students go to subdivision A1.\n\nMeanwhile, those in Grade 11S which are interested in biological and/or earth sciences, go to Subdivision D, others interested in physics and mathematics go to Subdivision C.\n\nAt Grade 13, every student is required to do the Senior School Higher Certificate Examination, no matter which lycée they are studying in.\n\nThe literacy rate in the Republic of the Congo is 82.8 percent. This is defined as people over the age of 15 that possess the skills to read and write.\n\nMost Congolese attend Marien Ngouabi University, once they have their Higher Certificate, although it is not the only option.\n\n\nFuture physicians and medicine-related officers learn at the faculty of medicine of Marien Ngouabi University. To enter that faculty, they are required to pass a test, in addition to passing the Higher Certificate Exam. Most attendees of the faculty have a C or D Higher Certificate.\n\nEducation on Medicine takes seven years, during which there is no intermediate degree. It consists of three levels; in the first three years, students are taught on general aspects, including anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology etc. The next level deals with theoretical medicine and pharmacy. The last level is on training in hospitals.\n\n"}

{"id": "18031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18031", "title": "Leon Battista Alberti", "text": "Leon Battista Alberti\n\nLeon Battista Alberti (; February 14, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer; he epitomised the Renaissance Man. Although he is often characterized exclusively as an architect, as James Beck has observed, \"to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts.\" Although Alberti is known mostly for being an artist, he was also a mathematician of many sorts and made great advances to this field during the 15th century. Alberti's life was described in Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa. His mother is not known, and his father was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied Law at Bologna. He lived for a time in Florence, then travelled to Rome in 1431 where he took holy orders and entered the service of the papal court. During this time he studied the ancient ruins, which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.\n\nAlberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a man's head. He distinguished himself as a writer while he was still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play which was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature. In 1435, he began his first major written work, \"Della pittura,\" which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early 15th century. In this work he analyses the nature of painting and explores the elements of perspective, composition and colour.\n\nIn 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara, for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father. In 1447 he became the architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved with several projects at the Vatican.\n\nHis first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel, the Tempio Malatestiano. In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the facade for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years. In 1452, he completed \"De re aedificatoria\", a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of Vitruvius and influenced by the archaeological remains of Rome. The work was not published until 1485. It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, \"De statua\", in which he examines sculpture. Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to Pisanello.\n\nAlberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua, San Sebastiano, which was never completed, and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated, and the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death, but was brought to completion and is his most significant work.\n\nAs an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman, educated in workshops. He was a humanist, and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time. Alberti, as a member of noble family and as part of the Roman curia, had special status. He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara, and in Urbino he spent part of the hot-weather season with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro. The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander, who generously spent money on the patronage of art. Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to his friend.\n\nAmong Alberti's smaller studies, pioneering in their field, were a treatise in cryptography, \"De componendis cifris\", and the first Italian grammar. With the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli he collaborated in astronomy, a close science to geography at that time, and produced a small Latin work on geography, \"Descriptio urbis Romae\" (\"The Panorama of the City of Rome\"). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed \"De iciarchia\" (\"On Ruling the Household\"), a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule.\n\nAlberti, having taken holy orders, remained unmarried all his life. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, for whom he wrote a panegyric, (\"Canis\"). Vasari describes him as \"an admirable citizen, a man of culture... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.\" Alberti died in Rome on April 25, 1472 at the age of 68.\n\nAlberti regarded mathematics as the common ground of art and the sciences. \"To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting,\" Alberti began his treatise, \"Della Pittura\" (On Painting), \"I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.\"\n\n\"Della pittura\" (also known in Latin as \"De Pictura\") relied in its scientific content on classical optics in determining perspective as a geometric instrument of artistic and architectural representation. Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of optics was connected to the handed-down long-standing tradition of the \"Kitab al-manazir\" (\"The Optics\"; \"De aspectibus\") of the Arab polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, d. c. 1041), which was mediated by Franciscan optical workshops of the 13th-century \"Perspectivae\" traditions of scholars such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Witelo (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of Lorenzo Ghiberti, \"Commentario terzo\").\n\nIn both \"Della pittura\" and \"De statua\", Alberti stressed that \"all steps of learning should be sought from nature.\" The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive \"through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature.\" However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, \"for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary.\" The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti \"the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,\" and subsequently \"this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony.\" Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.\n\nIn Rome, Alberti had plenty of time to study its ancient sites, ruins, and objects. His detailed observations, included in his \"De Re Aedificatoria\" (1452, \"On the Art of Building\"), were patterned after the \"De architectura\" by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (fl. 46–30 BC). The work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, and engineering to the philosophy of beauty. \"De re aedificatoria,\" a large and expensive book, was not fully published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects. However, the book was written \"not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts,\" as Alberti put it. Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by Cosimo Bartoli was published in 1550. Pope Nicholas V, to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars and others.\n\nAlberti wrote \"I Libri della famiglia\"—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like Erasmus decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that \"the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother,\" and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet. With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that \"he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it.\" \"Momus\", written between 1443 and 1450, was a misogynist comedy about the Olympian gods. It has been considered as a roman à clef—Jupiter has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from Lucian, one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, Momus, the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other gods come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.\n\nAlberti did not concern himself with the practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion. As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very well aware of the cityscape. This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement.\n\nIn Rome he was employed by Pope Nicholas V for the restoration of the Roman aqueduct of Acqua Vergine, which debouched into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was swept away later by the Baroque Trevi Fountain.\n\nSome studies propose that the Villa Medici in Fiesole might owe its design to Alberti, not to Michelozzo, and that it then became the prototype of the Renaissance villa. This hilltop dwelling, commissioned by Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo il Vecchio's second son, with its view over the city, may be the very first example of a Renaissance villa: that is to say it follows the Albertian criteria for rendering a country dwelling a \"villa suburbana\". Under this perspective the Villa Medici in Fiesole could therefore be considered the \"muse\" for numerous other buildings, not only in the Florence area, which from the end of the 15th century onwards find inspiration and creative innovation here.\n\nThe Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (1447, 1453–60) is the rebuilding of a Gothic church. The facade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.\n\nThe design of the façade of the Palazzo Rucellai (1446–51) was one of several commissions for the Rucellai family. The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in the Classical manner onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has Corinthian columns. The palace set a standard in the use of Classical elements that is original in civic buildings in Florence, and greatly influenced later palazzi. The work was executed by Bernardo Rosselino.\n\nAt Santa Maria Novella, Florence, between (1448–70) the upper facade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six Gothic niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches such as San Miniato al Monte and the Baptistery of Florence. The design also incorporates an ocular window which was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire facade in a manner which includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of Church facades in the later Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Revival buildings.\n\nAlberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, Pienza. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459. It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius II, in whose employ Alberti served. Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.\n\nThe piazza is a trapezoid shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, \"Palazzo Piccolomini\", is on the west side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by loggia on all three floors that overlook an enclosed Italian Renaissance garden with \"Giardino all'italiana\" era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the Val d'Orcia and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond. Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for 100 horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.\n\nThe Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua was begun in 1471, the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the triumphal arch motif, both for its facade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow. Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike Brunelleschi, he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.\n\n\nGiorgio Vasari, who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in Michelangelo, emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: \"He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.\" Leonardo, who ironically called himself \"an uneducated person\" (\"omo senza lettere\"), followed Alberti in the view that painting is science. However, as a scientist Leonardo was more empirical than Alberti, who was a theorist and did not have similar interest in practice. Alberti believed in ideal beauty, but Leonardo filled his notebooks with observations on human proportions, page after page, ending with his famous drawing of the Vitruvian man, a human figure related to a square and a circle.\n\nIn \"On Painting\", Alberti uses the expression \"We Painters\", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. \"In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty,\" wrote Vasari. \"The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.\" Jacob Burckhardt portrayed Alberti in \"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy\" as a truly universal genius. \"And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.\"\n\nAlberti is said to be in Mantegna's great frescoes in the Camera degli Sposi, the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of Ludovico Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua. In Alberti's self-portrait, a large plaquette, he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, \"Quid tum?\" (what then), taken from Virgil's \"Eclogues\": \"So what, if Amyntas is dark? (\"quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?\") Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.\"\n\nAlberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:\n\n\n\n\n"}

A notable compendium of essays titled \"The Madonna Connection\" was published in 1992. Controversy over this field of study stemmed from discussions over the intellectual worth of pursuing academic inquiry into a pop musician, with some arguing the field was nothing more than pop cultural commentary.\n\nMadonna first came to prominence in the mid 1980s, and the discipline did not take long to start up. Robert Miklitsch dates the start of Madonna studies to 1987 and \"Rocking Around The Clock: Music Television, Postmodernism & Consumer Culture\" by E. Ann Kaplan.\n\nBy the early 1990s it was the topic of wider media interest, and commentators were already attacking the growing field. In 1992, \"Vanity Fair\" reported that \"academics are doing a brisk trade in Madonna-ology\". A collection of scholarly articles, \"The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory\" edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg, was published in late 1992. The justification the creation of studies and bibliography focused on Madonna and validity that they have is a subject of debate among scholars and academics. These studies analyzed several topics, but mostly Madonna Studies involved in the study of gender, sexuality, and the mass media. One of her advocates is Annalee Newitz saying that to \"the university communities Madonna occupies a definite place in the curriculum of post-Western cultures in universities worldwide\". Professor and media scholar John Fiske explained that all cultural studies focus primarily on finding a hidden meaning within a social aspect —for example, a Madonna video— so it takes a more comprehensive analysis to provide an appropriate context —in this case, on the work of singer—. Similarly, the American psychologist Susan Fiske, noted that \"cultural studies about Madonna only analyze texts and how your audience uses the material to relate to the social construction that is Madonna. French academic Georges Claude Guilbert, who has written three books about Madonna, said in one of them \"is a bit excessive admiration imply that scholars have for Madonna is the result of a common hostility to censorship\". Given her constant social provocations, often with political overtones, the novelist Andrew O'Hagan said that \"Madonna is like a heroic opponent of cultural and political authoritarianism of the American \"establishment\".\n\nSince her debut, are has written several thesis, essays and scientific trials encuadrable in various branches of the social sciences. It was probably in the 1990s when this phenomenon was most critical and began to divide opinions at the used widely the term \"Madonna Studies\". According to author Robert Miklitsch of the State University of New York Press, this term is a \"political-cultural\" phenomenon.\n\nIn 1991, the firm \"Knight Ridder\" published an article on the subject titled \"Madonna even controversial for scholars\", citing comments from several teachers and other personalities. Meanwhile, Barbara Stewart from \"Orlando Sentinel\", said there was a \"growing number of \"Madonna Studies\" in the United States, [where authors] wrote their works for academic journals and conventions\". She added that overseas for many \"was a laugh hear of Madonna Studies\". She continued that \"neither this study theme sit well with some students of higher education\". Beyond all this, organizations like the set of liberal arts colleges 7 sisters teach courses that examine the influence of Madonna in culture. In this regard, the French scholar Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in the book \"Madonna as Postmodern Myth\" (2002), Princeton, Harvard, UCLA, the University of Colorado and Rutgers were the first to propose courses \"about\" Madonna. He added that even at the University of Amsterdam was created the elective academic discipline, \"Madonna: The Music and the Phenomenon\", within the Department of Musicology.\n\nThere is debate about whether Madonna should have a place in curriculums alongside more established and canonical subjects. Roger Kimball described it as \"a waste of time and money\", while others have defended the importance of studying modern culture. Others like Camille Paglia take a middle ground, saying \"We do not need a whole course in Madonna, but within a big course like mine, it is absolutely legitimate to show how images of the present inherit the meanings of the past.\" It has also been criticised for adding nothing to students' employment prospects.\n\n"}

{"id": "56040019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56040019", "title": "Mutual monogamy", "text": "Mutual monogamy\n\nMutual monogamy is a form of monogamy that exists when two partners agree to be sexually active with only one another. Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship reduces the risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STIs. Those who choose mutual monogamy can be tested before the sexual relationship to be certain they are not infected. This strategy for the prevention of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection requires that each partner remain faithful and does not engage in sexual activity with another partner.\n\nMutual monogamy differs from serial monogamy which is a current monogamous relationship that has not been established in the past and may not continue into the future. Serial monogamy may not result in the reduced risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection because the past sexual exposures to infection are brought into the new relationship, even though it may be exclusive of other sexual partners. The risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection while in a serial monogamous relationship is the same as the risk of those who have concurrent partners. Those with a greater ability to communicate about their commitment are likely to sustain the relationship.\nWhen individuals are mutually monogamous, and are free from STIs/HIV when they enter the relationship, the risk for being infected with STI/HIV acquisition from sexual intercourse is very low. A mutually monogomous relationship lowers the risk of HIV, cervicitis, and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nA mutual monogomous sexual relationship often includes a pledge to stay with the partner and includes the desire for the relationship to last, a psychological attachment and the lack of being able to find another partner. If these conditions remain a priority for both, the \"couple is likely committed and mutually monogamous.\"\n\nBeing in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test lowers the chance of acquiring gonorrhea. It is also effective for lowering the risk of syphilis, chlamydia and pubic lice.\n\nThe lack of a more precise definition of mutual monogamy in the literature confounds the ability to statistically assess its effectiveness. \n"}

Founded in 1985, NASIG is registered in the state of New York as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\n\nThe North American Serials Interest Group was founded in 1985 after a group of sixteen American librarians attended the 1984 UKSG (United Kingdom Serials Group) conference. One of those librarians, John Riddick from Central Michigan University, took the initiative to form a study group to investigate the feasibility of a North American counterpart. Riddick recruited Becky Lenzini from Faxon to work with him to market the concept of NASIG. They conducted a survey of interest and, in July 1985 held a well-attended and enthusiastic general information at the American Library Association conference in Chicago. Following this meeting, a site selection committee chose Bryn Mawr College to be the site of NASIG’s inaugural conference. An ad-hoc Executive Council was formed in late 1985 to provide temporary structure until the passage of bylaws and elections held.\n\nIn January 1986, the group published its first issue of the \"NASIG Newsletter\". The first elections were held in November 1986 and the bylaws were approved that same month.\n\nNASIG was incorporated in January 1988 in the State of New York as a non-profit organization under the name North American Serials Interest Group. Over time, the scope of NASIG expanded beyond serials to include all forms of electronic materials as continuing resources, and more recently, scholarly communications, including libraries as publishers and management of institutional repositories. In 2015, the membership elected to change the name to NASIG, and the legal name change in New York went through the same year.\n\nIn 2014, after the death of Birdie MacLennan, NASIG became the new home for the SERIALST listserv. MacLennan worked at the University of Vermont, which had hosted the listserv for over twenty years. After MacLennan passed, the remaining moderators sought a new home for the list—preferably one that was not tied to an individual’s employment—and with its historical focus on serials, NASIG was a good fit.\n\nNASIG’s physical archives have been hosted at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign since 2003.\n\nThe North American Serials Interest Group held its first annual conference in June 1986 at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. The NASIG conference has been held every year since in various locations in the US and Canada. Conferences are usually held in May or June, and have evolved from a focus on print serials to electronic journals to e-resources in general, more recently moving into scholarly communications. Originally, conferences were held on college campuses, with attendees staying in dormitories. The 2003 conference at Portland State University was the first conference with attendees staying in hotels, and all conference sessions were held on campus. In 2004, NASIG transitioned to housing the full conference in a hotel setting.\n\nNASIG’s annual conference proceedings are published in the \"Serials Librarian\" (ISSN 0361-526X) as a double issue each year, with the conference presentation files available on SlideShare. In addition to the proceedings, NASIG publishes \"NASIG Newsletter\" (ISSN 1542-3417) on a quarterly basis. NASIG produces a variety of online material, including one blog with job announcements, another with news and announcements, and \"NASIGuides\", short summaries of best practices and industry topics written by NASIG members.\n\nNASIG works independently and in partnership with other organizations to provide professional development to members, students, and other professionals in the publishing industry and library community.\n\nFour times per year, and sometimes in conjunction with National Information Standards Organization (NISO), NASIG hosts webinars on a variety of information resource management topics such as vendor negotiations, integrated library systems, FRBR, linked data, and the serials crisis.\n\nNASIG created a task force—now called the Student Outreach Committee—to work with library and information science programs accredited by the American Library Association. Serials is often not a topic of focus in many such programs, so NASIG created this sub-group to recruit and encourage future serials librarians. NASIG continues to supplement traditional librarian education with cutting-edge topics through its conference and webinars, in the areas of scholarly communication, serials, and electronic resources.\n\nNASIG annually confers numerous awards for professionals, paraprofessionals, and students within North America in order to assist with funding for attendance to the NASIG Annual Conference. In addition to the annual conference and webinars, NASIG also sponsors local conferences that relate to its mission.\n\nAs the primary professional organization for serials and electronic resource librarians, NASIG has developed and published the Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians that provides a basis both for creating job descriptions in serials and electronic resources and for creating library school curricula. They can also be used to define qualities needed by staff working with electronic resources, as a guide to train new and existing staff (in the case of a library-wide re-organization, for example), and to educate all library staff about the specialized skills needed to work with electronic resources. The core competencies were created in part by analyzing job advertisements for professional librarian positions and are based on the occurrence of specific descriptors in the responsibilities and qualifications sections of these job advertisements. \n\nThe core competencies focus and expand upon seven core elements: Life Cycle of E-Resources, Technology, Research and Assessment, Effective Communication, Supervising and Management, Trends and Professional Development, and Personal Qualities\n\nNASIG has also published Core Competencies for Print Serials Management, which came out of discussions about competencies for electronic resources and serials.\n\n\n"}

It assisted teachers in their professional career, provided a public voice for its members on subjects such as pay and tenure, and promoted improvements to the public school system in the state. In 1973 it joined with the United Teachers of New York to form the New York State United Teachers.\n\nThe New York State Teachers Association was organized at a teacher's convention on 30 July 1845 in Syracuse, New York.\nAfter the convention had resolved itself into a State Teachers' Association a committee was set up to recommend officers, which decided on Chester Dewey (1784–1869) of Rochester as President.\nThe association was incorporated by a legislative act in 1852.\nIt included most of the teachers in upstate New York and Long Island.\nThis was a period when free schools were being established throughout the state, and normal schools were being established to train teachers.\nThe objectives of the association were to support professional improvement of the member teachers and to promote a series of improvements to the public schools in the state.\n\nSamuel Buell Woolworth, principal of the Cortland Academy in Homer, New York, was NYSTA president in 1948–49.\nHe was a strong supporter of coeducation.\nAt first women did not have the right to speak at NYSTA meetings, and women teachers were paid much less than men.\nThanks to efforts of teachers such as Susan B. Anthony in the 1850s they were eventually admitted as full members.\nElizabeth Cady Stanton drafted Anthony's speech on coeducation for the June 1856 NYSTA meeting.\n\nIn the late 19th century both state officials and the NYSTA were increasingly concerned about the tendency of local school districts to give teaching certificates to unqualified candidates. In 1887 the NYSTA members lobbied for a bill requiring a standard examination for all teachers in the state. The governor vetoed the bill, but most districts agreed voluntarily to the examination. New York City was among those who did not.\nMary Evelyn Hall (1874–1956) became the first president of the NYSTA Library Section in 1910–11, and promoted school libraries in the state. \nShe became president of the NEA Library Department Committee on High School Libraries in 1911.\n\nFor most of its history the NYSTA was the New York affiliate of the National Education Association (NEA).\nTeachers could enhance their professional careers through membership in NYSTA, and often remained involved after retirement.\nFrom 1913 the NYSTA House of Delegates represented the interests of active teachers.\nThe New York State Teachers’ Retirement System was established in 1921.\nFrom September 1936 the association started to mail out mimeographed circulars to teachers on subjects such as \"Tax Reduction versus Tax Limitation,\" \"Why Tenure for Public School Teachers?\" \"Academic Freedom-Study Outline,\" \"Credit for School Teachers,\" \"Insurance for School Teachers,\" and \"Federal Aid.\"\nIn 1937 the NYSTA and the School Boards Association founded the New York State Educational Conference Board, which included most of the larger associations of teachers, administrators and parents. The Conference Board developed and promoted proposals to the New York State legislature for increased state funding of schools.\n\nIn 1938 it was proposed to add a statement to the section on freedom of speech in the New York Constitution that would explicitly prevent censorship of radio, cinema and other media, although abuse of the right could be prosecuted. The NYSTA and other educational organizations such as the State Education Department and Associated Principals wrote to the Bill of Rights Committee on the subject, but neither supported or opposed the amendment, which was dropped.\n\nBy 1946 the NYSTA had a permanent staff, and owned and partly occupied a modern office building.\nThe annual meetings drew many attendees. Achievements of the association included obtaining sufficient state funding for teacher training and public education, having teachers licensed by trained officials, job security through teachers' tenure of position, minimum salaries and rural school consolidation.\nOn 18 November 1951 the first officers were elected to the New York State Retired Teachers’ Association (NYSRTA), which represented the interest of retired teachers.\n\nIn 1973 the NYSTA merged with the United Teachers of New York (UTNY).\nAt the time of the merger the NYSTA had 101,000 members, while the UTNY had 85,000.\nThe NEA-affiliated NYSTA was strong in the upstate, suburban and rural areas, while the UTNY represented teachers downstate and in core of New York City.\nThe UTNY was an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).\nAlbert Shanker, president of the UTNY, was hoping to merge the national NEA and AFT unions. He said, \"If we could merge in New York State, we could start a wave that would flow throughout the country and mergers would occur in other states, like Michigan and Illinois and California.\"\n\nThe merger was approved by an overwhelming majority of UTNY members and a solid majority of NYSTA teachers.\nOne of the key issues had been whether the new union should be associated with the AFL–CIO, which the NEA opposed.\nThe merger agreement announced in April 1972 included AFL–CIO membership.\nThomas Y. Hobart Jr., who had been elected president of NYSTA in 1971, became the president of combined union.\nShanker was elected executive vice-president, but was generally thought to be the more powerful of the two.\nThe merged organization was at first called the New York Congress of Teachers, and later changed its name to the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT).\n\n\n"}

In some academic institutions the term is used for a presentation by a teaching assistant or instructor, under the guidance of a senior faculty member, that supplements course materials. In recitations that supplement lectures, the leader will often review the lecture, expand on the concepts, and carry on a discussion with the students.\n\nIn its most basic form, a student would recite verbatim poems or essays of others, either to the teacher or tutor directly, or in front of a class or body of assembled students.\n\nIn classes involving mathematics and engineering, a recitation is often used as the vehicle to perform derivations or solve problems similar to those assigned to the students.\n\nScientific classes, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, often employ the use of recitation sections to help students clarify subject matter that was either not fully understood or inadequately addressed in the limited time of lecture. These recitation sections may be conducted by the professor or a student teaching assistant. These sections provide students with an opportunity to receive additional instruction on confusing subject matter or receive personal assistance with problems or questions assigned as homework in the lecture section. Some universities may require attendance at regularly scheduled recitation sections in addition to any required labs. Recitations may also provide students with additional opportunities for receiving grades for the lecture portion of the course. Despite mandatory attendance and additional time spent in the classroom, these sections usually do not count towards university credits required for graduation, but may significantly increase a student's ability to understand important concepts required to pass the course.\n\nRecitations of holy texts are part of the cultural presentations of some religions. As Denny notes, \"There is a vast bibliography of Qur'an recitation in Arabic and other languages by Muslim scholars.\" These religion recitations take the form of prayer, liturgy, and public performance.\n\nRecitation is practiced as a performing art especially in Bangladesh and India. Nowadays it is a popular art form in Bengal. The reciters recite Bengali poems on stage and electronic media. Shambhu Mitra, Kazi Sabyasachi, Pradeep Ghosh, Partha Ghhosh, Gauri Ghosh, Utpal Kundu are great reciters from West Bengal. Reciters like Samiran Sanyal, Bratati Bandyopadhyay, Bijoylakshmi Burman, Pinaki Chattopadhyay to name a few, are contributing significantly in this field. There are many such organizations of recitation, with most located in Bangladesh.\n\nIt was often popular for a poet to recite his or her newly-created poetry to an audience. In the early twentieth century, recitation developed into an autonomous art form.\n\n"}

It can take the form of a classroom-based training through experiential learning activities such as case study analysis, role plays, games, simulations, and brainstorming, among others. These activities require the learners to work together to achieve a learning goal. The group work has to be carefully planned and frequently requires a facilitator to ensure group progress. In addition, the group function and the learning that takes place needs to be assessed and evaluated. The material learned is just as important as the group's ability to achieve a common goal. Facilitatory skills are important and require the teacher to ensure that both the task is achieved and the group functioning is maintained.\n\nSmall group learning allows students to develop problem-solving, interpersonal, presentational and communication skills, all beneficial to life outside the classroom. These generic skills are difficult to develop in isolation and require feedback and interaction with other individuals. Specific advantages of this learning model for the group of learners include the opportunity to compare learning performance with peers and the development of a sense of responsibility for their learning progress. The small group learning is also used for adult learning because it is associated with active involvement, collaboration, and problem-solving. \n\nAlthough this practice is not the best way for students to develop and improve on these skills there are some ways to make this effective for both the student and the instructor. According to Francine Armenth-Brothers in her Article, \"How to Make Small-Group Learning Work,\" some things to keep in mind when implementing this practice are, do not start without directions, which would help alleviate confusion in a group. Also, the instructor should choose the members in a group and when doing so keep learning levels and student diversity in mind.\n\nSome experts have criticized small group learning, especially that which consists of extremely small groups, for reducing learn-responsibility and thereby reducing the motivation learn. When learning in a group, individuals can lose sight of their learning objectives and prioritize those they have in common in others. In addition, they may be subject to the free-rider effect in groups that have a few highly skilled members.\n\nSmall group communication\n"}

Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers plays a huge role in the development of Uzbekistan economy and industry. Every year, talented students graduate from this university.\n\nThe history of the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers dates back to the Soviet Union. The university was first established in 1923 as the department of Turkistan State University. It was created under the technical faculty and was called Hydro Technical Engineering. In its first year of establishment, 24 agronomists and 16 water conservation specialists graduated from the faculty. The history of this university could be recognized by the second occasion. After six years of opening the Hydro Technical Engineering department, government decided to establish a new department under the Melioration Engineering Faculty. Those two departments were linked together in 1929, which led to the establishment of Central Asian Cotton Irrigation Polytechnic University. On 11 November 1934, Central Asian Cotton Irrigation Polytechnic University was merged with the Central Asian Institute of Agricultural Industry Irrigation and Mechanization, which was the reason for the creation of Tashkent Institute of Agricultural Industry Irrigation and Mechanization. In the first years of establishment there were only two faculties, Hydro Melioration and Mechanization. After World War II, the agricultural industry of the country increased rapidly, which affected the need for professional employees.\n\nAfter World War II, a number of faculties were created: Building (1945), Mechanization of Hydro Melioration (1946), and Hydro Energetics (1946). In 1974 a new faculty was named Technology of Repairing Agricultural Industry Machines and Creating Them. In 1979 a number of engineering faculties were opened, which was directly linked to the economic growth in Uzbekistan.\n\nAfter the independence of Uzbekistan, all the textbooks were interpreted into Uzbek language, and most of the classes started to be taught in the native language of Uzbekistan. In 2004, on 30 March by the edict of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, the institute obtained its current name. This meant that Tashkent Institute of Agricultural Industry Irrigation and Mechanization was renamed to Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. In 2017 institute took a name Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers. Nowadays the institute involves five faculties with 30 departments. It has 353 professors and teachers and more than 4860 students.\n\nTashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers consists of four main buildings, three laboratory buildings, scientific centers, an information recourse center which has 700 thousand materials in its fund, three dormitories with an overall capacity for 1200 students, a canteen which can serve 484 people at one time and the park.\n\nhttps://tiiame.uz/ru/page/Rektor== Rector ==\nThe rector of Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers is Umurzakov Uktam Pardaevich, a doctor of economical sciences and professor.\n\nTashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers has set its duties and provided them in the rules of the institute. The six main duties are:\n\nTashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers currently consists of five faculties, which are divided into 30 departments. The five faculties are as follows:\n\nUntil the 1970s there were no economists on the water industry in Uzbekistan. This caused some serious problems in water consumption and utilization. In 1974, in order to solve this problem, a new branch was opened under the faculty of Hydro Technical Constructions\", called the Economy of Water Industry and its Analysis. In 1976, this branch was set as the independent faculty and started working as the one of the biggest parts of the institute. From the first years about 50 students were invited to the university and in 1979 the first 50 students graduated from this faculty. After the independence of Uzbekistan, from 2015 the faculty was renamed to its current name: Water Industry Management. Nowadays, the dean of the faculty is docent Ibragimov Abdimalik Gapparovich. In the campus of the faculty there are two language classes, four computer classes, and more than 20 study classes, which are supplied with the modern education materials and information technologies.\n\nSeven departments which are located in the Water Industry Management faculty:\n\nThe history of the Hydro Melioration faculty can be separated into two parts: the Soviet Union times and the period after the independence of Uzbekistan. The past of the faculty is directly linked with the history of the university, which means that the faculty was created in 1923 and was the first faculty in the history of the university. In the first year only eight students graduated from the faculty, and then there were 274 students and 49 professors. On 16 November 1934, the number of students increased rapidly to 705. The establishment of the faculty led to economic growth in Central Asia. After independence, the faculty was mixed with two different departments. Nowadays it has three main bachelor's degree branches:\n\nThe departments located in the faculty are:\n\nThe current dean of the Hydromelioration faculty is docent Alisher Fatxulloev. The faculty's past deans are:\n\nAutomating and mechanizing the water industry faculty was established after the World War, when there were high demands for workers in the agricultural industry. The faculty was created after mixing the two faculties of Mechanization of Hydro Melioration Works 1946 and Automating the Agricultural Industry 1962. It happened because of the 415th edict which was made by the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, on 3 September 2004. \n\nThere are eight departments in Automating and Mechanizing the Water Industry faculty:\n\nNowadays the dean of the Building of Irrigation Hydro Technical Construction and Usage faculty\" is docent B.B. Xasanov. The history of the establishment goes back to 1946, when the first woman irrigator T.A. Kolpakova opened the Building of Small and Medium Hydroelectric-Stations faculty. After some years the faculty was called as the Hydro Technical Building. However, big changes to the faculty came in the independence years of Uzbekistan. In 1991 the faculty was considered to be as the department due to the changes in infrastructure. During those years, the faculty worked as part of the Center for Preparing the Irrigation Engineers\" and from 1996 it became part of the Hydro Melioration faculty\" and prepared professionals in the water industry building\" field. After the edict made by the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, the small department became the fully functioning faculty with the name Building of Irrigation Hydro Technical Constructions and Utilization. The faculty obtained its current name by the 311 edict which was made on 3 November, 2015, by the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan. The four departments involved inside the faculty are: Hydro Technical Buildings and Constructions, Utilization of Water Energy and Stations, Theoretical and Building Mechanics, and Drawn Geometry and Graphics.\n\nThe Utilization of Land and Land Cadaster was first established in 1945 under the name of Land Making. The faculty attained its current name in 2004. Nowadays, the dean of this faculty is Mukimov Zarip Majlisovich. There are now 670 students involved with studies in this faculty. During its working period, the Utilization of Land and Land Cadaster faculty became one of the biggest educational places in Central Asia. Some students came from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kirgizia, and Tajikistan. There are three bachelor's degree branches and two master's degree branches in the Utilization of Land and Land Cadaster faculty.\nBachelor's degree branches:\n\nMaster's degree branches:\n\nThere are three departments located in this faculty:\n\nStudents' town was first established in 1987 under the Tashkent Irrigation and Mechanization of Agricultural industry Engineers Institute. From 2004 it is considered to be the students' town of the Tashkent Irrigation and Melioration Institute. Students' town consists of three students' dormitories numbered as 2, 3, and 4, and with buildings numbered 6 and 7 for the university staff. The director of the students' town is Bozorov Baxtiyor Xakimovich.\n\nEach dormitory in students' town holds students from various faculties. Dormitory number 2 holds 232 students from Automating and Mechanizing the Water Industry faculty and 44 students from Building of Irrigation Hydro Technical Construction and Usage faculty. Overall, dormitory 2 holds 276 students.\n\nDormitory 3 holds about 410 students from different faculties. There are four female students currently living in dormitory 3 who are from China.\n\nDormitory 4 holds 385 students from different faculties., including seven international students.\n\nBuildings 6 and 7 mainly serve university staff representatives and young scientists. There are 162 rooms in those buildings and 607 people living there.\n\nEach building is provided with solutions for the essential needs of every individual. There are sport halls, kitchens, reading halls, and rest rooms in each level of the buildings. They all are fully provided with gas and electric energy. In addition, there is a small library in the student's town, and it works by its working graphic daily. This means that even though students are may be away from the university, they can deal with their studies in that library. The library provides the students with most of the textbooks. The kitchen rooms of the dormitories are provided with tables, chairs, and ovens. Students can cook there. Each room in the buildings of students' town is fully functional and supplied with an emergency exit. This means that fire emergency problems are covered fully.\n\nThere are two academic lyceums which are opened under the name of Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. They are Yunusabad Academic Lyceum and International House – Tashkent Lyceum. They were opened to cover high demands for qualified high-school graduates. The representative from the university who works with the lyceums is Makumova Dilrabo Innatovna\n\nYunusabad Academic Lyceum was first established under the Tashkent Irrigation and Mechanization of Agricultural Industry Engineers Institute in 1987, with another name of Universal Technical Lyceum\". However, after the independence of Uzbekistan by the edict of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan on 23 September 1998, the name of the lyceum must have been changed. This edict was done only after the year, on 2 September 1999, and was renamed and re-established by the edict number 406 to Yunusabad Academic Lyceum. There are three faculties in this academic lyceum: Exact Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social-Humanitarian Subjects.\n\nExact Sciences faculty:\n\nNatural Sciences faculty:\n\nSocial-Humanitarian Subjects faculty:\n\nOnly the prospective students who have successfully completed the nine year secondary program can apply to the university. Then they can be examined by the lyceum administration. Students from the other regions are provided with the dormitories.\n\nThere are five departments in Yunusabad Academic Lyceum:\n\nInternational House in Tashkent is one of the two lyceums which were established under the name of Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers. However, the lyceum first was opened as the education center in 1993, in order to inherit educational processes and techniques from the developed countries of the United Kingdom and the US. The lyceum was located in the center of the Tashkent city, and it is easy to find its location, by the metro station Hamid Olimjon. In 2007 by the edict of Islam Karimov, the simple education center was fully set to be the academic lyceum, and was given under the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. In 2009, for making the academic lyceum fully standard with the world's requirements, reconstruction works were established. The education in the lyceum is based on the Uzbekistan's educational standards, and held in two different faculties, Exact Sciences and Social-Humanitarian Sciences.\n\nIn 2011 International House academic lyceum published their own magazine catalog, which tells all about the lyceum. The magazine was named \"We are Inter House!\" The materials for the magazine were collected from the year of 2009. Nowadays about 300 students are studying at the International House lyceum and there are two professors, four docents and a number of highly qualified teachers.\n\nTashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers is located in the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent city, Kari Niyozov street, 39-house.\n\n\n"}

Although the term is often translated into English as \"polytechnic\", the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and the Rectors' Conference of Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences use the term \"university of applied sciences\". \n\nUnlike universities, AMKs focus on R&D by applying previous knowledge, rather than producing new research. They have a very clearly legislated objective in regional development. As there is mandatory five-month practical training for all students, AMKs may be a good platform for dispersing applied knowledge throughout higher education. AMKs provide professionals for locally important purposes and are governed by the city, although they receive most of the funding from the state. No tuition fees are asked from the students.\n\nBefore the AMK reform in 1993, the schools were usually called \"opisto\" and were considered vocational institutes, and were not considered universities. Their role was to give training for roles that need both practical skills and management work, such as a foreman in construction. In engineering, the degree was referred to as \"opistoinsinööri\" or \"teknikko\". In construction, there was \"rakennusinsinööri\", \"rakennusarkkitehti\" and \"rakennusmestari\".\n\nUntil recently, AMKs were granting only tertiary degrees (3–4 years) that are specialized to particular vocations (e.g. \"insinööri\", translated into English as Bachelor of Engineering); they are different from, but in their level comparable to, academic bachelor's degrees which are awarded by universities. In 2005, \"higher AMK\" degrees (which are translated into English as master's degrees) have been introduced for holders of an AMK degree or a similar degree, like a bachelor's degree from a university, to continue studies while also working. AMK's do not grant the higher degrees of licentiate and Ph.D. granted by universities, and a holder of an AMK higher degree is not eligible for doctoral studies in universities without specific studies bridging the gap between the two orientations (academic and vocational).\n\nFinnish higher education has a dual model, where universities (yliopisto) focus on scientific or artistic master's and higher degrees, and AMKs on vocationally oriented education on bachelor and master levels. The phrase \"equal but different\" was used in conjunction with the dual model, meaning that Finnish AMKs and universities serve different goals in the field of higher education and should not be combined on any level. The ongoing Bologna process, however, has led to some reform, where by complementing AMK studies with some theoretical studies, the route to higher degrees is open. Changes are described in detail in Education in Finland.\n\nThere are about 100,000 students in AMKs. The most common field of education is engineering, in which the schools offer high-level majors starting from a broad base of mathematics and physics related to the field of study. Engineers graduate after a minimum of four years and 240 ECTS credits are awarded. The degree of insinööri (amk) or ingenjör (YH) (for Swedish-speaking population) is often compared to the non-Finnish 'Bachelor of Engineering'.\n\nOther typical fields of study in an \"ammattikorkeakoulu\" are health care (nursing), business, and culture.\n\nThe term \"university of applied sciences\" was universally applied on January 1, 2006 to all Finnish \"ammattikorkeakoulu\"s to give a more correct impression of the level of education given. The term is borrowed from the German \"Fachhochschule\". The decision could be made by the \"ammattikorkeakoulu\"s, because there is no legislation concerning the translations of the terms.\n\nBecause degrees from an AMK are more oriented towards practical applications, compared to the degrees offered by Universities in Finland, a holder of an AMK degree, wishing to get a master's degree from a Finnish university, may have to complete 60 ETCS worth of theoretical and scientific studies in addition to the normal master's degree requirement.\n\nSince 2005, the Finnish Parliament has approved the creation of a higher AMK degree, similar to the master's degree in universities. This has led to a small-scale boost in new degree programmes (in limited fields of education), to the extent of 60-90 ECTS credits. They will give similar qualifications as a university master's degree in the same areas of education. But a minimum amount of 3 years of work experience gained after latest tertiary degree is needed to qualify for AMK higher degree programme.\n\nAt the end of 2010, there were nationwide discussions about the excessive number of students in AMKs, especially in the fields of Engineering and Business. This is connected to a problem in funding — AMKs receive their funding largely based on the students enrollment numbers (this is changing to a more management-by-results approach). This has led to an oversupply of AMK-educated people, compared to the needs of the labour market — the unemployment of AMK graduates is 8%, on par with the general unemployment rate. Some cuts to the amount of student places were issued by the Ministry of Education, starting with a nationwide cut of 10% applied to the new student intake in 2007 and 2008.\n\n"}

The Directory is published as a collaboration of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) and the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER).\n\nFor the database, a \"medical school\" is defined as an \"educational institution that provides a complete or full program of instruction leading to basic medical qualification; that is, a qualification that permits the holder to obtain a license to practice as a medical doctor or physician\". the database has records for 2,800 medical schools that are operational and more than 100 that have ceased to be operational.\n\nIt was created by merging their respective AVICENNA and IMED directories to produce a single comprehensive resource, including the schools in each of the prior directories.\n\nThe decision to merge the AVICENNA and IMED was finalized in March 2012.\nThe directory was officially launched in April 2014. During the transition to the new Directory, IMED and the Avicenna Directory remained open for a year, closing in 2015.\n\nThe major sponsors are the Australian Medical Council, Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, Medical Council of Canada.\n\n"}
{"id": "33432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33432", "title": "Writers of the Future", "text": "Writers of the Future\n\nWriters of the Future (WOTF) is a science fiction and fantasy story contest that was established by L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1980s. A sister contest, Illustrators of the Future, presents awards for science fiction art. Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of \"giving back\" to the field that had defined his professional writing life. The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers. Notable past winners of WOTF include Stephen Baxter, Karen Joy Fowler, James Alan Gardner, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Jay Lake, Michael H. Payne, Patrick Rothfuss, Robert Reed, Dean Wesley Smith, Sean Williams, Dave Wolverton, Nancy Farmer, and David Zindell. \nThe winning stories are published in the yearly anthology \"L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of Future\". The contest enjoys a favorable reputation in the science fiction community, although its connection with the Church of Scientology has caused some controversy.\n\nThe Writers of the Future (WOTF) contest may be entered quarterly, and is open to authors who have no, or few, professional publications. The contest rules state that entrants cannot have had published \"a novel or short novel, or more than one novelette, or more than three short stories, in any medium. Professional publication is deemed to be payment and at least 5,000 copies or 5,000 hits.\" Works that are less than 3,000 words and for which payment was less 6c/word, do not count as \"professional\" publications. Stories of up to 17,000 words in length can be submitted to the contest. Poems, screenplays, non-fiction, etc., are not eligible.\n\nManuscripts are judged with the authors' names deleted and are separated out in quarterfinal and semifinal award rounds by the Coordinating Judge (previously K. D. Wentworth, currently Dave Wolverton, and originally Algis Budrys). Eight finalists are sent to a panel of professional science fiction writers, who determine the top three awards. Prizes are $1000 (first place), $750 (second) and $500 (third). The process is then repeated the next quarter. At the end of the contest year, the four quarterly first place stories compete for a separate annual grand prize, the \"Gold Award,\" which includes an additional $5000. The first, second and third-place winners and often a selection of the other finalist stories are published annually, for which the writers receive additional compensation for publication rights. Thus, a grand prize-winning author can make over $6000 for a single story - more than many writers receive for a first novel. \n\nSome finalist stories not considered among the top three (in effect, the fourth or fifth placers) may be included in the annual anthology. These are called \"published finalists.\" The writers are compensated for publication rights, but are not considered winners and receive no prize money, but are eligible to re-enter the contest. Often writers will repeatedly enter the contest, quarter after quarter, until they either win or become ineligible due to publications elsewhere.\n\nAn artists' contest, the Illustrators of the Future (IOTF), was added in 1988. Like the WOTF contest, the Illustrators contest is open to amateurs. The Rules state: \"The Contest is open to those who have not previously published more than three black-and-white story illustrations, or more than one process-color painting, in media distributed nationally to the general public, such as magazines or books sold at newsstands, or books sold in stores merchandising to the general public. The submitted entry shall not have been previously published in professional media as exampled above.\"\n\nEntrants submit a portfolio of three pieces of artwork, which are circulated among the judges. Up to three winners are selected every quarter, each given a prize of $500. Unlike the Writers, the Illustrators are not ranked. After the completion of the contest year, each of the twelve Illustration winners is assigned one of the stories from among the twelve Writer winners, and given a month to return the finished illustration. A single grand prize, also called the Gold Award, is accompanied by a prize of $5000 - judging is based only on the final illustration, not the initial portfolio. While the art is judged according to standard artistic considerations (composition, draftsmanship, consistency of lighting, sense of wonder, facial expressions, etc.), a key consideration during the final judging is whether or not the art would make the viewer want to read the accompanying story. The art is also included in the annual anthology, and illustrators are additionally compensated.\n\nNo official tallies are given for the number of entrants in either contest, but it is believed that thousands enter the Writers contest every quarter, while only hundreds enter the Illustration contest. Thus, the Illustration judges are sometimes often unable to find three deserving winners, and only pick one or two. (This is not a problem for the Writing judges.) Should the Illustration winners number less than twelve in a year, each illustrator is - as usual - assigned a single story to illustrate for purposes of determining who wins the Gold Award. Returning the assigned illustration quickly does not directly correlate to winning the Gold Award, but those artists who do so are allowed the opportunity to illustrate additional stories. \n\nAll winners and published finalists are invited to attend the annual week-long writers' and artists' workshops and Awards gala at the invitation and expense of the contest administration. Tuxedoes and gowns are worn by the judges, administrators, and winners for the Awards gala (but members of the general public are casually attired), and various Hollywood actors are generally in attendance, in addition to prominent science fiction authors and artists. These include the present judges in addition to a famous and generally elderly writer given a Lifetime Achievement Award. While it is not required to attend the week-long festivities and seminars, it is thought by some that those in the running for the Gold Award may advance their cause by displaying professionalism and hard work at that time; judges for the contest, however, refute this, as the judging is done blindly in advance of the week-long pre-awards event and most judges don't arrive on site until the last day of the workshop.\n\nMany noted writers and artists have judged WotF awards, or have won them themselves.\nNotable writing judges have included: Kevin J. Anderson, Gregory Benford, Algis Budrys, Orson Scott Card, Brian Herbert, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Anne McCaffrey, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Frederik Pohl, Jerry Pournelle, Tim Powers, Brandon Sanderson, Robert J. Sawyer, K. D. Wentworth, and Jack Williamson. Prominent art judges have included: Ciruelo Cabral, Edd Cartier, Echo Chernik, Leo and Diane Dillon, Bob Eggleton, Will Eisner, Frank Frazetta, Frank Kelly Freas, Stephen Hickman, and Stephen Youll.\n\nThe following is a list of Grand Prize winners in each contest year. Stories by the grand prize winner, the quarterly winners, and a few others, are collected into an anthology each year. Winners and published finalists in the contest have included the writers Stephen Baxter, Karen Joy Fowler, Carl Frederick, James Alan Gardner, Jim C. Hines, Jay Lake, David D. Levine, Syne Mitchell, Nnedi Okorafor, Michael H. Payne, Brian Plante, Robert Reed, Bruce Holland Rogers, Patrick Rothfuss, Dean Wesley Smith, Catriona Sparks, Sean Tinsley, Mary Turzillo, Sean Williams, Dave Wolverton, David Zindell, and the artists Shaun Tan and Frank Wu.\n\nThe original sponsor of the contest was Bridge Publications, Inc., the publishing arm of the Church of Scientology. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to Author Services Inc. under the trade name Galaxy Press, which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard's fiction and the contest anthologies.\n\nThe contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with \"Battlefield Earth\" at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard's name appears \"above the title\", and in at least as prominent a font. The prominence of Hubbard's name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard's status in the science fiction and literary communities.\n\nEntering or winning the contest does not require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.\n\nAccording to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard's books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.\n\nHowever, records with the United States Patent and Trademark Office show that the rights to the Writers of the Future name were transferred from the L. Ron Hubbard estate (\"Family Trust-B\") to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1989, and under the 1993 IRS closing agreement with the Church of Scientology, the L. Ron Hubbard estate became part of the Church of Spiritual Technology, a \"Scientology-related entity\".\n\n"}
