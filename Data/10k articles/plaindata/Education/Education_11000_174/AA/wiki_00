Two systems are in common use, based on the abbreviations lists of standard reference works:\n\n\nThe two systems overlap substantially: Homer and Plato, for instance, are \"Hom.\" and \"Pl.\" in both the \"OCD\" and LSJ; Cicero and Horace are \"Cic.\" and \"Hor.\" in the \"OCD\", the \"ThLL\", and the \"OLD\". Occasionally, however, abbreviations in LSJ are shorter than in the \"OCD\": for instance, Aeschylus and Euripides are \"A.\" and \"E.\" in LSJ, \"Aesch.\" and \"Eur.\" in the \"OCD\". As a consequence, abbreviations in the \"OCD\" can be clearer than those in LSJ. However, the \"OCD\" has fewer abbreviations for authors and texts than LSJ and the \"OLD\" or \"ThLL\" combined, so publications dealing with minor authors and texts not included in the \"OCD\" often have to resort to the other, fuller system. \n\nBoth for Greek and for Latin texts, in both the systems referred to above, abbreviations are conventionally based on the Latin name of the author and title of the work. For instance, Aristophanes' \"Frogs\" is abbreviated \"Ra.\" or \"Ran.\" (from \"Ranae\") and Horace's \"Odes\" are abbreviated \"Carm.\" (from \"Carmina\"). This is due to the former status of Latin as the language of scholarly communication in the discipline as well as to the usefulness of having a set of references that is valid across present-day national and linguistic boundaries.\n\nWhen a work is falsely attributed to an author by ancient sources, his abbreviated name is often put between square brackets: for instance, the \"Shield of Heracles\" falsely attributed to Hesiod is abbreviated as [Hes.] \"Sc.\" (from \"Scutum\"). An alternative is \"Pseudo-\" (abbreviated \"Ps.\") attached to the purported author's name, such as the anonymous \"Pseudo-Longinus\" who authored the treatise \"On the Sublime\". \n\nFragments and certain kinds of texts, such as lexica and scholia, are generally referenced with the surname(s) of the editor(s) of the edition used, so as to disambiguate it from other editions of the same text which may have different numbering systems. The surname(s) can be cited entire or abbreviated: for instance, Snell-Maehler or Sn.-M. for the fragments of Pindar. \n\nAs well as authors' names and the titles of works, Classical publications often use abbreviations for other items that are relevant to Classical antiquity. These also tend to come in standardised form:\n\n"}

{"id": "50337889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50337889", "title": "Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș", "text": "Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș\n\nConstantin I. Dobrescu, better known as Dobrescu-Argeș (June 28, 1856 – December 10, 1903), was a Romanian peasant activist and politician, also active as a teacher, journalist, and jurist. Active from his native Mușătești, in Argeș County, he established a regional, and finally national, base for agrarian politics. He is considered Romania's second agrarianist, after Ion Ionescu de la Brad, and, with Dincă Schileru, a revivalist of the peasant cause in the Romanian Kingdom era. Dobrescu was notoriously unpersuaded by agrarian socialism, preferring a mixture of communalism and Romanian nationalism, with some echoes of conservatism. Thus, he stopped short of advocating land reform, focusing his battles on democratization through universal suffrage, and on obtaining state support for the cooperative movement. He himself founded some of the Kingdom's first cooperatives, also setting up model schools, the first rural theater, and the first village printing press—which put out his various periodicals.\n\nAlthough well liked by cultural and political figures of all hues, with whom he collaborated on various projects, Dobrescu's clandestine support for the concept \"Greater Romania\" made him a political liability. Technicalities were invoked to block him out of the Assembly of Deputies, despite his repeatedly winning in elections. Eventually, he served four contiguous terms in the 1880s and '90s, moving from alliances with the Conservative and Radical Parties to the position of an isolated independent, and, in 1895, to leader of his own \"Partida Țărănească\" (\"Peasants' Party\").\n\nDobrescu's nationalism and his association with ill-reputed figures such as Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești contributed to his marginalization, as did his reputation as a \"carnival peasant\", one who had backstage dealings with the establishment. Such ridicule and one public beating closely preceded scandals involving his financial misdeeds, alleged or proven. Upon the end of a publicized trial lasting to 1903, Dobrescu was found guilty of fraud, and emerged from prison after three months with his health compromised, dying in his peasant home. He remained cited as a martyr and precursor of agrarian and Poporanist movements, revived during the interwar. He was also credited as a forerunner of the National Peasants' Party.\n\nBorn in Mușătești, his father Ion Dobrescu was a Romanian Orthodox priest. The family ancestors included \"Pitar\" Nicolae Popescu, who had fought in the Wallachian uprising of 1821, becoming secretary to its leader, Tudor Vladimirescu; Vladimirescu would serve as an inspiration to Dobrescu in his own efforts of social improvement. A grandfather, Toma, also credited as an influence on the young Dobrescu, had participated in the 1848 Revolution and had gone into hiding upon its defeat. Additionally, Dobrescu was much inspired by the political articles of Mihai Eminescu, which he also read out, and put into more accessible language, for his peasant constituents.\n\nAfter attending primary school in his native village, where he used dirt and his own fingers as writing utensils, Dobrescu continued his education at Curtea de Argeș and Pitești. He studied at the theological seminary in the former town, one of several peasant inductees. In 1874 or 1875, he became a teacher in Mușătești. During this period, he became interested in the cause of peasant representation, militating against the weighted suffrage established under the Constitution of 1866, and implicitly against the two-party system that it favored. As he put it, the peasant could have \"an active part, of the uttermost importance\". He challenged the political establishment by noting that peasant representation had steadily declined, from 36 deputies in the ad-hoc Divans to 33 in the \"United Principalities\" era, and then to none in the Assembly of Deputies.\n\nAs noted by the agrarianist writer Ilariu Dobridor, Dobrescu was the second person in Romanian history, after Ion Ionescu de la Brad, to have championed peasantism as a political, not merely \"philanthropic\", effort. Also according to Dobridor, Dobrescu's first attempts to set up an agrarian movement brought him into contact with left-wing figures such as Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești and Constantin Mille—both disappointed him. He put himself up as a candidate in the legislative election of 1879, winning an Assembly seat for the Fourth College in Argeș. However, the electoral law specified that he had to be aged 25 to qualify, and so his mandate was invalidated. The elections did produce one peasant deputy, Dincă Schileru (Schileriu), who affiliated with the Radical Party of C. A. Rosetti and George Panu. He served almost continuously to 1911.\n\nDobrescu's other work was focused on cultural activism, for the goal of creating and popularizing \"rural dramas, rural comedies, rural poetry, [...] our own philosophy, our own arts, purpose, traditions and our own sort of civilization\". In order to facilitate the peasantry's access to education and the amenities of modern life, Dobrescu also advocated for the establishment of free libraries, rural banks and general stores. In 1879, the Central Rural Athenaeum, devoted to teaching adult peasants to read and write, was founded under his guidance. This institution comprised a choral and folk dance ensemble, a public library, an ethnographic and pedagogic museum, an agronomical station, a gymnastics arena, a school for adults, several cultural circles, a popular bank and a magazine that disseminated news of these venues' achievements. In 1882, Dobrescu also created the first rural theater in the entire Romanian Kingdom. This was followed in 1884 by the country's first cooperative, set up at Domnești under the name of \"Frăția\" (\"Brotherhood\")—although Mușătești remained the hub for the cooperative movement for the next two decades.\nIn order to better organize for his struggle, in 1881 Dobrescu founded at Mușătești a Peasants' Committee, a political network that brought together activists from Argeș and Gorj, later expanded into other regions of Muntenia and Oltenia. Its co-leaders were Schileru and Mucenic Dinescu, and its first congress was held at Corbeni in August 1882. According to Dobridor, this was a historic moment, bringing together peasants who had hitherto been separated by sectarian causes. Dobrescu \"simply lifted up his sword to sever the ropes of coterie that had penetrated the very soul of the peasants, had carved the mark of slavery into their napes, like a yoke carving into the neck of a buffalo.\"\n\nAn ardent nationalist and \"irredentist\", Dobrescu also supported the clandestine activities of Romanians in Transylvania and other parts of Austria-Hungary. These brought him to the attention of Ion Brătianu, doyen of the National Liberal Party and Argeș-based squire, who wanted to preserve good relations with the Austrian establishment and civil peace in his constituency. Dobrescu was secretly investigated by a Captain Vinieru, who reported from Sălătrucu that Dobrescu was coordinating illegal activities over the frontier, and had himself traveled to the area around Rothenturm for unknown purposes.\n\nThe Vinieru episode came shortly after the democratization reforms initiated by Brătianu, which had increased representation for the middle classes, rural ones included, and merged the lower two electoral colleges into a Third. Such enfranchisement came with its own limitations: some 98% of the electorate could only vote for Assembly with indirect suffrage, the rest being excluded from this by wealth and literacy requirements; some 41% of the deputies elected under these new laws represented rural constituencies, but most of them were not land-working peasants. By Dobrescu's own calculations, there was still a 1:20,000 ratio of representation in the new college, whereas the upper two had 1:180 and 1:421, respectively.\n\nBelonging to an intermediary class, Dobrescu himself returned as a peasant candidate elections of that year, winning a seat for Argeș's Third College. He was again invalidated, since, as a teacher, he had a conflict of interest. He ran again in by-elections, and, although he had suspended his work in state education, was again faced with invalidation. This time, he was reproached for not having served in the Army, but the real reason may have been his irredentist subversion. At the time, Vinieru suggested that Dobrescu was involved in the June 1887 episode that ended with a shootout between an \"irredentist\" group and the Romanian Army, at Albești. Also according to Vinieru, the affair was kept secret by the National Liberals, and altogether ignored by the opposition Conservatives.\n\nIn the October 1888 election, Dobrescu took a Third College seat at Argeș, with 491 votes from 571. He ran on a Conservative ticket—backing the government of Theodor Rosetti, and defeating the National Liberal Theodor T. Brătianu. His mandate coincided with the peasant revolts of 1888, which Dobrescu anticipated in his Assembly speeches. Upon the rebellion's quashing, he expressed a moderate position, refusing to condemn Rosetti for his violent response to violence, and agreeing with him on the underlying causes of rural unrest. Registering as an independent, he was closely aligned with Schileru's Radicals in February 1889, and is tentatively described by scholar Philip Gabriel Eidelberg as a \"liberal populist\". In April 1889, he was listed as one of 17 Radical and dissident Liberal deputies, all of whom voted against the project to fortify Bucharest.\n\nOverall, Dobrescu argued for class collaboration \"on social issues\", an attitude for which he was cited approvingly by the Conservative doyen Petre P. Carp. Alongside Mihai Săulescu, he drafted a bill for land reform, but later backed down from supporting it, arguing that \"peasants require justice more than they require land reform\". As noted by the Radical paper \"Lupta\", it was impossible to tell whether this meant that Dobrescu was for or against land redistribution. He later elaborated that what was needed were \"syndicates\" of state-sponsored producers, and noted that the one existing credit union only helped peasants to marginally \"eke out a living\". By contrast, Rosetti relied on selling state land to modest producers, in lots of 5 hectares, marginalizing both the landless and wealthier peasants.\n\nThis period also brought his involvement in the controversy about socialist agitation in the countryside. Dobrescu had been curious about socialism, and frequented the Marxist Ioan Nădejde. However, he soon grew to dislike both the movement and Nădejde, exposing the later as an \"ass in a lion's pelt\". He also claimed that Nădejde had failed the test of proletarian internationalism, since, allegedly, he opposed the naturalization of Romanian Jews—possibly referring to the specific case of Ralian Samitca. In turn, Mille, by then co-opted by the socialist journal \"Drepturile Omului\", ridiculed Dobrescu as a \"carnival peasant\". In February 1889, with fellow deputie Grigore Cozadini, Mihail Caracostea, and Ernest Sturdza, Dobrescu visited Roman County to investigate the election of Lascăr Veniamin as socialist deputy. The commission's findings eventually led the other socialist deputy, Vasile Morțun, to resign and demand that he be formally tried. Some of the peasants he met asked him to run for their constituency, following Veniamin's looming invalidation. Reportedly, this showed the abrupt decline of the socialist movement.\n\nDobrescu also edited several periodicals: \"Țĕranul\" (1881–1884), Romania's first rural cultural and political publication; and \"Gazeta Poporului\" and \"Gazeta Țăranilor\" (1892–1903), through which he attempted to spread his ideas into the villages, aiming to integrate all rural teachers into cultural societies. As noted by historian Nicolae Iorga, \"Gazeta Țăranilor\" had a \"talented\" editor, but a \"mostly local\" influence; the statement is qualified by Constantin Bacalbașa, who argues that this venue also \"planted the very first seeds of a rural awakening\". Completed in 1894–1898 with the sheet \"Școala Poporului\", the periodicals were put out by his own printing press in Mușătești, which he had purchased with money granted by Ghenadie Petrescu, the Bishop of Argeș. It was \"the first printing press and bookbinder ever to have functioned in a rural commune.\" He pursued his mission in various other ventures: pioneering institutions founded by Dobrescu during this interval include, in 1893, the cooperative in Mușătești, named after Vlad Țepeș, and, in 1895, \"Școala Nouă\" (\"The New School\") of Domnești, furnished with a library and reading room.\n\nBefore September 1890, Dobrescu had come under investigation for supposedly illegal activities also involving the artillery guards, and was shamed for this by both the left-wing daily \"Adevărul\" and the Conservative organ \"Timpul\". They suggested that he should resign his seat, and argued that his self-promotion was distasteful. Dobrescu was again elected to the Assembly, at Argeș, following the race of 1891, and reelected in 1892. During these legislatures, Dobrescu listed himself as an unaffiliated \"Democrat\", and became known as \"Dobrescu-Argeș\" to be distinguished from another Constantin Dobrescu, the Radical deputy of Prahova. His political stances were becoming ambiguous, and left-wingers came to suspect that he was secretly an ally of Lascăr Catargiu and his Conservative cabinet. Dobrescu openly supported some Conservative causes: with his theater, he performed one of his plays in front of King Carol I, who awarded him a decoration and his own portrait as a souvenir; in November 1892, he voted for adding 300,000 lei to the civil list, going to the royal family.\n\nA serious scandal erupted in November 1893, during debates over the establishment of an agricultural bank. Dobrescu promised nationalists A. C. Cuza and Constantin Popovici that he would endorse their amendment, excluding non-Romanians from the enterprise. He took the paper for signing, but never returned it, and found himself chased around the Assembly, threatened by Major N. Pruncu, and pummeled by Popovici. The incident was witnessed by writer (and deputy) Alexandru Vlahuță, who declared himself disgusted and demoralized by the casualness of the affair. Such displays prompted his 1889 rival Morțun to reuse the derisive moniker of \"carnival peasant\", an insult later popularized by \"Adevărul\", alongside \"poisonous mushroom\" and \"inveterate thief\".\n\nThe incongruity was also noted by the Radical Panu, who argued that the \"extremely congenial\" Dobrescu showed up in Romanian dress but was \"not a peasant, however much he may enjoy that designation [...] he merely dresses like one\". He honored in Dobrescu the \"intelligent man of the Argeș\", noting how fast he picked up on new things, but also that he lacked discipline. His abilities were also noted by the staff journalist at \"Foaia Populară\", who described Dobrescu as the \"miraculous\" figure of a self-made man, and by the journalist Constantin Bacalbașa, who remembered him as \"highly intelligent, cultured, and overflowing with political ambitions\".\n\nBy March 1895, Dobrescu stood in the generic opposition, and, alongside Cuza, attacked Catargiu's cabinet, and the Conservative Party in general, for not doing enough to improve rural education. The claim enlisted a lengthy retort from the Conservative Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who furnished evidence for the role of upper classes in rural advancement. On October 4, in Bucharest, Dobrescu held a congress that initiated a peasants' own political organization, \"Partida Țărănească\" (\"Peasants' Party\"). The platform, voted by peasant representatives from 20 counties, restated and detailed some of Dobrescu's main goals, including state investment into cooperatives and breeding programs, communalism with room for personal property and common land for gazing, and the auditing of peasant debt. It also had nativist requests, suggesting that peasants access a land reserve created from land repurchased by the state from non-nationals, and that leases on land be granted only by locals; an additional goal was the establishment of Greater Romania \"spread as far as the Romanian language is spoken\". The first party of its kind in Romania, \"Partida\" operated until 1899.\n\nDobrescu was again reelected, a final time, in 1895, after defeating the National Liberal Daniil Sterescu 645 votes to 280. In the latter race, he shared a ticket with Alexandru Valescu. \"Partida\" also won a seat for Muscel County, taken by M. Moisescu, with Dincă Schileru as a dissident National Liberal. By then, Dobrescu's party shifted some of its weight toward Muscel, with \"Gazeta Țăranilor\" printed from Câmpulung, before relocating to Bucharest. According to Dobrescu, during the electoral campaign Catargiu had ordered a clampdown on the printing press in Mușătești, with authorities threatening his readers throughout the region. The editorial offices, however, remained in place. Dobrescu eventually obtained a doctorate in law from the Free University of Brussels after studying there from 1894 to 1897. This activity sparked another controversy in 1897, upon notice that he had been awarded a scholarship by the Agriculture Ministry, then under the National Liberal Anastase Stolojan.\n\nIn addition to his clashes with Catargiu, Dobrescu found himself competing with the left-wing factions of the National Liberal Party, respectively led by the Spiru Haret and Nicolae Fleva. These now fought for the peasant vote, and openly attacked the landed gentry within their own party, in particular Dimitrie Sturdza. On various topical causes, Dobrescu worked with both Fleva and Haret, but also with other major figures in politics and militant culture, including Vasile Kogălniceanu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Tudor Arghezi, Nicolae Filipescu, and Take Ionescu. In the 1895 legislature, he and Moisescu intervened to propose bills for universal suffrage with proportional representation, supporting and being supported by Fleva, Morțun, Kogălniceanu, Nicu Ceaur-Aslan, George A. Scorțescu, and Iuniu Lecca. Nevertheless, Dobrescu was still adamantly opposed to Morțun's Marxism and the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party, possibly because the latter was also trying to win over peasant constituents—but also because Dobrescu respected the right of property and did not consider either an extensive land reform or collective farming. According to the cultural sociologist Z. Ornea, Dobrescu and his party only offered \"palliatives\" to landless peasants, and as such \"had no real mass basis, [were] weightless in political life.\"\n\nDobrescu also found himself ignored by the establishment: in the session of March 10, 1898, his interpellation about bootlegging ended inconclusively, as most of his colleagues got up and left the Assembly hall. He received some attention from Ion I. C. Brătianu, the new Minister of Public Works, who agreed with him on building a railway link between Curtea de Argeș and Câineni. By then, Dobrescu had been formally indicted of falsifying an insurance policy and embezzling funds. In June, he was arrested and sent to Văcărești prison, but made bail. As reported by Filipescu's \"Epoca\", his time in confinement was needlessly prolonged by hostile bailiffs, causing Dobrescu's mother to faint in public. However, the authorities discarded normal procedure, and left out biometrics when Dobrescu refused to comply, threatening to kill himself. He pleaded his case at the Correctional Tribunal, arguing that the counterfeiting was the work of his mistress, a Ms Ionescu. According to various accounts, he was being framed by the ruling class, although such accusations had surfaced independently in earlier years. In 1889, the peasants of Mușătești had complained that Dobrescu, hired to legalize their land claims, had absconded with their money. According to legend, Dobrescu also financed his party selling worthless bonds to peasants across the country. The scheme was only uncovered when one of his invoices showed up in a bankruptcy lawsuit. He was subsequently derided by his adversaries as \"Dobrescu-Chitanță\" (\"Dobrescu-Invoice\").\n\nDobrescu's work in public subscription also collected funds for a statue of Tudor Vladimirescu, in Târgu Jiu. He bagen this project in March 1895, with articles in \"Gazeta Țăranilor\", increasingly revolutionary in tone; he also oversaw the printing of a Vladimirescu biography. In 1899, as he inaugurated the statue, Dobrescu spoke about his mission of bringing about \"rule of the people, by the people\", \"democracy in both name and fact.\" During that year's elections, he was again in contact with the controversial candidate Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, at Slatina. He acted as electoral agent among the peasants, promising them that Bogdan-Pitești would redistribute land from a national reserve. When his patron was defeated, the enraged peasants rioted and had to be repressed using military force.\n\nMeanwhile, his trial, in which he was represented by Fleva, came before the Ilfov County tribunal, being postponed there over the absence of witnesses. Finally receiving a nine-month jail term in February 1900, reduced to a three-month term in 1903, Dobrescu served his sentence at Văcărești. After being released, he was completely demoralized and soon disappeared from public life. Near the end of the same year, gravely ill and paralyzed in both legs, he was taken from Bucharest to Mușătești. He was discreetly employed by Vasile Lascăr, the Interior Minister, to review or even draft new legislation, but died in his parental home before receiving any pay.\n\nSociologist Dumitru Drăghicescu suggests that, \"for all we know\", the \"peasant issue\" was introduced on the Romanian political agenda by Dobrescu. The \"brilliant and likeable forerunner\" directly inspired Drăghicescu to publish his own magazine for the peasants, \"România Rurală\", which came out in 1899–1900. Alexandru Valescu, who was also Dobrescu's brother-in-law, and his friend Kogălniceanu also sought to preserve the gains, and, in September 1906, reestablished \"Partida Țărănească\". \"Gazeta Țăranilor\" also continued to appear, with Valescu as publisher. It accepted Kogălniceanu's leadership of the party, but maintained a Dobrescu-like stance on land reform, only favoring the renting of estates to cooperatives (rather than full redistribution among individual owners).\n\nThis project blended with conservative populism through its deep association with Filipescu and the \"Epoca\" group, then was altogether thwarted by the peasants' revolt of 1907, which Valescu had ominously predicted. During the events, Kogălniceanu was found to be running a network which sold Romanian Orthodox icons \"for pledges\". Both leaders were arrested, with their \"Gazeta\" being singled out as a \"rebels' nest\". The movement went inactive for more than a decade. Although Valescu still convened a Congress of the Peasants in 1910, its demands were moderate, and its focus was on petitioning; other, more radical cells claiming the \"peasants' party\" pedigree were founded by Nicolae Basilescu and Alexandru Popescu-Berca. Overall, Valescu supported the reforms enacted by the National Liberal Party. As Drăghicescu notes, the latter now integrated a Poporanist current, and made the peasant issue, including advocacy for land reform, one of its core doctrines.\n\nUltimately, following World War I, land reform and universal suffrage were introduced throughout the newly established Greater Romania, making it possible for teacher Ion Mihalache to form his own Peasants' Party, the first of several interwar agrarianist movements. He was joined by Valescu, who took a Senate seat at Argeș in the elections of 1919. In 1920, at Priboieni, the folklorist Constantin Rădulescu-Codin relaunched \"Gazeta Țăranilor\" as a National Liberal mouthpiece, critical of Mihalache's policies. The period also saw a reevaluation of Dobrescu's role in the movement. Research into his politics was hampered by the destruction of his \"Țĕranul\", issues of which are exceedingly rare.\n\nBy the 1930s, the consolidated National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) was claiming Dobrescu as its patriarch. An earlier bust done by Frederic Storck from live sittings was raised at Curtea de Argeș in October 1933. PNȚ leaders Mihalache and Armand Călinescu were guest speakers at that ceremony. Also for the occasion, \"Adevărul\" revisited its earlier stances, dedicating Dobrescu a retrospective and quoting him on its frontispiece. As argued therein by editor Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, \"most of [Dobrescu's] goals, to this day, are just goals\". The land reform, he claimed, was haphazard and purposefully unsustainable; the enfranchisement was also compromised by \"savage elections\", and by Mihalache's own praise of corporatism. In January 1937, a \"Dobrescu-Argeș Canteen\" was founded by the PNȚ for rural peasants studying in Bucharest. Speaking at its inauguration rally, which doubled as an anti-fascist protest, Paul Bujor honored Dobrescu as the \"precursor and martyr of peasantism\". Pitești also hosted a Dobrescu-Argeș cooperative bank, managed by the PNȚ cadre Petre Gr. Dumitrescu.\n\nDuring the communist period, Dobrescu-Argeș was subjected to official criticism. In one novel of the period, Isac Ludo revisited the embezzling scandal, suggesting that other politicians were secretly admiring the leader of the \"so-called peasants' party\" for his criminal resourcefulness. A cultural club and research society bearing his name was founded at Mușătești in 1973, but was largely inactive. In 1974, the Romanian Communist Party Institute of Studies officially designated Dobrescu a representative of the \"numerically weak village bourgeoisie\", noting that his solutions \"could not lead to solving the basic social problems of the oppressed masses, urban as well as rural.\" His activity was again reviewed positively after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. A high school in Curtea de Argeș was named after him in 1990, as was a street in Pitești.\n\n"}
{"id": "599178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599178", "title": "Cosmopolitanism", "text": "Cosmopolitanism\n\nCosmopolitanism is the ideology that all human beings belong to a single community, based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.\n\nA cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).\n\nVarious cities and locales, past or present, have been or are identified as \"cosmopolitan\"; that does not necessarily mean that all or most of their inhabitants consciously embrace the above philosophy. Rather, locales may be called \"cosmopolitan\" simply because people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious background live in proximity and interact with each other.\n\nIn origin, cosmopolitanism suggests the establishment of a cosmo polis or ‘world state’ that would embrace all humanity. Cosmopolitanism has come to stand for peace and harmony among nations, founded upon understanding, tolerance and interdependence.\n\nThe word derives from the , or \"kosmopolitês\", formed from \"\", \"kosmos\", i.e. \"world\", \"universe\", or \"cosmos\", and , \"politês\", i.e. \"citizen\" or \"[one] of a city\". Contemporary usage defines the term as \"citizen of the world\".\n\nDefinitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of \"citizen of the world\". However, as Appiah points out, \"world\" in the original sense meant \"cosmos\" or \"universe\", not earth or globe as current use assumes. One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:\n\nCosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. \n\nCosmopolitanism can be traced back to Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the Cynic movement in Ancient Greece. Of Diogenes it is said: \"Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'\". In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity in at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being \"dwells [...] in two communities – the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration\".\nA common way to understand Stoic cosmopolitanism is through Hierocles' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of \"affinity\" or \"endearment\" towards others, which the Stoics termed Oikeiôsis. The task of world citizens becomes then to \"draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth\".\n\nIn his 1795 essay \"\", Immanuel Kant stages a \"ius cosmopoliticum\" (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to protect people from war, and morally grounds this cosmopolitan right by the principle of universal hospitality. Kant there claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to \"use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common\" (see common heritage of humanity) would \"finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution\".\n\nThe philosophical concepts of Emmanuel Levinas, on ethics, and Jacques Derrida, on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no \"universal moral law,\" only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth. The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.\n\nFor Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.\n\nDerrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized \"cosmopolitanism\",\nA further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the Second World War. As a reaction to the Holocaust and the other massacres, the concept of crimes against humanity became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.\n\nPhilosophical cosmopolitans are moral universalists: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is Kwame Anthony Appiah.\n\nSome philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging planetary phase of civilization, creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as global citizens and possible formation of a global citizens movement. These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; space travel and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of global warming and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or International Criminal Court; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic globalization; the emergence of global NGOs and transnational social movements, such as the World Social Forum; and so on. Globalization, a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.\n\nA number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh discusses what he calls \"Interbeing\" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; \"Interbeing\" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of Buddhist teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals. He further describes what he calls \"Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing\" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication. Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.\n\nOther theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In \"Scared Sacred\", Velcrow Ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion. In \"The Planet\", Paul Gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what Judith Butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.\n\nIn \"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers\", Kwame Anthony Appiah notices something important about how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, \"at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion\" for valuing others? If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that \"methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment.\" This estrangement entails a \"process of exposure to otherness\" in order to foster \"the irreducible value of diversity within sameness.\" Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness.\n\nFor Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In \"The Planet\", Gilroy describes the cases of Tom Hurndall and Rachel Corrie; each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents) and their stories might serve as affirmations of familiarity, rather than models of estrangement. Gilroy’s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy’s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.\n\nThe Venus Project, an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by Jacque Fresco, works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other.\n\nSome forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones. Frantz Fanon, in \"The Wretched of the Earth\", observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became \"manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe.\" When \"third world\" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself.\n\nFurther, Mahmood Mamdani in \"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim\" suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and Christianity to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations. Cosmopolitanism, in these instances, appears to be a new form of colonization: the powerful exploit the weak and the weak eventually fight back.\n\nMuch of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken nationalism and the framework of the sovereign nation-state for granted. Now, with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. Jesús Mosterín analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better.\n\nEspecially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the Internet provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations. He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion.\n\nCriticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, Charles Blattberg has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be \"rooted,\" by which he means based upon a \"global patriotism.\"\n\nMore general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares the John Searle's opposition to multiculturalism with Charles Taylor's celebration of it. She uses Richard Rorty as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor. At a conference on \"Philosophy in a Multicultural Context\", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. He develops Bruno Latour's conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.\n\nEmile Durkheim (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity. Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to John Rawls' political liberalism, which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.\n\nUlrich Beck (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional nation-state politics. Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the nation-state model. Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.\n\nIt is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered hegemonic at best and ethnocentric at worst. Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:\n\nA number of philosophers, including Emmanuel Levinas, have introduced the concept of the \"Other\". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.\n\nDuring this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in conscience.\n\nCosmopolitanism shares some aspects of universalism – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.\n\nIn addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.\n\nAs an example, Judith Butler discusses a Western discourse of \"human\" in \"Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence\". Butler works through the idea of \"human\" and notes that \"human\" has been \"naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism\" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all \"human\" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.\n\nThis idea is reiterated in Sunera Thobani's \"Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada,\" where she discusses a discourse in which Muslim people fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a \"good Muslim\" is one who has been Westernized and a \"bad Muslim\" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully \"human\" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized cultural identities.\n\nAccording to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of civil society actors such as Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.\n\nOther authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of Global Citizen will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a global citizens movement would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as global warming) and subsidiarity (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.\n\nDaniele Archibugi proposes a renewed model for global citizenship: institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.\n\n\"Cosmopolitanism\" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against \"alien\" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy. European Jews were frequently accused of being \"rootless cosmopolitans.\" Joseph Stalin in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which “the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.” In the 21st century the epithet became a weapon used by Vladimir Putin in Russia, and by nationalists in Hungary and Poland. In modern times, Stephen Miller, a Trump administration senior policy advisor, has publicly criticized CNN reporter Jim Acosta as exhibiting \"cosmopolitan bias\" during a discussion on the government's new immigration plan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "557830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557830", "title": "Graduate diploma", "text": "Graduate diploma\n\nA graduate diploma (GradD, GDip, GrDip, GradDip) is generally a qualification taken after completion of a first degree, although the level of study varies in different countries from being at the same level as the final year of a bachelor's degree to being at a level between a master's degree and a doctorate. In some countries the graduate diploma and postgraduate diploma are synonymous, while in others (particularly where the graduate diploma is at undergraduate degree level) the postgraduate diploma is a higher qualification.\n\nGraduate diplomas offered in Canada (French: \"Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées\"), are typically taken following a bachelor's degree and a successful award allows progression to a master's degree. Depending on the institution, a graduate diploma in Canada may be at graduate level or bachelor's level. Similar courses at other Canadian institutions may be termed postgraduate diplomas at graduate level and post-baccalaureate diploma at bachelor's level.\n\nThe graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor's degree, and some master's degree programs have graduate diploma as a nested (interim) award. The qualification is at level 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework, the same as an honours degree.. This qualification is at the same level as the post graduate diploma qualifications awarded in New Zealand institutions and Australian graduate diplomas should not be confused with New Zealand graduate diplomas as they belong to two different qualification levels.\n\nIn New Zealand, a graduate diploma is an \"advanced undergraduate\" qualification normally completed after a bachelor's degree or done at the same time of the bachelors study, and may be used to prove the student's ability to undertake postgraduate studies. A graduate diploma (e.g., Graduate Diploma in Education etc.) is different from a postgraduate diploma, which is a course of study at postgraduate level (e.g., Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology etc.).\n\nIn the UK, a graduate diploma is a short course at the level of a bachelor's degree that is normally studied by students who have already graduated in another field. Graduate diplomas are distinguished from graduate certificates by having a longer period of study, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year or more.. Until the 1990s, the British conservatoires of music offered three year undergraduate courses to some of their students, leading the award of the Graduate Diploma, e.g. GRSM, GTCL, equivalent to a university first degree in music. When a number of conservatoires became affiliated to or constituent colleges of universities, the graduate diplomas were gradually replaced by the award of the BMus degree to all successful students.\n\nGraduate diplomas should not be confused with a postgraduate diploma, which is a master's degree-level qualification. Historically, this has not always been the case, with postgraduate diploma and graduate diploma used interchangeably, but the Quality Assurance Agency now makes a clear distinction between these titles. Some institutions have renamed courses as a result, e.g. The College of Law renamed the official title for its law conversion course from \"Postgraduate Diploma in Law\" to \"Graduate Diploma in Law\" as, although the law conversion course is studied postgraduately, the contents of the course are only undergraduate in nature.\n\nIn 2018, the Royal College of Art launched a new Graduate Diploma in Art and Design programme aimed at preparing graduate students for it's master’s degree programmes in Art and Design \n\nThe graduate diploma or higher diploma in the Republic of Ireland is an award at the same level as an honours bachelor's degree. It comprises one year of full-time study and is taken after, and in a different subject from, an earlier bachelor's degree. A wide variety of courses are offered; it is also possible to progress to a master's degree.\n\nThe diploma is generally in two forms:\n\nThe graduate diploma (GradDip) is offered by the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin City University, HETAC and the University of Limerick. The higher diploma (HDip) is offered by HETAC, NUI institutions, and Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nIn India postgraduate diploma, is a master's degree-level qualification which usually is a 1 yr advanced program. Certain institutes provide master's level programs with increased number lower credit courses for 2 years, such courses are also called postgraduate diploma. At times for transnational equivalency the same is casually noted as Graduate diplomas. Advanced diplomas provided are equivalent to a post-baccalaureate diploma, this is an eight-month to one-year course.\n\nThe graduate diploma is an academic or vocational qualification; as an academic qualification it is often taken after a bachelor's degree although sometimes only a foundation degree is required. It is usually awarded by a university or a graduate school and usually takes 2 terms of study to complete. It is also possible for academic graduate diploma holders to progress to a master's degree on an accelerated pathway compared to first embarking on a 3- or 4-year degree program. To ensure that the graduate diploma qualification is recognised, the awarding body must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education.\n\nThe graduate diploma is generally a professional conversion qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the \"GDipPsy - Graduate Diploma in Psychology\" is aimed at offering specialised skills in psychology. See also postgraduate diploma.\n\nThe graduate diploma is offered at different levels by different institutions. The National University of Singapore requires study at master's level, but the graduate diplomas at the Singapore University of Social Sciences are UK (i.e. bachelor's-level) graduate diplomas awarded by the University of London and similarly the Ngee Ann - Adelaide Education Centre offers Australian graduate diplomas (i.e. Australian honours degree level) awarded by the University of Adelaide. The Graduate Diploma of Singapore Raffles Music College is a post-foundation degree qualification rather than post-bachelor's. Graduate diplomas from Aventis School of Management are part-time courses that is accredidated by The Association of Psychotherapists and Counsellors Singapore (APACS) or registered with European Foundation for Management Development and the European Council for Business Education (ECBE)\n\nThe WSQ Graduate Diploma is the highest qualification in Singapore's vocational Workforce Skills Qualifications framework, administered by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. This is not tied to the levels of academic degrees.\n\nGraduate Diplomas (in Danish: HD) are two-year full-time-equivalent programmes at bachelor's degree level, normally studied as four-year part-time courses. They are studied in business-related fields such as Business Administration and Innovation Management. Programs are normally split into Part 1 (graduate certificate) and Part 2 (graduate diploma), each being 60 ECTS Credits (one year of full-time-equivalent study).\n\nIn the US, graduate diplomas are \"Intermediate Graduate Qualifications\" involving study beyond master's level but not reaching PhD level. They are generally found in professional, rather than academic, fields. Other qualifications at this level include advanced graduate certificates, specialist certificates and specialist degrees.\n\nThe graduate diploma forms part of the lifelong education pathway on the Malaysian Qualifications Framework. They are qualifications at the level of a bachelor's degree but with half of the credit value.\n"}
{"id": "57144664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57144664", "title": "György Bulányi", "text": "György Bulányi\n\nGyörgy P. Bulányi (Budapest, 9 January 1919 – Budapest, June 6, 2010) was a Piarist priest, teacher, and leader of the Bokor Catholic youth discipleship movements in Croatia and Hungary which faced strong suppression from the Hungarian communist government and Catholic hierarchy for their advocacy of conscientious objection.\n\nBulányi graduated from the College of Teacher Education, the College of Paleontology, and then the Pázmány Péter University of Sciences. In 1943 he was ordained a priest in the Piarist Order. He then taught in a Piarist high school serving Sátoraljaújhely, Tata, and Debrecen.\nIn March 1945, a Croatian Jesuit named Kolakovićs came to Hungary to form base communities of youth with the permission of József Mindszenty, bishop of Veszprém. Kolakovićs viewed the model of base communities or cell groups as a survival strategy in the face of likely communist suppression where leaders might be unavailable. Bulányi and Kolakovićs collaborated to in the formation of the high school students who joined this community, and the group came to be called Bokor meaning \"bush\". They were sometimes also called Bulányists.\n\nBokor was focused on following Jesus and cultivating a love for Jesus. Bokor taught principles of altruism, humility, voluntary poverty, service to the poor, and Christian pacifism. Bokor opposed all involvement in the military and use of force. It was a movement designed for exponential growth, intending to train participants to start their own leaderless cell group of 4–12 friends. The movement was egalitarian, offering all participants the opportunity to share their opinions, and group prayers were performed by taking turns.\n\nIn 1949, Bulányi wrote a pamphlet (Old Scripture) on behalf of a group calling itself (Bush-Eco). The pamphlet asserted that humanity has a moral responsibility to respect nature, preserve the natural environment, and consider the impacts of actions on future generations. This is one of the earliest documents of the modern environmental movement in Hungary.\n\nBokor opposed the atheist communist ideology of the Hungarian state under Mátyás Rákosi, and continued to clash specifically on the topic of pacifism. The Hungarian State Church Office to the Bishop warned them that this position would not be tolerated, but Bokor held firm on this issue. The Hungarian government viewed the Bokor community as an illegal anti-state organization, and sentenced Bulányi to life imprisonment in 1952. He escaped in October 1956 during the Hungarian revolution and became a parish priest in downtown Budapest. However, he was arrested again in April 1958 and later released again in 1960. At this time, he was one of the most controversial figures in Hungarian Catholicism. He then worked as an unskilled laborer while he wrote a book, \"Seek the kingdom of God!\"\n\nBokor grew throughout the 1960s and became even more visible after 1970, despite ongoing suppression from both the government and the Catholic hierarchy. For those interested in deeper discipleship, Bokor offered a 5 year theological course involving about 78–80 spiritual exercises per year.\nIn 1989, Bokor had 185 leaders, 35 of whom were priests. The movement was connected to the base communities of Latin American liberation theology. Bokor continued to be suppressed by the Hungarian government until 1990.\n\nFrom the end of the 1970s into 1981, Bulányi became more vocal in preaching pacifism and conscientious objection publicly, and the practice increased markedly. Dozens of Bokor members were imprisoned for their pacifist stance. Hungarian Catholic officials, led by László Paskai, archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, strongly objected to Bulányi's teaching, considering it harmful and dangerous. They issued a formal condemnation of conscientious objection in October 1986. These officials supported government suppression of conscientious objectors, and imprisonments continued throughout the 1980s. Continued advocacy from groups like Bokor and interaction with Catholics outside of Hungary softened their perspective, however, and in March 1988, Paskai suggested that the Prime Minister allow alternative civilian service. Paskai later claimed to have been constrained by the autocratic government and said that he had no choice but to collaborate in suppression.\n\nThe Hungarian government and Catholic hierarchy responded by seeking to discredit Bulányi by presenting evidence that his writings were heretical. There was significant debate about Bulányi's writings such as \"Church order\" and \"Is obedience a virtue?\", drawing input from theologians such as Hans Küng. In a 31 December 1986 letter, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, asked Bulányi to publicly withdraw his teachings on the universal priesthood of the laity as false, dangerous ambiguous, and heretical. Bulányi did not agree with Ratzinger's assessment, and for a decade these strong official statements against Bulányi remained. After the change in government in Hungary in 1989, the Hungarian state requested forgiveness from Bulányi. However, leaders of the Catholic Church did not apologize.\n\nFinally, in February 1997, Bulányi and Ratzinger came to an agreement, with John Paul II offering greater freedom of conscience than Ratzinger had previously accepted. Bulányi cooperated, clarified his teachings, and signed a statement requested of him. On 5 April 1997, Ratzinger wrote that he considered the matter closed. On 10 September 1997, there was a public announcement of the formal rehabilitation of Bulányi in the Catholic Church, and he was once again permitted to conduct mass.\n\nThe Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference published the statements of Bulányi and Ratzinger without comment. Some Hungarian Catholics were disappointed that the Conference didn't offer an apology for their behavior toward Bulányi and his supporters. These Catholic viewed the actions of the Catholic hierarchy as improper use of power in collaboration with an immoral autocratic state. Even after rehabilitation, Bulányi continued to be marginalized within the Catholic community. From 2005 until his death, Bulányi lived with other Piarists in the of Budapest.\n\nBulányi identified with the views of Marcion of Sinope in rejecting the Old Testament as uninspired, immoral, and incompatible with the character of the God of Jesus who is love.\n\nBulányi affirmed a church structure consisting of base communities, based on a theological affirmation of universal priesthood of the laity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

JFLAP allows one to create and simulate structures, such as programming a finite state machine, and \nexperiment with proofs, such as converting a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) to a \ndeterministic finite automaton (DFA).\n\nJFLAP is developed and maintained at Duke University, with support from the National Science Foundation since 1993. It is freeware and the source code of the most recent version is available, but under some restrictions. JFLAP runs as a Java application.\n\nBefore JFLAP, there were several software tools related to automata theory developed by Susan H. Rodger and her students starting around 1990 \nin the Computer Science Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 1992, the first published paper at a DIMACS 2012 workshop described a related tool called NPDA \nNPDA then evolved into FLAP, including also finite state machines and Turing machines.\nIn 1993, a paper on Formal Languages and Automata Package\n(FLAP) was published\n. At that time, the tool was written in C++ and X Window. Around 1994, Rodger moved to \nDuke University and continued tool development. Around 1996, FLAP was converted to \nJava and the first paper mentioned JFLAP was published in 1996\nAlong the way, other tools were developed as stand alone tools and then later integrated into JFLAP. \nFor example, a paper in 1999 described how JFLAP now allowed one to experiment with construction\ntype proofs, such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a mininal state DFA, and as another example, \nconverting NPDA to CFG and vice versa. In 2002 JFLAP was converted to Swing. In 2005-2007 a study was run with fourteen institutions using \nJFLAP. A paper on this study in 2009 showed that students using JFLAP thought JFLAP made them feel more engaged in the \nclass, and made learning the concepts easier.\n\nThe history of JFLAP is covered on the jflap.org site, and includes \nover 35 students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Duke University who have worked on \nJFLAP and related tools since 1990.\n\nA paper by Chakraborty, Saxena and Katti entitled \"Fifty years of automata simulation: a review\" \nin ACM Inroads magazine in December 2011 stated the following about JFLAP:\n\"The effort put into developing this tool is unparalleled in the field of simulation of automata.

This method was also known as \"mutual instruction\" or the \"Bell-Lancaster method\" after the British educators Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster who both independently developed it. The method was based on the abler pupils being used as 'helpers' to the teacher, passing on the information they had learned to other students.\n\nThe Monitorial System was found very useful by 19th-century educators, as it proved to be a cheap way of making primary education more inclusive, thus making it possible to increase the average class size. Joseph Lancaster's motto for his method was \"Qui docet, discit\" -- \"He who teaches, learns.\" The methodology was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and later by the National Schools System.\n\nThe system is not entirely unlike the way professors, assistants and tutors work together in university education.\n\nThe Monitorial System, although widely spread and with many advocates, fell into disfavour with David Stow's \"Glasgow System\" which advocated trained teachers with higher goals than those of monitors.\n\nThe basic teaching and learning process used in the Monitorial System has been used in passing knowledge between people in many cultures because of its low cost to benefit ratio. Numerous institutions use the basic concept as their primary mode of instruction. There have been many observations regarding its efficacy,\nin 35AD in Rome, Seneca the Younger, in an epistle to his friend, Lucillus, noted: \"Docendo discimus\" - we learn by teaching.\n\nLancaster specified an ideal classroom (hall) as being a \"parallelogram, the length about twice the width. The windows were to be six feet from the floor. The floor should be inclined, rising one foot in twenty from the master's desk to the upper end of the room, where the highest class is situated. The master's desk is on the middle of a platform two to three feet high, erected at the lower end of the room. Forms and desks, fixed firmly to the ground, occupy the middle of the room, a passage being left between the ends of the forms and the wall, five or six feet broad, where the children form semicircles for reading.\"\n\nAccording to Gladman, to stimulate effort and reward merit, \"Lancaster used Place Taking abundantly. He also had medals and badges of merit... Tickets could be earned too; these had a trifling pecuniary value.\" Prizes were given \"to excess\" ceremonially.\n\nFrequent changes of routine aided discipline. A code of command and exact movements also reinforced discipline. Class lists and registers were kept.\n\nChildren were classified on a dual principle according to their ability in reading and arithmetic.\n\nLancaster described his system as to produce a \"Christian Education\" and \"train children in the practice of such moral habits as are conducive to the welfare of society.\"\n\nBell's \"Madras System\" was so named because it originated at the Military Male Orphan Asylum, Egmore, near Madras. Gladman describes Bell's system from notes taken from \"Bell's Manual\" which had been published by the National Society two years after Bell's death, in 1832. \"After observing children in a native school, seated on the ground, and writing in the sand, he set a boy, John Frisken, to teach the alphabet on the same principle... Bell was consequently led to extend and elaborate the system.\"\n\nBell declared \"There is a faculty, inherent in the mind, of conveying and receiving mutual instruction\". In 1796, John Frisken was 12 years and 8 months old. With assistants, he was in charge of 91 boys.\nThe school was arranged in forms or classes, each consisting of about 36 members of similar proficiency, as classified by reading ability.\n\nThe young teachers were kept to task through registers. Reading, Ciphering and Religious rehearsals were tracked through the paidometer register. Discipline was held through a 'Black Book', which had entries which were read to the entire school, and the faults were explained in moral terms.\n\nThe hall was built in rectangles, with windows five feet from the floor, but opening at the top. Desks were placed against walls, and the Master's desk was raised. \"Fixing the master thus, deprived him of much of his power; he would do more good in passing from class to class, and teaching.\" critics said.\n\nFrederick John Gladman, writing in the 1880s, distinguishes between the Lancasterian system and the Madras System. The Lancasterian System is described as preferring smaller classes, unlike Bell's Madras System.\n\nDespite the many similarities of the two systems, and the initial friendship of Lancaster and Bell, divisions appeared between their advocates. In 1805, a Mrs Trimmer published a paper claiming Lancaster's system was antagonistic to the Anglican Church. It was said that the country was soon divided into two camps; speeches, sermons, magazine articles and pamphlets appeared on each side. The National Society was formed to propagate Bell's System and the British and Foreign School Society (B&FSS) was formed to propagate Lancaster's System. \n\nThere is one surviving British School in Hitchin, Hertfordshire- and this is now run as a museum with and experiential educational program suitable for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 pupils.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231088", "title": "Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service", "text": "Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service\n\nMultichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), formerly known as Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and also known as Wireless Cable, is a wireless telecommunications technology, used for general-purpose broadband networking or, more commonly, as an alternative method of cable television programming reception.\n\nMMDS is used in the Sudan, United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Iceland, Ireland, Ukraine, Russia, Slovakia, Bolivia, Brazil, Barbados, Australia, Portugal, Madeira, Czech Republic, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uruguay, India, Belarus, Lebanon, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It is most commonly used in sparsely populated rural areas, where laying cables is not economically viable, although some companies may also offer MMDS services in urban areas, most notably in Ireland where MMDS was phased out in 2016.\n\nThe BRS band uses microwave frequencies from 2.5 GHz to 2.7 GHz. Reception of BRS-delivered television and data signals is done with a rooftop microwave antenna. The antenna is attached to a down-converter or transceiver to receive and transmit the microwave signal and convert them to frequencies compatible with standard TV tuners (much like on satellite dishes where the signals are converted down to frequencies more compatible with standard TV coaxial cabling), some antennas use an integrated down-converter or transceiver. Digital TV channels can then be decoded with a standard cable set-top box or directly for TVs with integrated digital tuners. Internet data can be received with a standard DOCSIS Cable Modem connected to the same antenna and transceiver.\n\nThe MMDS band is separated into 33 6 MHz \"channels\" (31 in USA) which may be licensed to cable companies offering service in different areas of a country. The concept was to allow entities to own several channels and multiplex several television, radio, and later Internet data onto each channel using digital technology. Just like with Digital Cable channels, each channel is capable of 30.34 Mbit/s with 64QAM modulation, and 42.88 Mbit/s with 256QAM modulation. Due to forward error correction and other overhead, actual throughput is around 27 Mbit/s for 64QAM and 38 Mbit/s for 256QAM.\n\nThe newer BRS Band Plan makes changes to channel size and licensing in order to accommodate new WIMAX TDD fixed and mobile equipment, and reallocated frequencies from 2150–2162 MHz to the AWS band. These changes may not be compatible with the frequencies and channel sizes required for operating traditional MMDS or DOCSIS based equipment.\n\nLocal Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) and BRS have adapted the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) from the cable modem world. The version of DOCSIS modified for wireless broadband is known as DOCSIS+.\n\nData-transport security is accomplished under BRS by encrypting traffic flows between the broadband wireless modem and the WMTS (Wireless Modem Termination System) located in the base station of the provider's network using Triple DES.\n\nDOCSIS+ reduces theft-of-service vulnerabilities under BRS by requiring that the WMTS enforce encryption, and by employing an authenticated client/server key-management protocol in which the WMTS controls distribution of keying material to broadband wireless modems.\n\nLMDS and BRS wireless modems utilize the DOCSIS+ key-management protocol to obtain authorization and traffic encryption material from a WMTS, and to support periodic reauthorization and key refresh. The key-management protocol uses X.509 digital certificates, RSA public key encryption, and Triple DES encryption to secure key exchanges between the wireless modem and the WMTS.\n\nMMDS provided significantly greater range than LMDS.\n\nMMDS may be obsoleted by the newer 802.16 WiMAX standard approved since 2004.\n\nMMDS was sometimes expanded to Multipoint Microwave Distribution System or Multi-channel Multi-point Distribution System. All three phrases refer to the same technology.\n\nIn the United States, WATCH Communications (based in Lima, Ohio), Eagle Vision (based in Kirksville, MO), and several other companies offer MMDS-based wireless cable television, Internet access, and IP-based telephone services.\n\nIn certain areas, BRS is being deployed for use as wireless high-speed Internet access, mostly in rural areas where other types of high-speed internet are either unavailable (such as cable or DSL) or prohibitively expensive (such as satellite internet). CommSPEED is a major vendor in the US market for BRS-based internet.\n\nAWI Networks (formerly Sky-View Technologies) operates a number of MMDS sites delivering high-speed Internet, VoIP telephone, and Digital TV services in the Southwestern U.S. In 2010, AWI began upgrading its infrastructure to DOCSIS 3.0 hardware, along with new microwave transmission equipment, allowing higher modulation rates like 256QAM. This has enabled download speeds in excess of 100 Mbit/s, over distances up to 35 miles from the transmission site.\n\nIn the early days of MMDS, it was known as \"Wireless Cable\" and was used in a variety of investment scams that still surface today. Frequent solicitations of Wireless Cable fraud schemes were often heard on talk radio shows like \"The Sonny Bloch Show\" in the mid-1990s.\n\nSeveral US telephone companies attempted television services via this system in the mid-1990sthe Tele-TV venture of Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Bell; and the rival Americast consortium of Ameritech, BellSouth, SBC, SNET and GTE. The Tele-TV operation was only launched from 1999 to 2001 by Pacific Bell (the merged Bell Atlantic/NYNEX never launched a service), while Americast also petered out by that time, albeit mainly in GTE and BellSouth areas; the systems operated by Ameritech utilized standard wired cable.\n\nIn the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and British Columbia, Craig Wireless operates a wireless cable and internet service (MMDS) for rural and remote customers.\n\nIn Mexico, the 2.5 GHz band spectrum was reclaimed by the government in order to allow newer and better wireless data services. Hence, MAS TV (formerly known as MVS Multivision) had to relinquish the concessions for TV broadcast and shut down its MMDS pay TV services in 2014 after 25 years of service.\n\nIn Ireland, since 1990, UPC Ireland (previously Chorus and NTL Ireland) offered MMDS TV services almost nationwide. The frequency band initially allocated was 2500–2690 MHz (the \"2.6 GHz band\") consisting of 22–23 8 MHz analogue channels; digital TV was restricted to 2524–2668 MHz, consisting of 18 8 MHz digital channels. Two digital TV standards were used: DVB-T/MPEG-2 in the old Chorus franchise area and DVB-C/MPEG-2 in the old NTL franchise area. The existing licences were to expire 18 April 2014 but Comreg, the Irish communications regulator, extended the licences for a further 2 years to 18 April 2016 at which date they expired together with all associated spectrum rights of use. The 2.6 GHz band spectrum will be auctioned off so that when the existing MMDS licences expire new rights of use can issue on a service and technology neutral basis (by means of new licences). As a result, holders of the new rights of use may choose to provide any service capable of being delivered using 2.6 GHz spectrum. For instance, they could distribute television programming content, subject to complying with the relevant technical conditions and with any necessary broadcasting content authorisations, or they could adopt some other use.\n\nIn Iceland, since November 2006, Vodafone Iceland runs Digital Ísland (Digital Iceland)the broadcasting system for 365 (media corporation), (previously operated by 365 Broadcast Media). Digital Ísland offers digital MMDS television services using DVB-T technology alongside a few analogue channels. The MMDS frequency range extends from 2500–2684 MHz for a total of 23 8 MHz channels, of which 21 are considered usable for broadcasting in Iceland. Analogue MMDS broadcasting began in 1993, moving to digital in 2004.\n\nIn Brazil, the shutdown of the MMDS technology started in 2012 to release the frequency for the 2500–2600 MHz LTE-UTRAN band, which would make the service infeasible. The national shutdown was planned to be finished at the end of 2012; as of 2013, the service had already been shutdown in most cities.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, Wind Telecom started operations using MMDS technology in 2008; at that time and ever since it became a pioneer taking advantage of such implementations. The company uses the DVB standard for its digital television transmissions.\n\n\n"}

The net floor area is 36,478m, and the gross floor area 44,432m.\n\nAcquisitions under legal deposit total 18,194 monographic publications and 3,625 serial publications. There are 1,030 foreign serial titles and 4,865 foreign books. The holdings in the special collections number 11,430 items. There are 7,281 items of non-book materials, and 986 items ofelectronic materials.\n\nIn 2011 there were 19,360 registered users and 357,291 visitors to the Library, of whom 22,445 used late hours study services. In the same year there were 718,850 online visitors. For users there are 1,100 seats, with an additional 64 seats in the Reading Rooms and 150 seats in the evening hours study room. The Special Collections are provided with 8 audio booths, 7 individual and 2 group work study rooms, and there are 10 reading-and-study compartments. There is a 100-seat conference room.\n\nSome of the principal tasks of the Library are:\n\n1. the assembling and organizing of the Croatian national collection of library materials and the coordination of the acquisition of international scientific works at both the national and the University level,\n\n2. the preservation and restoration of library materials in the context of the international Preservation and Conservation programme (PAC),\n\n3. the promotion of Croatian printed and electronic publications,\n\n4. the integration of the Library’s bibliographic activities and information services into international programmes,\n\n5. the organization of the Library as the centre of the library system of the Republic of Croatia and the University of Zagreb,\n\n6. scientific research in the field of library and information sciences,\n\n7. publishing and various promotional activities and the organization of exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Collection assembles, preserves, processes and makes available the items from the richest Croatian collection of national manuscripts and old books, as well as the manuscripts and numerous rare and old books belonging to other cultures.\n\nThe Manuscripts and Old Books Collection contains a vast legacy of manuscripts – correspondence including nearly 100,000 letters and 3,670 call numbers for individual manuscripts (1,720 in Croatian, 920 in Latin, 454 in German, 230 in Italian, etc.). The Collection also includes the photographic collection containing 865 items. In total the Collection contains 9,236 items (10,295 volumes).\nValuable drawings and prints have constituted a significant part of the holdings of the National and University Library in Zagreb since the foundation of the Library four hundred years ago, while the Print Collection, as a separate organizational unit of the Library, was established in 1919. Apart from being the oldest Croatian collection of this type, the Print Collection of the National and University Library in Zagreb is also the largest print collection in Croatia. In addition to the works by many great names of the Croatian visual arts, the holdings of the Collection include works by numerous leading world artists.\n\nThe collection includes works by the 16th-century artist Andrija Medulić, architectural drawings by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach from the 18th century, and many more modern Croatian artists.\nThe Collection assembles, preserves, processes and makes available all types of maps and atlases. Special attention is given to older and more valuable cartographic items, national cartographic materials and the control of legal deposit procedures. The members of the Collection supply users with information in the field of cartography and provide professional assistance for researchers and students in the preparation and writing of their papers, articles or theses.\n\nThe Collection comprises nearly 42,000 maps, almost 1,500 atlases, and approximately 600 books in the accompanying reference library.\nThe Collection assembles, processes, archives and makes available sheet music, the rich legacy of Croatian composers as well as a large stock of sound recordings. All materials in the collection are available to the users of the National and University Library in Zagreb and they include nearly 17,000 printed music scores, 3,000 manuscript scores, 23,600 gramophone records, 5,700 cassettes, and 7,447 CDs.\n\n\nIn 1607 the Jesuit order established itself in Zagreb. In addition to founding a grammar school, the Jesuits founded a Jesuit College with an accompanying library. By 1645 the library was housed in a special hall, it had a librarian and rules were established regarding the preservation and lending of books. In 1669 the Jesuit College acquired the status of an Academy by the Charter of King Leopold I and became \"Academia Zagrabiensis\". The library and its holdings were moved into an old building of the abandoned Dominican monastery in today’s 5 St. Catherine’s Square in the Old Town of Zagreb.\n\nThe Jesuit order was disbanded in 1773. The College continued with its provisional activities until 1776, when the library became part of the Royal Zagreb Academy of Sciences (\"Regia Academia Zagrabiensis\") as an academy of law, philosophy and theology. The following year the library received a bequest containing historical material from the clergyman Adam Baltazar Krčelić, with a stipulation that this material be made available to the wider public.\n\nAs a result of legal deposit regulations introduced in 1816 bearing on the University of Pest, the library's national importance began to increase. Such legal deposit regulations were extended to the whole territory of Croatia and Slavonia in 1837. Antun Kukuljević, politician and the founder of the Croatian educational system, changed the name of the library to the Latin name, \"Nationalis Academica Bibliotheca\", highlighting the dual nature of the library’s educational and national functions, which it has jointly developed since then and symbolically preserved in its name to this day.\n\nThe Franz Josef I Royal University in Zagreb was founded in 1874, and the Academy library (\"Bibliotheca Regiae Academiae Zagrabiensis\") became part of the University and changed its name to University Library, increasing its significance and role in higher education.\n\nIn 1913 the library with its approximately 110,000 volumes moved from the building of the present-day Rector’s Office into an impressive Art Nouveau edifice located in 21 Marko Marulić Square, the first building built specifically for the purposes of the library. As it was designed to house 500,000 volumes, its premises soon become inadequate for the library’s 2,500,000 volumes – books, journals, newspapers and the particularly valuable items of the library’s special collections. A new library building, the Pantheon of the Croatian Book, was commissioned: its foundation stone was laid in 1988 and the building opened on 28 May 1995 as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of Croatia’s independence. This modern edifice was designed by Croatian architects Velimir Neidhardt, Marijan Hržić, Zvonimir Krznarić and Davor Mance.\n"}

It was launched in 2012 and by 2017 more than 200,000 researchers have joined the site, adding more than one million reviews across 25,000 journals. Publons' mission is to \"speed up science by harnessing the power of peer review\". Publons claims that by turning peer review into a measurable research output, academics can use their review and editorial record as evidence of their standing and influence in their field. Publons says its business model is based on partnering with publishers.\n\nPublons produces a verified record of a person's review and editorial activity for journals. This evidence is showcased on reviewers' online profiles and can be downloaded to include in CVs, funding and job applications, and promotion and performance evaluations.\n\nPublons also provides:\nReviewers can choose whether or not to make the content of their review open access following publication of the reviewed publication, though journals can choose to override this. Review content is shared using a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license.

He was a Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which he played a pivotal role in helping found, and United Nations Assistant Secretary General from 1994-1998. He became the Acting Secretary General of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), after his retirement from UNEP.\n\nReuben Olembo was born on November 28, 1937 in Bunyore in the then Vihiga District of Kakamega in Western Province, Kenya. He excelled in his studies at Wanakhale Primary School, and then Maseno School, both of which were mission schools. Faith played a key role in his early family life and education. His parents were both ministers in the Church of God, established in his village by American missionaries.\n\nOlembo was among the students airlifted to the US in 1959 as part of the Mboya airlifts. He attended Purdue University in Indiana and between 1961 and 1965 he was awarded his bachelor's (Biology and Chemistry), master's and doctoral degrees (genetics, with minors in biochemistry and statistics). His academic accomplishments were notable because \"he did not come from a scientific background and had no laboratory experience.\"\n\nOlembo taught at Makerere University in Uganda between 1965 and 1969, where he earned the nickname \"Prof.\" He is said to have helped many Ugandans enter the UN system through scholarships and was instrumental in the establishment of Makerere University's National Institute for Environment.\n\nOlembo moved back to Kenya to join the Department of Botany at the University of Nairobi. He was appointed chairman of the department in 1970, aged 33. He remained in that position till 1975. He was the first Kenyan to be a professor in the department and to head it. He introduced new, rigorous courses in genetics at both the undergraduate and post-graduate levels.\n\nOlembo was a strong advocate for education in Kenya and neighboring countries. He served as an examiner for the Cambridge University School Certificate, a chief examiner for the East African Examinations Council, and an external assessor for university degrees in Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania.\n\nHe wrote and was widely published on genetics, ecology and environmental policy.\n\nOlembo was a member of the African delegation to the 1972 Stockholm Conference that led to the creation of UNEP. He joined the organisation in 1974 as a Senior Programme Officer. He played key roles in strengthening a number of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAS), such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES), the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the FAO International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.\n\nHe chaired and spoke at numerous international conferences on environmental matters.\n\nOlembo was the longest serving member of the Board of Trustees of the Kenya National Parks, to which he was appointed in 1967.\n\nWhile at the University of Nairobi, Olembo helped members of parliament from Western Kenya build the Harambee Institute of Technology for Western Province, which became the Western College of Arts and Applied Sciences (WECO) and which, in 2007 became the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.\n\nOlembo served as a national government advisor on environmental affairs to the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources. He developed the blueprint for what became the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). He was then appointed a managing trustee of the Kenya National Environment Trust Fund. He joined the Board of Directors of the Kenya Seed Company in 2003, where he served until his death in March 2005 after participating in a company strategic planning retreat.\n\nPurdue University honored Olembo in 1994 with a Distinguished Alumni Award for Agriculture.

It was founded in 1831 by the Duke of Wellington, Sir Arthur Wellesley.. RUSI is an independent, non-government and non-partisan organisation registered with the UK's Charity Commission. \n\nRUSI's President is HRH the Duke of Kent and its Director is Karin von Hippel.\n\nRUSI was founded in 1831 – making it the oldest defence and security think tank in the world – at the initiative of the Duke of Wellington. Its original mission was to study naval and military science.\n\nThe Duke of Wellington spearheaded the establishment of RUSI in a letter to \"Colbourn's United Service Journal\" arguing that \"a United Service Museum\" should be formed, managed entirely by naval and military officers, and under patronage of the monarch, then King George IV, and the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. Such an institution would prove that the two professions have entered the lists of science, and are ready to contend for honours \"tam Artibus quam Armis\" – 'as much through the arts as through weapons'.\n\nSubsequently, Commander Henry Downes, Royal Navy, assembled a group with a view to forming a committee for action, to which King George's First ADC was commanded to convey \"His Majesty's gracious and high approbation of the undertaking and of the principles on which it is proposed to conduct it\", which were stated to be suitable for \"a strictly scientific and professional society, and not a club\". The death of the King delayed matters, but the Duke of Clarence expressed his readiness to become a patron so, encouraged by the powerful support of the Duke of Wellington, the First Aide-de-camp, Sir Herbert Taylor, re-submitted the project to William IV (the former Duke of Clarence), and was able to assure the committee that \"it could proceed under his Majesty's gracious auspices\".\n\nOn 25 June 1831 the committee met. The chair was taken by Major General Sir Howard Douglas, in his person a symbol of the \"United Service\": a soldier who was the leading expert on naval gunnery. The resolution that the institution be established was put by the future Field Marshal Viscount Hardinge and seconded by the future Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, the famous hydrographer. The first name adopted was the Naval and Military Museum: this was altered in 1839 to the United Service Institution, and in 1860 to the Royal United Service Institution by a royal charter of incorporation. In 2004 the name was changed to the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. Fellows of RUSI may use the five-letter post-nominal abbreviation, FRUSI.\n\nPrior to moving into its current purpose-built headquarters in 1895, RUSI began its existence in Whitehall Court, then moved to a house in what was then known as Middle Scotland Yard in 1832. Queen Victoria granted RUSI the use of the Banqueting House. It finally moved to its current location next door to the Banqueting House in 1895.\n\nRUSI is a British institution, but operates with an international perspective. It promotes the study and discussion of developments in military doctrine, defence management and defence procurement. In recent years RUSI has broadened its remit to include all issues of defence and security, including financial and organised crime, terrorism and the ideologies which foster it and the challenges which we face from other man-made or man-assisted threats and from natural disasters. The 2016-2017 Review and Annual Report are available It won \"Prospect\" magazine's Think Tank of the Year Award in 2008. In 2009, the same magazine named RUSI \"Foreign Policy Think Tank of the Year\".. In 2018, the awards shortlisted RUSI in the Economic and Financial as well as the International Affairs categories.\nRUSI has a membership consisting of military officers, diplomats and the wider policy community, numbering 1,668 individuals and 129 corporate members (see last page of the latest Review) \nRUSI currently also has fifty Associate Fellows and twelve Fellows FRUSI.\n\nRUSI members and the wider defence and security community have access to the following activities:\n\nAccording to its website , RUSI 'maintains a wide range of multidisciplinary research specialisms. It focuses on the areas of Military Sciences, International Security Studies, National Security and Resilience Studies, Nuclear Proliferation, Financial Crime and Defence, Industries and Society.' \n\nRUSI experts are often called upon to provide analysis and commentary on the leading defence and security issues of the day. In addition, RUSI.org hosts timely analysis on the defence and security issues of the day. Content is drawn from its publications and briefings from its researchers.\n\nRUSI organises a number of lectures, seminars and conferences for its membership and the wider defence and international security community. Its location in Whitehall means that is able to attract leading statesmen and policymakers.\n\nRUSI publishes a number of periodicals and books. Its flagship publication is the \"RUSI Journal\". It also publishes the \"RUSI Newsbrief\" and \"RUSI Defence Systems\".\n\nRUSI is a registered charity (No. 210639). It relies on membership subscriptions; income from conferences including sponsorship; research contracts; room hire; and donations from foundations and individuals for its income. RUSI receives no core funding from government.. Transparify gave RUSI a transparency rating in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRUSI is governed by a Council comprising Vice-Presidents, Trustees and an Advisory Council. Members serve for a three-year term.

This is driven by the foreseen lack of young scientists in all European countries. Science on Stage Europe believes that a good way to encourage schoolchildren to consider a career in science or engineering is to motivate and educate their teachers. Therefore, Science on Stage Europe provides a forum for science teachers to exchange teaching ideas and gives them access to science teaching resources.\n\nOrganised by EIROforum, a collaboration of European research organisations, the initiative Science on Stage began in 1999 as Physics on Stage (POS), with financial support from the European Commission [POS was half funded by EIROforum]. EIROforum launched the initiative to address the decreasing numbers of young physicists. The first Physics on Stage festival was at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2000. Over the course of an inspiring week, more than 500 teachers from 22 countries shared activities and projects in a fair, in workshops, in performances and in presentations showed that physics can be fun. On the back of this success, Physics on Stage 2 was arranged in 2002 at ESA in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Physics on Stage 3 followed a year later at the same location.\n\nThe members of EIROforum soon realised that the lack of young scientists was not limited to the field of physics, so the initiative was broadened to cover all sciences and renamed Science on Stage. The first Science on Stage festival took place in 2005, again at CERN in Geneva, and the second in 2007 at ESRF/ILL in Grenoble, France. The format of the Physics on Stage festivals remained and still remains unchanged. In May 2008, the financial support of the European Commission ran out. In March 2009, under the guidance of Stage on Stage Germany the 27 European\ncountries involved unanimously affirmed their wish to continue the cooperation. All participants stressed the importance of regular European festivals as the flagship of the European Science on Stage activities. Alternative funding would be sought for the festivals. In October 2008, the first of these alternatively funded Science on Stage festivals took place at Urania in Berlin, organised by Science on Stage Germany and sponsored by THINK ING., an initiative of the Federation of German Employers‘ Associations in the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industries. The second alternatively funded European Science on Stage festival took place from 16–19 April 2011 at the Ørestad Gymnasium in Copenhagen under the motto “Science Teaching: Winning Hearts and Minds”. It was funded by the Danish Ministry of Education and organised by Danish Science Communication and the Science on Stage Europe office. The next Science on Stage festival will take place from 25–28 April 2013 in Slubice and Frankfurt/Oder at the German-Polish border. For the first time, the festival will be organised by two countries, represented by the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and Science on Stage Germany, under the motto “Crossing Borders in Science Teaching”. 350 science teachers from across Europe will present their most innovative teaching ideas, workshops and performances. Participants are chosen at competitive national events or processes in each country involved.\n\nInitially launched as an initiative in 2008, Science on Stage Europe became an officially registered non-profit association in January 2012, with headquarters in Berlin and recognised by German law.\n\nScience on Stage Europe is organised in a bottom-up structure. The basis is the Science on Stage community in the participating countries. Each country has a national steering committee (NSC). The NSCs get together in the Science on Stage assembly and elect the executive board. The board is supported by invited experts and by the Science on Stage Europe office in Berlin. The Science on Stage international festivals take place every two years, as the culmination of all the national Science on Stage activities. The festivals are organised jointly by a European festival programme committee and a national organising committee.\n\n\n\n"}

The Loft is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive independent literary centers, and offers a variety of writing classes, conferences, grants, readings, writers' studios and other services to both established and emerging writers.\n\nEach year the Loft hosts more than 400 writers and performers that draw more than 12,000 people, and collaborates with at least 30 local and national organizations. The Loft additionally claims to have more than 170,000 unique visitors through digital resources and online writing classes.\n\nIncorporated in 1975, the Loft started in a bookstore when a group of writers decided to offer classes and readings in the upstairs loft. Following a series of successful events held at Rusoff & Co. Book Dealers in Dinkytown, Minnesota, bookstore owner Marly Rusoff and writers Jim Moore, Patricia Hampl, Phebe Hanson, and Michael Dennis Browne formed a ‘poets’ club’ with support from a fundraising party emceed by Garrison Keillor. This ‘poets’ club’ eventually became known as ‘The Loft,’ and in 1975 filed for nonprofit status and received a grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board to sponsor several writing workshops. Over the next two years, the Loft hosted a number of benefit readings that featured poets such as Allen Ginsberg, Robert Bly, and Etheridge Knight.\n\nOver the years, the Loft grew organically as a community-based nonprofit to become one of the nation’s leading independent literary centers. With support from the Jerome Foundation the Loft launched the Mentor Series in 1980, bringing together nationally prominent authors with promising local writers. The first year featured New York Times bestselling author Marge Piercy and Pulitzer Prize-winning poets Philip Levine and Galway Kinnell. Other programs launched in the organization’s first decade include the McKnight Artist Fellowship in Creative Writing (1982), The Loft Scholarship Fund (1984), and a radio program in collaboration with Minnesota Public Radio (1985). In 1990, Loft membership passed the 2,000 mark, and in 1996 the Loft awarded more than $160,000 in grants to writers.\n\nThe Loft initiated the Amnesty Action Project in 1988, which coordinated letter-writing campaigns on behalf of imprisoned writers as identified by Amnesty International. Prominent Malawian poet Jack Mapanje was the first, followed by political prisoners Jaki Seroke, Zwelakhe Sisulu, Nguyễn Chí Thiện, Dai Qing, Lee San-ha, and Bligesu Erenus. The following year, WCCO anchor Dave Moore read from Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses at the Loft in protest of Ayatollah Khomeini’s sentence of death on Rushdie. The reading was also a response from the Twin Cities Artistic Community Ad Hoc Committee in Protest of Censorship and Intimidation. In 1993, the Loft hosted a week-long series of events celebrating freedom of expression that coincided with National Banned Books Week. The events included a dialogue with Kathy Acker, Amiri Baraka, and Nat Hentoff; a reading and forum with Lorrie Moore and Mona Simpson; free speech read-ins; and performance art with J. Otis Powell and Patrick Scully at the Rogue Nightclub.\n\nIn 1999, the Loft joined forces with Minnesota Center for Book Arts and publisher Milkweed Editions to build the nonprofit literary and book arts center Open Book, which opened in May 2000 and is the current home of the Loft. This move was followed by the launch of the Loft Equilibrium Spoken Word Series in 2002, which was recognized with the Minnesota Nonprofit Anti-Racism Initiative Award. In 2004, the Loft hosted a reading by former senator and anti-war presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, and collaborated with the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and Minnesota International Center to host a discussion and book signing by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\n\nIn 2010, the Loft celebrated its 35th anniversary with the publication release of \"Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop\" and the launch of its online education program.\n\nThe Loft now has an annual budget of over $2.4 million, and through contracts, awards, and grants pays writers more than $400,000 each year. The Loft annually serves thousands of writers by offering hundreds of classes, numerous fellowships, readings from award-winning authors, and literary resources such as a small library, writing studios, and a book club room. In 2013, the Loft hired 227 writers to teach 323 classes and 5 conferences. In their evaluations, 96% of students reported that their class helped them improve their writing, 91% identified their next steps as a writer, and 94% would recommend their class to others.\n\nJocelyn Hale has been Executive Director since 2007, when she replaced long-time leader Linda Myers.\n\n\n\n\nThousands of writers both established and emerging have read, taught, mentored, and judged contests at the Loft since 1975. Their ranks include Margaret Atwood, Charles Baxter, Robert Bly, Billy Collins, Bernard Cooper, Toi Derricotte, Junot Diaz, Kate DiCamillo, Rita Dove, Louise Erdrich, Vince Flynn, Nikki Giovanni, Patricia Hampl, John Irving, Garrison Keillor, Stanley Kunitz, Mary Oliver, Michael Ondaatje, Tracy K.

The total cost of college is called the cost of attendance (or, informally, the \"sticker price\") and, in addition to tuition, can include room and board and fees for facilities such as books, transportation, or commuting provided by the college.\n\nFrench tuition fees are capped based on the level of education pursued, from 183 Euros per year for undergraduate up to 388 for doctorates. Some public universities have autonomous status, meaning that they can charge much higher tuition, and all private universities charge tuition.\n\nIn the German Education system almost all universities and most universities of applied sciences are funded by the state and do not charge tuition fees. In exceptional cases universities may offer courses for professionals (e.g. executive MBA programmes) which may require tuition payment. Some of the local governments have recently decided that students from non-EU countries can be charged, although ERASMUS students, students from developing countries and other special groups are exempt. In addition there are private institutions of higher education which are run on a tuition-based model. \n\nIn Greece there are no tuition fees as Bachelor-level higher education and Master-level post-graduate education is provided for free to all Hellene (Greek) citizens as a benefit of citizenship paid by taxes. However, universities accept very few students who have excelled at high school, with the selection being done through the Panhellenic Examinations, a system of state-administered examinations in which the chance of failure is too high and thus only a small percentage of students is able to pass and there is a limit to the number of students that can be accepted each year. Furthermore, it is difficult for mature students to be accepted at universities. Doctorate-level higher education is often also provided for free, but some universities may charge some fees for PhD degrees. Students who weren't able to pass the Panhellenic Examinations in a few attempts are effectively banned for life from the Greek university system and those who wish to have a higher education must resort to registering at private universities (called colleges, κολέγια) which charge tuition fees or emigrate to other countries in order to get an education. Sometimes it may happen that a student was academically excellent in school but failed to get a good \"ethics performance mark\" or was disqualified from entering the Panhellenic Examinations because of non-academic factors, since the Greek educational system also marks the student's \"ethics performance\" (διαλογή, dialogi) rather than only his or her academic performance: for example, an unruly student or a student caught cheating or drinking may receive a disqualifying mark in his or her \"ethics performance\" which can disqualify the student from entering university (or in extreme cases from continuing in the high school) even if the student has excellent academic skills.\n\nTuition is charged at different rates from one type of institution to the next. Net tuition indices mark an increase in the “relative real burden” for payments at various types of institutions for higher education; in the period between 1980 and 1995, for example, this burden increased by approximately 80 percent for students at public universities and by 148 percent for students at private universities.\n\nMost students or their families who pay for tuition and other education costs don't have enough savings to pay in full while they are in school. Some students must work or borrow money to afford an education. In the United States, student financial aid is available to defray the cost of a post-secondary education: “Financial aid is typically thought to exert the most influence in [attendance], when admitted students consider whether to enroll in a particular institution.” It is often the case that the lower the cost of the school, the more likely a student is to attend.\n\nDeveloped countries have adopted a dual scheme for education: while basic (i.e. high-school) education is supported by taxes rather than tuition, higher education usually requires tuition payments or fees.\n\nPeople may purchase tuition insurance to protect themselves from fees related to involuntary withdrawal (illness, death of a parent or guardian, etc.)\n\nIn medieval Europe, universities were mainly institutions of the Catholic Church. As they mainly trained clergy, most of these universities did not have any need to exact fees from the students with one notable exception: during the 12th century, while under the supervision of Pierre le Mangeur, the University of Paris began collecting two sous weekly in tuition. \n\nLater, the main duty of universities in most Protestant countries was the training of future civil servants. Again, it was not in the interest of the state to charge tuition fees, as this would have decreased the quality of civil servants. On the other hand, the number of students from the lower classes was usually kept in check by the expenses of living during the years of study, although as early as the mid-19th century there were calls for limiting the university entrance by middle-class persons. A typical family, however, could not afford educating a child or young adult, even if the education itself was free. A similar situation exists today in many Third World countries, where the expenses of \"free\" schooling (food, books, school uniform, etc.) prevent some children from attending any school.\n\nAfter World War II the tuition systems of all of today's advanced democracies still were highly similar: Education institutions in all countries charged no or only very low tuition fees. It was not before the 1950s that the countries' education systems developed in different directions. Some countries, especially the Anglo-Saxon countries (for example the United States) but also Asian countries such as Japan, introduced considerable tuition payments already in the early post-war period. Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and continental Europe, in contrast remained tuition-free. These developments were unrelated to the massive educational expansion that took place at the same time.\n\nSince the early 1970s, the average cost of tuition has steadily outpaced the growth of the average American household. This trend continued particularly under President Reagan's higher education policies in the 1980s. Likewise, there has been a steady decrease in federal funding for grants and a rise in the interest rates of most major student loans, leaving many students struggling to pay debt for years after graduation.\n\nThe Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate. It would allow the estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented students in the United States to gain in-state tuition as well as a path towards American citizenship. The Act would apply only to those students with tangible proof of residence in the United States before the age of 18. This Act has stirred debate in numerous groups, including institutions, families, and the Senate itself.\n\nAs of March 2013, undocumented students in most States were required to pay the higher out-of-state students' tuition charged at public universities, often between $20,000 and $35,000 at a local public university. In addition, these students were denied federal assistance as they lacked valid Social Security numbers. Because such students often come from comparatively poor families, the costs were too high to allow many undocumented students to seek university education in the United States.\n\n"}

It is located in the Kiratpur Raja Ram village of Vaishali district. Soon after its establishment in 1997, the college became well-known for producing the state-level toppers in the Intermediate exams. In 2014, allegations of irregularities surfaced against the college, with the chairman of Bihar School Examination Board being suspected of aiding the college in its \"topper scam\". In 2016, the students of VR College topped both science and arts streams, but were exposed as cheaters after a video of them failing to answer basic questions went viral. Subsequently, the college was de-recognized and the BSEB chairman was forced to resign.\n\nThe college was established in 1997-98. Its director and principal is Amit Kumar alias Bachcha Rai, a local political leader. The college is named after his grandfather. The family also runs other colleges, including four Intermediate colleges and a B.Ed. college. Rai is considered close to the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav. During the 2015 Assembly elections, he spent one month canvassing for Yadav's son Tej Pratap. His father Rajdeo Rai had also unsuccessfully fought a Legislative Council election as an RJD candidate.\n\nSoon after its establishment, VR college became famous for its high success rate in Class XII exams. In 2014, 7 out of the Bihar's 10 toppers were from this college. In 2015, Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalini was the state topper in the science stream. Because of its \"stellar record\" the college attracted students from far-off districts.\n\nSince 2014, the college faced allegations of irregularities. Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh, the chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) was suspected of favouring the college. Once a principal of the Patna College, Singh was promoted to BSEB Chairman thanks to the state's chief minister Nitish Kumar. During 2010-2015, his wife Usha Singh was an MLA from Hilsa, which is located in Nitish Kumar's home district, Nalanda; she was a member of Nitish Kumar's political party, the Janata Dal (United).\n\nSingh personally decided that G A Inter College in Hajipur would be the examination centre for the students of the VR College. He also decided that the Balak High School in Patna would be the evaluation centre for the answer sheets of the college's students. He personally visited these two places a number of times. When allegations of irregularities surfaced, he formed a judicial committee for investigation, but did not inform the state's education department.\n\nOn 28 May 2016, the BSEB publicly declared the intermediate results, however it released its official merit list for 10 May 2016 itself but due to some issues, it made the results public to a later date. VR College students emerged as toppers in both arts and science streams in Class XII exams. Ruby Rai topped arts stream with 89% marks, while Saurabh Shresth topped science stream with 97% marks. Rahul Kumar, another science student of VR College, obtained the third highest marks in the state. Actually, Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalinee Roy had topped the science stream: she had obtained 4 marks more than Saurabh Shresth. However, the corrupt Board officials did not release her name to avoid a controversy: they intended to release her name later, in a clandestine manner. Earlier in 2014, Shalinee had topped the Class X exams, scoring 97.2% marks. Around 1,323,000 students had appeared for the exams: no other student had scored more than 90% marks.\n\nWhen interviewed by the Aaj Tak TV channel, Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shresth were unable to answer basic questions. The arts topper Ruby Rai named \"prodikal science\" (actually political science) as one of the subjects she had studied. When asked what this subject dealt with, she answered that it was about cooking. She stated that the exam was of 600 marks, while it was actually of only 500 marks. The science topper Saurabh Shresth could not describe the link between water and HO (the chemical formula for water). He also wrongly named aluminium was the most reactive element.\n\nAfter the video of their interviews went viral, the BSEB asked them and other toppers to appear before a team of experts for a test. Saurabh Shresth and Rahul Kumar of VR College failed in this test. Ruby Rai did not appear for the test, citing poor health. The Board subsequently de-recognized VR College, and ordered an inquiry into the irregularities. Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalinee, who actually topped the science stream, but whose name was withheld from the official merit list, was not invited for the re-test.\n\nOn 8 June 2016, the BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh resigned after being served a show-cause notice by the Bihar state's education department. On 25 June, Ruby Rai appeared before BSEB team for re-evaluation, and failed to answer a single question correctly. She was subsequently arrested.\n"}
