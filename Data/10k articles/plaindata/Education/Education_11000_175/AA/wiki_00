Dr. King's \"Twelve Essentials\" (King, 1930) for the raising of healthy infants included:air and sunshine, water, food, clothing, bathing, muscular exercise and sensory stimulation, warmth, regularity, cleanliness, mothering, management, and rest and sleep. Dr. King's \"Twelve Essentials\" were thought to be revolutionary at the time.\n\nIn 1918, Dr. King campaigned on the need for the pre-parenting for parenting and the value of breast-feeding. Dr. King was invited to establish a system of Mothercraft. The underlying message of his program and of the Mothercraft manual was: \"Build healthy babies rather than patch sick ones\". The Mothercraft system became known as the Mothercraft Movement as it spread to all corners of the British empire, including Australia, England, India, Jamaica, New Zealand, Scotland, and South Africa.\n\nIn 1925, His Majesty King George V knighted Dr. King. Over the years, the Royal Family provided support, interest, and encouragement in the activities and accomplishments of Mothercraft.\n\nIn 1931, Barbara Mackenzie, a registered nurse and midwife trained in New Zealand came to Canada and married Irving Robertson, then Chairman of the Board of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson established the Canadian Mothercraft Society. Mrs. Robertson championed the cause of mid-wifery, founded the Mothercraft Well-Baby Nursing Training program, and operated the Mothercraft maternity hospital, and maintained a community registry of Well-Baby Nurses. Well-Baby Nurses aided with breastfeeding, getting infants on schedules, and provided at home child care support. The registry of Well-Baby Nurses was maintained until 1990.\n\nThe work of the Canadian Mothercraft Societyalso attracted the attention of Britain's Royal Family. In 1931, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York, became the Honorary Patroness of the Canadian Mothercraft Society.\n\nIn these early days, the Canadian Mothercraft Society supported infants awaiting adoption with the Catholic Children's Aid Society and provided hospice for infants who were very ill. It was also a time prior to the establishment of Canadian public health systems. To support local efforts at community-based public health, Mothercraft opened advice rooms so that families could bring young children for medical and nutritional advice. Mothercraft also pioneered prenatal classes that focused on infant well-being and mental health.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mothercraft's medical focus broadened to include early learning and care and, in 1965, the Canadian Mothercraft Society opened one of the first infant child care centres in Toronto, positioning Mothercraft as a leader in infant care and education... a specialization that holds true in 2007.\n\nIn 1967, Mothercraft joined with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and conducted research with Dr. William Fowler to determine the effects of quality child care on disadvantaged children. The findings from Dr. Fowler's research provided the foundation for Mothercraft's curriculum in Early Childhood Education. To learn more about the work of Dr. Fowler and Mothercraft, link to the media clip of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) found in External Links. In 1979, Mothercraft again joined research forces with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education studying early intervention strategies for infant at risk and their families with Dr. Dorothy Shipe. The findings from this research provided a foundation for Mothercraft's early intervention programs.\n\nIn 2011, The Canadian Mothercraft Society departments include:\n\n\n\n"}

It was approximately 20 miles north of Ponca City, Oklahoma and seven miles north of Newkirk, Oklahoma, near the Kansas border. The name \"Chilocco\" is apparently derived from a Muscogee word meaning \"big deer\" or horse. In 1912 the Oklahoma Supreme Court heard a case over an election dispute involving whisky and whether the Chilocco reservation was part of Kay County and Oklahoma or \"Indian Territory\". The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school land was not an Indian Reservation, that the school was an off-reservation entity, and that the word reservation had various meanings and the area was not reserved as Indian territory.\n\nThe U.S. Congress in 1882 authorized the creation of five non-reservation boarding schools. Chilocco was one of the five which also included Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas, Chemawa Indian School in Oregon, and Fort Simcoe in Washington. Major James M. Haworth, first Superintendent of Indian Schools, selected a site for the school along Chilocco Creek and the school was established according to an executive order signed by president James Garfield. Chilocco was located in the Cherokee Outlet or Cherokee Strip and the Cherokee provided 8,640 acres (35 km2) of land to help Chilocco fulfill its mandate for agricultural education.\n\nChilocco provided academic and vocational education to American Indian students from all tribes in the United States. The objective of the school was to integrate and assimilate American Indians into the mainstream of American life. Until the 1930s, the school relied on a highly structured and strict military regime. \n\nStudents \"remember twenty-two bugle calls a day, Government-issue uniforms, scanty meals, inadequate health care, and a paucity of individual attention.\" The school was \"home and haven to some, reformatory and prison to others.\" Instruction focused mostly on vocational training rather than academic subjects and students were required to perform manual and domestic labor known as \"actual work.\" Students were required to attend Christian religious services once a week.\n\nA 1928 report critical of the Indian boarding schools led to reforms in the 1930s. \"Boys and girls could sit together in the dining rooms, more attention was invested in academic work, and drudgery work devoted to school upkeep was cut back.\" The curriculum at the school focused on agricultural trades, including horseshoeing and blacksmithing, but also included building trades, printing, shoe repair, tailoring, leather work, and in later years plumbing, electrical work, welding, auto mechanics, food services and office education.\n\nThe school opened in 1884 with 150 students from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Wichita, Comanche, and Pawnee tribes. In 1894 the first graduating class consisted of 15 students. As the school expanded, additional structures were added in 1893, 1899, 1903, 1909, 1923, 1931 and 1932. In the 1960s, several of the older buildings were demolished to make room for a new dormitory and machine shop. The school's facilities at one time included more than 100 buildings, including a dining hall and hospital. Buildings were constructed from distinctive locally quarried yellow limestone. Students worked on the \"rockpile\" breaking large boulders into construction material.\n\nEnrollment declined during the 1920s and the elementary school was closed, but with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 enrollment increased because of growing poverty among Indians. As one graduate said, \"It wasn't a matter of enjoying [Chilocco], it meant we were educated, clothed, fed, and had a roof over our head.\" In 1949 a special program for Navajo youth began. Enrollment at Chilocco peaked at about 1,300 in the 1950s. Thereafter, enrollment declined as many Indians had access to public schools and a boarding school was no longer essential to their education. In the 1970s, activists from American Indian organizations criticized abuses and, in 1972, the National Indian Youth Council staged a sit-in at the school. By the late 1970s only about 100 students still lived at the school.\n\nThe Chilocco School closed in June 1980 when the U.S. Congress ceased funding. In the school's 1980 yearbook, Superintendent C. C. Tillman wrote, \"Chilocco is another in a long list of broken promises.\" During its history nearly 18,000 students from 126 Indian tribes attended Chilocco. Chilocco granted high school diplomas to 5,542 students. Graduates included 688 Cherokee, 573 Choctaw, 545 Navajo, and 452 Creek divided between 2,741 females and 2,801 males.\n\nAfter closure, the school's land was granted to five local tribes as the Chilocco Development Authority; the Kaw Nation (.10 mineral interest), the Otoe-Missouria Tribe (.10 mineral interest), the Pawnee Nation (.10 mineral interest), the Ponca Nation (.10 mineral interest), and the Tonkawa Tribe (.10 mineral interest). The Cherokee Nation holds a .50 mineral interest. Between 1989 and 2001, the property was leased to Narconon, which operated a substance abuse rehabilitation center at the site. In 2011, Chilocco was closed to the public and used as a training and practice facility for federal law enforcement personnel.\n\nIn October 2016, the Cherokees announced that they were leasing to PNE Wind more than 4,000 acres of Chilocco land for a wind energy project.\n\nIn November 2017, The Department of Homeland Security released a statement warning the residents they are preparing in the event of a biological attack. According to a 58-page document, chemicals will be released at Chilocco Indian School in Newkirk. \nIn January/February and again in June/July 2018, particles will be released onto buildings of the Chilocco campus. It is to determine how well biological agents will penetrate into single and multi-family homes. The department claims these chemicals are nontoxic and nonhazardous; however, personnel will wear suits, masks, gloves and respirators when in the zone.\n\n\n"}

As is common with diplomas in general, diplomas in journalism are often more practical or applied than a course leading to a bachelor's or master's degree in journalism. Some universities offer postgraduate Diplomas of Journalism.\n\nHistorically, the emergence of journalism diplomas reflected the somewhat condescending view of journalism education which emerged in Britain and British Commonwealth countries, unlike the United States. Briggs and Burke point out that, despite the emergence of university degree programs in the United States from the late 19th century, British universities were uninterested in formal journalism education, and entered the field only at sub-degree level: \"between 1919 and 1939 the only University Diploma for Journalism in Britain was offered at London University\". In the 1920s and 1930s in Australia, four universities started journalism diploma courses as sub-degree programs, but none of the courses survived in this form. (They have since emerged as degree courses.) \n\nMore recently, there has been debate about comparisons between diploma and degree programs in journalism, with advocates of diplomas arguing that the shorter courses, with their lesser emphasis on theory, are often more relevant to industry needs. Degree courses, however, offer deeper theoretical exposure and greater analysis of ethical and legal issues.\n\nIn New Zealand, the media industry has developed a national diploma of journalism, establishing a curriculum which is followed by accredited training institutions, including universities and colleges. Britain National Council for the Training of Journalists offers certificate courses and accredits colleges and universities offering diplomas and degrees in journalism.\n\nAnother development has been the specialist diploma in a particular field of journalism, such as sports journalism, science journalism or business journalism, generally taught at postgraduate level.\n\nEnglish-language institutions offering the Diploma of Journalism are mainly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Commonwealth countries. \n\nExamples of journalism diploma courses are:\n\n\n"}

Le Fauconnier was seen as one of the leading figures among the Montparnasse Cubists. At the 1911 Salon des Indépendants Le Fauconnier and colleagues Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay caused a scandal with their Cubist paintings. He was in contacts with many European avant-garde artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, writing a theoretical text for the catalogue of the Neue Künstlervereinigung in Munich, of which he became a member. His paintings were exhibited in Moscow reproduced as examples of the latest art in \"Der Blaue Reiter Almanach\" (\"The Blue Rider Almanac\").\n\nIn 1901 Henri Le Fauconnier moved from northern France to Paris, where he studied law, then attended painting classes in the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens, then in the Academie Julian. He changed his from Fauconnier to \"Le\" Fauconnier and exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1904 and 1905, implementing bold colors in line with Henri Matisse. He moved to Brittany in 1907 and painted the rocky landscapes of Ploumanac'h in a proto-Cubist style characterized by chastened tones of brown and greens with thick outlines delimiting the simplified forms.\nHe explored a personal style and put it into practice; painting nudes or portraits (such as that of the poet Pierre Jean Jouve in 1909 (Musée National d'Art Moderne). Under the influence of Paul Cézanne he developed his own form of Cubism. Back in Paris, he mingles with the artistic and literary gathered around Paul Fort at the Closerie des Lilas in Montparnasse.\n\nAt the 1909 Salon d’Automne Le Fauconnier exhibited alongside Constantin Brâncuși, Jean Metzinger and Fernand Léger.\n\nLouis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, made a passing and inaccurate reference to Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Fernand Léger, as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\"\n\nMetzinger had written in 1910 of 'mobile perspective' as an interpretation of what would soon become known as \"Cubism\" with respect to Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier.\n\nAt the invitation of Wassily Kandinsky, Le Fauconnier published a theoretical text in the catalog of the Neue Künstlervereinigung (Munich, 1910). He opened his Rue Visconti studio in Paris to artists eager like him to apply the lessons of Cézanne.

Le Fauconnier exhibited his vast \"Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours\" (\"Mountaineers Attacked by Bears\") at the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (Paris).\n\nFebruary 1912 Henri Le Fauconnier was appointed to succeed Jacques-Émile Blanche as \"chef d'atelier\" of the avant-garde school of art Académie de La Palette. Le Fauconnier commissioned Jean Metzinger and André Dunoyer de Segonzac as full-time instructors for the morning sessions; Eugeniusz Żak (Eugène Zak) and took over in the afternoon.\n\nIn 1912, Le Fauconnier participated in the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain, at Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona, with Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp, Juan Gris, Marie Laurencin, and August Agero.\n\nLe Fauconnier was a contributing member of the Section d'Or (Puteaux Group).\n\nAt the outset of World War I Le Fauconnier moved to the Netherlands where he stayed for six years. His work at this time combined Cubism and Expressionism, which generated considerable success and influence in the Netherlands. He returned to France in 1920 where his paintings became more realistic.\n\nHe died of a heart attack in Paris (1946).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11252664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11252664", "title": "High Mowing School", "text": "High Mowing School\n\nHigh Mowing School is an independent private, co-educational, day and boarding school, located in Wilton, New Hampshire, in the United States. High Mowing is the oldest Waldorf high school in Canada or the United States, and is the only Waldorf boarding school in the United States. It is a high school (grades 9 through 12). It was founded in 1942.\n\nNestled in the Monadnock Region of southern New Hampshire, the school's campus was once the family home of its founder, Beulah Hepburn Emmet, a teacher who was displeased with the politics in the public school in Connecticut in which she taught. Both the school and its name are rooted in its hilltop farm location. Inspired by the writings and educational theories of Rudolf Steiner, Mrs. Emmet opened the school in 1942. It is the first Waldorf high school to have been founded in North America. Since that time, the casual comfort of the old farm site has welcomed teenagers from around the globe. Students experience the Waldorf curriculum, as they live and work in close proximity to their teachers and classmates. High Mowing is the only Waldorf high school on the continent to offer a boarding program as well as a day school.\n\nThe name, \"High Mowing\", has its roots in New England's colonial past. The practice of cutting or mowing hayfields to feed farm animals was a long-standing tradition there. According to European custom, these hayfields were often called \"mowings\" by the early settlers. A \"high mowing\" referred to a hilltop field, regarded as a perfect name for a school with high ambitions for its students. It was also believed to be an ideal setting for young adults to grow intellectually, artistically and socially, while living and learning with students from the region and around the world.\n\nA liberal arts curriculum meant to promote \"engaged and active learning\" forms the basis of High Mowing's academics. Each school day begins, for each grade, with \"Main Lesson Block\" – an integrative hour and 45 minute class that runs for between three and four weeks. Subjects for block classes encompass history, literature, drama, science, and mathematics. Students create their own \"Block Book\" for each class of the work they create during their study of the block material. Approximately one third of blocks are devoted to the sciences and one third to historical subjects. Others focus on drama, literature, or math. Examples of blocks include World Religions, Russian Literature, Government, Economics, Geology, Zoology & Evolution, Biochemistry, Atomic Theory, Surveying & Trigonometry, Dante, Greek Drama, Permutations and Combinations, Thermodynamics, History Through Art, and History through Architecture.\n\nBlock classes are followed by track classes, typically four each day. These include English, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, History, World Languages, and Studio and Performing Arts. Many of these are required courses for underclassmen and are taken in sequence beginning with the introductory course. Four years of track classes are required in the subjects Language Arts, Natural Sciences, and Studio & Performing Arts, three years in Mathematics and Physical Education, and two in World Language and History. Electives are courses freely chosen by students and are more common to upperclassmen who have completed core requirements. Examples of electives include Naturalist, Great Novels, French, Spanish, and German, Philosophy, Biology, Physics, Filmmaking and Digital Arts, Eurythmy, Drawing and Painting, Woodwork, and Pottery.\n\nSpecial programs include: naturalist, fine and applied arts, apprenticeship pottery program, farm and garden program, and an annual, immersive, interest-based two week \"Projects Block.\" The Waldorf curriculum for each grade is developmentally-based, focusing on the central question that students typically encounter at that age. High Mowing is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America.\n\nThe demographic breakdown of the 108 students enrolled for 2013–14 was:\n\n\nChapel, held on Sunday nights on campus, was originally a weekly spiritual/religious event begun by the school's founder, Mrs. Emmet. It now typically occurs less frequently and is designed to allow students and faculty to \"reflect on the changing world and our responsibilities to it.\" Members of the broader community such as parents and alumni, as well as faculty and students, are invited to give talks at Chapel. Boarding students are required to attend Chapel while it is optional for day students.\n\nStudents returning from Thanksgiving Break attend school on Sunday afternoon to commemorate the beginning of the holiday season. Among other activities, they gather pine branches and laurels from the surrounding woods to make wreaths and other decorations. A large Christmas tree is brought into the main room of the main building on campus. Afterward, the Advent Chapel is held.\n\nAt the caroling chapel, students and faculty sing Christmas carols while the tree is decorated.\n\nThe annual depiction of the story of the birth of Jesus is a theatrical and musical event originally designed by Mrs. Emmet. It involves Mary and Joseph, the angel Gabriel, numerous other angels, a host of shepherds, and the Three Kings. A sizable percentage of the student body participates in the short play, which is followed by the Snow Goose Party, an annual students-only event.\n\nThis event has been held every year since the school's founding on the night before Winter Break. It is preceded by an all-school holiday dinner, and semi-formal dress is appreciated. The festival has a number of built-in traditions including a skit by the \"fools\", a movement-based rendition of the carol \"A Partridge in a Pear Tree\" by seniors, the reading of a Christmas story from the Bible in as many languages as are spoken in the school community, the Yule Log, wassailing, and the presentation of the Christmas book, a compilation of artwork (generally holiday-themed) made of the contributions of all students.\n\nMay Day takes place in the spring and is meant to celebrate the end of winter and the new season. The event is open to the public and involves a number of events and activities. These include a pottery sale, musical performances, cake walks, games and other entertainment for children, a grease pole with a twenty dollar bill at the top, a cow plop competition (in which the winner is the one onto whose pre-purchased field space an ushered-in cow first excretes fecal matter), and the Maypole Dance. The Maypole is a tall wooden pole buried in the ground on the center green-space and is a metaphor for the fertility of spring. Students hold colored bands originating at the top of the pole and dance around each other on the ground, creating a weave pattern of the fabric on the pole. Another tradition, the May Day Play, is a skit put on by students and faculty. Initially Queen and King Winter (played by faculty members) attempt to proclaim the predominance of winter over spring, backing up their assertions by tossing ice and icicles into the crowd. Eventually the Spring Fairy enters and proclaims that spring is nigh and that the representatives of Winter should be gone. At one point the audience is asked which they would prefer, Winter or Spring, at which point (most) everyone cheers for \"Spring\". The Spring Fairy typically sprinkles flower petals and other plant materials on audience members as well as Queen and King Winter. They are eventually \"driven off\" and the Queen and King of Spring (played by students) are crowned to commemorate the season.\n\nHigh Mowing considers regular physical activity essential to the well-being of its students. Every student participates in Morning Activity before Main Lesson Block, which changes with the block. Activities include Ultimate (frisbee), yoga, dance, walking, and games. Afternoon activities include both team sports and other activities. High Mowing is a member of NEPSAC District Two and competes with other New England schools with Men's/Women's Soccer in the fall, Men's/Women's Basketball in the winter, and Men's Baseball and Women's Lacrosse in the spring. Other afternoon activities may include, depending on the year and season, cross-country running, skiing, and hiking. Physical education requirements fulfilled by participation in afternoon activities are necessary to graduate from High Mowing.\n\n\nThe first NOFA (Northeast Organic Farming) Summer Conference was held at the school in 1975.\n\n\n"}

The term has come to be used specifically for graphic design for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of data visualization and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.\n\nInformation design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.\n\nThe term 'information design' emerged as a multidisciplinary area of study in the 1970s. Some graphic designers started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the \"Information Design Journal\" in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and Information Design Association (IDA) in 1991.\nIn 1982, Edward Tufte produced a book on information design called \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\".\nThe term information graphics tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.\n\nIn technical communication, information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.\nSimilar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing web sites, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.\nIn computer science and information technology, 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) information architecture, the design of information systems, databases, or data structures. This sense includes data modeling and process analysis.\n\nInformation design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:\n\nThe Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility. Edward Tufte wrote in 1983 that: \"It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.\"\n\nInformation design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills). The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).\n\nGovernments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the Truth in Lending Act in the USA, which introduced the Schumer box (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).\n\nProfessor Edward Tufte explained that users of information displays are executing particular \"analytical tasks\" such as making comparisons or determining causality. The \"design principle\" of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.\n\nSimplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more\ninformation means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. \n\n\n"}

The Institute was founded by the University of London to support and provide academic research, postgraduate teaching, computer services and network services. It was founded as the University of London's Computer Unit at some point in the 1950s, changed its name to the Institute of Computer Science in the 1960s, and dissolved in 1974.\n\nThe exact date of foundation remains to be established, but the Institute appears to have already existed by the 1950s. Richard Buckingham was Director, first of the Computer Unit and later of the Institute of Computer Science, from 1957 to 1973.\n\nThe name of Institute had been given by 1962, when John Buxton became one of its lecturers. It was dissolved in 1974 and its Director moved to Birkbeck College. Some of the material in this description of the institute is derived from a history of the School of Computer Science & Information System at that college\n\nThe Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science of the Institute was one of the first courses in the subject. Barnett also ran informal courses, at the Institute and at the London College of Printing, to explain computer typesetting to officials of the trade unions concerned with the printing industry.\n\nA number of distinguished software and hardware engineers and scientists taught and supervised the M.Sc. and Ph.D degrees awarded by the Institute (see Staff above). Prominent graduates of the Institute include –\nMichael Newman, Professor of Information Systems, Manchester Business School. Nick Fiddian, Professor and Head of Department of Computer Science, Cardiff University, and Gautam Mitra, OptiRisk Systems Ltd, Professor of Computational Optimisation, Brunel University.\n\nThe Institute provided early mainframe computer services on an Atlas computer, as the University of London Atlas Computing Service.

He attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and was active in the school's Dramatic Society.\n\nHe attended the Feagin School of Dramatic Art and took part in the New York Federal Theatre Project. In the mid-1930s, he acted with the Clare Tree Major Children's Theater of New York. When Corey began making films, his agent suggested that he change his name from Arthur Zwerling, and he did so.\n\nHe worked with Jules Dassin, Elia Kazan, John Randolph and other politically liberal theatrical personalities. Although he attended some meetings of the Communist Party, Corey never joined. A World War II veteran, Corey served in the United States Navy. His memoir, \"Improvising Out Loud: My Life Teaching Hollywood How To Act\" which he wrote with his daughter, Emily Corey, is published by the University Press of Kentucky. His longtime friend and former student, Leonard Nimoy, wrote the foreword for the book. \n\nCorey moved to Hollywood in 1940 and became a highly respected character actor. One of his film roles was in \"Superman and the Mole Men\" (1951), which was later edited to a two-part episode of the television series \"The Adventures of Superman\", retitled \"The Unknown People\". His portrayal of a xenophobic vigilante coincidentally reflected what was about to happen to him. Prior to that, Corey appeared in Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, (1943) as one of the men who discover the body of the vagrant Freddy Jolly.\n\nCorey's career was halted in the early 1950s, when he was summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Corey refused to give names of alleged Communists and subversives in the entertainment industry and went so far as to ridicule the panel by offering critiques of the testimony of the previous witnesses. This behavior led to his being blacklisted for 12 years. \"Most of us were retired Reds. We had left it, at least I had, years before,\" Corey told Patrick McGilligan, the co-author of \"Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist\" (), who also teaches film at Marquette University. \"The only issue was, did you want to just give them their token names so you could continue your career, or not? I had no impulse to defend a political point of view that no longer interested me particularly ... They just wanted two new names so they could hand out more subpoenas.\"\n\nDuring his blacklisting Corey drew upon his experience in various actors' workshops (including the Actors' Lab, which he helped establish) by seeking work as an acting teacher. He soon became one of the most influential teachers in Hollywood. His students, at various times, included Robert Blake, James Coburn, Richard Chamberlain, James Dean, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Michael Forest, James Hong, Sally Kellerman, Shirley Knight, Bruce Lee, Penny Marshall, Jack Nicholson, Darrell M. Smith, Diane Varsi, Sharon Tate, Rita Moreno, Leonard Nimoy, Sally Forrest, Anthony Perkins, Rob Reiner, Robert Towne, Barbra Streisand and Robin Williams.\n\nIn 1962, Corey began working in films again, and remained active into the 1990s. He played Hoban in \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965) and Tom Chaney the principal villain in \"True Grit\" (1969) and was Sheriff Bledsoe in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (also 1969) who warned Butch and Sundance that no good would come of their breaking the law. In \"Seconds\" (1966), a science fiction drama film directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Rock Hudson, Corey with Will Geer and John Randolph played wealthy executives who opt to restart their lives with a new identity, an ironic parallel to the real life of Corey and the other principal actors (excepting Hudson) who had also been proscribed from Hollywood films during the \"Blacklist\" years of the 1950s.\n\nCorey played a police detective in the psychological thriller \"The Premonition\" (1976) and he reprised the role of sheriff Bledsoe in the prequel \"\" (1979). He also played Wild Bill Hickok in \"Little Big Man\" (1970). Corey directed some of the screen tests for \"Superman\" (1978), which can be seen in the DVD extras, and played Lex Luthor in several try-outs.\nAlso starred in Up River 1979 film played the part of Bagshaw.\n\nCorey made guest appearances on many television series. Corey appeared as murder victim Carl Bascom in the \"Perry Mason\" episode, \"The Case of the Reckless Rockhound\" (1964). He featured on science fiction series too, including an episode of \"The Outer Limits\" (\"O.B.I.T.\", 1963) in which he played Byron Lomax; \"\" (\"The Cloud Minders\", 1969) in which he played High Advisor Plasus; as Caspay in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) and \"Babylon 5\" (\"Z'ha'dum\", 1996) in which he played Justin. \n\nHe was also the voice of the villain Silvermane (in elderly form) in \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" (1994). He also appeared in the short-lived \"Paper Moon\" (1974), a comedy about a father and his presumed daughter roaming through the American Midwest during the Great Depression based on the film. Corey had a memorable role in a third-season episode of \"Night Court\" (1986) as a burned-out judge who had lost his grip on reality.\n\nHe played Dr. Miles Talmadge on \"\" season one episode one, \"The Dead Man\", on December 16, 1970. Corey detailed his television work on Rod Serling's \"Night Gallery\" in an interview in February 1973 aboard the SS \"Universe Campus\" of Chapman College. He was proudest of this work, for which he received an Emmy nomination.\n\nIn the era of old-time radio, Corey portrayed Lieutenant Abar on the crime drama \"The Adventures of Philip Marlowe\" on NBC (1947) and CBS (1948-1951).\n\nCorey died on August 16, 2002, aged 88, from complications from a fall.

Pattabhi Jois () (26 July 1915 – 18 May 2009) was an Indian yoga teacher and Sanskrit scholar who developed and popularized the vinyāsa style of yoga referred to as Ashtanga Yoga. In 1948, Jois established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute (now known as the K Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute) in Mysore, India. Pattabhi Jois is one of a short list of Indians who were instrumental in transmitting yoga from India to the West in the 20th century.\n\nJois was born on 26 July 1915 (\"Guru Pūrṇimā\", full moon day) in the village of Kowshika, near Hassan, Karnataka, South India.\n\nJois's father was an astrologer, priest, and landholder. His mother took care of the house and the nine children - five girls and four boys - of whom Pattabhi Jois was the fifth. From the age of five, he was instructed in Sanskrit and rituals by his father, which is standard training for Brahmin boys. No one else in his family learned yoga.\n\nIn 1927, at the age of 12, Jois attended a lecture and demonstration at the Jubilee Hall in Hassan by T. Krishnamacharya and became his student the very next day. For two years Jois remained in Kowshika and practiced with Krishnamacharya every day. Jois never told his family he was practicing yoga. He would rise early, go to practice, and then attend school.\n\nIn 1930, Jois ran away from home to Mysore to study Sanskrit, with 2 rupees. Around the same time Krishnamacharya departed Hassan to teach elsewhere. Two years later, Jois was reunited with Krishnamacharya, who had also made his way to Mysore. During this time, the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar, had become seriously ill and it is said that Krishnamacharya had healed him, through yoga, where others had failed. The Maharaja became Krishnamacharya's patron and established a Yoga shala for him at the Jaganmohan Palace. Jois often accompanied Krishnamacharya in demonstrations. and would occasionally assist Krishnamacharya in class and teach in his absence.\n\nJois studied with Krishnamacharya from 1927 to 1929 in his own village, and then in Mysore from 1932 to 1953. He studied texts such as Patañjali's \"Yoga Sūtra\", \"Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā\", \"Yoga Yajñavalkya\" and the \"Upaniṣads.\"\n\nOn the full moon of June 1933, when Jois was 18 years old, he married Savitramma, who affectionately came to be known as Amma by Pattabhi Jois's family and students alike. They had three children: Saraswathi, Mañju and Ramesh.\n\nIn 1948, with the help of Jois' students, he purchased a home in the section of town called Lakshmipuram. According to Tim Miller, Pattabhi Jois continued to practice asanas until his son Ramesh committed suicide when Jois was in his early 60s.\n\nSaraswathi Jois had two children who continue to teach yoga today, R. Sharath Jois and Sharmila Mahesh. They both trained in yoga under Pattabhi Jois from childhood. Pattabhi Jois took an active role in raising his grandchildren. Sharath began assisting Pattabhi Jois in his teaching in 1990, and continued to do so until Jois passed away in 2009. At that time, Sharath took over as the main teacher and director of the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute, which he renamed as the \"K Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI)\" in honor of his grandfather.\n\nManju Jois left India in the late 1970s to settle in the United States. He continues to teach yoga internationally, and is married with one child.\n\nThe Maharaja of Mysore would at times attend classes when Jois was assisting and offered Jois a teaching position at the Sanskrit College in Mysore with a salary, scholarship to the college and room and board.\n\nPattabhi Jois held a yoga teaching position at the Sanskrit College of Maharaja from 1937 to 1973, becoming \"vidwan\" (professor) in 1956, as well as being Honorary Professor of Yoga at the Government College of Indian Medicine from 1976 to 1978. He taught there until 1973, when he left to devote himself fulltime to teach yoga at his yoga shala.\n\nHe wrote the book \"Yoga Mālā\", in Kannada in 1958, and it was published in 1962, but was not published in English until 1999. The film \"Guru\" was made about him by Robert Wilkins.\n\nIn 1924 Krishnamacharya spent time in the Calcutta University Library researching an ancient text called the \"Yoga Korunta\" which was badly damaged and had many missing portions. Krishnamacharya had learned this text from his teacher Rama Mohan Brahmachari in the Himalayas.\n\nJois began his studies with Krishnamacharya in 1927 and was taught the method from the \"Yoga Korunta\". An entire system of practices including Pranayama, Bandhas, (core muscular and energetic locks) and Dristi (visual focal points) were included along with āsanas and vinyāsa Pattabhi Jois then went on to teach it to others as he was taught by Krishnamacharya.\n\nJois indicated that he had never seen this text. Even though the authenticity of this text is difficult or impossible to validate it is generally accepted as the source of Ashtanga Yoga as taught by Pattabhi Jois. It is important to characterize the \"Yoga Korunta\" as having been transmitted and passed on from teacher to student. Perhaps each student received the teachings but not in physical form.\n\nOne major component of Ashtanga Yoga that was not in the Yoga Korunta nor was it part of the early teachings of Krishnamacharya was Surya Namaskara A & B. Surya Namaskara A & B, which establish the āsana practice, were devised by Pattabhi Jois based on references to ancient texts. Detailed explanations of Surya Namaskara A & B are in Jois's book Yoga Mala.\n\nIn 1948, Jois established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute at their home in Lakshmipuram. In 1964 he built an extension in the back of the house for a yoga hall.\n\nIn 1964, a Belgian named André Van Lysebeth spent two months with Jois learning the primary and intermediate series of the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga system. Not long afterward, van Lysebeth wrote a book called \"J'apprends le Yoga\" (1967, English title: \"Yoga Self-Taught\") which mentioned Jois and included his address. This marked the beginning of Westerners coming to Mysore to study yoga. The first Americans came, after Jois's son Manju demonstrated yoga at Swami Gitananda's ashram in Pondicherry.\n\nJois gained attention from celebrity students including Madonna, Sting, and Gwyneth Paltrow To accommodate the increasing number of students coming to study, he opened a new school in Gokulam in 2002.\n\nPattabhi Jois spent more than 70 years of his life dedicated to practicing and teaching Ashtanga yoga. Jois continued to teach at the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, now located in the neighbourhood of Gokulam, with his only daughter Saraswathi Rangaswamy (b. 1941) and his grandson Sharath. until 18 May 2009 when he died aged 93 of natural causes.\n\nParampara is the passing of knowledge from teacher to student and the importance of the ongoing relationship between the two. \"This lies at the heart of Jois's Ashtanga Yoga.\"\n\nJois's Ashtanga Yoga is passed on in a traditional manner and the teacher certification process is extensive, by which a student, through many years of daily practice and extended trips to Mysore, India, becomes a 'lineage holder' also known as 'Authorized' or 'Certified'. Jois studied with his teacher Krishnamacharya for many years and in turn, expected the same from his students in order to be able to teach correctly and appropriately. \"Professional development requirements such as these are arguably some of the most stringent found in Modern Postural Yoga lineages, and they derive directly from the emphasis that both Pattabhi Jois and [his grandson] R. Sharath Jois have placed on Parampara.\"\n\nAs of 2017, there are three levels of teacher recognition 'Authorized Level 1', 'Authorized Level 2', and 'Certified'. In brief, 'Authorized Level 1' teachers are able to teach the primary series. 'Authorized Level 2' teachers are able to teach up to where they learned in intermediate series. Certified teachers have learned the third series and beyond and are able to teach accordingly.\n\nHis first trip to the West was in 1974 to South America, to deliver a lecture in Sanskrit at an international yoga conference. In 1975 he stayed for four months in Encinitas, California, marking the beginning of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga in the US. He had said on many occasions that only twenty or thirty students practiced Ashtanga Yoga in America then, but, 'gradually, gradually, in twenty years, it will be fully spreading' He would return to the US several times over the next 20 years, to teach yoga at Encinitas and beyond. \n\nA range of obituaries for Jois were published in many newspapers and journals, including the New York Times, the Financial Times, the BBC, the Guardian, the Huffington Post, the Economist, the LA Times and the Times of London.\n\nA student David Life, co-founder of Jivamukti Yoga school in Manhattan, has said of him, \"He was not a monk or a renunciate; he was fearless about combining the path of yogi with the path of participant. He never saw it as separate from our lives. He thought that anyone could attain to yoga if they had the desire and the enthusiasm.\"\n\nAccording to B.K.S. Iyengar, Jois was assigned to teach asana at the Sanskrit Pathshala when the yogashala of Krishnamacharya was opened in 1933 and was \"never a regular student.\" Pattabhi Jois also claimed he was B. K. S. Iyengar's teacher, although Iyengar has refuted this claim. Krishnamacharya did have many teachers working for him and they would have been teaching the same yoga system though, therefore he would have received acknowledgement for that.\n\n\"The Economist\" published an obituary that questioned Jois's adherence to the yogic principle of brahmacharya or sexual continence and made the accusation that his female students received different \"adjustments\" from his male students. \"CounterPunch\" in a magazine article indicated that Jois was a \"reported sexual abuser of students.\" Accusations of inappropriate touching of women by Jois during yoga classes also surfaced on \"YogaDork,\" in \"Elephant Journal\", and in an article appearing on \"YogaCity NYC\", where a female student reported she was groped by Jois during a class in New York.\n\nThe same obituary questioned Jois's adherence to the yogic principle of ahimsa or non-violence and highlighted that \"a good number of Mr Jois's students seemed constantly to be limping around with injured knees or backs because they had received his \"adjustments\", yanking them into Lotus, the splits or a backbend.\" Adjustments by Jois have been characterized as \"overwhelming, producing fear and extreme discomfort in students as they are pushed beyond their physical and psychological comfort zones in often-difficult, even dangerous asana.\". It's unlikely that students would have endured such adjustments without faith and trust in the teachers and the method. This connection between teacher and student is how Jois taught Parampara, the passing of knowledge as it occurs between teacher and student. Pattabhi Jois did not call himself a guru, but is considered the master guru, or teacher, of Ashtanga Yoga.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, The Walrus magazine published a article entitled \"Yoga's Culture of Sexual Abuse: Nine Women Tell Their Stories\". The article features the first-person testimonies of nine women who allege being sexually assaulted by Pattabhi Jois. The incidents date from 1992 to 2002. One of the women quoted in this article, Karen Rain, was formerly known as Karen Haberman. She studied with Jois in Mysuru for a total of two years between 1994 and 1998. She has archived her writings about Jois on her blog. In an interview, she describes the challenges involved in coming forward with her story. In response to the revelations and to Rain's call for reform in the Ashtanga Yoga community, several Ashtanga teachers authorized by the Jois family have committed to restorative actions.\n\nJois's grandson, R. Sharath Jois, is a major contributor to his legacy. Sharath Jois currently leads the ashtanga yoga community as the director and main teacher at the K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI) in Mysuru, where thousands of yoga students study each year. Sharath also teams with yoga practitioner and philanthropist Sonia Klein Jones to create Jois Yoga in honor of K. Pattabhi Jois. Jones's organization Sonima often provides organizational support to Sharath's world tours, and produces online programs that provide supplementary teaching tools for Ashtanga. Jois's daughter, Saraswathi, and granddaughter, Sharmila, run a successful yoga school in Mysuru and travel the world on teaching tours. Pattabhi Jois's lineage is also carried on by the students that he officially authorized and certified.\n\nThe result of Jois's contribution to the practice of yoga can be found in yoga classes across the globe. Jois devised Surya Namaskara A & B (the \"sun salutations\") in reference to a passage from the Vedas, and they are commonly found at the beginning of even non-Ashtanga classes.\n\n"}
{"id": "18126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18126", "title": "Learning object", "text": "Learning object\n\nA learning object is \"a collection of content items, practice items, and assessment items that are combined based on a single learning objective\". The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins, and dates from a working group in 1994 bearing the name. The concept encompassed by 'Learning Objects' is known by numerous other terms, including: content objects, chunks, educational objects, information objects, intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, reusable information objects, reusable learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning.\n\nThe core idea of the use of learning objects is characterized by the following: discoverability, reusability, and interoperability. To support discoverability, learning objects are described by Learning Object Metadata, formalized as IEEE 1484.12 Learning object metadata. To support reusability, the IMS Consortium proposed a series of specifications such as the IMS Content package. And to support interoperability, the U.S. military's Advanced Distributed Learning organization created the Sharable Content Object Reference Model. Learning objects were designed in order to reduce the cost of learning, standardize learning content, and to enable the use and reuse of learning content by learning management systems.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines a learning object as \"any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training\".\n\nChiappe defined Learning Objects as: \"A digital self-contained and reusable entity, with a clear educational purpose, with at least three internal and editable components: content, learning activities and elements of context. The learning objects must have an external structure of information to facilitate their identification, storage and retrieval: the metadata.\"\n\nThe following definitions focus on the relation between learning object and digital media. RLO-CETL, a British inter-university Learning Objects Center, defines \"reusable learning objects\" as \"web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective\". Daniel Rehak and Robin Mason define it as \"a digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning\".\n\nAdapting a definition from the Wisconsin Online Resource Center, Robert J. Beck suggests that learning objects have the following key characteristics:\n\n\nThe following is a list of some of the types of information that may be included in a learning object and its metadata:\n\nOne of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines or content management systems. This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive learning object metadata. Just as a book in a library has a record in the card catalog, learning objects must also be tagged with metadata. The most important pieces of metadata typically associated with a learning object include:\n\nA mutated learning object is, according to Michael Shaw, a learning object that has been \"re-purposed and/or re-engineered, changed or simply re-used in some way different from its original intended design\". Shaw also introduces the term \"contextual learning object\", to describe a learning object that has been \"designed to have specific meaning and purpose to an intended learner\".\n\nBefore any institution invests a great deal of time and energy into building high-quality e-learning content (which can cost over $10,000 per classroom hour), it needs to consider how this content can be easily loaded into a Learning Management System. It is possible for example, to package learning objects with SCORM specification and load it in Moodle Learning Management System or Desire2Learn Learning Environment.\n\nIf all of the properties of a course can be precisely defined in a common format, the content can be serialized into a standard format such as XML and loaded into other systems. When it is considered that some e-learning courses need to include video, mathematical equations using MathML, chemistry equations using CML and other complex structures, the issues become very complex, especially if the systems needs to understand and validate each structure and then place it correctly in a database.\n\nIn 2001, David Wiley criticized learning object theory in his paper, The Reusability Paradox which is summarized by D'Arcy Norman as, \"If a learning object is useful in a particular context, by definition it is not reusable in a different context. If a learning object is reusable in many contexts, it isn’t particularly useful in any.\" \nIn Three Objections to Learning Objects and E-learning Standards, Norm Friesen, Canada Research Chair in E-Learning Practices at Thompson Rivers University, points out that the word \"neutrality\" in itself implies \"a state or position that is antithetical ... to pedagogy and teaching.\"\n\n\nInnayah: Creating An Audio Script with Learning Object, unpublished, 2013.\n\n"}

These programs focus on applied techniques and design, in their respective engineering fields. The technological PDEng designer programs were initiated at the request of the Dutch high-tech industry. High-tech companies need professionals who can design and develop complex new products and processes and offer innovative solutions. All programs work closely together with high-tech industry, offering trainees the opportunity to participate in large-scale, interdisciplinary design projects. With this cooperation, PDEng programs provide trainees a valuable network of contacts in industry. Each program covers a different technological field, for example managing complex architectural construction projects, designing mechanisms for user interfaces for consumer products or developing high-tech software systems for software-intensive systems. Participation in a program that awards the abbreviation PDEng requires at least a Master's degree in a related field. The PDEng may sometimes be confused with a Phd, but they are not comperable.\n\nPDEng degrees can be obtained at three technical Universities in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, and University of Twente. Between these universities interscholastic cooperation programs exist like the 4TU Federation and its Stan Ackermans Institute.\n\nThe two-year, full-time post-master programs all lead to a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) degree. The programs are certified by the Dutch Certification Committee for Technological Design Programs (CCTO or Dutch: \"Nederlandse Certificatiecommissie voor Opleidingen tot Technologisch Ontwerper\"), which represents the interests of the organization of Netherlands Industry Entrepreneurs and Employers (VNO-NCW/MKB Netherlands) and the Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers (Dutch: \"Koninklijk Instituut Van Ingenieurs - KIVI\"). The CCTO's main goal is to ensure that such degrees hold to the high standards established by both academia and industry. The committee reviews these degree programs every five years to ensure continued standards compliance. \n\nAlthough the PDEng and PhD are both recognised as postgraduate degrees, they are not the same. A PDEng is practically oriented and does not require a body of original academic research to graduate.\n\nThe Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) name owes its existence to the adoption of the Bachelor/Master (Ba/Ma) degree system after the Bologna Process. While most Dutch universities adopted the Ba/Ma system in 2001, the PDEng was known as the official Master of Technical Design (MTD) degree until 2004. From that date the Executive Boards of TU/e, TUD and UT decided jointly to use PDEng. \n\nApplication is open to university graduates from the Netherlands and other countries. A trainee must hold at least a Master of Science degree or equivalent, preferably in the exact sciences. Besides, applicant must have an interest in designing solutions for complex technological problems. There can be an assessment and selection procedure before entering a program. The PDEng programs use strict selection criteria to ensure the required high quality. Excellent marks, motivation and a design-oriented attitude are vitally important. A trainee should also have an excellent command of the English language. The exact admission and selection procedures are different at the three locations.

The initiative was launched in 2002 and runs every two years, with the aim of making significant contributions to the arts worldwide. In keeping with its tradition of supporting individual excellence, Rolex seeks to give emerging artists time to learn, create and grow.\n\nThe mentoring programme grew out of a desire by Rolex, the Swiss watch company, to support artists in the same way that the Rolex Awards for Enterprise were supporting scientists, conservationists and explorers. Two years of research in the 1990s led to the discovery that mentorship of individual young artists was lacking, and the international initiative was founded to nurture young dancers, musicians, theatre directors, writers, visual artists and film-makers.\n\nUnparalleled in corporate philanthropy today, in terms of the Rolex Arts Initiative’s scope and international reach, the programme is grounded in an age-old practice: the passing down of the world’s artistic heritage from one generation to the next through mentoring.\n\nThe mentor-protégé selection process begins with the establishment of an Advisory Board of distinguished artists and arts practitioners from around the world who suggest, endorse and help recruit the mentors. Once the mentors ─ one in each discipline ─ have agreed to take part, each gives a profile of his/her ideal protégé. The potential protégés are young, extremely talented artists, who have already made great headway in their careers, but who will benefit tremendously by collaborating with a master for a year.\n\nTailor-made panels of nominators, one for each discipline, act as “talent scouts” to identify suitable protégé candidates from their extensive network of contacts worldwide; the potential candidates are approached and asked to submit applications detailing their credentials and career motivation, which are used by the respective panel to select three or four protégé finalists. Finally, each mentor meets with the finalists to choose his/her protégé. The best talent is inevitably discovered through this process.\n\nThe mentor and protégé work closely together during the mentoring period, with each pair deciding the most effective way of interacting. Except for the minimum of six weeks (30 working days) that the mentor-protégé pairs are required to spend together, there are few rules to the programme. Most spend considerably more time interacting, sharing knowledge and experience.\n\nRolex grants each mentor an honorarium of 100,000 Swiss francs, and each protégé 40,000 Swiss francs during the mentoring period (plus travel and expenses) and 30,000 Swiss francs after the mentoring period for the creation of a new piece of work, a publication, performance or public event.\n\nThe programme is managed by a specialized team at the company’s headquarters in Geneva. After the mentoring year, Rolex continues to keep in touch with the protégés, following their careers and documenting their progress on the Arts Initiative website rolexmentorprotege.com.\n\nThe initiative has been highly acclaimed by both mentors and protégés. Protégés gain from the mentor-protégé relationship, and, over the years, mentors have expressed how they have gained new energy, insights and inspiration from the younger artists. Cross-fertilization also exists through the alumni network of artists who have participated in the programme.\n\n\n"}

Shueisha, along with Shogakukan, owns Viz Media, which publishes manga from all three companies in North America.\n\nIn 1925, Shueisha was created by major publishing company Shogakukan (founded in 1922). became the first novel published by Shueisha in collaboration with Shogakukan—the temporary home of Shueisha. In 1927, two novels titled \"Danshi Ehon\", and \"Joshi Ehon\" were created. In 1928, Shueisha was hired to edit , a compilation. \"Gendai Humor Zenshū\" continued 12 volumes, some issues being \"Joshi Shinjidai Eishūji-chō\" and . In the 1930s another novel called \"Tantei-ki Dan\" was launched and \"Gendai Humor Zenshū\" was completed in 24 volumes. In 1931 two more novels were launched, \"Danshi Yōchien\" and \"Joshi Yōchien\".\n\nAfter World War II, Shueisha started publishing a manga line called \"Omoshiro Book\". \"Omoshiro Book\" published a picture book called \"Shōnen Ōja\", which became a huge hit among boys and girls. The first full volume of \"Shōnen Ōja\" was released as \"Shōnen Ōja Oitachi Hen\", which became an instant best-seller. \n\nThe first magazine published by Shueisha was \"Akaruku Tanoshii Shōnen-Shōjo Zasshi\". In September 1949, \"Omoshiro Book\" was made into a magazine with all the contents of the former line. In 1950, a special edition of the magazine was published under the title \"Hinomaru\". In addition to \"Omoshiro Book\", a female version was published in 1951: \"Shōjo Book\" which featured manga aimed at adolescent girls. The Hitotsubashi building of Shueisha became completely independent in 1952. In that year, \"Omoshiro Book\" ceased publication and \"Myōjō\" began publication as a monthly magazine. The series of \"Omoshiro Book\" were published in bunkoban editions under the \"Omoshiro Manga Bunko\" line. A novel called \"Yoiko Yōchien\" was published and \"Omoshiro Book\" was replaced with another children's manga magazine called \"Yōnen Book\".\n\nIn 1955, the success of \"Shōjo Book\" led to the publication of currently running \"Ribon\". The novel \"Joshi Yōchien Kobato\" began publication in 1958. On November 23, a special issue of \"Myōjō\" titled \"Weekly Myōjō\" was released. In 1951, another male edition of \"Shōjo Book\" was released, \"Shōnen Book\" was made, and \"Shōjo Book\" series were released in bunkoban editions under the \"Shōjo Manga Bunko\" imprint. In the 1960s, another spin-off issue of \"Myōjō\" was released called \"Bessatsu Weekly Myōjō\". \n\nShueisha continues to publish many novels. A compilation of many \"Omoshiro Book\" series was released as \"Shōnen-Shōjo Nippon Rekishi Zenshū\" complete in 12 volumes. Many other books were published including \"Hirosuke Yōnen Dōwa Bungaku Zenshū\", \"Hatachi no Sekkei\", \"Dōdō Taru Jinsei\", \"Shinjin Nama Gekijō\", and \"Gaikoku kara Kita Shingo Jiten\". In 1962, Shueisha published a female version of \"Myōjō\" titled \"Josei Myōjō\" and many more novels. In 1963, Shueisha began publication of the widely successful \"Margaret\" with the additional offshoot \"Bessatsu Margaret\". The novel \"Ukiyo-e Hanga\" was released complete in seven volumes, and the picture book \"Sekai 100 Nin no Monogatari Zenshū\" was released in the usual 12. In 1964, \"Kanshi Taikei\" was released in 24 volumes plus a reprint. In that year a line of novels, \"Compact Books\", was made and a line of manga called \"Televi-Books\" (\"televi\": short for \"television\"). In 1965, two more magazines were made: \"Cobalt\" and the \"Shōnen Book\" offshoot \"Bessatsu Shōnen Book\".\n\nIn 1966, Shueisha began publication of \"Weekly Playboy\", \"Seishun to Dokusho\" and \"Shōsetsu Junior\". A novel called \"Nihonbon Gaku Zenshū\" spawned a great 88 volumes. Another manga magazine was made titled \"Young Music\". \"Deluxe Margaret\" began publication in 1967 and the additional \"Margaret Comics\" and \"Ribon Comics\" lines. In 1968 the magazine \"Hoshi Young Sense\" began publication as spin-off to the short-lived \"Young Sense\". Later in that year \"Margaret\" launched the \"Seventeen\" magazine as a Japanese version of the English edition. \n\n\"Shōnen Jump\" was created in the same year as a semi-weekly magazine. Another children's manga magazine was created in that year called \"Junior Comic\" and another \"Ribon\" spin-off called \"Ribon Comic\". In 1969 the magazine \"Joker\" began publication along with \"guts\". Several other novels were published. The magazine \"Bessatsu Seventeen\" began publication. In that year \"Shōnen Jump\" became a weekly anthology and changed its name to \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\". Following up the end of \"Shōnen Book\" a spin-off of \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" started at the same time as it became weekly, initially called \"Bessatsu Shōnen Jump\". It changed its name to \"Monthly Shōnen Jump\" with the second issue. \n\nThe 1970s started with the launch of the novel magazine \"Subaru\" and in 1971 the \"Non-no\" and \"Ocean life\" magazines began publication.

The company is based in Lehi, Utah, and employs approximately 400 in offices worldwide. It was bought out by Vista Equity Partners in December 2006, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, CA. Bill Davison was named SirsiDynix CEO in October 2011.\nIn January 2015 ICV Partners announced their acquisition of SirsiDynix from Vista Equity Partners.\n\nThe Sirsi Corporation was founded in Huntsville, Alabama in 1979 by Mike Murdock, Jacky Young, and Jim Young. The Unicorn library automation system they developed was first installed at Georgia Tech. Sirsi acquired Data Research Associates (DRA) for $51.5 million in 2001. The main product inherited from Sirsi is the Unicorn integrated library system (ILS).\n\nThe Dynix Corporation was founded in 1983. Their major product was the Dynix Automated Library System.\n\nIn January 1992, Dynix Systems was acquired by Ameritech. Dynix and NOTIS Systems (maker of NOTIS), which Ameritech purchased in October 1991, were consolidated into Ameritech Library Services (ALS) in 1994.\n\nIn November 1999, Ameritech sold Ameritech Library Systems to a pair of investment companies, the 21st Century Group and Green Leaf Ridge Company, which rebranded ALS as epixtech. In 2003, epixtech reverted to using the Dynix name.\n\nThe ILS serves libraries in various functions: cataloging, circulation, acquisitions, reserves, outreach, etc. SirsiDynix currently supports the SirsiDynix Symphony ILS and the Horizon ILS.\n\nSirsiDynix announced the BLUEcloud LSP (BCS) library services platform at their annual COSUGI users' group conference. It is a browser-based system that will integrate SirsiDynix's \"administration, discovery, acquisition, and collection management applications.\" It can be accessed from a desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone. BCS can integrate with both SaaS and locally hosted Horizon and Symphony systems. The BLUEcloud LSP is made up of three major components: BLUEcloud Staff, BLUEcloud Marketplace, and BLUEcloud Discovery. The first features are expected to be released by summer 2013.\n\nSirsiDynix will offer BCS to their customer base without forcing a data migration. The initial release will require the latest version of the ILS, but customers will then be allowed to lag behind by a version. The goal of this project was to streamline the user experience rather than changing administration interfaces for each product. This approach will stop the duplication of data and will integrate all searches across products. The majority of the new features of BCS will be included in the annual maintenance fee.\n\nOther products include Director's Station and Web Reporter\n\nPrevious products include Unicorn, Dialcat and SchoolRooms.\n\nSirsiDynix and Stanford university libraries worked together for over a year to upgrade Stanford's library environment to support Asian and other multi-byte character sets. SirsiDynix has also partnered with 3M to provide radio-frequency identification systems for libraries.\n\nOn October 29, 2009, the WikiLeaks Project obtained a document from SirsiDynix taking a negative view of open source projects as compared to proprietary products, including risks of instability and insecurity. The document, which its author, Stephen Abram, claimed was not intended to be secret, set off a debate on open source within the library technology community.\n\nIn May 2010, the company performed an upgrade of its systems at the Ottawa Public Library, involving a scheduled two-day closure of all library branches, accompanied by an 11-day shutdown of online systems. However, the actual upgrade required closure of the library system for an additional two days. Jan Harder, chair of Ottawa's library board, stated an intention to seek compensation from SirsiDynix for the unexpected additional upgrade work.\n\n"}

{"id": "322977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322977", "title": "Student society", "text": "Student society\n\nA student society, student association, university society or student organization is a society or an organization, operated by students at a university or a college institution, whose membership typically consists only of students or alumni.\n\nEarly notable types of student societies include the medieval so-called nations of the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Later Modern era examples include the Studentenverbindung in the German speaking world, as well as the evolvement of fraternal orders for students and student fraternities internationally.\n\nAims may involve practice and propagation of a certain professional hobby or to promote professional development or philanthropic causes. Examples of common societies found in most universities are a debate society, an international student society, a rock society, and student chapters of professional societies (e.g. the American Chemical Society). Not all societies are based around such a large area of interest and many universities also find themselves home to societies for many obscure hobbies such as a Neighbours society.\n\nStudent societies typically have open membership, thus differing from honor societies, secret societies, and certain fraternities that admit members by invitation only. Students typically join societies at the beginning of the school year when many societies present themselves in a societies fair and campaign to attract new members. The students may pay a membership fee to the society. Since the societies are non-profit organizations this fee is often nominal and purely exists to cover insurance or to fund society events.\n\nStudent societies may or may not be affiliated with a university's students' union. Student societies often aim to facilitate a particular activity or promote a belief system, although some explicitly require nothing more than that a member is a present or former student. Additionally, some are not affiliated with a specific university or accept non-university students.\n\nTypical examples are:\n\nIn Australia, student societies play an important role in university life by bringing together like-minded students to engage in activities the society seeks to promote.\n\nIn Flanders, student societies play a unique role in student life. Student societies there have traditionally been politically active, and they played a significant part in the 1960s division of the Catholic University of Leuven into separate Flemish and Walloon universities.\n\nA student society in Flanders is led by a \"praesidium\". The head of the praesidium (and the society) is the \"praeses\". Alternative spellings are \"presidium\" and \"preses\". For most positions, Dutch names are used nowadays.\n\nOther positions include:\nPositions are flexible, and change to meet the needs of the student organisation.\n\nStudent societies used to be politically engaged, but are now more focused on organizing parties, cantus, and cultural activities.\n\nStudent societies also exist at polytechnics.\nNew members go through an initiation ritual before becoming full members of a Flemish student society. A new member is called \"schacht\" and has to undergo a \"baptism\". The baptism is the first step to integration in the student society. The next (and last) step to becoming a full-fledged member is the \"ontgroening\". After the \"ontgroening\", one becomes a normal member or \"commilito\" of the organization, and can join the praesidium if one so chooses. Normal members are also referred to as \"anciens\".\n\nSee also:\nEducation in Belgium\n\nIn Wallonia and Brussels, several types of francophone student societies exist:\n\nThese societies sometimes have traditions dating back a hundred years, such as wearing one of the two traditional student hats: the or the Calotte. Their main activity is organising and attending parties or festivals (for example, the 24 hours bike ride of Louvain-la-Neuve or the St V).\n\nThe Alma Mater Society at Queen's University is the oldest such organization in Canada, and currently the most extensive in regard to student involvement. It is currently a multi-million corporation employing over 500 students. The day-to-day operations of the AMS are overseen by the AMS Council which includes an annually elected three-person executive (the President, Vice-President (Operations) and Vice-President (University Affairs), selected as a slate), five commissioners who are each responsible for a specific aspect of student life, and three directors who are responsible for overseeing the AMS’ 14 corporate services.\n\nEstonian Students' Society (Estonian: Eesti Üliõpilaste Selts commonly used acronym: EÜS) is the largest and oldest all-male academical student society in Estonia, which is similar to Baltic German student corporations (should not be confused with American college fraternities). It was founded in 1870 at the University of Tartu. It has over 800 members in Estonia and abroad.\n\nIn Estonia are 10 academical male student corporations. They are joined in League of Estonian Corporations, which was founded on March 28, 1915 by Vironia, Fraternitas Estica, Sakala, Ugala and Rotalia. Estonian student corporations have hundreds of members and alumni worldwide, because after the Soviet annexation of Estonia many members fled to Western countries.\n\nAdded to them there are one female student society: Estonian Women Students' Society, five female student corporations: Filiae Patriae, Indla, Lembela, Amicitia, Sororitas Estoniae.\n\nIn Europe, there are several continent-wide student organisations fostering exchange among students of different nationalities and Culture, such as \n\nThere is also the National Unions of Students in Europe, a representative student organisation at European level, notably within the Bologna process.\n\nIn Germany, student societies are widespread and various, though by lack of support from the universities (and by force of variety), generally do not boast many members. The most popular are the Studentenverbindungen; most of them are moderate and tolerant, although many are restricted to male or Christian members.\n\nThe counterpart to these more conservative organisations are left-wing and anti-fascist student organisations as Anti-Fa or Praxis (in Bavaria).\n\nOn many universities - although in many states not officially recognised - there are student representations, called AStA (Allgemeiner Studenten-Ausschuss), StuVe (Studentische Vertretung) or StuRa (Studentenrat).\n\nOther organisations include European Student Associations and the student organisations of the German political parties\n\nYet, there are also politically and confessionally independent, interdisciplinary and not-for-profit student organisations. One of, if not the leading one in Germany is the Studentenforum im Tönissteiner Kreis e. V. (Student Forum within the Tönissteiner Kreis e. V.) that is part of a European and worldwide network of student organizations, the Politeia Community.\n\nSee also:\n\nStudent societies in Indonesia play a very important role since freedom struggle (before 1945), such as Budi Oetomo, Islamic Students of Indonesia (PII), and after freedom struggle like Muhammadiyah Student Association (IPM).\n\nStudent societies are widespread in Ireland's universities, with a wide range of activities catered for, including debating, performing arts, role-play, faculty-based activities, gaming, political activity etc. The range of support for societies varies from university to university, though all universities provide funding and facilities to some extent for societies.\n\nStudent societies are usually governed by Officers and a Committee with an \"Auditor\" at its head. The Biological Society, RCSI's main student society, is purportedly the oldest student medical society in the world. However, it is Trinity College, Dublin which is the location of College Historical Society (1770) and the University Philosophical Society (1853), the two oldest student societies in the world. The Literary and Debating Society (NUI Galway) also has the distinction for being the first known student society in the world to elect a female leader, with the election of Clare F. Fitzgerald as \"Auditor\" in 1942.\n\nExamples include:\n\nIn the Netherlands, there are different forms of student societies. Originally there was just the \"Corps\" (for corpus studiosorum), student bodies, starting with the Groninger Studenten Corps \"Vindicat atque Polit\" in the city of Groningen on 4 February 1815, as a part of the governing of the education on the universities and to give students the opportunity to develop themselves in all fields of life. On the wave of catholic emancipation starting in the 1890s, small groups of students, gathered around local priests, split off from the liberal, secular (in name anyway) corps fraternities to form their own societies focused on the catholic religion. This started the formation of many other religious societies in the different university cities. In the second half of the 20th century the Catholic split-offs formed an intercity-connection; the and the focus on the religion was lost or abandoned.\n\nThese societies are now known as \"student associations\" in the Netherlands, aimed mostly at social relations and gezelligheid. Most of the corpora now reside in older buildings in the city center, retaining mostly a rather traditional and conservative image. These organizations offer students a wide range of sports, cultural activities ranging from all levels of sports like field hockey, rowing and rugby to extremes like kitesurfing, glider-flying, all for student-friendly prices and development aid organisations and encouragement to start a new club of some sort at all times.\n\nThe 20th century also saw, especially in the 1960s, the formation of more independent societies at the universities itself, partly as a reaction against the elite status of the corps, abolishing hazing and religious links and some even opening up to non-students. These non-Corps student societies are known as \"study associations\" (aimed at extracurricular activities for students, such as study trips, lectures, parties or drinks) or are general associations, for sports, literature, arts, etc., founded at the university itself.\n\nThe tradition with student societies in Norway reaches back to 1813, when Norwegian Students' Society in Oslo was founded. The major student societies in Norway are those in Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. The societies in Oslo and Trondheim operates the student houses, and do also have subgroups who are engaged in theatre, political debates, radio, TV and newspaper. Bergen Student Society are not in charge of the city's student house, but are arranging political debates, lectures and cultural discussions at Det Akademiske Kvarter.\n\nA Norwegian tradition is to appoint an animal as the high protector or majesty of the student societies, such as \"His Majesty the Golden Pig\" (Oslo), \"The Black Sheep\" (Trondheim) and His Majesty the Hedgehog (Bergen). The zoological Majesties have their own order of honours, awarded to members of the student societies and member of the academic staff at the institutions, as well as visiting members of the Norwegian royal family.\n\nStudent leisure activities in Sweden are usually organised by the students' unions (\"studentkårer\", \"studentkår\" in singular). Swedish student unions cover the whole area from arranging most of the big parties, cultural activities and sports event, to acting as an equivalent of trade union for the students so their voices can be heard regarding the content and forms of education. The union is usually divided in smaller parts called sections, \"sektioner\", according to what subjects of programs the students study. Generally all kinds of smaller societies, political, religious or just dealing with different kinds of hobbies, are organised within the students' union rather than as separate units.\n\nAn exception to this are the two ancient universities in Uppsala and Lund. There, most activities except \"trade union\" issues are organised by the student nations, the oldest student societies in Sweden, now thirteen at each university. The Uppsala nations have a history stretching back to ca 1630–1640, and were likely formed under the influence of the \"Landsmannschaften\" in existence at the northern German universities frequented by Swedish students. The nations in Lund were formed at the time of the foundation of the university (1666) or shortly thereafter. The nations take the names from the Swedish provinces from which they traditionally recruited their members, but do not always adhere to the strict practice of limiting membership according to those principles.\n\nAs a former Soviet Union state, Uzbekistan holding some of the best Universities in Central Asia. First universities established back in 1920s at Turkestan Socialist Republic.Today many of these universities have their own student societies.These societies providing information and support for students who wants to study abroad at Tashkent.\n\nThe U.K. universities boast many notable societies, most of them organised through the universities' Student Unions. These societies encompass a wide range of topics, from course-specific societies, sport societies, film or tv show societies and business societies. For example, the University of Warwick's biggest society is the Warwick Business School Society (WBSS), that possesses more than 4,000 members and organises 30+ events each year around the themes of business and is led by President and Vice-President, Petra Ghamlouch and Luca Dugaro.\n\nMany student societies in the US are focused on the interests of the student members, whether it involves community service, the ethnicity of the members (such as a Black Student Union or Hillel), their religion or lack of religion (such as the Secular Student Alliance), or their political interests (such as College Republicans). Others focus on a specific social cause, whether by topic or specific to an area (even international). For example, Refresh Bolivia is a student-run nonprofit community which originated at Harvard University; it is dedicated to constructing a \"maternal & child care oriented community health center\" in Cochabamba, Bolivia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11655925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11655925", "title": "Super senior", "text": "Super senior\n\nA super senior is a student in an American four-year educational institution such as a high school or university who has been attending the institution for 5 or more years or has more than the usual number of credits required to graduate without achieving a diploma or bachelor's degree.\n\nApplied to education in the United States, super-seniors usually have the minimum number of credits to graduate but do not for various reasons. These students will advance through the grades (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) on schedule and are classified as a \"senior\" for two or more years.\n\nA student-athlete may have been made a redshirt their freshman year, which delays their four-year eligibility for competition in the NCAA until their sophomore year. As a result, they will still be eligible the year after their senior year and may stay in college to continue competition.\n\nStudents who intend to complete two or more degrees at the same time are often required to earn approximately 140-150 credits to receive their degrees, rather than the normal 120. It is often in the student's best interest to earn all desired/required undergraduate degrees at the same time as financial aid is more readily available to undergraduates than to graduates returning for additional undergraduate degrees. They could also use summer school sessions as well.\n\nStudents may choose to change majors after they are well advanced in their schooling. These students often have enough general education credits and overall credits to graduate but do not have their major-specific credits completed.\n\nStudents may take a leave of absence from their university for the difficult circumstances described below, or to pursue other endeavors, such as living, working, or studying abroad, tending to a fledgling business, or pursuing opportunities in their chosen career. Stanford University in particular is known for its sizable constituency of fifth-year (and sometimes even sixth-year) seniors who took time off to volunteer or work overseas. Many of Stanford's more famous alumni have taken a leave of absence and never returned to the school.\n\nAnother school well known in this regard is Brigham Young University, the flagship school of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many male BYU students, both at the main campus in Utah and at its branch campuses in Hawaii and Idaho, take two years off during their studies to go on LDS missions. Before a 2012 change in church policy, female students were much less likely to take time off to serve missions (which, for women, last 18 months). Under the old policy, men were allowed to serve at age 19, while women had to wait until 21 (by which time many would be close to finishing degrees, married, or both). With the new policy, males can go on missions immediately after high school as long as they are at least 18, while females can serve once they turn 19.\n\nSuper-seniors often include students who chose their classes without considering graduation requirements. They are often missing important requirements for their major or core/general education. Additionally, in changing of majors this creates an important concept in core classes as well as other classes in the curriculum.\n\nFor music majors, participation in music ensembles is an obvious requirement over the course of their college career. At many colleges, large ensembles (full choir, concert/marching/jazz band, and/or symphony orchestra) rehearse four hours a week for only one credit (typically, the number of credits correspond to hours spent in class per week). This is to encourage non-music majors to be in the ensembles; however, it is not unusual for music majors to carry 8 classes in a semester for a normal credit load of 15-16 credits. Due to this more intense time commitment, music majors often have to take 2 or more semesters to complete their graduation requirements.\n\nIn many schools, the grade of \"D\" is enough to receive credit for a class, but not high enough to count towards the student's major or core/general education requirements. A student who receives too many D grades may have enough credits to graduate but not good enough grades.\n\nSome super-seniors have enough credits and requirements to graduate, but do not apply for graduation. In most cases, universities do not automatically grant graduation without application, and as long as tuition is paid, students are not forced to leave the school. This is normally not applicable to high school.\n\nSome super-seniors may be in their fifth or later year in the school but do not have enough credits to graduate. These students appear on paper as juniors or (simple) seniors and do not have enough credits to graduate with their peers.\n\nSome super-seniors take a leave of absence or extra majors on purpose to remain in school for as long as possible.\n\nAnother example of a student’s desire to remain in school is if the student is an accounting major intending to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination. Most states in the U.S. require CPA candidates to obtain at least 150 semester hours of college education. One way for a student to obtain the 150 semester hours required for the CPA Exam is to take additional accounting or business courses in the student’s fifth or subsequent years without having to enroll in a postgraduate program.\n\nStudents in high-stress majors such as mathematics or those who take a difficult double-major (within the same degree) or minor may choose to take a minimum number of classes (two, three, or four depending on the number of credits offered per class) at one time in order to achieve higher grades or superior retention.\n\nOccasionally a student becomes ill or is injured in mid-semester and cannot complete/pass the classes he/she has begun. If this occurs after the drop-deadline, the school may make a judgment as to whether to count the grades against him/her or drop the student from the semester. In either case, the student would need an additional semester to graduate.\n\nStudents may have other difficulties that prevent them from completing the graduation requirements in the traditional four years, such as raising a child or being required to work full-time. Such students may only attend classes on a part-time basis, taking over a decade to complete a bachelor's degree.\n\nOccasionally a student may keep his or her grade point average high enough to remain in school but still fail enough classes that they do not have enough credits to graduate at the end of his or her four years.\n\nMany times, universities will require classes in order to graduate that fall under the \"General Education Requirements\" category. Often, universities will offer some of these classes (especially at smaller universities where number of teachers or resources are more limited) only once every few semesters. In some cases, students find it impossible (due to other courses, employment, or other reasons) to take these courses when they are offered and sometimes need to stay enrolled in the university for an extra semester or year until these classes are offered again.\n\nAt the University of Rochester, students are given the unique opportunity to partake in the Take Five Scholars Program. In this program, the student receives a fifth year, or one additional semester, tuition free while the student studies a subject outside of their major. The student has to apply for this program before their eighth semester.\n\nAgnes Scott College also offers a Fifth Year program, tuition-free. It is typically used to take courses that interest them but they could not take during their first four years, to finish a second major, or to take classes that are prerequisites for a graduate program they wish to pursue.\n\nMany colleges and universities offer a Cooperative Education program. In this program, a student has the opportunity to integrate work experience into his/her education through full-time employment during one or more semesters. Generally, a student will not enroll in any courses during the semester(s) of his/her full-time employment. Therefore, a student participating in Cooperative Education will require more than four years to complete his/her studies.\n\nStudents are wait-listed when applying for college entrance or when enrolling in classes at their college or university. A spot on a wait-list delays students that are earning credits for core/general education or toward their major. Being wait-listed at the beginning of their college career or at any point during their time at a college or university prevents them from having enough credits to graduate in the traditional four years.\n\nTransfer students may have to spend a longer time getting their degrees since different universities have different requirements. Also, students may transfer to narrow down their major to a specific one; an engineering student at one school may want to transfer to another one to major in a specific type of engineering, for example.\n\nSome universities reduce or withdraw state funding after a student's fifth year. In addition, parents who are paying for their children's education and living expenses may lose patience and cut their student's funding. Fifth year students are becoming more common as students increasingly choose to progress through difficult courses of study slow paces or pursue multiple majors or degrees. Although States often reduce or withdraw funding, there is still funding available to the students in the form of scholarships, as well as federal money such as work study and student loans.\n\nPublic high schools may allow a fifth year super-senior who does not have enough credits to graduate to continue attending their regular school, though students older than age 19 are usually required to attend \"continuation school\" meant for adults who have not graduated with a high school degree. Students forced into continuation school often choose to drop-out or take the GED.\n\nIn the United States, federal law (IDEA) states that public (state) schools are required to keep special-needs students in regular public schools (or a special education school if the student's IEP warrants it) until they graduate from that school or reach the age of 21.\n"}
{"id": "35269445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35269445", "title": "Takadimi", "text": "Takadimi\n\nTakadimi is a system devised by Richard Hoffman, William Pelto, and John W. White in 1996 in order to teach rhythm skills. Takadimi, while utilizing rhythmic symbols borrowed from classical South Indian carnatic music, differentiates itself from this method by focusing the syllables on meter and on western tonal rhythm. Takadimi is based on the use of specific syllables at certain places within a beat. Takadimi is used in classrooms from elementary level up through the collegiate level, and it meets National Content Standard 5 by teaching both reading and notating music.\n\nTakadimi is similar to the Kodály Method, developed in 1935 in Hungary.\nBoth systems can be traced back to the 19th century French Time-Names system. Hoffman, Pelto, and White developed the system with certain goals in mind. As stated by the developers themselves:\nHoffman, Pelto, and White believe that they took the best from many existing systems and tweaked them together to form this system that best meets the goals they set for themselves. Of the systems they used as either inspiration or examples of unwanted attributes, three are mentioned in the journal where they first proposed their system in 1996: The Kodály Method, the McHose/Tibbs system, and Edwin Gordon's system.\n\nThe Takadimi system teaches students to read rhythm in a way similar to the way a language would be taught, rooted in Pestalozzian theory formalized by Robert M. Gagné and applied in Edwin Gordon's skill learning sequences. Students learn first to recognize and repeat rhythms before they learn to associate those rhythms with standard musical notation and begin reading and writing music. The system has a basis of two related sets of syllables, one for simple meter and one for compound meter. In both meters, syllables are assigned to certain positions within the beat as opposed to the syllables being assigned to certain notational values.This allows for rhythms that sound the same to be pronounced the same, even when the notation differs. Such notational differences that commonly result in rhythms that sound the same often occur between 2/4 and 2/2 time signatures. Also, each subdivision has unique syllables, so a note in a certain place within the beat always has the same syllable. \nIn simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta,’ and an attack on the second half of the beat is always called ‘di.’ When the beat is divided further into fourths, pronunciation of each fourth would be ‘ta ka di mi.’\n\nIn compound meter, as in simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta.’ The first division into thirds is pronounced ‘ta ki da.’ The subdivision into sixths is pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma.’\n\nIn both meters, ‘ta’ always begins a beat and ‘di’ always marks the middle of the beat, simplifying switching between the two. Also, in order to allow the system to expand to more unusual time signatures, a syllable ‘ti’ may be added to the end of the subdivision. A quintuplet in simple meter, for example, would be pronounced ‘ta ka di mi ti,’ and a septuplet in compound meter would be pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma ti.’\n\nThe system developed by Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály differs from Takadimi in that is ascribes syllables to specific notational values, regardless of their placement within the beat. Sets of syllables are also assigned to specific rhythmic patterns. For example, an eighth note is called ‘ti’ whether it is on the attack of the beat or in the middle. It is also called ‘ti’ regardless of the meter. This method was intended for use at the elementary level, and many critics say that it is not expandable to upper level classrooms. Philip Tacka and Michael Houlahan, experts who have studied Kodály at Millersville University, have stated that “the Takadimi rhythm system solves the problems associated with the Kodály rhythm syllables. We believe that were Kodály alive today, he would certainly encourage his students and colleagues to use the Takadimi system.” Lois Chosky has proposed modifications to this method that provide for further subdivisions of syllables in The Kodály Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning.\n\nAllen McHose and Ruth Tibbs developed a system that is based on counting within the measure. For example, ‘one’ is said on the attack of beat one, ‘two’ is said on the attack of beat two and so on. This system also ascribes syllables to certain notational values, but the syllables are not unique to certain attack points as in the Takadimi system. Hoffman believes that this system requires a formal understanding of musical notation before it can become useful.\n\nEdwin Gordon has developed a system similar to the McHose/Tibbs system above. It is similar in that it also assigns syllables based on beat orientation. However, these syllables are meter-dependent. For example, 3 eighth notes in 6/8 are pronounced ‘du-da-di’ whereas in 7/8 they are pronounced ‘du-ba-bi.’\n"}

Founded in 1976, Taproot Theatre has mainstage productions, at its location in the Greenwood neighborhood, touring productions through the Pacific Northwest, and theatrical training through its acting studio. Taproot Theatre Company is a member of Theatre Communications Group (TCG), Theatre Puget Sound (TPS), and the Greenwood-Phinney Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTaproot Theatre produces five plays each year for its Mainstage season, plus an annual holiday production. Play selection includes classics, world premieres, musicals, dramas and comedies. Each Mainstage production offers one pay-what-you-can performance. TTC reaches approximately 30,000 audience members each year through more than 150 performances.\n\nIn addition to its regular performances, Taproot hosts matinees targeted to specific audience, either students or seniors. Each student matinee includes a post-show talk-back with the actors and director. For some students, it is the first time they have seen a professional production.\n\nTaproot’s Acting Studio was founded in 1992 to provide affordable, encouraging and artistically challenging classes for children and adults interested in learning the craft of acting. In the years since then, TTC has expanded the program to offer year-round classes in dozens of subjects including musical theatre, on-camera acting, and Shakespeare.\n\nTaproot Theatre Company began as a touring company in 1976, performing throughout Washington State at schools, prisons, churches and community centers. Today, Taproot’s Road Company spends the school year using theatre to teach social-issue lessons such as bullying and harassment prevention to schools in Seattle and throughout the Pacific Northwest; this program began in 1985. Each summer, Taproot assembles a Road Company of five professional actors to present a three-play repertoire of social-issue plays to school populations. The cast engage with the students after each performance through interactive talk-back sessions and classrooms discussions.As of early 2008, over 1 million students have seen Taproot’s social-issue plays. Plays in this program are written by Northwest playwrights and incorporate principles from Committee for Children’s Steps to Respect and Second Step curricula. During the 2008/2009 school year, Taproot’s Road Company introduced a new play, \"New Girl\" by Josh Hornbeck, about cyber bullying.\n\nTTC also mounts touring productions for the church and corporate communities.

It was proclaimed on 3 November 2011 by UNESCO's 36th General Conference after originally being proposed by the Kingdom of Spain.\n\nFollowing a request from the Spanish Radio Academy on 20 September 2010, Spain proposed that the UNESCO Executive Board include an agenda item on the proclamation of a World Radio Day. UNESCO's Executive Board approved the agenda item in its provisional agenda for the proclamation of a \"World Radio Day\" on 29 September 2011. UNESCO carried out a wide consultation in 2011 with diverse stakeholders, such as broadcasting associations, UN agencies, funds and programmes, relevant NGOs, foundations and bilateral development agencies, as well as UNESCO Permanent Delegations and National Commissions for UNESCO. Among the answers, 91% were in favour of the project, including official support from the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU), the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), the African Union of Broadcasting (AUB), the Caribbean Broadcasting Union (CBU), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the International Association of Broadcasting (IAB), the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA), the Organización de Telecomunicaciones Ibeoramericanas (OTI), BBC, URTI, Vatican Radio, etc. The results of this consultation are available in UNESCO's document 187 EX/13.\n\nThe Board recommended to the UNESCO 36th session of the General Conference that it proclaim a World Radio Day at its 36th session, and that this day be celebrated by UNESCO on 13 February, the anniversary of the day that the United Nations established the United Nations Radio in 1946. It also invited all United Nations Member States, organizations of the United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, professional associations and broadcasting unions, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organizations and individuals, to duly celebrate World Radio Day, in the way that each considers most adequate. The board further requested that UNESCO's Director-General bring the resolution to the attention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, so that World Radio Day could be endorsed by the General Assembly and celebrated by the whole system. The matter was subsequently treated by UNESCO's General Conference, which adopted resolution contained in the file 36 C/63. World Radio Day was thus unanimously proclaimed by all Member States of UNESCO in November 2011.\n\nIn December 2012, The General Assembly of the UN endorsed the proclamation of World Radio Day, thereby becoming a day to be celebrated by all UN agencies, funds and programmes and their partners. File\nA/RES/67/124. Various radio industry bodies around the world are supporting the initiative by encouraging stations in developed countries to assist those in the developing world.

A variety of practitioners, academics and tools providers joined at the School of Oriental and African Studies to explore ways in which radio reaches even the most remote and vulnerable communities. Speakers included Guy Berger (Director for Freedom of Expression and Media Development at UNESCO), Dr Chege Githiora (Chairman of the Centre of African Studies at SOAS), Birgitte Jallov (Empowerhouse/ Panos London), Amy O'Donnell (FrontlineSMS:Radio), Carlos Chirinos (SOAS Radio), and Linje Manyozo (LSE). The panel was moderated by Lucy Durán (SOAS, BBC Radio 3, Human Planet). At the University of Pisa in Italy, a public event was held on 13 February 2012 to commemorate World Radio Day. The event was organized by Italradio and the Faculty of Engineering and Telecommunication and focused on the cost and ease of use of radio as a source of information. Pisa was chosen as the first Italian city to host an intercontinental radio station built by Marconi in the early years of 20th century.\n\nIn 2012, in Barcelona, Spain, a public event organised by College of Telecommunications Engineers of Catalunya (COETTC) was held on 21 February 2012 to commemorate World Radio Day. The event was organised with the help of the Government of Catalonia. There were panellists from radio stations and personalities from the world of radio broadcasting in attendance. The main event was a panel discussion entitled \"For a more global and competitive radio\". In Switzerland, the European Broadcasting Union organised a Digital Radio Week.
