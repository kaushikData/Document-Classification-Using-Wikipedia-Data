The actor received the role after a long casting process, during which Wilson sent the producers a recording of himself performing a scene, before attending an audition. Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. The character was initially intended to be a guest part, but due to Wilson's \"endearing quality\", he was promoted to the full-time cast. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 June 2015. Aaron was the third Brennan sibling to be introduced, following his brothers Mark (Scott McGregor) and Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns) in 2010 and 2015 respectively.\n\nAaron is portrayed as a confident, happy, occasionally naive, optimist. He was initially shown to be closer to Tyler than Mark, but the brothers were bonded when their estranged father was introduced. The character had a unique entrance to the show as an exotic dancer performing at The Waterhole. Wilson took dance lessons ahead of his first scenes. Aaron has embarked on various careers throughout his duration, including bodyguard and social media manager. Aaron is openly gay, and he has formed relationships with established regular Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt), despite initially having nothing in common, and later Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger) and David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). The character has received a positive response from television critics and viewers. He was named Best New Male Character of 2015 by a columnist for \"Soap World\".\n\nOn 17 May 2015, it was announced actor and model Matt Wilson had joined the cast as Aaron Brennan, the middle brother of established characters Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns). Wilson was given the role of Aaron after a long casting process. The process started with Wilson recording himself performing a scene and sending the footage to the producers, who then invited him to attend an audition. During the lengthy waiting period, Wilson watched the show \"religiously\", which made him want to be a part of the cast even more. Months after his audition, Wilson was sent an email informing him he had won the role. Of joining the cast, Wilson said \"It's surreal. This stuff is part of your living room growing up and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have this chance.\" Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne, where the \"Neighbours\" studios are located. He made his debut appearance as Aaron during the episode broadcast on 16 June 2015. Executive producer Jason Herbison later revealed that Aaron was only ever intended to be a guest character, but Wilson's \"endearing quality\" led him to be promoted to the full-time cast.\n\nIn his fictional backstory, Aaron left his hometown of Port Lincoln shortly after Mark's departure. Aaron had not seen his brothers in six years, as he was living on the other side of the country, but they had kept in contact and stayed close. Aaron gets bored doing the same job every day and he eventually realised that working down the mines was not something he wanted to do anymore. Wilson told Claire Crick of \"All About Soap\" that after Aaron saw a male dance show in Perth, he made \"a snap decision\" to become an exotic dancer. Wilson said Aaron's career choice was similar to the characters featured in the 2012 film \"Magic Mike\".\n\nAt the time of his arrival, Aaron was much closer to his younger brother Tyler as they both liked to live in the moment, whereas Mark was a bit more sensible and OCD. Wilson thought Aaron liked being the middle brother because he loves to be the centre of attention. The actor commented, \"There's definitely no middle-child syndrome here! He's quick to mediate any arguments between the other two.\" Wilson also said Aaron was opportunistic like Tyler, but he understood limitations like Mark. McGregor opined Mark's younger siblings made him a stronger character, while Burns thought Aaron's arrival had changed the dynamic between Mark and Tyler.\n\nWilson described Aaron as \"a very confident young guy\", who loves life and is not easily fazed. He also likes to make others happy. The actor also told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy: \"Aaron's an infectious person. He's really happy, he's an optimist, he's got a lot of energy and there's a really good vibe which comes off him. He's received well by absolutely everyone.\" A writer for the official \"Neighbours\" website described the character has having \"a big heart, and a cheeky streak.\" They also said Aaron's family was important to him and he would do anything for his siblings. Speaking to Hazel Bradley of \"The West Australian\", Wilson admitted that he shared some similarities with his character, such as optimism and selflessness. However, Wilson thought Aaron was also naïve and occasionally vulnerable.\n\nAaron is openly gay, and Wilson told Peter Gray of \"Q News\" that he felt no pressure portraying a gay character, as there was a lot of support for Aaron. He called Aaron \"a typical Aussie gay guy\", which, he believed, was not well represented on Australian television at the time. Wilson turned to his own gay friends while researching Aaron's wardrobe. He thought the character was similar to them and based the clothing on items they wear. Wilson thought Aaron would be a good boyfriend because he was romantic, but his career put a strain on his past relationships. While his siblings have accepted Aaron's sexuality, their father struggled with it, but Aaron refused to let it get to him.\n\nMark contacted Aaron after fearing that Tyler had \"gone off the rails\", following his arrest. Mark knew Aaron and Tyler had a close relationship and he needed Aaron's help. Both Mark and Tyler assumed Aaron still worked down the mines in Western Australia, but he had secretly switched careers to become an exotic dancer. At the same time Mark contacted Aaron, he was booked to appear at a charity bingo night hosted by Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) at The Waterhole. Aaron was set to perform his routine in the bar when bingo was called. Sheila encouraged Mark and Tyler to attend the event and they were \"stunned\" to see their brother half-naked on the stage.\n\nWilson explained that he had no dance experience coming into the show and took private lessons ahead of filming. He commented, \"I hit the stage with 100 per cent confidence, so all of my efforts paid off!\" Mark was unimpressed with his younger brother's new career choice and berated him for it, while Tyler was amused. He was further cheered up when Aaron helped him out at the garage. Mark made an effort to bond with his brothers, after seeing how close Aaron and Tyler were.\n\nAs Aaron settled onto Ramsay Street, Tyler learned he was single and he decided to try and set Aaron up on a date with his friend Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt). Tyler's motive for the matchmaking scheme was his need to repair his broken friendship with Nate, who had not forgiven him for stealing a prescription pad from Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher). Aaron and Nate's first meeting did not go well, as they disagreed about everything and realised that they had nothing in common. Despite Tyler's efforts to get them to agree on something, Aaron and Nate realised what he was trying to do and told him that nothing was going to happen between them. Tyler's scheme did manage to get Nate to reconcile with him. Of the scenes, Wilson told Kilkelly: \"Although Aaron is quite an infectious person and everyone receives him really well, for some unbeknown reason Nate just gives him the cold shoulder. Aaron doesn't really know how to handle that. The scene where Tyler tries to set us up is hilarious - it's an absolute car crash of a scene!\"\n\nNate initially did not want anything to do with Aaron, but then Aaron got involved with his feud with Alistair Hall (Nick Cain) in an effort to help him out. Wilson said that Nate did not like Aaron's \"game-playing\". Sheila later charged a reluctant Nate with the task of getting Aaron to sign an employment contract for The Waterhole. Nate kept making snide comments about Aaron's career, so he refused to sign the contract. Sheila told Nate to make things right with Aaron, forcing him to beg. Aaron enjoyed seeing Nate's discomfort and agreed to sign the contract if he only dealt with Sheila. However, when Sheila suffered lock jaw, she forced Aaron and Nate to work together and they could resist taunting each other. Nate teased Aaron by telling him he found him to be attractive, while Aaron went to kiss him, only to pull away quickly. A \"TV Soap\" writer observed \"it's beginning to look like there might be a mutual attraction behind Nate and Aaron's guarded exteriors.\"\n\nAaron and Nate were forced to spend more time together when Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly) locked them in an outdoor hotel room with a glass front as part of a promotion for Lassiter's Hotel. The storyline started with Naomi hiring Aaron and a female model to pose as a happy couple. However, when the female model failed to turn up, Naomi grabbed Nate and locked him inside the room with Aaron. Nate decided to make the most of the situation and he hoped he could annoy Aaron in the process. Wyatt said, \"after a while Nate doesn't even notice the audience and starts to lighten up, which surprises Aaron.\" Naomi's plan was a success, as Lassiter's received positive press about its support for same-sex relationships. She then asked the men to do something special for a photograph and Nate spontaneously kissed Aaron. Nate enjoyed the kiss and it became clear that he had strong feelings for Aaron. Wyatt thought the characters were \"a good balance\", but a future relationship depended on whether they could be themselves around each other.\n\nWhen Aaron attempted to cheer up his friend Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) by acting as his wingman for the evening, he put himself in danger when her boyfriend Evan Shields (Daniel Fischer) appeared. Aaron tried to smooth things over, but he and Evan squared up to each other, leaving Josh to defuse the situation. As Aaron walked home, Evan appeared and threw a drink in his face, before attacking him. Wilson said it was a \"pretty bad\" moment, but Nate came to Aaron's rescue and dragged Evan away, before scaring him off. Aaron did not have a chance to thank Nate, as he left the scene. Neither Aaron and Nate were willing to accept that they had romantic feelings for each other. Nate believed Aaron was not interested in him, so when Aaron offered to be his slave for the week to make up for injuring him during Tai Chi, Nate was unaware Aaron was trying to flirt with him. Nate later confronted Aaron, who confessed to having feelings for him. But Nate thought Aaron was joking and Aaron was \"crushed\" by his rejection. Tyler then told Nate that his brother was attracted to him.\n\nAaron and Nate eventually developed a relationship. After Nate got involved in a fight, he decided to leave town to clear his head. Aaron was \"angry and upset\" when he learnt that Nate had returned to Australia and had not been in contact with him. Wilson said Aaron and Nate had \"a lot of stuff to sort out\", while adding that the characters wanted to be together, but were unsure if they could make it work. He continued, \"Ever since they first met they've always argued about the small suff and they're still doing it now.\" Wilson later commented that as much as they loved each other, they could not live with each other because they were opposites. He also said that the couple complemented one another well, as \"Nate is really closed off, whereas Aaron is a lot more free and happy.\" When Nate eventually returned, he struggled to reconnect with Aaron and was \"gutted\" to learn that Aaron had moved on with someone else while he was away. Wilson added that Aaron resists a reconciliation as he has been hurt.\n\nAfter giving up exotic dancing, Aaron briefly sold coffee and then worked as a bodyguard for \"resident baddie\" Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). However, Aaron struggled to cope with Paul's various schemes. In March 2016, Wilson teased a new darker storyline for Aaron, saying \"I can't talk about it yet but anything where you have to go to the dark places in your mind is really challenging.\" Aaron was later hired to be new mayor Sonya Rebecchi's (Eve Morey) executive assistant, and Wilson joked \"I get to wear a lot of suits from here on in, which is better than wearing next to nothing, which is how I first came on the show.\" Aaron also attracted the attentions of Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger), the development manager for Lassiter's Hotel. Aaron accepted some champagne from Tom, before realising that it could be seen as conflict of interest as Tom wanted to know Sonya's position on the proposed expansion of Lassiter's. Aaron later returned the gift to Tom, who made an advance on Aaron. As he was hurting over Nate's silence, Aaron agreed to go on a date with Tom. Following the success of the first date, Aaron and Tom went on another and Tom learnt that approval for the Lassiter's expansion could take months. He persuaded Aaron to give him a list of everyone opposed to the expansion and when Aaron discovered they had withdrawn their opposition, he knew he had \"crossed the ethical line.\"\n\nTom then used Aaron's laptop to doctor an environmental impact report, leading the council to approve the development. Aaron then realised Tom had taken advantage of him and told Sonya, who fired him. Shortly after, an explosion at the Lassiter's Hotel dominated the show's storylines and Aaron was shown to have \"a guilty conscience\" over something. Aaron was later \"anxious\" to know if Tom was okay, as he had not been since that day. After hearing that Tom's ID had been found in the wreckage, Aaron feared that he was dead and tried to push Nate away. But when Nate pressed him, Aaron admitted that if Tom was dead, then it was down to him. In an interview with Carena Crawford of \"All About Soap\", Wilson detailed the events in the lead up to the explosion, saying \"Aaron knew Tom was dodgy and went on a hunt to find out exactly what was going on. The last time Aaron saw Tom they had a bit of an altercation and got into a fight in the hotel boiler room.\" Wilson went on to explain that Aaron hit Tom and then walked away, leaving Tom in a semi-conscious state. When the boiler room exploded shortly afterwards, Aaron believed that Tom had been killed.\n\nIn what was billed as \"a tense storyline\", Aaron began receiving threatening text message from an unknown sender who knew what he did to Tom. Aaron initially tried to keep the messages to himself, but he was \"freaking out\" as he could be charged with manslaughter or murder if his secret came out. Nate believed Tom's mother Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) might be behind the messages, as she had been asking Aaron a lot of questions about the day of the explosion and his relationship with Tom. However, once Nate discovered it was not Julie, Aaron thought that it would be best if he went to the police. Wilson told Carena Crawford of \"All About Soap\", \"Aaron's finding it hard to walk around Erinsborough thinking that he's killed someone.\" The person behind the messages soon demanded $10,000 from Aaron, giving Nate a chance to set up a trap. He hid some money in an envelope at an old well and when they mystery person picked it up, they caught him. The person behind the messages turned out to be Tom, and Wilson said Aaron experienced \"really mixed emotions\" when he saw him. Aaron really believed he had killed someone and was facing time in prison and when he realised that was not going to happen, he wanted to stop Tom. Aaron then declared that he was going to tell Mark, but Nate warned him that he could still face charges for punching Tom.\n\nIn 2016, producers introduced the Tanaka twins David (Takaya Honda) and Leo (Tim Kano), who move to Erinsborough. Aaron is initially attracted to Leo, while his friend Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) likes David. Aaron organises a night out at the Back Lane Bar in the city for the group, where Aaron realises that Leo is straight and interested in Amy. Aaron leaves the bar early, but he later sets up Amy and David on a date. However, he shares an \"intense moment\" with David, leading him to believe that David is gay. He goes to warn Amy, but is too late and she goes on her date with David. Aaron later confronts David, who insists that he is not gay and that he likes Amy. Aaron later helps organises a day out for David's great-grandmother Kazuko Sano (Linda Chin) and they bond. Aaron also urges David to question Kazuko about his biological father, but David is hurt by Kazuko's angry reaction. Aaron tries to apologise to David, but David thinks he is making romantic advances towards him and insults Aaron's homosexuality. He later apologises and they share another moment.\n\nAfter realising that he should embrace his sexuality, David goes to Number 24 late at night to see Aaron and potentially confess his feelings for him. But in a storyline twist, Aaron admits that he is not alone and actually has another man in his room, causing David to leave quickly. David comes out and realises he has feelings for Aaron. They spend ANZAC Day together, but when David tries to kiss Aaron, he is rejected. Wilson said that Aaron is not expecting the kiss, as he was thinking about Nate at the time. David feels embarrassed and runs off, which Wilson thought was true to the character. He explained, \"They are pretty much opposites – Aaron will always stand and fight, whereas David always chooses flight.\" In an interview on Tenplay, Wilson explains that while Aaron does have feelings for David, he knows that David needs to deal with his sexuality and have some fun first. Aaron hopes that David will return to him eventually. Wilson liked the pairing of Aaron and David, calling them \"a great couple\", and he thought they could get married in the future.\n\nA few months later, Aaron and David begin a relationship. Wilson said it was getting increasingly harder for Aaron to be without David, as he explores his sexuality, as Aaron was in love with him. Wilson also pointed out that it was obvious to everyone else that the pair should be a couple. David's brother Leo \"becomes sick of the guys misreading each other’s signals\" and forces Aaron to tell David about his feelings for him during a karaoke event at The Waterhole. Wilson said the couple's relationship would have \"great potential\" for future storylines.\n\nA month after Aaron's arrival, the Brennan brothers' father Russell Brennan (Russell Kiefel) was introduced and the family became the focus of a \"controversial\" domestic violence storyline. Russell abused his sons as they were growing up and the brothers later became estranged from him. Russell wants to prove that he is a changed man. While Mark is pleased to see his father, Tyler tries to avoid him, and Aaron is thinks about Russell's negative reaction upon learning he had a gay son. Russell makes plans to buy the local garage with his sons, but Tyler is still unhappy to be reunited with him. When Tyler punches Russell, he eventually tells Aaron and Mark about the abuse he had suffered at the hands of their father. Mark is initially sceptical, until he talks with Aaron and they confront Russell, who does not deny the accusations. Aaron and Mark support their younger brother and ask Russell to leave town.\n\nProducers planned to bring Russell back, but the storyline had to be rewritten due to Kiefel's unexpected death. In 2017, it was announced the Brennan brothers' mother Fay Brennan (Zoe Bertram) would be introduced instead. Wilson said that the brothers have various issues with their mother and Aaron acts \"very out of character\" towards her. Wilson enjoyed exploring the family dynamic further, as well as playing Aaron's unpredictable reaction to her arrival. He also said some viewers would be able to relate to the issues that Aaron and his mother have. Aaron later admits to his partner, David, that he resents Fay for leaving the family, as he was just thirteen years old and trying to deal with his sexuality. David encourages Aaron to resolve his issues with his mother, and Wilson stated that Aaron and Fay would \"go through the whole process of resolving that.\" \n\nThe following year, Aaron, Mark and Tyler's younger sister Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) was introduced. Chloe's backstory states that when Russell and Fay's marriage ended, she went to live with her mother, while the brothers stayed with Russell. The siblings only saw each other during the holidays and at Christmas. Chloe comes to Erinsborough in an attempt to reconnect with Aaron and Mark.\n\nWhen Josh learns Aaron is looking for someone else to join his dance act, he auditions for the place, as he needs to raise money for an operation for his sick daughter. Aaron and Josh then form an exotic dance duo called The Heat. Josh is \"terrified\" when The Heat receive their first booking, a 50th birthday party at the community centre. Aaron and Josh put together a routine on the day and while the performance starts off \"a bit rough\", the female audience enjoy it. Aaron also enjoys the attention, while Josh receives an indecent proposal from a member of the audience. Bonner said that he and Wilson had dance lessons at the Ministry of Dance for the scenes.\n\nNeeding another job, Aaron decides to reinvent himself as a social media manager in mid-2016. He befriends his neighbour Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) upon learning that she is being bullied online by trolls. When Aaron realises that Xanthe is trying to lose weight and change her appearance, he becomes her mentor and tells her to ignore the trolls. Aaron then launches his own brand management company and Nate helps fund it. Just as Aaron starts to feel disheartened, Paul Robinson asks Aaron to help him clear his name after he is charged with causing the Lassiter's explosion. Paul explains that he just wants to change public opinion of him and Aaron agrees to help. He comes up with a strategy to use social media, as traditional media sources will not touch the story. Aaron convinces Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) to interview Paul for her vlog.\n\nIn 2017, Aaron explores another new career when he teams up with Mishti Sharma (Scarlet Vas) to purchase and run a gym. Aaron and Mishti bond over their respective interests in fitness, and when they learn that a local gym, The Shed, is for sale, they decide to purchase it together. The pair are \"left disappointed\" when the gym is sold to someone else, however, when that sale falls through, Mishti puts in an offer, which is accepted. When Mishti goes to tell Aaron what she has done, she learns that he does not want to buy the business anymore. But Aaron changes his mind when Sonya gives him a \"confidence boost\" by pointing out how his friendly persona and love of fitness would make him a great gym owner. Of Mishti's bond with Aaron, Vas commented, \"I think her friendship with Aaron is really cute. They're different, but fitness brings them together. Plus it's so much fun working with Matt Wilson [Aaron]. He's the kindest person.\"\n\nFor his portrayal of Aaron, Wilson received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the 2018 \"Inside Soap\" Awards. Aaron and David's partnership was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 \"Digital Spy\" Reader Awards.\n\nShannon Molloy of news.com.au observed that Aaron made a \"colourful and abrupt entrance\". While an \"Inside Soap\" writer stated \"Let's just say that the hunky new Brennan brother, Aaron, makes quite an entrance…\" Another contributor to the publication wrote that the character \"made quite the impression\". Anthony D. Langford from TheBacklot.com admitted to being surprised that the producers had made one of the Brennan brothers gay. He also questioned whether Aaron's love life would be \"as messy and complicated as his brothers' tend to be\" and hoped Wilson had been cast for more than his body and appearance.\n\nClaire Crick from \"All About Soap\" was pleased to meet the latest Brennan brother, commenting \"We've been waiting for weeks in the \"All About Soap\" office, and as of today Aaron Brennan is finally on our screens. Hurrah! And he certainly arrived with a bang, didn't he?\" Crick went on to say that Aaron was a mix of his two brothers' personalities and a good dancer. She also branded him \"lovely Aaron\". Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly dubbed the character \"Erinsborough's nice guy\". While Will Stroude of \"Attitude\" labelled him \"Ramsay Street's ravishing new resident\" and \"Mark and Tyler's mischievous middle brother\". Aaron's arrival was named one of \"the best bits of July\" by a writer for the \"Inside Soap Yearbook 2016\".\n\nLangford, now writing for \"TVSource Magazine\", said that he was not a fan of Aaron's relationship with Nate. He found the pairing to be lacking in chemistry and \"terribly boring\". He added \"I just don't believe a guy like Aaron would date a total downer like Nate.\" A \"Soap World\" columnist named Aaron the Best New Male Character during their feature on the highs and lows of soap operas in 2015. The columnist wrote, \"As we got to know Aaron, there was even more to like as he made his mark with his cheeky and playful personality. In a refreshing change, the very masculine looking Aaron turned out to be gay, proving that you can't always judge a book by its cover.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27858350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27858350", "title": "Academies Act 2010", "text": "Academies Act 2010\n\nThe Academies Act 2010 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It aims to make it possible for all publicly funded schools in England to become academies, still publicly funded but with a vastly increased degree of autonomy in issues such as setting teachers' wages and diverging from the National Curriculum. The Act is inspired by the Swedish free school system. Journalist Mike Baker described it as a \"recreation of grant-maintained schools\".\n\nIt was among the first government bills introduced in the 55th United Kingdom Parliament by the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government. The bill was presented by Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford in the House of Lords, where it had its third reading on 13 July. It was read a third time in the House of Commons on 26 July. The Act received Royal Assent on the following day and was brought into force in the most part on 29 July.\n\nAngela Harrison, education correspondent for the BBC, has said that the Act \"could be the most radical overhaul of schools in England for a generation\".\n\nAn Academy may be set up under section 1 of the Act by virtue of an agreement between the Secretary of State for Education and any other person. Alternatively, maintained schools may be converted into academies by an Academy Order made under section 4 of the Act, provided that the governing body of the school has applied under section 3 or the school is eligible for intervention under sections 60-62 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. Academies established under section 1 will be charities in addition to receiving funding from the central government. Academies will also be free to set their own curriculum, as long as it is \"broad and balanced\" meeting the standards set in section 78 of the Education Act 2002. The Act will only affect schools in England.\n\nPrior to the 2010 General Election there were 203 academies in England. After the election the new Education Secretary Michael Gove sent a letter to all publicly funded schools inviting them to become academies. Within three weeks, 70% of all outstanding secondary schools expressed interest. Of the 1,567 schools initially expressing interest, 828 were rated \"outstanding\" and could be fast-tracked into academies by September 2010. An analysis of the list applicants for academy status by the \"Times Educational Supplement\" reported that the list was \"dominated\" by schools from middle class areas, particularly the Home Counties. For example, 12% of schools in Kent applied compared to less than 2% in Middlesbrough. A later list published by the Department for Education said a total of 1,907 schools had expressed an interest.\n\nBy 23 July 2010, 153 schools in England had applied for academy status. The list included 12 faith schools and more than 20 grammar schools. Ultimately, 32 new academies (including seven primary schools) opened under the provisions of the Act in the autumn term of 2010. A further 110 schools (including 40 primaries) are planned to convert at a later date. By January 2011 a total of 407 primary and secondary schools with academy status existed (twice as many as before the 2010 election), with the 371 secondary academies representing 11% of the total number of secondary schools.\n\nOpposition MPs and the Conservative chair of the Education Select Committee Graham Stuart accused the government of \"rushing\" the bill through Parliament, to which the government replied that there was \"ample time\" to debate the bill. Julian Glover said the \"rush hides not the enormity but the thinness of the measure; opposition outrage enhancing the impression that something big must be under way\" and the Act \"concedes no new powers of any importance\".\n\nThe Act aims to enshrine greater freedoms for schools given academy status. Janet Daley says this will liberate schools from \"monolithic local authority control\" while journalist Toby Young said the Act will revitalise the goal of the existing academies system to provide an increased level of choice for parents. Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Buckingham said that the plan to increase autonomy for a select number of schools will be divisive and disadvantaged children would lose out. Supporters say that the \"pupil premium\" (which is not included within the Academies Act but will be brought forward in forthcoming legislation) will countermand this by allocating extra funds for schools with a greater intake of disadvantaged children.\n\nCriticism of provisions in the Act have also come from the British Humanist Association, the Local Government Information Unit, the Liberal Democrat Education Association teachers' unions, the Campaign for Science and Engineering, the Institute of Education and Sir Peter Newsam, former Chief Schools Adjudicator. The element of the Act which eliminates the requirement for there to be local consultation was criticised as undemocratic by education lawyers and the National Governors' Association. The National Grammar Schools Association warned grammar schools against becoming academies, saying that \"there are fears that academies may not be legally defined as 'maintained' schools, in which case they may lose the statutory protection of requiring a parental ballot before they are turned into comprehensive schools.\"\n\n"}

In 2013 he was Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack Visiting Professor of Australian Studies at the Institut für Englische Philologie, Freie Universität Berlin.\n\nMilner was born in Leeds, UK, the son of John Milner and Dorothy Ibbotson. He was educated at Batley Grammar School and later at the London School of Economics, where he studied sociology. He graduated with a B.Sc (Econ) degree, with honours in Sociology, in 1972 and a Ph.D. in the Sociology of Literature in 1977. He married Verity Burgmann, the Australian political scientist and labour historian, in 1977. They have three sons.\n\nMilner was politically active, by turn, in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Labour Party Young Socialists, the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign, the International Socialists, the Socialist Workers Party (Britain) and, in Australia, People for Nuclear Disarmament. In the early 21st century he appears to have joined the Australian Greens.\n\nMilner's academic interests include literary and cultural theory, the sociology of literature, utopia, dystopia and science fiction. His work has been published in English in Australia, India, the US and the UK and has been translated into French, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Persian and Korean. He first attracted attention for work, strongly influenced by Lucien Goldmann, on the sociology of 17th-century literature. Subsequently he has become better known for his advocacy of Raymond Williams's cultural materialism and for studies of utopian and dystopian science fiction. He also has a strong interest in the cultural sociology of Pierre Bourdieu.\n\nAndrew Milner began his academic career teaching Sociology at the London School of Economics in 1972. He subsequently taught in Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London; in Cultural Studies at the University of Leeds; and in the Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies at Monash University, where he was appointed to a chair in 2000. He was Director of the Centre 2001-2003 and Deputy Director 2004-2010. When the University merged its programs in Comparative Literature and English in January 2012 he became Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He retired in 2013 and was appointed Professor Emeritus before proceeding to a position in English at the Freie Universität Berlin. He also held visiting appointments in the Centre for Philosophy and Literature at the University of Warwick, the Theory, Culture and Society Centre at Nottingham Trent University, the School of English at the University of Liverpool and the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies at the University of Warwick.\n\nMilner’s first book, \"John Milton and the English Revolution\", was an application of Goldmann’s 'genetic structuralist' sociology of literature to the political, philosophical and poetical writings of John Milton, the great poet of the English Revolution. It argued that the seventeenth-century revolutionary crisis had witnessed the creation and subsequent destruction of a rationalist world vision, which found political expression in the political practice of 'Independency'. A detailed analysis of \"Paradise Lost\", \"Paradise Regained\" and \"Samson Agonistes\" interpreted the poems as articulating distinct and separate responses to the problem of defeat, whether actual or potential, and to the triumph of unreason over reason. \"Literature, Culture and Society\" was published in two editions, the first in 1996 and the second, very substantially revised, in 2005. Both develop a substantive account of the capitalist literary mode of production, focussing on technologies of mechanical reproduction and social relations of commodification. The differences between editions are evidence of Milner’s growing interest in comparative literature and science fiction studies. Two of the additional case-studies in the second edition reflect both interests, a third the latter alone.\n\nMilner’s concern with Williams’s theoretical legacy inspired \"Cultural Materialism\", published in 1993, and \"Re-Imagining Cultural Studies\", published in 2002. Both traced the continuing influence on literary and cultural studies of the kinds of cultural materialism developed by Williams and his successors. They also stressed the differences between Williams and Richard Hoggart, arguing that the label 'culturalism' could not properly be applied to both. Milner argued that Williams had stood in an essentially analogous relation to the British 'culturalist' tradition as Bourdieu and Michel Foucault to French structuralism and Jürgen Habermas to German critical theory. Cultural materialism was therefore best understood, not as culturalist, but rather as positively 'post-culturalist'. In 2010 Milner published, under the title \"Tenses of Imagination\", an edited collection of Williams’s writings on utopia, dystopia and science fiction.\n\n\"Locating Science Fiction\" is arguably Milner’s most important, potentially paradigm-shifting, book. Academic literary criticism had tended to locate science fiction primarily in relation to the older genre of utopia; fan criticism primarily in relation to fantasy and science fiction in other media, especially film and television; popular fiction studies primarily in relation to such contemporary genres as the romance novel and the thriller. Milner’s book relocates science fiction in relation not only to these other genres and media, but also to the historical and geographic contexts of its emergence and development. \"Locating Science Fiction\" sought to move science fiction theory and criticism away from the prescriptively abstract dialectics of cognition and estrangement associated with Fredric Jameson and Darko Suvin, and towards an empirically grounded understanding of what is actually a messy amalgam of texts, practices and artefacts. Inspired by Williams, Bourdieu and Franco Moretti’s application of world systems theory to literary studies, it drew on the disciplinary competences of comparative literature, cultural studies, critical theory and sociology to produce a powerfully distinctive mode of analysis, engagement and argument. The concluding chapter is preoccupied with environmentalist thematics occasioned by Milner’s growing interest in Green politics.\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are nonprofit organizations, and many are run by volunteers or by very small professional staffs.\n\nInternational professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries, and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007. Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.\n\nThe first children's museum in the world was the Brooklyn Children's Museum, founded in 1899. The next five in order of their founding were:\n\n\nBy 1975, there were approximately 38 children's museums in the United States. An additional 80 institutions opened between 1976 and 1990, and more than 130 opened between 1990 and 2007. As of 2007, ACM estimated that there were approximately 80 children's museums in the planning phase.\n\nThe children's museum concept has spread worldwide from the United States. Le Musée des Enfants in Brussels was started in 1978, inspired by Boston Children's Museum. The Boston museum also inspired the Museo Pambata in Manila, which opened in 1994. The Children's Museum of Caracas, Venezuela, became Latin America's first museum for children when it opened in 1982. The Children's Museum of Bogotá, Colombia, followed it in 1986. Eureka! The National Children's Museum in Halifax, England, established in 1992, claims the title of the United Kingdom's first hands-on children's museum. Austria's first museum for children was ZOOM Children’s Museum in Vienna, established in 1994. Korea's first children's museum is the Samsung Children's Museum in Seoul, which opened in 1995 under the sponsorship of the Samsung Culture Foundation. India has seen rise in children's museums in recent years. The first children’s museum in Japan is KIDS PLAZA OSAKA which was established in 1997. There is a children’s Museum in the Canadian Museum of History. The Early Start Discovery Space in Wollongong, Australia opened in 2015 and was modelled on the US-styled children's museums. \n\n"}

He was a 1982 graduate of the College of Business Administration at University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a degree in Finance and Real Estate. As a real estate investor, doing business as Ramsey Investments, Inc., he built a rental real estate portfolio worth more than $4 million by 1986. The bank that was financing his real estate was sold to a larger bank who demanded immediate repayment on the loans. He was unable to pay, and eventually filed bankruptcy in September 1988.\n\nAfter recovering financially, Ramsey began counseling couples at his local church. He attended workshops and seminars on consumer financial problems. Ramsey developed a set of lessons and materials based partially on his own experience and partially on works and teachings by Larry Burkett, Ron Blue and Art Williams of the A.L. Williams company, now Primerica. In 1992 he wrote his first book, \"Financial Peace\".\n\nRamsey is a devout Christian. He has been married to his wife, Sharon, for over 30 years. They have three children, and reside in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nRamsey's syndicated radio program, \"The Dave Ramsey Show\", is heard on more than 500 radio stations throughout the United States and Canada, in podcast format, on IHeartRadio, the Dave Ramsey Show iOS application, live on YouTube, as well as live audio and video on DaveRamsey.com. He has written numerous books including five \"New York Times\" bestsellers. His books and broadcasts advocate a fiscally disciplined approach to personal and household finances, including the strict management of debt, and often feature a Christian perspective. Ramsey was named the 2009 Marconi Award winner for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year, and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nHis company, The Lampo Group, Inc., headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, oversees six divisions geared toward financial education.\n\nRamsey has been featured on many media outlets including \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"60 Minutes\", and \"The Early Show\". He recorded a pilot and six unaired episodes of \"The Dave Ramsey Project\" for CBS. He was the host of the television program \"The Dave Ramsey Show\", which aired on the Fox Business Network until June 2010.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Ramsey started his radio career by co-hosting \"The Money Game\" with Roy Matlock of Primerica. Over time, this local show on one radio station in Nashville turned into \"The Dave Ramsey Show.\" With a combined listenership of over 12 million weekly, the show is available on more than 575 radio stations and other channels. In 2007, the Fox Business Network launched a television show under the same title, but canceled the show in June 2010.\n\nRamsey founded his company, The Lampo Group, Inc., in 1992 (now called Ramsey Solutions), initially helping people one-on-one who were struggling with financial issues. In 1994, he hired Russ Carroll, Ramsey's lead financial counselor, and together they began teaching the first Financial Peace University classes on overhead projectors. Between 1999 and 2004, The Lampo Group grew from 18 to 105 team members. There are currently over 500 team members.\n\nRamsey is the creator of Financial Peace University, a biblically based training series for adults that integrates video teaching, class discussions, and small group activities. In 2013, he launched a followup program, The Legacy Journey. This course is a biblically based training series for adults focused on \"what's next?\" after getting out of debt.\n\nRamsey coined the word EntreLeadership to describe the responsibilities of a small business owner as an entrepreneur, and used it as the name of a small business conference. Ramsey released the book \"EntreLeadership\" in 2011. It made the New York Times Bestseller's list nearly overnight.\n\nEveryDollar is a budgeting tool that was created by Ramsey Solutions, available online, on iOS, and Android. Users list all sources of income and they give every dollar a name for the month, based on zero-based budgeting.\n\nRamsey supports the debt snowball method, where debtors pay off their lowest balance debt first instead of paying off their highest interest rate debt first. While this approach has been criticized by some, such as NerdWallet.com, research done by the Kellogg School of Management has found that the debt snowball method is generally effective. The small victories give debtors motivation. A 2016 study by Harvard Business School found that people who used the snowball method to pay off their smallest account first, paid down more of their debt than those who used other methods.\n\nRamsey claims that investors can get a 12% average annual return, which is the rate he uses in financial analyses. Ann Carrns responded that using an average annual return rate is misleading and that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement for planning investments. Helaine Olen, author of the book \"Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry\" quoted in \"Yahoo Finance\" stated that a 12% return is unrealistically high. According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.\n\nRamsey recommends investors to hold all their investments in stock mutual funds, but their volatility increases risk compared to bonds. He recommends that retirees withdraw 8% of their retirement fund each year, contrary to the generally recommended 4%.\n\nIn 2010, Ramsey received criticism on social media sites for building a large and lavish home. He responded that the cost of the home was paid in cash, represented a very low percentage of his net worth, and had already been used to host many fundraisers for ministries, charities and community causes.\n\n\n\n\"The Total Money Makeover\", \"Financial Peace Revisited\", and \"More than Enough\" have been translated into Spanish.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n"}

{"id": "1522498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1522498", "title": "Education in North Korea", "text": "Education in North Korea\n\nEducation in North Korea is universal and state-funded schooling by the government. The self-reported national literacy rate for citizens at age of 15 and older is 100 percent (approx.). Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to university.\n\nIn 1988 the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that North Korea had 35,000 preprimary, 59,000 primary, 111,000 secondary, 23,000 college and university, and 4,000 other postsecondary teachers.\n\nFormal education has played a central role in the social and cultural development of both traditional Korea and contemporary North Korea. During the Joseon Dynasty, the royal court established a system of schools that taught Confucian subjects in the provinces as well as in four central secondary schools in the capital. There was no state-supported system of primary education.\n\nDuring the 15th century, state-supported schools declined in quality and were supplanted in importance by private academies, the seowon, centers of a Neo-Confucian revival in the 16th century. Higher education was provided by the Seonggyungwan, the Confucian national university, in Seoul. Its enrollment was limited to 200 students who had passed the lower civil-service examinations and were preparing for the highest examinations.\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed major educational changes. The seowon were abolished by the central government. Christian missionaries established modern schools that taught Western curricula. Among them was the first school for women, Ehwa Woman's University, established by American Methodist missionaries as a primary school in Seoul in 1886. During the last years of the dynasty, as many as 3,000 private schools that taught modern subjects to both sexes were founded by missionaries and others. Most of these schools were concentrated in the northern part of Korea.[3]\n\nAfter Japan annexed Korea in 1910, the colonial regime established an educational system with two goals: to give Koreans a minimal education designed to train them for subordinate roles in a modern economy and make them loyal subjects of the emperor; and to provide a higher-quality education for Japanese expatriates who had settled in large numbers on the Korean Peninsula.[3]\n\nThe Japanese invested more resources in the latter, and opportunities for Koreans were severely limited. A state university modeled on Tokyo Imperial University was established in Seoul in 1923, but the number of Koreans allowed to study there never exceeded 40 percent of its enrollment; the rest of its students were Japanese. Private universities, including those established by missionaries such as Sungsil College in Pyongyang and Chosun Christian College in Seoul, provided other opportunities for Koreans desiring higher education.[3]\n\nAfter the establishment of North Korea, an education system modeled largely on that of the Soviet Union was established. According to North Korean sources, at the time of North Korea's establishment, two-thirds of school-age children did not attend primary school, and most adults, numbering 2.3 million, were illiterate. In 1950, primary education became compulsory for children. The outbreak of the Korean War, however, delayed attainment of this goal; universal primary education was not achieved until 1956. By 1958 North Korean sources claimed that seven-year compulsory primary and secondary education had been implemented.[4]\n\nIn 1959 \"state-financed universal education\" was introduced in all schools; not only instruction and educational facilities, but also textbooks, uniforms, and room and board are provided to students without charge. By 1967 nine years of education became compulsory. In 1975 the compulsory eleven-year education system, which includes one year of preschool education and ten years of primary and secondary education, was implemented; that system remains in effect as of 1993. According to a 1983 speech given by Kim Il Sung to education ministers of nonaligned countries in Pyongyang, universal, compulsory higher education was to be introduced \"in the near future.\"At that time, students had no school expenses; the state paid for the education of almost half of at the time North Korea's population of 18.9 million.[4]\n\nIn 2012 Chief Kim Jong Un has advocated that North Korea should expand its compulsory education from 11 years to 12 years. According to Joong Ang News in North Korea, a bill to expand its compulsory education was passed last September 2012. Prior to this reformation, North Korea had eleven years of free education system which consisted of one year of kindergarten, four years of elementary school and six years of secondary school prior to college. After reformation, now, it resembles education system in South Korea which consists of six years of elementary school, three years of middle school and three years of high school.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the compulsory primary and secondary education system was divided into one year of kindergarten, four years of primary school (people's school) for ages six to nine, and six years of senior middle school (secondary school) for ages ten to fifteen. There are two years of kindergarten, for children aged four to six, only the second year (upper level kindergarten) is compulsory.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, there were 9,530 primary and secondary schools. After graduating from people's school, students enter either a regular secondary school or a special secondary school that concentrates on music, art, or foreign languages. These schools teach both their specialties and general subjects. The Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute where the children of the North Korean elite are prepared for service as officers in the Korean People’s Army is an important special school where modern training in economics and computers is stressed as is the Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School.\n\nIn senior middle schools, politically oriented subjects, including the \"Great Kim Il Sung\" and \"Communist Morality\" as well as \"Communist Party Policy,\" comprise only 5.8 percent of instruction.\n\nOutside the formal structure of schools and classrooms is \"social education.\" This education includes extracurricular activities, family life, and the range of human relationships in North Korean society. Attention is paid to the influence of the social environment on the growing child and its role in the development of his or her character.\n\nThe idea of social education is to provide a carefully controlled environment in which children are insulated from unplanned influences. According to a North Korean official interviewed in 1990, \"School education is not enough to turn the rising generation into men of knowledge, virtue, and physical fitness. After school, our children have many spare hours. So it's important to efficiently organize their afterschool education.\"\n\nIn his 1977 \"Theses on Socialist Education\", Kim Il Sung described the components of social education. In the Young Pioneer Corps and the Socialist Youth League, young people learn the nature of collective and organizational life in North Korea. Some prepare for membership in the Korean Workers' Party. In students' and schoolchildren's halls and palaces, managed by the SWYL Central Committee, young people participate in many extracurricular activities after school.\n\nThere are cultural facilities such as libraries and museums, monuments and historical sites of the Korean revolution, and mass media dedicated to serving the goals of social education. Huge, lavishly appointed \"schoolchildren's palaces\" with gymnasiums and theaters have been built in P'yongyang, Mangyongdae, and other sites. The palaces provide political lectures and seminars, debating contests, poetry recitals, and scientific forums. The Students' and Children's Palace in P'yongyang attracted some 10,000 children daily in the early 1990s.\n\nNorth Korea compares their system of education to the ideal standards espoused by international guidelines such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).\n\nInstitutions of higher education include colleges and universities; teachers' training colleges, with a four-year course for preparing kindergarten, primary, and secondary instructors; colleges of advanced technology with two or three-year courses; medical schools with six-year courses; special colleges for science and engineering, art, music, and foreign languages; and military colleges and academies. Kim Il Sung's report to the Sixth Party Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in October 1980 revealed that there were 170 \"higher learning institutions\" and 480 \"higher specialized schools\" that year.\n\nIn 1987 there were 220,000 students attending two- or three-year higher specialized schools and 301,000 students attending four- to six-year colleges and university courses. According to Eberstadt and Banister, 13.7 percent of the population sixteen years of age or older was attending, or had graduated from, institutions of higher education in 1987-88. In 1988 the regime surpassed its target of producing \"an army of 1.3 million intellectuals,\" graduates of higher education, a major step in the direction of achieving the often-stated goal of \"intellectualization of the whole society.\" \n\nEvery university in North Korea has to receive certain percentage (twenty to thirty) of discharged soldiers (served longer than three years) or workers (employed longer than five years).\n\nKim Il Sung University, founded in October 1946, is the country's only comprehensive institution of higher education offering bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. Its enrollment of 16,000 full- and part-time students in the early 1990s occupies, in the words of one observer, the \"pinnacle of the North Korean educational and social system.\" Competition for admission is intense.\n\nAccording to a Korean–American scholar who visited the university in the early 1980s, only one student is admitted out of every five or six applicants. An important criterion for admission is senior middle school grades, although political criteria are also major factors in selection. A person wishing to gain acceptance to any institution of higher education has to be nominated by the local \"college recommendation committee\" before approval by county- and provincial-level committees.\n\nKim Il-Sung University's colleges and faculties include economics, history, philosophy, law, foreign languages and literature, geography, physics, mathematics, chemistry, nuclear power, biology, and computer science. There are about 3,000 faculty members, including teaching and research staff. All facilities are located on a modern, high-rise campus in the northern part of P'yongyang.\n\nOther notable universities include Kim Chaek University of Technology and the University of Natural Science, which focuses on computer science and natural science related to mass nuclear research. Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, trains working level diplomats and trade officials, and Kim Hyong Jik University trains teachers.\n\nChoson Exchange, a non-profit organization founded by Harvard, Yale, Wharton School and Singaporean graduate students, also runs consulting and training programs in Finance, Business and Economics with Kim Il Sung University and the State Development Bank in North Korea. Their programs target North Koreans under the age of 40 and combine OpenCourseWare materials and on-site lectures to deliver year-round training.\n\nPyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), which opened in 2010, is the country's only joint venture institute of higher learning, founded, funded and operated by Evangelical Church groups and people from both North and South Korea, as well as China and the USA. It plans to recruit around 200 Master and PhD level students annually, from both Koreas, and with half of faculty hired from universities and research institutes abroad. At this university, courses will be taught in Korean and English. In addition, the Pyongyang Business School offers short courses given by foreign lecturers. It was founded by the Swiss government and helps teach students business management. Another economic educational institution is the Centre for the Study of the Capitalist System, established in 2000.\n\nThe remote universities obtained media attention while encrypting lesson plans and communicating them by a method of a radio broadcasting in 2016.\n\nBecause of the emphasis on the continued education of all members of society, adult or work-study education is actively supported. Practically everyone in the country participates in some educational activity, usually in the form of \"small study groups.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, people in rural areas were organized into \"five-family teams.\" These teams have educational and surveillance functions; the teams are the responsibility of a schoolteacher or other intellectual, each one being in charge of several such teams. Office and factory workers have two-hour \"study sessions\" after work each day on both political and technical subjects.\n\nAdult education institutions in the early 1990s included \"factory colleges\", which teach workers new skills and techniques without forcing them to quit their jobs. Students work part-time, study in the evening, or take short intensive courses, leaving their workplaces for only a month or so. There are also \"farm colleges\", where rural workers can study to become engineers and assistant engineers, and a system of correspondence courses. For workers and peasants who are unable to receive regular school education, there are \"laborers' schools\" and \"laborers' senior middle schools,\" although in the early 1990s these had become less important with the introduction of compulsory eleven-year education. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "39506967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39506967", "title": "Education in personalized medicine", "text": "Education in personalized medicine\n\nPersonalized medicine involves medical treatments based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their medical history, family history, and genetics. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in medical genetics among physicians and the general public. For example, pharmacogenomics (genetic factors influencing drug response) is practiced worldwide by only a limited number of pharmacists, although most pharmacy colleges in the United States now include it in their curriculum. It is also increasingly common for genetic testing to be offered directly to consumers, who subsequently seek out educational materials and bring their results to their doctors. Issues involving genetic testing also invariably lead to ethical and legal concerns, such as the potential for inadvertent effects on family members, increased insurance rates, or increased psychological stress.\n\nAs of 2009, the majority of primary care physicians did not have adequate training in genetics or genomics. Although medical school curricula typically include medical genetics, fewer than half offer a standalone course, and the emphasis on practical applications is weak.\n\nIn the United States, Stanford University was the first medical school in the United States to offer a course teaching the interpretation of genetic data. Students were able to study their own genotypes, determined using commercially available genotyping platforms (23andMe or Navigenics). Although there was skepticism that this would improve educational outcomes, a survey later showed that this had increased students’ enthusiasm for the subject. A similar class is offered at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, launched in 2012, in which students have the option of analyzing their entire genome sequence instead of only their genotype.\n\nIn 2010, the University of California, Berkeley offered entering students a genetic test for SNPs affecting alcohol, lactose, and folate metabolism. The goal was “to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works, the results of the students' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate.” However, criticism of the program led to an informational hearing by the California State Committee on Higher Education, and a bill was introduced by Chris Norby to prevent California state universities from genetically testing their students. The California Department of Public Health concluded that the program constituted clinical testing, and the university released only aggregate information instead of personal results.\n\nAs described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel. The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.\n\n\n"}

Information on Erowid's website is gathered from diverse sources including published literature, experts in related fields, and the experiences of the general public. Erowid acts as a publisher of new information as well as a library for the collection of documents and images published elsewhere.\n\nErowid was founded in April 1995 as a small business; their website appeared six months later. The name \"Erowid\" was chosen to reflect the organization's stated philosophy of education. Using Proto-Indo-European linguistic roots, \"Erowid\" roughly translates into \"Earth Wisdom\" (\"er\" meaning 'earth,' 'exist,' and 'be born' and \"wid\" meaning 'knowledge' / 'wisdom' or 'to see'). In 2005, the 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization \"Erowid Center\" was formed. The organization is supported by donations, and its website is free of advertisements. Although its primary focus is on the website, Erowid Center also provides research and data for other harm reduction, health, and educational organizations. The organization is based in Northern California and the main servers are located in San Francisco.\n\nFire Erowid and Earth Erowid are the sobriquets of the two creators of the site. Both work full-time on the project, along with speaking at conferences, producing original research, and contributing to entheogenic research. According to the site, the creators' vision includes a \"world where people treat psychoactives with respect and awareness; where people work together to collect and share knowledge in ways that strengthen their understanding of themselves and provide insight into the complex choices faced by individuals and societies alike\". Erowid Center's mission is to provide and facilitate access to objective, accurate, and non-judgmental information about psychoactive plants, chemicals, technologies, and related issues. According to one study, \"Erowid is a trusted resource for drug information -- both positive and negative\". and Erowid has been extensively cited worldwide by book authors, scientific and medical journals, newspapers, magazines, film makers, radio and TV shows, PhD students, web sites, and other media producers.\n\nThe library contains over 63,000 documents related to over 350 psychoactive substances, including images, research summaries and abstracts, FAQs, media articles, experience reports, information on chemistry, dosage, effects, law, health, traditional and spiritual use, and drug testing. , over 17 million people visit the site each year.\n\nThe site generally contains more detail in the pages listed under plants and chemicals than in other sections. It does not have comprehensive information about the specific effects of most pharmaceuticals. Such information may appear elsewhere on the site, where one can read about people's individual reactions to various drugs.\n\nErowid allows site visitors to submit descriptions of their own personal experiences with psychoactive substances for review and possible publication. The site states that they welcome all perspectives regarding personal psychoactive experience, including positive, negative and neutral. Their collection consists of more than 30,000 edited, reviewed, and published reports, as well as stating that they have another 55,000 unpublished reports undergoing review.\n\nErowid also runs EcstasyData.org, an independent laboratory pill testing program co-sponsored by IsomerDesign and DanceSafe, which monitors the quality of American street-ecstasy.\n\nLaunched in July 2001, its purpose is to collect, manage, review, and present laboratory pill testing results from a variety of organizations. Tablets of street ecstasy can be anonymously submitted to a DEA licensed laboratory for testing and then photos of the tablets and GC/MS test results are published on the project's website. EcstasyData has published testing results for nearly 3,000 samples. Testing costs have sometimes been covered by project funding (when available) and at other times are covered by those who submit tablets for testing. At least one published study uses EcstasyData.org as primary source of data.\n\n\"Erowid Extracts\", the bi-annual members newsletter of Erowid, has been published each year since 2001. It provides updates on the organization's activities, results of surveys conducted on Erowid.org, experience reports, new articles on various aspects of psychedelic and psychoactive plants and drugs, and information about psychedelic culture and events. New issues of \"Erowid Extracts\" are sent to members, but past issues are available on the Erowid website.\n\nErowid and The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) collaborated on two large reference database projects. Erowid has provided expertise and work developing and coordinating construction of an online Psychoactive drug reference library and MAPS has published a similar collection \n\nErowid Center also archives and provides access to thousands of older texts in their online and physical libraries. By collecting and making these texts available, they attempt to promote an understanding of the changing contexts surrounding the use of psychoactive drugs. Major archiving projects include the Albert Hofmann collection, the Myron Stolaroff Collection, and documents from Alexander Shulgin.\n\nDue to the subject matter presented on Erowid.org, the site has drawn praise and criticism from both the media and medical officials. American physician and broadcaster Dean Edell often recommends Erowid to listeners interested in learning about drugs and drug use. On the other hand, Edward Boyer, an emergency-room physician and toxicologist, while admitting that Erowid has a plethora of useful information, once argued the site may cause more harm than good to potential drug users. \"Though Boyer has since come to cautiously admire Earth and Fire, and no longer refers to their site as 'partisan,' he still argues that Erowid minimizes adverse effects and includes too much dodgy – and potentially harmful – data in its quest to present all sides. 'Erowid is so comprehensive, and so much of the information is correct, that unless you're an expert in medical toxicology you may miss the dangerous information that's close to the surface.'\" In the context of this debate, anthropologist Nicolas Langlitz argued that Erowid also sometimes serves as a mechanism of postmarket surveillance or pharmacovigilance in the realm of illicit and experimental substances.\n\nRussia has blocked access to Erowid.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "530361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=530361", "title": "Hikikomori", "text": "Hikikomori\n\nIn Japan, are reclusive adolescents or adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. \"Hikikomori\" refers to both the phenomenon in general and the recluses themselves. \"Hikikomori\" have been described as loners or \"modern-day hermits\". Estimates suggest that nearly half a million Japanese youth have become social recluses.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare defines \"hikikomori\" as a condition in which the affected individuals isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months. The psychiatrist Tamaki Saitō defines \"hikikomori\" as \"a state that has become a problem by the late twenties, that involves cooping oneself up in one's own home and not participating in society for six months or longer, but that does not seem to have another psychological problem as its principal source\".\n\nMore recently, researchers have developed more specific criteria to more accurately identify \"hikikomori\". During a diagnostic interview, trained clinicians evaluate for:\n\nThe psychiatrist Alan Teo first characterized \"hikikomori\" in Japan as modern-day hermits, while the literary and communication scholar Flavio Rizzo similarly described \"hikikomori\" as \"post-modern hermits\" whose solitude stems from ancestral desires for withdrawal.\n\nWhile the degree of the phenomenon varies on an individual basis, in the most extreme cases, some people remain in isolation for years or even decades. Often \"hikikomori\" start out as school refusers, or in Japanese (an older term is ).\n\nWhile many people feel the pressures of the outside world, \"hikikomori\" react by complete social withdrawal. In some cases, they isolate themselves in their living quarters for prolonged periods, sometimes for years. They usually have few or no friends. In interviews with current or recovering \"hikikomori\", media reports and documentaries have captured the strong levels of psychological distress and angst felt by these individuals. \n\nWhile \"hikikomori\" favour indoor activities, some venture outdoors occasionally. The withdrawal from society usually starts gradually. Affected people may appear unhappy, lose their friends, become insecure and shy, and talk less.\n\nAccording to government figures released in 2010, there are 700,000 individuals living as \"hikikomori\" with an average age of 31. Still, the numbers vary widely among experts. These include the \"hikikomori\" who are now in their 40s and have spent 20 years in isolation. This group is generally referred to as the \"first-generation \"hikikomori\".” There is concern about their reintegration into society in what is known as \"the 2030 Problem,” when they are in their 60s and their parents begin to die. Additionally, the government estimates that 1.55 million people are on the verge of becoming \"hikikomori\". Tamaki Saitō, who first coined the phrase, originally estimated that there may be over one million \"hikikomori\" in Japan, although this was not based on national survey data. Nonetheless, considering that \"hikikomori\" adolescents are hidden away and their parents are often reluctant to talk about the problem, it is extremely difficult to gauge the number accurately.\n\nWhile \"hikikomori\" is mostly a Japanese phenomenon, cases have been found in the United States, Morocco, Oman, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Finland and France. Recent research using the same standardized definition of \"hikikomori\" has found evidence of it existing in other countries as wide-ranging as the United States and India.\n\n\"Hikikomori\" is similar to the social withdrawal exhibited by some people with autism spectrum disorders, a group of disorders that include Asperger syndrome, PDD-NOS and \"classic\" autism. This has led some psychiatrists to suggest that \"hikikomori\" may be affected by autism spectrum disorders and other disorders that affect social integration, but that their disorders are altered from their typical Western presentation because of the social and cultural pressures unique to Japan. Suwa & Hara (2007) discovered that 5 of 27 cases of \"hikikomori\" had a high-functioning pervasive developmental disorder (HPDD), and 12 more had other disorders or mental diseases (6 cases of personality disorders, 3 cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 2 cases of depression, 1 case of slight mental retardation). The researchers used a vignette to illustrate the difference between primary \"hikikomori\" (without any obvious mental disorder) and \"hikikomori\" with HPDD or other disorder; furthermore, 10 out of 27 had primary \"hikikomori\". Alan Teo and colleagues conducted detailed diagnostic evaluations of 22 individuals with \"hikikomori\" and found that while the majority of cases fulfilled criteria for multiple psychiatric conditions, about 1 in 5 cases were primary \"hikikomori\".\n\nAccording to Michael Zielenziger's book, \"Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation\", the syndrome is more closely related to posttraumatic stress disorder. The author claimed that the \"hikikomori\" interviewed for the book had discovered independent thinking and a sense of self that the current Japanese environment could not accommodate.\n\nThe syndrome also closely parallels the terms avoidant personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, or social anxiety disorder (also known as \"social phobia\").\n\nSometimes referred to as a social problem in Japanese discourse, \"hikikomori\" has a number of possible contributing factors. Alan Teo has summarized a number of potential cultural features that may contribute to its predominance in Japan. These include tendencies toward conformity and collectivism, overprotective parenting, and particularities of the educational and economic systems.\n\nAcute social withdrawal in Japan appears to affect both genders equally. However, because of differing social expectations for maturing boys and girls, the most widely reported cases of \"hikikomori\" are from middle- and upper-middle-class families; sons, typically their eldest, refuse to leave the home, often after experiencing one or more traumatic episodes of social or academic failure.\n\nIn \"The Anatomy of Dependence\", Takeo Doi identifies the symptoms of \"hikikomori\", and explains its prevalence as originating in the Japanese psychological construct of \"amae\" (in Freudian terms, \"passive object love\", typically of the kind between mother and infant). Other Japanese commentators such as academic Shinji Miyadai and novelist Ryū Murakami, have also offered analysis of the \"hikikomori\" phenomenon, and find distinct causal relationships with the modern Japanese social conditions of anomie, \"amae\" and atrophying paternal influence in nuclear family child pedagogy. Young adults may feel overwhelmed by modern Japanese society, or be unable to fulfill their expected social roles as they have not yet formulated a sense of personal \"honne\" and \"tatemae\" – one's \"true self\" and one's \"public façade\" – necessary to cope with the paradoxes of adulthood.\n\nThe dominant nexus of \"hikikomori\" centres on the transformation from youth to the responsibilities and expectations of adult life. Indications are that advanced industrialized societies such as modern Japan fail to provide sufficient meaningful transformation rituals for promoting certain susceptible types of youth into mature roles. As do many societies, Japan exerts a great deal of pressure on adolescents to be successful and perpetuate the existing social status quo. A traditionally strong emphasis on complex social conduct, rigid hierarchies and the resulting, potentially intimidating multitude of social expectations, responsibilities and duties in Japanese society contribute to this pressure on young adults. Historically, Confucian teachings de-emphasizing the individual and favouring a conformist stance to ensure social harmony in a rigidly hierarchized society have shaped much of East Asia, possibly explaining the emergence of the \"hikikomori\" phenomenon in other East Asian countries.\n\nIn general, the prevalence of \"hikikomori\" tendencies in Japan may be encouraged and facilitated by three primary factors:\n\nThe Japanese education system, like those found in China, Singapore and South Korea, puts great demands upon youth. A multitude of expectations, high emphasis on competition, and the rote memorization of facts and figures for the purpose of passing entrance exams into the next tier of education in what could be termed a rigid \"pass-or-fail\" ideology, induce a high level of stress. Echoing the traditional Confucian values of society, the educational system is viewed as playing an important part in society's overall productivity and success.\n\nIn this social frame, students often face significant pressure from parents and the society in general to conform to its dictates and doctrines. These doctrines, while part of modern Japanese society, are increasingly being rejected by Japanese youth in varying ways such as \"hikikomori\", freeter, NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education, or Training), and parasite singles. The term \"Hodo-Hodo zoku\" (the \"So-So tribe\") applies to younger workers who refuse promotion to minimize stress and maximize free time.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the pressure on Japanese youth to succeed began successively earlier in their lives, sometimes starting before pre-school, where even toddlers had to compete through an entrance exam for the privilege of attending one of the best pre-schools. This was said to prepare children for the entrance exam of the best kindergarten, which in turn prepared the child for the entrance exam of the best elementary school, junior high school, high school, and eventually for their university entrance exam. Many adolescents take one year off after high school to study exclusively for the university entrance exam, and are known as \"ronin\". More prestigious universities have more difficult exams. The most prestigious university with the most difficult exam is the University of Tokyo.\n\nSince 1996, the Japanese Ministry of Education has taken steps to address this 'pressure-cooker' educational environment and instill greater creative thought in Japanese youth by significantly relaxing the school schedule from six-day weeks to five-day weeks and dropping two subjects from the daily schedule, with new academic curricula more comparable to Western educational models. However, Japanese parents are sending their children to private cram schools, known as \"juku\", to 'make up' for lost time.\n\nAfter graduating from high school or university, Japanese youth also have to face a very difficult job market in Japan, often finding only part-time employment and ending up as freeters with little income, unable to start a family.\n\nAnother source of pressure is from their co-students, who may harass and bully (\"ijime\") some students for a variety of reasons, including physical appearance, wealth, or educational or athletic performance. Some have been punished for bullying or truancy, bringing shame to their families. Refusal to participate in society makes \"hikikomori\" an extreme subset of a much larger group of younger Japanese that includes parasite singles and freeters.\n\nSome organizations such as the non-profit Japanese organization \"NPO lila\" have been trying to combat the financial burden the \"hikikomori\" phenomenon has had on Japan's economy. The Japanese CD and DVD producer Avex Group produces DVD videos of live-action women staring into a camera to help \"hikikomori\" learn to cope with eye contact and long spans of human interaction. The goal is to help \"hikikomori\" reintegrate into society by personal choice, thereby realizing an economic contribution and reducing the financial burden on parents.\n\n\n\n"}

The game's goal is to create movies that sell well.

A pre-release was given to message board members and long-term fans on September 26, 2006. \n\"Hollywood Mogul\" has five difficulty levels to choose from, each with higher annual budgets. A higher annual budget causes higher monthly expenses, making it more difficult to keep the studio profitable, which provides a greater challenge to the player.\n\n\nMovies come in fifteen set genres, ranging from comedy to drama to science fiction, as well as six subgenres such as \"farce\" or \"slapstick\". Movies can rise and fall depending on what genre they are and what time of year they are released.\n\nActing, screenwriting and directing talent also play a great role in the success of a film. More popular talent costs more to hire, but have the benefit of raising the noticeability of a film. Likewise, production budget, special effects budgets and advertising play a big role as well.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s reviewer in April 1994 said that despite \"Hollywood Mogul\"s \"crude visual look ... I have found myself spending dozens of hours as a Hollywood bigwig rather than playing dozens of more expensive and graphically sexy games\". Despite the lack of limited or award season-oriented releases, he concluded that it \"is a fascinating exercise for the detail-oriented gamer\" preferring statistics over action or visuals.

His last name was legally changed after his parents' divorce. His work in military electronics, communications, and spectroscopy culminated in medical electronics and x-ray products with the founding of the company Bio-Imaging Research.\n\nAfter attending schools in Scottsville, Virginia and High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire, Moore received a B.S. in nuclear physics from MIT in three years (where he and Walter Marvin Jr. founded the Tech Model Railroad Club in 1946), and won a National Science Foundation fellowship that led to an M.S. in solid-state physics from Harvard's School of Applied Science. His first full-time employment was at Raytheon in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he worked on radar and telemetry. At Hycon Eastern (Cambridge, Massachusetts; later acquired by Northrop), he moved from classified missile technology to become Systems Manager of a communications design office in Bangkok, Thailand. On his return, he again worked in aircraft and missile telemetry as Director of Research and Engineering at ASCOP (Princeton, New Jersey; later a division of EMR/Schlumberger). In 1960, he joined Lockheed Electronics in Plainfield, New Jersey, where he advanced from Manager of Operations Analysis to Scientific Advisor to the President, while contributing to \"moon-bounce\" communication systems and optical signal processors, and creating an infrared laboratory and corporate acquisition analysis. While there, he was appointed to the Lockheed Corporate Research Council, and also attended Columbia University in New York half-time. For the latter, his Ph.D. thesis proved experimentally that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus has enough greenhouse effect to warm its surface to the spacecraft-observed temperature of over 460 °C (860 °F).\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Moore created new designs in spectroscopy and fluorometry as Director of Product Development at Spex Industries in Metuchen, New Jersey. In 1976 he joined EMI Medical, the inventor of X-ray CT scanning, in Northbrook, Illinois. There, he advanced to Vice-President of Engineering, and built the team that created the first CT scanner to take a picture in under 3 seconds. When EMI got out of the medical electronics business, he founded Bio-Imaging Research (Lincolnshire, Illinois). Initially, BIR created the world's first one-second CT scanner for Toshiba, and then branched into MRI, ultrasound, and industrial x-ray scanners, including the megavolt x-ray systems that inspect trucks and cargo containers at ports and border crossings. He was awarded the Chicago Area High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year in 1987 and 1989. In 2006, he sold BIR's medical division to Toshiba Medical, and in 2007 sold its industrial and security divisions to Varian Medical Systems.\n\nMoore served on several standards committees for medical imaging, and was Chairman of the Surface Weapons Board of the U.S. Naval Research Advisory Committee. He has published and presented numerous papers, including before the World Health Organization in Geneva. He recently retired after 27 years on the board of TC Manufacturing, and consults in medical and radiation physics.\n\nHe had five children (Robin [deceased], Sheila, Marjorie, Deborah [deceased], and Laurel) by his first marriage in 1948 to Joan Elizabeth Sanders (1928–1998), and two children (Jonathan Moore and Cris Moore) by his second marriage in 1963 to Betty-Ann Jorgensen (1938- ).

{"id": "31262284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31262284", "title": "Leader development", "text": "Leader development\n\nLeader development is defined as the \"expansion of a person's capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes\" (McCauley, Van Veslor, & Rudeman, 2010, p. 2). These roles and processes are ones that aid in setting direction, creating alignment and maintaining commitment in groups of people sharing common work. Most organizational leadership research and educational programs have focused on developing individual-based knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with formal leadership roles (human capital) of individuals (Day, 2000). Leader development therefore results by investing in human capital.\n\nWhile there is no specific theory from which leader development derives, developmental theory taps into two aspects of development: learning and change. Development is a form of change and it is impossible for a leader to develop without change occurring (Day & Zacarro, 2004). Learning is defined as the attainment of a permanent change in a person because of practice or experience, which then drives change and development (Day & Zacarro, 2004). Learning stems from two traditions: a permanent change in behavior following experience based on behaviorism, and a change in or creation of new mental models based on Gestalt psychology. Behaviorism allows for performance to be used as an indicator of a leader's behavior. In contrast, Gestalt psychology examines the creation of new mental models that arise from experience, which can help a leader develop their intrapersonal competence. Together, behaviorism and Gestalt traditions are thought to be complementary in the fact that development comes from both changing mental models and creating new behaviors (Hogan and Warrenfeltz, 2003).\n\nLeader development is described as one aspect of the broader process of leadership development (McCauley et al., 2010). Leadership development is defined as the expansion of a group's capacity to produce direction, alignment, and commitment (McCauley et al.), in contrast to leader development which is the expansion of a one's ability to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Further distinctions between the two can be made by looking at components of each model. Leader development focuses on developing individual knowledge, skills, and abilities (human capital), whereas leadership development focuses on building networked relationships (social capital) among individuals in an organization. Leader development keys in on the assumption that effective leadership occurs through the development of individual leaders, whereas leadership development is a function of the social resources that are rooted in relationships (Day, 2000). In leader development, the focus is on intrapersonal skills of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation; leadership development focuses on interpersonal skills of social awareness and social skills (Day, 2000). Day (2000) argues that what most organizations term as leadership development should be more accurately labeled as leader development. Organizations cannot choose one or the other approach, but instead a bridge must be anchored on either side of leader and leadership development for effective development to occur (Kegan, 1994). Therefore, it is important to develop the intrapersonal capabilities to serve as a foundation for interpersonal competence and link both leader and leadership development together.\n\nManagement development and leadership development can often be confused as one. Although they also can overlap, there are key differences between the two that are not to get confused with leader development. Leadership processes allow groups of people to work together, whereas management processes are considered to be position and organization specific (Keys & Wolf, 1988). Management development includes managerial education and training (Latham & Seijts, 1998; Mailick, Stumpf, Grant, Kfir, & Watson, 1998). There is a greater emphasis on gaining specific types of knowledge, skills,and abilities to enhance task performance in management roles (Baldwin & Padgett,1994; Keys & Wolfe, 1988; Wexley & Baldwin, 1986). Also, management development's goal is to apply proven solutions to problems giving it more of a training orientation. Management development focuses more on the formal managerial roles.\n\nMcCauley, Van Veslor, and Ruderman (2010) explain a two-part model for developing leaders. The first part illustrates three elements that combine to make developmental experiences stronger: assessment, challenge and support. Assessment lets leaders know where they stand in areas of strengths, current performance level, and developmental needs. Challenging experiences are ones that stretch a leader's ability to work outside of their comfort zone, develop new skills and abilities, and provide important opportunities to learn. Support, which comes in the form of bosses, co-workers, friends, family, coaches and mentors, enables leaders to handle the struggle of developing. \nThe second part of the leader development model (McCauley et al., 2010) illustrates that the leader development process involves a variety of developmental experiences and the ability to learn from them. These experiences and the ability to learn also affect each other in that a leader with a high ability to learn will search for developmental experiences and through developmental experiences leaders will increase their ability to learn. It is also important to note that the leader development process is rooted in a particular leadership context which includes elements such as age, culture, economic conditions, gender of the population, organizational purpose and mission, and business strategy (McCauley et al.). This environment molds the leader development process. Along with assessment, challenge and support, leadership context are important aspects of the leader development model.\n\nYGLP is an international leadership program for university and high school students aiming to groom young minds into exemplary leaders.\n\nYGLP was developed by Human Science Lab, London, with support from several transnational organizations and foundations. The objective behind creation of YGLP was to come up with a path-breaking leadership model that could be used across the globe to create a new generation of leaders who can push the limit of human accomplishments to new frontier.\n\nThe Four-Step Leadership theory formulated under the HSL Leadership Project at Human Science Lab, London, provides the scientific framework for YGLP. The theory stipulates that \"the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader –motivation, planning, energising and executing\".\n\nYGLP contains four core modules and one non-core module. Each core module is designed to optimise one of the four leadership component enumerated in the Four-Step Leadership Principle i.e. motivating, planning, energising and executing.\n\nThere are three types of intrapersonal competencies related to leader development: self-awareness (emotional awareness, self-confidence, and accurate self-image), self-regulation (self-control, trustworthiness, adaptability and personal responsibility), and self-motivation (commitment, initiative, and optimism) (Day, 2000).\n\nIn today's changing environment, the two personal capabilities that allow a leader to learn new skills or competencies are self-awareness (identity) and adaptability (Briscoe & Hall, 1999; Hall, 1986a, 1986b, 2002). Leader development is personal development and involves the process of becoming more aware of one's self (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness is the extent to which people are conscious of various aspects of their identities and the extent to which their self-perceptions are congruent with the way others perceive them (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness has been referred to as \"the first component of emotional intelligence\" and discusses how it is \"the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effects on others\" (Goleman, 1998, p. 95). This is vital for a leader to be able to evaluate themselves to recognize their impact on their thinking and decisions as well as on other individuals.\n\nSelf-regulation has been conceptualized in proposed models by Tsui and Ashford (1994) as well as Wood and Bandura (1989). The models have some differences but agree on a fundamental sequence where individuals (a) regulate their attention and effort around self-set goals or assigned goals, (b) take action to achieve their goals, (c) obtain their goals or their performance strategy, if necessary, to maintain or enhance their progress toward their goals and (e) recommence the cycle. Tsui and Ashford (1994) describe the procedure as setting the goal, behaving, detecting a discrepancy, and lastly reducing any discrepancy. This process is vital in leader development because it can have both internal and external effects. As Sosik, Potosky, and Jung (2002) stated that, \"individuals desire congruence between their own and others’ perceptions of their behavior, and, therefore, set and work toward goals to reduce perceptual discrepancies, gain congruence, and improve their effectiveness\" (p. 212). This is similar to the intrapersonal competence of self-awareness as individuals want their own perception of themselves be congruent with those of others, both outlining importance for leader development.\n\nSelf-motivation involves having higher levels of identification to be motivated to go beyond contracts and exchanges in both their own development and performance (Hall, 2004). \nTogether, the capabilities of self-awareness, self-regulation and self-motivation allow for enhanced individual knowledge, trust, and personal power, which can be seen as fundamental to create in a leader (Zand, 1997).\n\nLeader development takes place through multiple mechanisms: formal instruction, developmental job assignments, 360-degree feedback, executive coaching, and self-directed learning (Boyce, Zaccaro & Wisecarver, 2009; Day, 2000). These mechanisms may occur independently, but are more effective in combination.\n\nOrganizations often offer formal training programs to their leaders. Traditional styles provide leaders with required knowledge and skills in a particular area by utilizing coursework, practice, \"overlearning\" with rehearsals, and feedback (Kozlowski, 1998). This traditional lecture-based classroom training is useful, however, the limitations include the leader's ability to transfer the information from a training environment to a work setting.\n\nFollowing formal training organizations should assign leaders to developmental jobs that target the newly acquired skills (Zacarro & Banks, 2004). A job that is developmental is one in which leaders learn, undergo personal change, and gain leadership skills resulting from the roles, responsibilities and tasks involved in that job (McCauley & Brutus, 1998). Developmental job assignments are one of the most effective forms of leader development (Ohlott, 2004). After training a leader should first complete a \"stamping-in\" assignment\". A \"stamping-in\" assignment is one in which the leader masters the new skills before moving on to a \"stretch assignment\" (Zacarro & Banks). The \"stretch\" or developmental assignment challenges the leader's new skills and pushes them out of their comfort zone to operate in a more complex environment involving new elements, problems and dilemmas to resolve (Ohlott, 2004). A truly development assignment doesn’t depend on existing skills, it challenges the leader to understand his or her current limitations and develop new skills (Zaccaro & Banks). These assignments should be given to leaders who do not possess the skills to succeed at the current assignment, but who have the ability to succeed at higher levels (Zaccarro & Banks). Developmental assignments should be accompanied by appropriate feedback that assesses the leader's strengths and weaknesses in order to be successful (Zaccaro & Banks).\n\nThree hundred and sixty-degree feedback is a necessary component of leader development which allows leaders to maximize learning opportunities from their current assignment. It systematically provides the leader with perceptions of his or her performance from a full circle of viewpoints including subordinates, peers, superiors (Day, 2000), and the leader's own self-assessment (Zaccaro & Banks, 2004). With many different sources from which to interpret information, the messages may differ and be difficult to interpret. However, when several different sources concur on a similar perspective, whether a strength or weakness, the clarity of the message increases (King & Santana, 2010). For this mechanism to be effective, the leader must accept feedback and be open and willing to make changes. An effective way to facilitate the feedback through open discussion and to help facilitate change is through coaching (Day, 2000).\n\nThe goal of executive coaching focuses on enhancing the leader's effectiveness along with the effectiveness of the team and organization (Frankovelgia & Riddle, 2010). It involves an intense one-on-one relationship designed at learning important lessons through assessment, challenge, and support. Although coaching is sometimes aimed at correcting a fault, it is being used more and more to help already successful leaders move to the next level of increased responsibilities, and new and complex challenges. Coaching must move toward measurable goals that contribute to individual and organizational growth. Day (2000) proposes that leaders should be carefully selected, willing to change, and matched with a compatible coach in order for coaching to be most effective.\n\nSelf-directed learning is an individual leader's aim in identifying the focus of development, specifying the developmental processes, and identifying the resources (Boyce, Zaccaro, & Wisecarver, 2010). Self-development is the process of not only acquiring new skills but also gaining an understanding of the leader's environment and self through new experiences and activities, such as seeking out mentors or developmental job assignments (Boyce, Zaccaro, & Wisecarver, 2010).\n\nThe Army has been conducting leader development studies since as early as 1971; studies include a review of education and training for Army officers, and professional development of officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers. In 1987, the Army Chief of Staff directed a comprehensive leader development study to be conducted which produced the Army's leader development system, a support system to monitor and adapt to the effects of change on Army leader development, and a leader development action plan (U.S. Army, 1994). The U.S. Army Research Institute's (ARI) research topics include training, leader development, and soldier research and development. One area ARI's leadership development program focuses on is ways to provide accelerated development of Army leaders.\n\n\n"}

She received a MFA from the University of Iowa Writers Workshop in 1978. During her years at Iowa, she specialized in poetry with Florida poet Donald Justice. Her first volume of poetry, \"Wintering with the Abominable Snowman\", was published in 1976 by the avant-garde press, 'kayak,' run by George Hitchcock in Santa Cruz, California in 1976.\n\nShe received a Fulbright grant in 1978 to participate in a two-year Fulbright seminar in literary translation held in Rome at the Centro Studi Americani, under the directorship of Frank MacShane of Columbia University and William Weaver, the noted translator from Italian. The project pursued by Lappin in those years, a translation from the Italian of Carmelo Samonà's novel, \"Brothers\", won two prizes in literary translation in the United States: The Renato Poggioli Award in Translation from Italian given by the New York PEN club and a National Endowment for the Arts grant in translation in 1987. She was awarded a second translation grant from the NEA in 1996 for her work on Tuscan writer Federigo Tozzi. From 1987 to the year 2000, she published essays, poems, reviews, and short stories in many US and European publications, including several essays on women writers and artists of the 1920s, including \"Missing Person in Montparnasse\", in the Literary Review, about the life of Jeanne Hébuterne, \"Jane Heap and her Circle\" in Prairie Schooner, dealing with the lives of Jane Heap and Margaret Anderson, founders of the Little Review and \"Dada Queen in the Bad Boys' Club, Baroness Elsa Von Freitag Loringhoven\" in Southwest Review.\n\nMajor themes in Lappin's work include women's biographies and autobiographies, expatriate writers in the 1920s, and displacement.\n\nIn \"The Etruscan\", her first novel, Harriet Sackett, a feminist photographer, travels to Italy to photograph Etruscan tombs for the Theosophical Society. Here she falls in love with a charismatic count, the occultist and amateur archaeologist, Federigo del Re, who materializes and disappears into the Etruscan landscape. As Harriet stalks her phantasm-lover, the solution to the mystery which propels the novel retreats. Is Federigo Del Re faithful; is he a real count, or even a real man; a fantasy or an Etruscan ghost? The novel draws inspiration from the literary gothic novel, Jungian archetypes, fairy tales, and from DH Lawrence's \"Sketches of Etruscan Places\". Critically, \"The Etruscan\" has been analyzed as a recapitulation of the entire tradition of English/American fiction set in Italy. A documentary about the book entitled \"A Tale of Tuscia\", directed by Sergio Baldassarre, is available.\n\nLappin's second novel, \"Katherine's Wish\", is a meta-fictional re-elaboration of textual documentation pertaining to the final phase of Katherine Mansfield's life. Written from three points of view, that of Katherine Mansfield, of her companion, Ida Baker, and of her husband, John Middleton Murry, Katherine's Wish recreates a slice of Mansfield's life from 1918 until her retreat to Fontainebleau, to Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1922, where she died in 1923. The novel focuses on Mansfield's triangular relationship with Ida Baker and Middleton Murry while tracing her artistic and spiritual quest.\n\nLappin's third novel \"Signatures in Stone\" Caravel Books 2013 is set in the Monster Park of Bomarzo, and draws inspiration from the early twentieth century British writer, Mary Butts.\n\n"}

Usually referred to as a “teachers' union” its membership also includes college faculty, public school custodians, bus drivers, and paraprofessionals, among others. It represents people working in neighborhood public schools, those in charter schools as well as school employees working for private companies.\n\nWhile MEA works to serve its members’ employment goals, it also promotes public education. It sees these goals as closely related. Through policies put in place by its elected Board of Directors, MEA advocates for policies it judges to be best for student success, for civil rights and for the quality of life for all. Like other public sector unions, the MEA has come under fire in recent years for its defense of teacher employment protections. Controversy over the role of the MEA is part of a wider debate on the structure and funding of public education in Michigan and around the United States.\n\nMEA was founded in 1852 as the Michigan State Teachers Association, five years before the National Education Association was organized, becoming the Michigan Education Association in 1926. Today it is the largest public employee union in the state and the third largest education association in the United States.\n\nIn 1937 the MEA’s governing body, the Representative Assembly, authorized the development of a group hospitalization program. This was one of the first such health care programs in the United States. Two years later, the Hoosier Casualty Company provided coverage for MEA members, administrated by local insurance agent Herman Henkel.\n\nMichigan law forbade the MEA from acting as an agent for its members, so when Henkel retired in 1960, it was decided that a separate non-profit corporation would serve this function, and Michigan Education Special Services Association (MESSA) was born. 10,000 MEA members were enrolled at the time.\n\nTax-exempt under IRS 501(c)(9), MESSA qualified as a “voluntary employees’ beneficiary association” and could therefore offer group term life, health, and dental coverages, among others, to its members.\n\nWhen the Michigan bargaining law was enacted in 1965, public school employees were able to organize into local bargaining units to negotiate salary, benefits and other working conditions. Insurance became a bargainable issue.\nIn 1984, MEA merged with the Michigan Educational Support Personnel, making MEA one of the first state associations to represent both teachers and other school personnel.

{"id": "31597238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31597238", "title": "Positive education", "text": "Positive education\n\nPositive education is an approach to education that draws on positive psychology's emphasis of individual strengths and personal motivation to promote learning. Unlike traditional school approaches in which teachers attempt to tailor their material to a mythical \"average\" student, and move the class altogether using the material through one teaching and testing style, positive schooling teachers use techniques that focus on the well-being of individual students. Teachers use methods such as developing tailored goals for each student to engender learning and working with them to develop the plans and motivation to reach their goals. Rather than pushing students to achieve at a set grade level, seen through the emphasis of standardized testing, this approach attempts to customize learning goals to individual students' levels. Instead of setting students to compete against one another, learning is viewed as a cooperative process where teachers learn to respect their students and each student's input is valued.\n\nSeveral early psychologists and thinkers paved the way for the incorporation of positive psychology techniques, though they may not have yet been labeled as such, in the classroom. John Dewey was among the earliest advocates to impact the field of positive schooling. John Dewey recognized schools as primary institutions for the development of democracy. He opposed the repressive atmosphere of schools, especially elementary and secondary schools, and emphasized the importance of promoting learners' ability to absorb and recreate information in their minds. He put forth the idea of constructivism, which argues that individual learners should take information and creatively construct it according to their own personal capacities and views. This approach opposes the traditional view of education in which teachers pass down knowledge to the students through direct communication. In summary, Dewey's view of education, similar to progressive education implies that people learn best in environments that are applicable to the real world and that allow them to learn through activities and practical problem solving.\n\nMaria Montessori, the originator of the Montessori system, put forth views relating to positive schooling as well. The Montessori system is largely based on the positive psychology principle of creativity. Creativity, known as one of the twenty-four character strengths, is offered with the freedom for children to choose how they learn, known as self-directed learning. Children are provided with hands-on materials, which not only inspires creativity, but also stimulates interest in learning, as children are able to express themselves through learning, rather than feeling forced to work in order to learn.\n\nElizabeth Hurlock was one of the first psychologists to actually carry out experiments with positive psychology techniques to measure the effects of positive schooling in the field of education. Hurlock studied the effectiveness of praise and reproach in the classroom, arguing that praise was a more effective long-term incentive. Her studies found that praise was more effective for children regardless of age, ability and gender.\n\nJeniffer Henderlong and Mark Lepper echo Hurlock's arguments that praise is beneficial to enhancing children's intrinsic motivation. Although some research doubts the effectiveness of praise, appropriate use of praise is proven to be positively correlated with confidence and better academic performance results. They support that praise increases the personal beliefs about one's ability to perform given tasks. Also, cognitive evaluation theory supports that praise enhances individuals' perception about performance outcomes and that positive moods induced by praise may contribute to effective outcomes.\n\nArthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson focus on the pedagogy, the teacher's \"how,\" rather than content and subject matter being taught, which is partly due to the scarce empirical research that has been done on college curriculum. Chickering and Gamson give seven research-supported principles regarding education and learning in the undergraduate environment for teachers to follow:\n\nEliot Aronson has pioneered the jigsaw classroom, a theoretical approach for 3rd-12th grade classes which emphasizes the individual academic strengths of children and seeks to make them peer-teachers in a cooperative learning setting. In this approach, students are divided into competency groups of four to six students; individual group members then break off and work with \"experts\" on their topic from the other groups, researching together that specific section of material. These students then return to their groups and present on their part of the material. This approach encourages group engagement, listening, and cooperation among peers, as well as incorporates an aspects of play into learning. It as shown positive effects on academic performance and liking for school and peers. This may be because increased liking leads to self-esteem, which if absent, can affect academic performance. It is also possible that jigsaw methods help to increase participation while reducing anxiety, lead to increases empathy, and result in changes in attributions of success and failures. The Jigsaw method has been proposed as a strategy to improve race relations since it meets the criteria posed by contact theory for reducing racial prejudice. Intergroup contact theory states that interracial contact will only improve race relations if ethnic groups are of equal status, pursue a common goal of mutual interest for groups, and are sanctioned by institutions.\n\nAnother model that utilizes positive education in school is the response to intervention model. Response to intervention is a preventative model that works to provide tailored assistance to at-risk students who are exhibiting insufficient academic achievement, though its principles have been used to address behavioral issues as well. The central components of this model include a core curriculum based on scientific evidence, universal screening, progress monitoring, and decisions about acceptable progress in subsequent tiers. RTI utilizes a multi-tiered structure: at each tier, students are screened and then monitored. The model was originally created to help identify learning disabilities, so that the adoption of a core curriculum ensures that inadequate teaching is not the cause for poor performance. Those who struggle even when adhering to a research-supported curriculum are given more intense instruction at a higher tier. When behavior is being considered, school or local norms for behavior rates are used when screening.\n\nThe Positive Behavioral Support (PBS) model is structured similarly to RTI but addresses behavior problems. This model adopts a prevention and intervention approach, emphasizing the importance of building prosocial skills, in addition to reducing bad behavior while implementing a three-tiered \"continuum of supports\" from a universal to an individual level. The strategies at the universal level include defined expected behaviors, strategies to teach expected behavior, strategies to encourage and practice appropriate behavior, and consistency within and across school systems. The second level involves providing targeted support for individuals and groups that are at risk. The final level concerns individuals that persist in their bad behavior and involves functional behavior assessments, instruction-based plans, and collective comprehensive plans including families and community agencies. PBS can be implemented at a school-wide, district-wide or even statewide level. Recently, local school systems and even state departments of education have been demonstrating a rising interest in PBS because the program requires little training time and limited money and staff. In 2002, the New Hampshire Department of Education organized a statewide initiative to introduce PBS into New Hampshire schools. PBS has also become popular in Maryland, as more than 33% of state's schools implemented the program in 2006.\n\nOne major empirical finding in support for positive learning techniques has been the positive effect of praise-based discipline techniques in classrooms. Elizabeth Hurlock studied the day-to-day improvement of students who were praised, reproached, and ignored. Students were divided into these groups in addition to a control group after they had been administered an arithmetic test, and were subsequently tested each day over an additional period of four days. After the first testing session, the control group was tested in a separate room from the other groups. In the treatment room, the \"praise\" group of students were invited to the front of the room and praised for their work as well as encouraged to do better. The \"reproach\" group was called up and reproved for their poor performance, while the ignored group received no recognition. Some significant findings include the fact that the praised group experienced the most initial improvement, followed by the reproach group and then the ignored group, while no improvement was seen in the control group. The ignored and control group also showed a decrease in accuracy towards the end of the testing period. When children were grouped according to academic achievement into the categories \"superior\", \"average\" and \"inferior\" after the first test, praise was the most influential incentive for all students, though it was most effective for the \"inferior\" group. As a whole, the results suggested that praise was the most accurate incentive regardless of age, sex, initial ability, or accuracy.\n\nWhile empirical evidence supports the positive effects of praise, there exists a debate regarding whether the jigsaw classroom method is successful in various areas. Two studies by Christopher Bratt, who was interested in the jigsaw classroom's ability to improve prejudice based on ethnicity, examined the effects of the jigsaw classroom method on intergroup relations; yet, no positive effects were found. The first studied the method's effect on majority members' outgroup attitudes, attitudes towards school empathy, and intergroup friendships by examining two jigsaw classrooms and two regular classrooms of multi-ethnic 6th graders. The second measured common ingroup identity in the majority sample and outgroup attitudes in the minority sample in addition to the previous variables in a sample of 8th–10th graders in 46 multi-ethnic classrooms, utilizing a matched pair design between jigsaw and regular classrooms. No evidence of any significant effects of the jigsaw method was found in the second study, while outgroup attitudes improved in study 1. Yet, Bratt believed the findings from study 1 were spurious, arguing that the fact that one of the classrooms in study 1 was taught by two teachers while the others had one teacher may have influenced the results.\n\nA study by Walker & Crogan yielded evidence that supported the utility of the jigsaw classroom. The study investigated the relationship between teaching methods such as cooperative learning and the jigsaw classroom and outcomes in academic performance, self-esteem, attitude of school, attitude of peers, and racial prejudice. The study was designed to investigate solely the jigsaw classroom method, yet one of the teachers altered her mode of instruction due to the behavior of disruptive students so that it resembled cooperative learning. As a result, the experimenters modified their objectives, believing they could compare the effectiveness of cooperation, necessary in both methods, and task interdependence, characteristics only of the jigsaw classroom. They concluded that academic performance, liking of peers, and racial prejudice improved under the jigsaw classroom method while cooperative learning appeared to intensify intergroup tension, yet major methodological issues may cast doubt on the validity of these findings. Many of the classrooms did not adhere very strictly to proper plan for implementation of the jigsaw classroom and the researchers had to abandon their original design. Also, the fact that one of the teachers had to forgo the jigsaw classroom method due to student misbehavior is telling. Bratt argues that studies professing results that support improved intergroup relations are similarly flawed.\n\nThe Circle of Courage curriculum is, yet, another practical attempt for implementing positive learning techniques. Deborah Espiner and Diane Guild monitor the progress and success of Mt. Richmond Special School after implementing the Circle of Courage curriculum and Response Ability Pathways (RAP) program. The Circle of Courage is an educational philosophy based on Native American values. Belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity are four core values that are intended to integrate Western and indigenous cultures. The school managers established a positive learning environment based on these two programs, which were designed for dynamic interaction between teachers and students. Before launching the actual classroom environment, five months were taken to introduce new learning methods to school staff and students. In general, participants acknowledged that new modules brought positive impact in the school. One recognizable outcome was that RAP training facilitated the connection between teachers and challenging students. Additionally, new positive education methods also led teachers to discover the potentials of their pupils.\n\nWhen examining programs that attempt to help children overcome behavioral issues that prevent them from displaying their full potential, research has provided support for the efficacy of PBS. A study by Barrett and Lewis-Palmer investigated the statewide implementation of PBS in 467 schools. The results indicated that overall, the program had been successfully implemented and displayed high fidelity to the theoretical model. Elementary schools reported 43% less office discipline referrals (ODRs) per day, while middle schools reported 37% less ODRs per day and K-(8–12) schools reported 72% less ODRs per day when compared with the national averages. Schools also demonstrated significant reductions in suspension rates in as little as one year. Another study by Muscott and Mann examined the first cohort of 28 New Hampshire early childhood education programs and K-12 schools that had implemented PBS in accordance with the directive of the Department of Education. Within three months after the program was introduced, 54% of schools met the standards of successful PBS implementation and 88% of schools had done so two years after implementation. In terms of behavior issues, a school was considered successful if 80–90% of elementary students and 70–80 middle school students received less than 2 ODRs during a school year. After the first year, 70% of schools has achieved these results. Between the first and second years, the schools reduced ODRs by 28% collectively.\n\nPositive education is, by no means, uniformly agreed on as an effective teaching strategy. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was proposed in 2001 to improve the conditions of public schools in the United States. The act has imposed standardized testing on all schools that are government-run and receive government funding. Each school's test results are analyzed, and schools with continuously low test scores are obligated to develop an improvement plan. There is still much debate whether the act has a positive effect on America's education system, since it is based on performance-based education reform. Supporters of the act believe that setting measurable goals will improve individual educational success and that statewide tests will improve the situation of public schools. Major teacher's unions and other opponents, however, have doubts about the act's effectiveness, which may be due to the mixed results of NCLB, arguing over the ineffectiveness of standardized tests and higher standards for teacher qualification. Opponents also argue that standardized tests are exceedingly biased and that higher standards for teacher qualification simply contribute to teacher shortage.\n\nSimilarly, the 2009 United States Department of Education program Race to the Top, designed to spur reform in K-12 Education, and awarding $4.35 billion in funds, has been controversial for its emphasis on testing to evaluate schools, an approach which contrasts positive schooling techniques, and data regarding its effectiveness has yet to be produced.\n\nBesides the emphasis on standardized testing to evaluate school performance, tracking has been a very controversial, yet widely implemented, approach to learning in America's public schools. Tracking is an approach which places children in classes according to expectation levels. Honors, college-preparation, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate classes are examples of higher-level learning courses, while schools may simultaneously offer regular-level classes for other students. Research has shown a disparity in the enrollment of these classes based on race. Research also shows that while separation by tracking is beneficial for higher-level students, it produces no benefit for lower-level students, and is possibly even detrimental to their academic success. Many advocates for education reform discount tracking based on the argument that a rigorous, quality education should be provided universally through public schools.\n\nRecently, a positive psychology plan was implemented in the U.S. military to address the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other mental disorders among soldiers. The military asked psychologists to devise some sort of way not simply to treat the problem but to prevent future soldiers from becoming vulnerable to these mental disorders. Statistically, there is a normal distribution of reactions to combat in the military: the left side includes those who have trouble and end up suffering from a mental disorder, the middle, those who are resilient and return to normal functioning afterwards, and the right are those who bounce back to an even higher level of functioning and experience growth through adversity. The goal of the plan is to have a negatively skewed distribution that shifts most soldiers to the right side of this distribution. The model is designed to improve one's spiritual, emotional, social, and family fitness. If the plan is successful within the military, it could possibly revolutionize current U.S. civilian health care and be a new model for the education system. Within health care, it will emphasize prevention, rather than solely treatment; additionally, within schools, it will encourage psychological fitness similar to the plan used for the military.\n\nMoreover, \"the emphasis on positive psychology interventions in education increases engagement, creates more curious students, and helps develop and overall love of learning (Fisher, 2015)\".\n\n\"Positive education benefits the teacher, too. It is easier to engage with students and persist in the work they need to do master their academic material (Fisher, 2015). It creates a school culture that is caring, trusting, and it prevents problem behavior. In relation to achievement goals, expectancy beliefs, and value it is found that task goals associated positively with optimism resulted in a highly motivated student (Fadlelmula, 2010). Research has shown that motivation may be consistent and long-term if it is always paired with positive psychology interventions.\"\n\nAdditionally, the effects of positive learning were examined in the context of medical school and first-year physicians. Often, medical students and young physicians get exhausted and burnt out from the stressful conditions they operate under. Medical students at Karolinska Institutet were evaluated in their final year of school and again in their first year as a physician. After controlling for baseline exhaustion, a positive learning climate in the clinic that the students were working in was found to have a negative correlation with exhaustion. In this case, positive learning was found to predict the exhaustion of students and new doctors. Although only a correlation, positive learning environments could benefit the well-being of people with various other careers and job conditions.\n\nPositive education, the use of positive psychology in the realm of education, may have the potential to be a new model for successful education. The field of positive schooling, although still in the early stages of development, seems to have a promising future. Rather than the traditional concept of teachers simply communicating information to students, students in positive schooling learn through individual goals and by cooperating with other students to have an environment in which students can work towards the same goal together. Overall, the goal of positive schooling is to turn all students into teachers who will pass down their wisdom and knowledge to others and teachers who will continue the ways of positive education.\n\n\n\nOutline of psychology\n"}

Other Assyrians in northern Iraq, northeast Syria and southeast Turkey had already long been members of the considerably older Syriac Orthodox Church. Formally, the mission covers only twenty years - from 1898 to 1918, but the period prior to its establishment, lasted almost the entire second half of the 19th century.\n\nThere was a group from the Assyrian Church of the East that converted to Orthodoxy in 1898. In the mid 1890s, bishop Mar Yonan of Supurghan in the region of Urmia, petitioned the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church that he and his flock be received into the Russian Church. Mar Yonan traveled to Saint Petersburg in 1898, where he and several of his clergy accepted Eastern Orthodoxy. They were received into the Russian Orthodox Church by confession of faith and vesting on the Feast of the Annunciation at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Saint Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The services were presided over by Metropolitan Palladius (Raev) of Saint Petersburg. Also in 1898, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church established the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia, in order to aid Mar Yonan() in the conversion and education of his flock.\n\nAlong with Bishop Yonan, Archimandrite Elia (Abraham) converted to Orthodoxy in 1898. In 1904 he was consecrated to the episcopate, as bishop of Tergawar in the region of Urmia, and became vicar of Bishop Yonan.\n\nSince 1904, the mission published the magazine \"Orthodox Urmia\" in both the Assyrian-Aramaic and Russian languages.\n\nIn 1918, renewed persecution by the Muslims resulted in a mass exodus of indigenous Christians (including Assyrians, Armenians and Georgians) from northern Persia. Over 100,000 Christians fled northern Persia heading south to Iraq; untold numbers were massacred along the way. The Orthodox Assyrians eventually ended up in Baghdad.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, Bishop Elia could no longer communicate with Patriarch Tikhon in Moscow, and joined the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad.\n\nBishop Elia died in December 1928, and he was succeeded by Bishop John (Gewarigis), who was consecrated to the Epicopate in Belgrade in 1931 by Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky) and Archbishop Germogen (Maximov).\n\nBishop John resided in Baghdad where most of his flock lived. He retired due to old age in 1945, and eventually made his way to the U.S., where he lived with his son in Chicago. In the early 1950s, Bishop Nikon (Rklitsky), while visiting Chicago, \"had a wonderful meeting with Bishop John of Urmia and Salma, the eldest member of our Council of Bishops, and spiritual head of the Orthodox Assyrians.\" Vladika Nikon noted that Bishop John spoke the same language as that spoken by Christ the Savior, and had been the translator at the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia. After moving to Chicago to live in retirement, he found there were several thousand of his fellow Orthodox Assyrians, who were spiritually undernourished, living in the Chicago area. When Vladyka Nikon visited Bishop John, he found him \"surrounded by Americans of Assyrian origin\", to whom Bishop John was reading the Bible in their native language. The Synod of Bishops, through Archbishop Gregory (Borishkevitch) of Chicago and Cleveland (later of Chicago, Detroit and Midwest America), Protopresbyter Arkadii Tsepuro, Protopresbyter George Grabbe (later Bishop Gregory of Washington & Florida), and Protopresbyter Adrian Rymarenko (later Archbishop Andrew of Novo Diveyevo) arranged for Bishop John to live in retirement at the Novo Diveyevo Convent in Spring Valley, New York. He reposed at Novo Diveyevo in 1960 at the age of 105, and is buried in the cemetery located there.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92295", "title": "Sewing", "text": "Sewing\n\nSewing is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using stitches made with a needle and thread. Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing using bone, antler or ivory needles and \"thread\" made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.\n\nFor thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand. The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring, haute couture fashion, and custom dressmaking, and is pursued by both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative expression.\n\nThe first known use of the word \"sewing\" was in the 14th century.\n\nSewing has an ancient history estimated to begin during the Paleolithic Era. Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter. The Inuit, for example, used sinew from caribou for thread and needles made of bone; the indigenous peoples of the American Plains and Canadian Prairies used sophisticated sewing methods to assemble tipi shelters. Sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves in Africa to create baskets, such as those made by Zulu weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as \"thread\" to stitch wider strips of palm leaf that had been woven into a coil. The weaving of cloth from natural fibres originated in the Middle East around 4000 BC, and perhaps earlier during the Neolithic Age, and the sewing of cloth accompanied this development.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Europeans who could afford it employed seamstresses and tailors. Sewing for the most part was a woman's occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical. Clothing was an expensive investment for most people, and women had an important role in extending the longevity of items of clothing. Sewing was used for mending. Clothing that was faded would be turned inside-out so that it could continue to be worn, and sometimes had to be taken apart and reassembled in order to suit this purpose. Once clothing became worn or torn, it would be taken apart and the reusable cloth sewn together into new items of clothing, made into quilts, or otherwise put to practical use. The many steps involved in making clothing from scratch (weaving, pattern making, cutting, alterations, and so forth) meant that women often bartered their expertise in a particular skill with one another. Decorative needlework such as embroidery was a valued skill, and young women with the time and means would practise to build their skill in this area. From the Middle Ages to the 17th century, sewing tools such as needles, pins and pincushions were included in the trousseaus of many European brides.\n\nDecorative embroidery was valued in many cultures worldwide. Although most embroidery stitches in the Western repertoire are traditionally British, Irish or Western European in origin, stitches originating in different cultures are known throughout the world today. Some examples are the Cretan Open Filling stitch, Romanian Couching or Oriental Couching, and the Japanese stitch. The stitches associated with embroidery spread by way of the trade routes that were active during the Middle Ages. The Silk Road brought Chinese embroidery techniques to Western Asia and Eastern Europe, while techniques originating in the Middle East spread to Southern and Western Europe through Morocco and Spain. European imperial settlements also spread embroidery and sewing techniques worldwide. However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely. For example, a method of reverse appliqué known to areas of South America is also known to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution shifted the production of textiles from the household to the mills. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, the machinery produced whole cloth. The world's first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint. By the early 1840s, other early sewing machines began to appear. Barthélemy Thimonnier introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France's army; shortly afterward, a mob of tailors broke into Thimonnier's shop and threw the machines out of the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work. By the 1850s, Isaac Singer developed the first sewing machines that could operate quickly and accurately and surpass the productivity of a seamstress or tailor sewing by hand.\n\nWhile much clothing was still produced at home by female members of the family, more and more ready-made clothes for the middle classes were being produced with sewing machines. Textile sweatshops full of poorly paid sewing machine operators grew into entire business districts in large cities like London and New York City. To further support the industry, piece work was done for little money by women living in slums. Needlework was one of the few occupations considered acceptable for women, but it did not pay a living wage. Women doing piece work from home often worked 14-hour days to earn enough to support themselves, sometimes by renting sewing machines that they could not afford to buy.\n\nTailors became associated with higher-end clothing during this period. In London, this status grew out of the dandy trend of the early 19th century, when new tailor shops were established around Savile Row. These shops acquired a reputation for sewing high-quality handmade clothing in the style of the latest British fashions, as well as more classic styles. The boutique culture of Carnaby Street was absorbed by Savile Row tailors during the late 20th century, ensuring the continued flourishing of Savile Row's businesses.\n\nSewing underwent further developments during the 20th century. As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for sewing patterns grew. Women had become accustomed to seeing the latest fashions in periodicals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, increasing demand for sewing patterns yet more. American tailor and manufacturer Ebenezer Butterick met the demand with paper patterns that could be traced and used by home sewers. The patterns, sold in small packets, became wildly popular. Several pattern companies soon established themselves. Women's magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century. This practice declined during the later decades of the 20th century, when ready-made clothing became a necessity as women joined the paid workforce in larger numbers, leaving them with less time to sew, if indeed they had an interest. Today, the low price of ready-made clothing in shops means that home sewing is confined largely to hobbyists in Western countries, with the exception of cottage industries in custom dressmaking and upholstery.\n\nThe spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well. In Japan, traditional clothing was sewn together with running stitch that could be removed so that the clothing could be taken apart and the assorted pieces laundered separately. The tight-locked stitches made by home sewing machines, and the use of Western clothing patterns, led to a movement towards wearing Western-style clothing during the early 20th century. Western sewing and clothing styles were disseminated in sub-Saharan Africa by Christian missionaries from the 1830s onward. Indigenous cultures, such as the Zulu and Tswana, were indoctrinated in the Western way of dress as a sign of conversion to Christianity. First Western hand sewing techniques, and later machine sewing, spread throughout the regions where the European colonists settled. However, a recent examination of new online learning methods demonstrated that technology can be adapted to share knowledge of a culture's traditional sewing methods. Using self-paced online tutorials, a Malay sewing class learned how to tailor and sew a traditional men's \"Baju Kurung\" garment in 3 days, whereas a traditional Malay sewing class would have taken 5 days to teach the same information.\n\nAdvances in industrial technology, such as the development of synthetic fibres during the early 20th century, have brought profound changes to the textile industry as a whole. Textile industries in Western countries have declined sharply as textile companies compete for cheaper labour in other parts of the world. According to the U.S. Department of Labor \"employment of sewers and tailors is expected to experience little or no change, growing 1 percent from 2010 to 2020\". It is estimated that every lost textile job in a Western country in recent years has resulted in 1.5 jobs being created in an outsourced country such as China. Textile workers who perform tasks with sewing machines, or do detailed work by hand, are still a vital component of the industry, however. Small-scale sewing is also an economic standby in many developing countries, where many people, both male and female, are self-employed sewers.\n\nGarment construction is usually guided by a pattern. A pattern can be quite simple; some patterns are nothing more than a mathematical formula that the sewer calculates based on the intended wearer's measurements. Once calculated, the sewer has the measurements needed to cut the cloth and sew the garment together. At the other end of the spectrum are haute couture fashion designs. When a couture garment is made of unusual material, or has extreme proportions, the design may challenge the sewer's engineering knowledge. Complex designs are drafted and refitted dozens of times, may take around 40 hours to develop a final pattern, and require 60 hours of cutting and sewing. It is important for a pattern to be created well because the way a completed piece fits is the reason it will either be worn or not. \n\nMost clothing today is mass-produced, and conforms to standard sizing, based on body measurements that are intended to fit the greatest proportion of the population. However, while \"standard\" sizing is generally a useful guideline, it is little more than that, because there is no industry standard that is \"both widely accepted and strictly adhered to in all markets\".\n\nHome sewers often work from patterns purchased from companies such as Simplicity, Butterick, McCall's, Vogue, and many others. Such patterns are typically printed on large pieces of tissue paper; a sewer may simply cut out the required pattern pieces for use but may choose to transfer the pattern onto a thicker paper if repeated use is desired. A sewer may choose to alter a pattern to make it more accurately fit the intended wearer. Patterns may be changed to increase or reduce length; to add or remove fullness; to adjust the position of the waistline, shoulder line, or other seam, or a variety of other adjustments. Volume can be added with elements such as pleats, or reduced with the use of darts. Before work is started on the final garment, test garments may be made, sometimes referred to as muslins.\n\nSewers working on a simple project need only a few sewing tools, such as measuring tape, needle, thread, cloth, and sewing shears. More complex projects may only need a few more simple tools to get the job done, but there are an ever-growing variety of helpful sewing aids available.\n\nIn addition to sewing shears, rotary cutters may be used for cutting fabric, usually used with a cutting mat to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches. Special marking pens and chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.\n\nPressing and ironing are an essential part of many sewing projects, and require additional tools. A steam iron is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor's ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage.\n\nSewing machines are now made for a broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, heavy-duty machines for sewing thicker fabrics (such as leather), computerized machines for embroidery, and sergers for finishing raw edges of fabric.\n\nA wide variety of presser foot attachments are available for many sewing machines—feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, and a variety of other functions.\n\nSeamstresses are provided with the pattern, with the intent of using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the grain or the bias to manipulate fabric stretch. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.\n\nSupporting materials, such as interfacing, interlining, or lining, may be used in garment construction, to give the fabric a more rigid or durable shape.\n\nBefore or after the pattern pieces are cut, it is often necessary to mark the pieces to provide a guide during the sewing process. Marking methods may include using pens, pencils, or chalk, tailor's tacks, snips, pins, or thread tracing, among others.\n\nIn addition to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. Seam types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, flat fell seam, French seam and many others.\n\nClothing technology has evolved to a complicated science weighed against the labor cost making positive and negative effects across the globe. Millions of women in Bangladesh and other developing countries have come out of poverty working as Sewing Machine Operators.\n\nWith the development of cloth simulation software such as CLO3D, Marvelous Designer and Optitex, seamstresses can now draft patterns on the computer and visualize clothing designs by using the pattern creation tools and virtual sewing machines within these cloth simulation programs.\n\n\n\n"}

Coraghessan Boyle (born December 2, 1948), is an American novelist and short story writer. Since the mid-1970s, he has published sixteen novels and more than 100 short stories. He won the PEN/Faulkner award in 1988, for his third novel, \"World's End\", which recounts 300 years in upstate New York.\n\nHe was previously a Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Southern California.\n\nBoyle grew up in Peekskill, New York. His name was originally Thomas John Boyle; he changed his middle name to Coraghessan when he was 17 after an ancestor of his mother. He received a B.A. in English and History from the State University of New York at Potsdam (1968), an M.F.A. (1974) from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, and a Ph.D. (1977) from the University of Iowa.\n\nIn \"Understanding T. C. Boyle\", Paul William Gleason writes, \"Boyle's stories and novels take the best elements of Carver's minimalism, Barth's postmodern extravaganzas, Garcia Marquez's magical realism, O'Connor's dark comedy and moral seriousness, and Dickens' entertaining and strange plots and brings them to bear on American life in an accessible, subversive, and inventive way\".\n\nMany of Boyle's novels and short stories explore the baby boom generation, its appetites, joys, and addictions. His themes, such as the often-misguided efforts of the male hero and the slick appeal of the anti-hero, appear alongside brutal satire, humor, and magical realism. His fiction also explores the ruthlessness and the unpredictability of nature and the toll human society unwittingly takes on the environment. His novels include \"World's End\" (1987, winner of the Pen/Faulkner Award for Fiction); \"The Road to Wellville\" (1993); and \"The Tortilla Curtain\" (1995, winner of France's Prix Médicis étranger).\n\nBoyle has published eight collections of short stories, including \"Descent of Man\" (1979), \"Greasy Lake\" (1985), \"If the River was Whiskey\" (1989), and \"Without a Hero\" (1994). His short stories regularly appear in the major American magazines, including \"The New Yorker\", \"Harper's\", \"Esquire\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and \"Playboy\", as well as on the radio show, \"Selected Shorts\".\n\nT.C. Boyle is married to Karen Kvashay. They have three children and live in Montecito near Santa Barbara, California. Their home was imperiled in the 2017 Thomas Fire which consumed 440 square miles and over 1,000 structures in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, killing a firefighter in the latter. The fires denuded drought-stricken hillsides of vegetation and torrential rains in January 2018 subsequently dislodged immense boulders and precipitated mudslides which destroyed over one hundred homes and killed almost two dozen of his neighbors. Over 10,000 people were evacuated from Montecito as a result of the sequence of natural disasters. Boyle extensively documented both calamities on his website, and additionally in an article for The New Yorker magazine.\n\nBoyle has said Gabriel García Márquez is his favorite novelist. He is also a fan of Flannery O'Connor and Robert Coover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21693936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21693936", "title": "Threshold knowledge", "text": "Threshold knowledge\n\nThreshold knowledge is a term in the study of higher education used to describe core concepts — or threshold concepts — which, once understood, transform perception of a given subject, phenomenon, or experience. Introduced by Jan Meyer and Ray Land, Meyer and Land also discuss the related idea of troublesome knowledge, ideas that appear alien or counter-intuitive. the theory holds that:\n\n\"there are certain concepts, or certain learning experiences, which resemble passing through a portal, from which a new perspective opens up, allowing things formerly not perceived to come into view. This permits a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something, without which the learner cannot progress, and results in a reformulation of the learners’ frame of meaning. The thresholds approach also emphasises the importance of disciplinary contexts. As a consequence of comprehending a threshold concept there may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape, or even world view.

KU Med houses the university's schools of medicine, nursing, and health professions, with the primary campus in Kansas City, Kansas. Other campuses are located in Wichita and Salina, Kansas.\n\nThe School of Medicine was formed in 1905, with several Kansas City hospitals being combined within the next ten years. In 1947, the campus was renamed to the University of Kansas Medical Center. The campus began expanding its programs over the next forty years, and on February 27, 1990, the hospital performed its first liver transplant.\n\nIn 1997, the state of Kansas was struggling to keep the hospital and its medical campus open so the state legislature passed a bill to sell the hospital, and keep the medical campus for schooling.\n\nSince the state separated with the hospital, the Medical Center has turned its focus on cancer. In 2002, the KU Cancer Center was established, with the help of the Kansas masons. It became a National Cancer Institute-designated in 2012.\n\nKU Med teaches it courses in both academic buildings, as well as the hospital. KU Med consists of three schools: the School of Medicine, the School of Nursing, and the School of Health Professions. With three campuses spread out in Kansas, the Medical Center employs 4,084 people, with 1,233 of those being teaching faculty. As of October 1, 2018, the KU Medical Center has 3,695 students enrolled.\n\nThe current executive vice chancellor, and current dean of the School of Medicine, is Robert D. Simari.\n\nThe School of Medicine, which officially began in 1905 by the Kansas Board of Regents in Kansas City, is the only medical school in Kansas. The school offers seven different degree programs, with the only options as master's program or a doctoral program. The other two campuses are in Wichita, which opened in 1971, and Salina.\n\nThe School of Nursing began in 1905, as well. It offers six degrees. The school opened its first satellite campus in Salina in 2017.\n\nThe School of Health Professions was established in 1974 and offers 25 different programs.\n\n"}
