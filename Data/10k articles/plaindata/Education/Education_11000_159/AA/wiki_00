The center has full accreditation from the Ministry of Education in Jordan to teach Arabic language to speakers of other languages. The center is also approved to grant US college credit to any eligible students through Brookhaven College in the USA. All courses are taught at Ali Baba International Center by experienced multilingual Jordanian teachers with solid teaching experience . The center offers immersion programs throughout the year. A typical program consist of a language courses, comfortable accommodation and rich extracurricular activities. The language courses are supplemented by cultural and social activities, and guided-tours to the major tourist attractions of Jordan. Participants in the programs will also be encouraged to meet and interact with people everywhere, immersing them in the every fabric of the Jordanian society, gaining for themselves an insider’s view of Jordanians lives.\n\nPrograms Types Ali Baba International Center offers two types of programs: regular programs and special programs. A short description of each program is given in what follows.\n\nI . Regular programs are offered throughout the year. Two types of regular programs are offered; 1-month group programs, and private programs. A 1-month group program is a package consisting of the followings: a 1-month long intensive Arabic language course, a comfortable accommodation, airpor pickup, and an optional tour to a touristic site in Jordan. In the a 1-month group program a student takes 80 hours of Arabic language instruction; 5 times a week, 4-hours each time, for a period of 4 weeks. The 80-hour program is equal to a 4-credit course in most universities. Students wishing to study for longer periods can cover consecutive levels of Arabic. Private regular programs are offered anytime of the year. These programs are more flexible since students can take as many hours as they wish and for the duration they need. For both types of regular programs students may request the type of Arabic language they wish to learn; MSA (Modern Standard Arabic), Media Arabic, or Colloquial Arabic. Elementary, intermediate and advanced classes are opened in each month to meet the demands of people having different backgrounds in Arabic. A placement test will be given to the registered students before the start of the course to determine the level and accordingly the appropriate class they should enroll in.\n\nII. Special Programs: a special program is a package consisting of a specialized course in Arabic or a middle eastern or Islamic field, accommodation, and tours around Jordan if desired. The specialized courses are tailored to meet the needs of individuals or groups working in fields like diplomacy, business, culture and others, and therefore may vary in their contents, durations, time of offering, and cost. The following possible special courses can be offered:\n\nSpecial Arabic Courses : individuals or groups may request specialized Arabic courses in certain fields such diplomacy and political science, economics and business, sports or other professional fields.\nAcademic Courses: university students may request undergraduate level courses in Archaeology, Islamic Culture, Arabic Culture or Middle Eastern Studies. Courses will be taught in English at the center. Of courses, Arabic language may be offered with the courses, if requested.\n\nAli Baba International Center offers two types of programs: regular group programs and individual programs. A short description of each program is given in what follows.\n\nRegular programs are offered throughout the year (from January to December).\n\nOur courses are intensive (16 teaching units weekly, each unit 45 minutes), semi-intensive (12 teaching units weekly) and extensive (9 teaching units weekly) for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. In the group program a student takes 48-60 teaching units of German language instruction for each level.\n\nA placement test will be given to the registered students before the start of the course to determine the level and accordingly the appropriate class they should enroll in.\n\nIndividual programs are offered throughout the year (from January to December).\n\nOur individual courses are tailored to meet the needs of individuals or small groups working in fields like medicine, diplomacy, business, and others, and therefore may vary in their contents, durations, time of offering, and cost.\n\nThe center cooperates with the Goethe Institute in Amman. All courses are taught at Ali Baba International Center. Experienced multilingual German, Austrian and Jordanian instructors with solid teaching experience and training will be responsible for teaching the German courses. The language courses are supplemented by cultural and social activities. Participants in the programs will also be encouraged to meet and interact with German speaking people in Jordan and everywhere.\n\n"}

She is a recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Kalaimamani Award of the Government of Tamil Nadu and Kala Ratna Award of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2007, for her contributions to arts.\n\nAnanda Shankar, born in a Tamil Brahmin family from Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu to G. S. Shankar, an officer with Indian Railways and Subhashini, a school teacher and a musician, was brought up in Hyderabad where she did her early education at St. Ann's High School, Secunderabad. She started learning classical dance at the age of 4 under Sharada Keshava Rao and, later, K. N. Pakkiriswamy Pillai, and in 1972 at the age of 11, she joined Kalakshetra of Rukmini Devi Arundale where she trained in Bharatanatyam under teachers such as Padma Balagopal, Sharada Hoffman and Krishnaveni Laxman. After six years of study, she secured her diploma and post graduate diploma from the institution in disciplines of Bharatanatyam, Carnatic music, veena, dance theory and philosophy. She returned to Hyderabad at the age of 17 and founded \"Shankarananda Kalakshetra\", a dance school with eight students, which has since grown into a dance academy, associating such artists as Partha Ghose, Mrunalini Chunduri, Sathiraju Venumadhav and Dolan Banerjee among others. In Hyderabad, she also learned Kuchipudi under Pasumarthy Ramalinga Shastry. Concurrently, she pursued her academic studies and after completing her master's degree in Indian History and Culture from Osmania University, she passed the civil services examination to join the Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS), thus becoming the first woman officer of the service on South Central Railway While serving IRTS, she continued her studies to secure an MPhil in Art History on a UGC research scholarship and a doctoral degree (PhD) in tourism; her thesis being \"Promotion of Tourism in India - Role of Railways\".\n\nIn June 2008, after returning from a \"Kuchipudi Conference\" in the US, she was diagnosed with breast cancer which was subsequently treated. In November 2009, she was invited to share her experiences on TED talk and she delivered a speech, incorporating dance moves in between, which has since been rated as one of the twelve \"Incredible TED talks on cancer\". The Huffington Post ranked her talk as \"one of the five greatest TED talks by Indians\". She resumed her dancing career after her cancer days which lasted two years. Under the aegis of her dance academy, she composed many dance ensembles like \"What About Me?\" (1999) and the subsequent \"Dancing Tales - Panchatantra\", based on the ancient Indian fables of the same name and performed on many stages including in Cambodia. \"Buddham Saranam Gachchami\", \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\", \"Sri Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum\", \"Buddham Saranam Gachchami\", \"Expressions of Truth\" (on Gandhian ideals), \"An Easel Called Life\", \"Navarasa - Expressions of Life\", \"Darshanam - An Ode to the Eye\" and \"Kavyanjali\" are some of the dance-dramas choreographed by her.

It involves assessing the resources, skills, and experience available in a community; organizing the community around issues that move its members into action; and then determining and taking appropriate action. This method uses the community's own assets and resources as the basis for development; it empowers the people of the community by encouraging them to utilize what they already possess. \n\nThe ABCD approach was developed by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. They co-authored a book in 1993, \"Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing A Community’s Assets\", which outlined their asset-based approach to community development. The Community Development Program at Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research established the Asset-Based Community Development Institute based on three decades of research and community work by John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight.\n\nWhereas needs-based community development emphasizes local deficits and looks to outside agencies for resources, asset-based community development focuses on honing and leveraging existing strengths within the community. Related to tenets of empowerment, it postulates that solutions to community problems already exist within a community’s assets. Principles that guide ABCD include:\n\nThe ABCD approach utilizes several tools to assess and mobilize communities.\n\n\nThere are five key assets in any given community: individuals, associations, institutions, physical assets, and connections. These assets are broken down into three categories: Gifts of individuals, Citizens’ Associations, and Local Institutions. Asset maps are used in lieu of needs maps which focus solely on negative aspects of communities. Asset maps, on the other hand, focus on community assets, abilities, skills, and strengths in order to build its future.\n\nTime banks are an example of using community assets to connect individuals' assets to one another. Neighbors and local organizations share skills with one another and earn and spend ‘TimeBank Hours’ or ‘credits’ in the process, allowing an hour of child care to equal an hour of home repair or tax preparation.\n\nSince ABCD relies on existing community assets to create change, it has been criticized for implying that disadvantaged communities have all the resources they need to solve community problems. According to the ABCD Institute, however, ABCD methodology recognizes that systemic injustice may require disadvantaged communities to seek assistance from outside the community. ABCD maintains that interventions from exterior sources will be most effective when a community’s assets are leveraged at full capacity.\nABCD is described as a more sustainable model of community development than needs-based community development, because needs-based approaches may perpetuate community problems by emphasizing deficiencies and the necessity for reliance on outside assistance. By contrast, ABCD aims to build capacity within communities by expanding their social capital. By working with outside resources and simultaneously building trust within the community, more members can make use of a wider array of strengths.\n\n\n"}

Its mission statement states: \"The Association for Business Communication (ABC) is an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice\". The organization is interdisciplinary, with members belonging to academic fields such as management, marketing, English, foreign languages, speech, communication, linguistics, and information systems. Additionally the organization brings together university academicians, business practitioners, and business consultants.\n\nABC is an international organization, divided into nine regional divisions (Europe, Asia and Pacific Rim, Caribbean and Central America, and five North American regions: Canada plus Eastern, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western United States), each with its own separate academic conferences. Each year, the association holds an International Conference in October or November. Midyear, regional conferences are held—one in the European region and one or two of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years or more frequently.\n\nA board of directors and an executive committee lead the ABC. The board of directors is directly elected with a vice president elected from each of 9 regions and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. The executive committee consists of a permanent position of executive director and four officers of the association. The members of the executive committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as second vice president in the first year, then first vice president the next, president the next, and past president the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the second vice president position from among candidates on the board of directors.\n\nThe current executive director of the ABC is James M. Dubinsky (Virginia Tech). He took office in 2011.\n\nFor 2018-2019 the executive committee consists of President Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder (North Carolina A & T University), First Vice President Marcel Robles (Eastern Kentucky University), Second Vice President Geert Jacobs (Ghent University), and immediate Past President Deborah Roebuck (Kennesaw State University).\n\nTwo peer-reviewed academic journals, \"International Journal of Business Communication\" and the \"Business and Professional Communication Quarterly\" are published by SAGE Publications on behalf of ABC.\n\nThe ABC has standing committees, as follow:\n\nThe ABC has ad hoc committees for interests that have not yet warranted a standing committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the standing committees began as ad hoc committees. In 2017, the ABC had these ad hoc committees:\n\nAdditionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. A Special Interest Group may be convened by the First Vice President or by members’ current interest groups. In 2017, the ABC had the following Special Interest Groups:\n\nABC was founded in 1936, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the University of Illinois, was then named the “Association of College Teachers of Business Writers.” The next year, 1937, that name changed to the “American Business Writing Association.”\n\nBy the 1960s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In 1967, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the “American Business Communication Association” to reflect this change.\n\nBy the late 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more members from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term “American” became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current “Association for Business Communication.”\n\nIn 1990, ABC moved its headquarters from Illinois first to the University of North Texas (1990–1994) and then to Baruch College CUNY in New York City (from 1994–2007) and then to Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas (from 2007-2011). Presently, the ABC is headquartered at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.\n\n"}

Peter Suber has referred to the three events combined as the \"BBB definition\" of open access as the three overlap with and inform one another.\n\nThe declaration was drafted at an October 2003 conference held by the Max Planck Society and the European Cultural Heritage Online (ECHO) project. More than 120 cultural and political organizations from around the world attended.\n\nThe statement itself was published on October 22, 2003. Acknowledging the increasing importance of the internet and the previous discussions on the need for open access, it offered the following definition of an open access contribution:\n\nIt also encouraged researchers and institutions to publish their work in accordance with these principles, advocate for open access and help in the development and assessment of open access related tools and measures.\n\n, there are 609 signatories of the declaration.\n\nAt a 2005 follow-up conference, the declaration was refined to two key principles: signatories should require researchers to deposit a copy of their work in an open access repository and encourage the publication of work in open access journals when available. Today these two concepts are often called \"Green OA\" and \"Gold OA, \" respectively, and the two combined are referred to as an open-access mandate.\n\nIn 2013, on the 10th anniversary of the declaration, a mission statement was published with a goal of ensuring that 90% of research is published within an open access model.\n\n\n"}

Although a slightly smaller company than its contemporaries (Encyclopædia Britannica Films, Coronet Films and Learning Corporation of America), it was nonetheless very successful from the late 1940s through the early 1990s, gaining added fame with the Academy Award nominated \"Leo Beuerman\" in 1969.\n\nFounded in 1947 in Lawrence, Kansas by boyhood friends Arthur H. Wolf (a veteran of another Kansas film company, Calvin Films) and Russell A. Mosser (of Boeing-Witchita), the name was chosen to incorporate the key words \"central\" (being that the company was located in the center of the United States) and \"electronic\" in honor of the \"electronic age of the future\".\n\nCentron successfully competed with large companies on both coasts and was widely known for its high quality films, coming in on time and under budget. Although the company kept afloat for decades making many technical instructions, cooking and sewing demonstrations, teacher aides and safety prevention reels, it also added some social guidance films in the 1950s to compete with Coronet Films, along with zoological and geographic topics that held stronger interest among school students.\n\nHarold \"Herk\" Harvey was a principal director at Centron. His 1962 feature \"Carnival of Souls\" was produced with several people associated with Centron. John Clifford, a Centron screenwriter wrote the script for \"Carnival of Souls\".\n\nOne of his most popular educational series covered the land and people \"south of the border\" (as the \"Middle America Regional Geography\" and \"La América del Sur\" series). Scripted by Peter Schnitzler and shot in many locations by cameraman Bob Rose, these were made under some (for that time) political difficulties. At one point, the series almost had to exclude Chile when government officials initially prevented film stock from leaving the country.\n\nAlthough Centron won many awards for its films, it is most famous for the Oscar nominated \"Leo Beuerman\". This simple profile of a short handicapped man with his tractor in downtown Lawrence was produced on a budget of $12,000 and eventually became one of the most popular classroom films of all time, selling an impressive 2300 prints.\n\nIt was also during this period that the company expanded its distribution of outside productions, including a number of National Film Board of Canada titles. The 1970s was a particularly golden age for nature documentaries, especially the \"Elementary Natural Science\" series of the team of Karl and Stephen Maslowski.\n\nIn 1981, Wolf and Mosser sold Centron to the Coronet division of Esquire, Inc. Production carried on, mostly in Illinois, under the Coronet banner for a few years with Bob Kohl as primary head. (The Phoenix Learning Group currently has distribution rights to the Coronet library, including many of Centron.) In 1984, the Gulf and Western Industries conglomerate took over the mother company and, in a swift move, Kohl successfully purchased Centron from Gulf and moved production back to Lawrence, Kansas. After continuing through the end of the decade (including a series of instructional films for Encyclopædia Britannica), Kohl then sold the company facilities to the University of Kansas in 1991, with the library of films added to their archive by the time the company officially folded in 1994.\n\nThis list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45206870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45206870", "title": "Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking", "text": "Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking\n\nThe Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking, or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information. It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including Library and Information Science and Health Communication.\n\nThe CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts. It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer. It specifies \"antecedents\" that explain why people become information seekers, \"information carrier characteristic\" that shape how they go about looking for information, and \"information seeking actions\" that reflect the nature of the search itself.\n\nThe CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB). There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are: Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions. The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information. Those factors are: Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs. These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process. The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities. This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information. A person’s understanding is developed through the information field. The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field. The final schema involves information seeking actions. This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking. There are three major dimensions: the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.\n\nThe CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease. In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.\n\nThe information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.\n\nThere are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search. For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.\n\nA key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”. According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.\n\nThe first stage, \"Casual\", is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.\nThe second stage is \"Purposive-Placid\". This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.\n\nThe third stage is \"Purposive-Clustered\". Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or BRCA 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.\n\nThe fourth stage, \"Directed\", includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.\n"}
{"id": "34530158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34530158", "title": "Dictogloss", "text": "Dictogloss\n\nDictogloss is a language teaching technique that is used to teach grammatical structures, in which students form small groups and summarize a target-language text. First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied. The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes. Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures, and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to focus on the form of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in task-based language teaching.\n\nDictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity.\n\nAn example of a dictogloss is the following: learners discuss the sea; the teacher then explains the task, and reads a short text on the sea to the class, who just listen; the teacher reads the text again and the learners take notes; in groups, the learners then reconstruct the text. In this activity, learners are required to reconstruct a short text by listening and noting down key words, which are then used as a base for reconstruction.\n\nAn alternative way of conducting a dictogloss activity is to have the teacher read a short, relevant text three times. The first time, the students listen only, and do not take notes. The second time, they are allowed to note down several key words. The third time, the learners are allowed to write as much as they desire. Following this, the students are instructed to create a summary of what they have heard on their own. When this task has been completed, they take their own summaries and work with a partner to co-construct a summary based on their individual work. Following this, they join with another pair to create a group of four to collaboratively reconstruct the text. Then, students compare their reconstruction of the work with the original to discuss similarities and differences from the source text. This activity can be used, for example, to draw attention to a particular language feature or to help develop students' abilities to synthesize information.\n\n"}

It stars Fred Savage playing a grade school student named Philip who gives a class report on dinosaurs, with the help of an animated chalkboard and Will Vinton's claymation dinosaurs. \n\nOriginally created in 1980, when it was known more simply as Dinosaur, the 17-minute claymation short by Vinton Studios \nwould later be used for this 1987 video. The popular short is also played at the Smithsonian Museum and has won numerous awards. This film is also played BOB's request in Rocky Hill, Connecticut at the museum in Dinosaur State Park.\n\n\"Dinosaurs!\" was designed as an educational film for young children new to the world of prehistoric life; the video slipcase describes the film with \"Discover the \"real\" monsters who dominated the earth for millions of years!\" The cartoon animation of the chalkboard is used to elaborate on attributes such as the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as their brain capacity, while the Vinton claymation illustrates, in a colorful and simplistic manner, the brutal lives of the many dinosaurs. The movie also introduces a music video for the song \"Mesozoic Mind\" by Charmer, featuring cartoon dinosaurs performing it.\n\nThe video—with beginning scenes filmed in 1987—begins with a young boy named Phillip (played by Fred Savage) sitting in his bedroom, listening to loud music, and struggling to find an idea for a class report on a science topic. While struggling to find some ideas, and irking his mother (who threatens to get his father if he does not turn off the music and go to bed) with his loud music, he plays a song on his boom box (titled Mesozoic Mind). And the song provides him with an inspiration for his report: DINOSAURS!\n\nPhilip then goes to sleep and has a dream where he discovers that the search for the truth about these magnificent animals and their astonishing 160-million-year success on earth is probably the most fascinating speculation there is. Phillip then finishes his report and presents it to the class. The class report is then covered through the 1980 claymation short Dinosaur by Will Vinton Productions. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "8087627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8087627", "title": "Education in Flanders", "text": "Education in Flanders\n\nThe education in the Flemish Community covers the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and consists of three networks (\"netten\"): government-provided education (\"gemeenschapsonderwijs\"), subsidized public schools (by provinces and municipalities) and subsidized free schools (mainly affiliated to the Catholic church).\n\nIn the past there were conflicts between state schools and Catholic schools (\"de schoolstrijd\"), and disputes regarding whether the Catholic schools' should be funded by the government. The 1958 School Pact was an agreement by the three large political parties (the Christian Democratic, Socialist and Liberal parties) to end these conflicts.\n\nDue to the federalization of Belgium, education is organised by the three communities since 1989. Since then, the Flemish Government organises education in the Flemish Region as well as in the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region where the Government of the French Community is also responsible. The Flemish Community organises the Dutch-language education but has to provide French-language schools in the 12 municipalities with language facilities within the Flemish Region.\n\nThe federal level only regulates a few general matters: the start and end of compulsory education (which is between the ages of 6 and 18), the minimal conditions for issuing diplomas, and the pension scheme. Article 24 of the Belgian Constitution furthermore guarantees free education, the right of parents to choose their school and the (philosophical, ideological and religious) neutrality of government-provided schools. These state schools have to provide the choice between the teaching of one of the recognized religions and non-denominational moral teaching.\n\nEducation is organised through three networks.\n\nFirst, there are state schools directly provided by the Flemish government, which is called \"Gemeenschapsonderwijs\" (literally \"community education\"), stylised as \"GO!\", education of the Flemish Community. They are both primary and secondary schools as well as adult education centres. Most secondary schools are commonly named \"(Koninklijk) Atheneum\" (\"(Royal) Atheneum\"), most of which were built in the 1960s during the \"schoolstrijd\" (\"school struggle\") in Belgium. One of the oldest athenea is the Royal Atheneum of Antwerp, which exists since 1808.\n\nSecondly, there are subsidized public schools (\"officieel gesubsidieerd onderwijs\"), which are public schools organized by provinces and municipalities. Those provided by the municipalities are coordinated through the Education Secretariat of the Cities and Municipalities of the Flemish Community (\"Onderwijssecretariaat van de Steden en Gemeenten van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap\"; OVSG). This network also includes a few schools organised by the Flemish Community Commission (VGC) in Brussels.\n\nLastly, there are subsidized free schools (\"vrij gesubsidieerd onderwijs\"), which is with about 70% of the pupils by far the largest group. They are mainly organized by an organization affiliated to the Catholic Church, organised by Catholic Education Flanders (\"Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen\"), formerly known as the Flemish Secretariat of the Catholic Education (\"Vlaams Secretariaat van het Katholiek Onderwijs\"; VSKO). Only eight schools are affiliated to the Protestant Church, so-called \"Schools with the Bible\". There are also non-denominational free schools, \"method schools\" using e.g. the Steiner, Freinet or Montessori education method.\n\nHomeschooling is also legal since \"learning\" is mandatory in Belgium as opposed to attending school. Homeschooling is very rare, but the numbers are rising slowly. For the year 2007—2008 the number of home-schooled children in Flanders rose to 279 in basic education and 504 in secondary education, out of a total of 1.3 million.\n\nBasic education (\"basisonderwijs\") consists of optional pre-school (\"kleuteronderwijs\") and six years of mandatory primary education (\"lager onderwijs\"). The mandatory education starts on 1 September of the year in which the child has its sixth birthday.\n\nSecondary education (\"secundair onderwijs\") also consists of six years starting from the age of 12.\nSecondary school is divided into four general types. Each type consists of a set of different directions that may vary from school to school. The general types are as follows:\nStudents with disabilities can follow Special Secondary Education (; BuSO), of different types.\n\nThere are five universities in the Flemish Community, each forming an \"association\" with one or more university colleges (\"hogescholen\").\n\nThe former Catholic University of Brussels (K.U. Brussel) merged into the Catholic University of Leuven.\n\nMany universities and university colleges are historically tied to their respective \"pillars\" in society, KU Leuven being the prominent Catholic university, Ghent University being tied to the socialist pillar and the Free University of Brussels representing the liberal pillar.\n\nCertain universities have agreements which give students the option of following certain courses in the French-speaking counterpart:\n\n\nAs part of the Bologna Process, the Flemish government set up in cooperation with the Dutch government an Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).\n\nAs of 2014, 227,943 students were enrolled in Flemish higher education.\n\nEducation in Belgium, particularly in Flanders, is often considered to be of high quality.\n\nIn the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Flanders is among the top countries. In mathematics for example, Flemish eighth-grade students were the 5th–6th best performing in 1995–2003 (Flanders is not included in the study for 2007).\n\nRelatively many students of neighbouring countries, especially from the Netherlands, attend Flemish schools.\n\nIn primary and secondary education, this is some 5,950 students as of 2011 (25,200 if families from neighbouring countries but actually living in Flanders are included too), a rising number. On the other hand, a decreasing 1,422 Flemish students attend schools in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe language used as medium of instruction in schools subsidized by the Flemish government is Dutch. Flemish schools in Brussels provide Dutch-medium education, whereas French-medium education there is provided by or recognised by the Government of the French Community. The Flemish Government is however required to provide French-medium schools in the twelve municipalities with language facilities if there is demand for it.\n\nContrary to French-speaking Belgium and other European countries, bilingual education is still rare in Flanders.\n\nIn higher education, the use of English is allowed but restricted.\n\nAll Dutch-speaking schools teach French as first foreign language, English being the second foreign language. German and Spanish are often also available depending on the school direction.\n\nCompared to other European countries, Flemish pupils aged 13–15 score remarkably well for their knowledge of English, which is taught as a second foreign language, although less so for French, which is the first foreign language.\n\nOlyfran is a popular contest organised to test students' knowledge of the French language.\n\nIn Brussels, the Dutch-speaking school system functions separately from the French-language education system. For the Flemish schools in Brussels, The \"Scholengroep Brussels\" serves as the organising body for most of the \"state schools\" (\"GO!\" education), while the Flemish Community Commission is the organising body for the Dutch-speaking Brussels schools that until 1995 belonged to the province of Brabant.\n\nIn February 2012, the Dutch-speaking schools in the Brussels-Capital Region counted 11,776 in pre-school education, 14,850 pupils in primary education and 12,535 in secondary education. These numbers have been growing considerably since several decades.\n\nSome of the students speak Dutch at home, others French, but about half of those attending Dutch-speaking schools in Brussels use another language at home.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35397266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35397266", "title": "Female education in Nigeria", "text": "Female education in Nigeria\n\nWomen in Nigeria have had various challenges in order to obtain equal education in all forms of formal education in Nigeria. Education is a basic human right and has been recognized as such since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the gross national product and increase of life expectancy. Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of the investment in human capital in any society. Rapid socio-economic development of a nation has been observed to depend on the calibre of women and their education in that country. Education bestows on women a disposition for a lifelong acquisition of knowledge, values, attitudes, competence and skills.\n\nTo ensure equal access to education, the National Policy on Education states that access to education is a right for all Nigerian children regardless of gender, religion and disability.\n\nBefore 1920, primary and secondary education in Nigeria was within the scope of voluntary Christian organizations. Out of a total of 25 secondary schools established by 1920, three were girls only and the remainder were exclusively for boys. In 1920, the colonial government started giving out subvention to voluntary associations involved in education, the grant giving lasted till the early 1950s and at that point, education was placed under the control of regions. In 1949, only eight out of a total of 57 secondary schools were exclusively for girls. These schools are Methodist Girls' High School, Lagos (1879), St Anne’s School, Molete, Ibadan (1896), St. Theresa’s College, Ibadan (1932), Queens College, Lagos, (1927) Holy Rosary College, Enugu (1935), Anglican Girls Grammar School, Lagos, (1945), Queen Amina College and Alhuda College, Kano. From 1950 up till 1960, six more notable schools were established and by 1960, there were fourteen notable girl's schools, ten mixed and sixty one boys only.\n\n\nFrom 1970 to 1994, the enrollment of girls in primary education steadily increased from 30% to as high as 80%. However, differences exist between enrollment of males and females in all levels of education. In addition, the drop out rate of girls is higher than boys and participation in STEM classes are lower for girls than boys. In 2002, the combined gross enrollment for primary, secondary and tertiary schools for female was 57% compared to 71% for males. This translates into fewer women in certain economic fields as well. The percentages of female workers in some selected professions were as follow: architects, 2.4%, quantity surveyors, 3.5%, lawyers/jurists, 25.4%, lecturers, 11.8%, obstetricians and gynecologists, 8.4%, pediatricians, 33.3%, media practitioners, 18.3%.\n\nIssues of gender equality in education have been the subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. Currently, the female adult literacy rate (ages 15 and above) for the country was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria the gender gap in literacy rates at the rural level between boys and girls was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. However, in the age group 6–9 years (primary school ages) it was only 3.9 percent in favour of boys. This indicates that there is a gender dimension to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participation Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.\n\nGender disparity is also visible in the education of children with disabilities, a study in the 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion that the male will carry the family name while the female will marry. Also the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes.\n\nThe completion of the second Millennium Development Goal’s (MDG) target i.e. ‘education for all’ by 2015 is at risk after having missed the initial deadline of 2005. In Nigeria, educational facilities are generally believed to be inadequate and access is limited for many, especially girls and women. According to the United Nations Human Development Report (2005), Nigeria was classified as a low development country in respect of equality in educational accessibility.\n\nThere are various cultural and socioeconomic issues that prevent women from having adequate access to education.\n\nVarious cultural and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view is that it is better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place is believed to be the kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.\n\nThe Nigerian society (both historical and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural practices that are potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.\n\nThe decline in economic activities since the early 1980s has made education a luxury to many Nigerians, especially those in rural areas. Because Nigerian parents are known to invest in children according to sex, birth order or natural endowments, girls and boys are not exact substitutes. Often the family can only afford to send one child to school. Because daughters have assumed responsibilities in the home, she is less likely to be the one to attend school.\n\nAt the beginning of colonialism and Christianity, rigid ideals about gender perceptions were imposed on the African mind. Thereafter, the woman’s role has come to be limited to sexual and commercial labour; satisfying the sexual needs of men, working in the fields, carrying loads, tending babies and preparing food. The disempowering colonial ‘ideology of domesticity’ as espoused by the practice of ‘housewification’ provided the springboard for women’s educational imbalance in parts of Africa. As such, the overall human development in Nigeria is being hindered by this unevenness in educational accessibility across gender categories.\n\nWhile most of the Millennium Development Goals face a deadline of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it will be impossible to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.\n\nMany policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made on the grounds that literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education. Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is one of the keys to success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. \"For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition,\" says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. \"Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner.\"\n\nCurrently Nigerian women are making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male dominated professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents. The subsequent creation of the National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues for the promotion of women's educational issues and the enhancement of the role of women in national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry. Today, more children go to school and learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap between boys and girls aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.\n\nNigerian women’s access to formal education is still being constrained due to their unfair workload within the household division of labour. Consequently, the realization of the MDG3’s ‘gender equality and women empowerment’ targets is being impeded harshly. Moreover, according to Bhavani, such unequal social and gender relations needs to be transformed in order to take women out of want and poverty.\nA 2007 UNESCO and UNICEF report addressed the issue of education from a rights-based approach. Three interrelated rights were specified and must be addressed in concert in order to provide education for all:\n\nUNESCO estimates that an estimated $11 billion per year is necessary to reach the 2015 EFA goals. The disparity between need and aid is apparent: aid sent to low-income countries to provide basic education in 2004 and 2005 was at an average of $3.1 billion per year. The Fast Track Initiative (FTI) provides one of the most promising paths to universal primary education by 2015. Set up as a partnership between donors and developing countries and non-governmental organizations, the FTI endorses developing countries that put primary education at the forefront of their domestic efforts and develop sound national education plans. Nigeria is already maximizing these resources for the advancement of the younger generation.\n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from discrimination and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning.\n\nGovernment policies that affect girl-child education since 1985 include:\n\n1986: Blueprint on Women's Education. An outreach and awareness campaign to promote the importance of equal education, increase the available educational resources for females and reduce drop out rates among female students.\n\n1986: Nomadic Education Programme. Increase the access to education for children of Nomads without jeopardizing pastoralism.\n\n1991: National Commission for Mass Literacy and Non-formal Education. A policy to motivate parents and families to send their school-age children to school and to establish training facilities that concentrate on domestic science, home economics and crafts.\n\n1994: Family Support Basic Education Programme. A programme to encourage families living in rural areas to send girls to go to school as a means of promoting youth development.\n\n1999: Universal Basic Education. Reduction in geographic and gender disparity in school enrolment.\n\n2001: National Policy on Women\n\n2002: Education For-all Fast Track Initiative.\n\n2003: Strategy for Acceleration of Girls Education in Nigeria.\n\n2004: National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategies (NEEDS).\n\n2004:Universal Basic Education Act.\n\n\nGeneral:\n"}

Due to the large numbers, the deaths during the rule of the Khmer Rouge are commonly known as the Cambodian genocide.\nThe Khmer Rouge took power at the end of the Cambodian Civil War and were only toppled after the invasion of Cambodia by the neighbouring Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Most of Cambodia remained under Vietnamese occupation for over a decade.\n\nBy the 17 April 1975 Khmer Rouge victory, Pol Pot and his associates occupied the most important positions in the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) and in the state hierarchies. Pol Pot had been CPK general secretary since February 1963. His associates functioned as the party's Political Bureau, and they held a majority of the seats on the Central Committee.\n\nThrough the 1970s, and especially after mid-1975, the party was shaken by factional struggles, including armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. Punitive measures resulted in 1977 and 1978 when hundreds of thousands of people, including some of the most important CPK leaders, were executed.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge abolished the Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea (established in 1970). Cambodia did not have any sort of government until the proclamation of the Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea on January 5, 1976.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge continued to use King Norodom Sihanouk as a figurehead for the government until April 2, 1976, when Sihanouk resigned as head of state. Sihanouk remained under insecure house arrest in Phnom Penh, until late in the war with Vietnam when he departed for the United States where he made Democratic Kampuchea's case before the Security Council. He eventually relocated to China.\n\nThe \"rights and duties of the individual\" were briefly defined in Article 12. They included none of what are commonly regarded as guarantees of political human rights except the statement that \"men and women are equal in every respect.\" The document declared, however, that \"all workers\" and \"all peasants\" were \"masters\" of their factories and fields. An assertion that \"there is absolutely no unemployment in Democratic Kampuchea\" rings true in light of the regime's massive use of force.\n\nThe Constitution defined Democratic Kampuchea's foreign policy principles in Article 21, the document's longest, in terms of \"independence, peace, neutrality, and nonalignment.\" It pledged the country's support to anti-imperialist struggles in the Third World. In light of the regime's aggressive attacks against Vietnamese, Thai, and Lao territory during 1977 and 1978, the promise to \"maintain close and friendly relations with all countries sharing a common border\" bore little resemblance to reality.\n\nGovernmental institutions were outlined very briefly in the Constitution. The legislature, the Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly (KPRA), contained 250 members \"representing workers, peasants, and other working people and the Kampuchean Revolutionary army.\" One hundred and fifty KPRA seats were allocated for peasant representatives; fifty, for the armed forces; and fifty, for worker and other representatives. The legislature was to be popularly elected for a five-year term. Its first and only election was held on March 20, 1976. \"New people\" apparently were not allowed to participate.\n\nThe executive branch of government also was chosen by the KPRA.[Citation Needed] It consisted of a state presidium \"responsible for representing the state of Democratic Kampuchea inside and outside the country.\" It served for a five-year term, and its president was head of state. Khieu Samphan was the only person to serve in this office, which he assumed after Sihanouk's resignation. The judicial system was composed of \"people's courts\", the judges for which were appointed by the KPRA, as was the executive branch.\n\nThe Constitution did not mention regional or local government institutions. After assuming power, the Khmer Rouge abolished the old provinces (\"khet\") and replaced them with seven zones; the Northern Zone, Northeastern Zone, Northwestern Zone, Central Zone, Eastern Zone, Western Zone, and Southwestern Zone. There were also two other regional-level units: the Kracheh Special Region Number 505 and, until 1977, the Siemreab Special Region Number 106.\n\nThe zones were divided into \"damban\" (regions) that were given numbers. Number One, appropriately, encompassed the Samlot region of the Northwestern Zone (including Battambang Province), where the insurrection against Sihanouk had erupted in early 1967. With this exception, the damban appear to have been numbered arbitrarily.\n\nThe damban were divided into \"srok\" (districts), \"khum\" (subdistricts), and \"phum\" (villages), the latter usually containing several hundred people. This pattern was roughly similar to that which existed under Sihanouk and the Khmer Republic, but inhabitants of the villages were organized into \"krom\" (groups) composed of ten to fifteen families. On each level, administration was directed by a three-person committee (\"kanak\", or \"kena\").\n\nCPK members occupied committee posts at the higher levels. Subdistrict and village committees were often staffed by local poor peasants, and, very rarely, by \"new people.\" Cooperatives (\"sahakor\"), similar in jurisdictional area to the khum, assumed local government responsibilities in some areas.\n\nAccording to Pol Pot, Cambodia was made up of four classes: peasants and workers, bourgeoisie, capitalists, and feudalists. Post-revolutionary society, as defined by the 1976 Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea, consisted of workers, peasants, and \"all other Kampuchean working people.\" No allowance was made for a transitional stage such as China's \"New Democracy\" in which \"patriotic\" landlord or bourgeois elements were permitted to play a role in socialist construction.\n\nSihanouk writes that in 1975 he, Khieu Samphan, and Khieu Thirith went to visit Zhou Enlai, who was gravely ill. Zhou warned them not to attempt to achieve communism in a single step, as China had attempted in the late 1950s with the Great Leap Forward. Khieu Samphan and Khieu Thirith \"just smiled an incredulous and superior smile.\" Khieu Samphan and Son Sen later boasted to Sihanouk that \"we will be the first nation to create a completely communist society without wasting time on intermediate steps.\"\n\nAlthough conditions varied from region to region, a situation that was, in part, a reflection of factional divisions that still existed within the CPK during the 1970s, the testimony of refugees reveals that the most salient social division was between the politically suspect \"new people\", those driven out of the towns after the communist victory, and the more reliable \"old people\", the poor and lower middle-class peasants who had remained in the countryside. Despite the ideological commitment to radical equality, CPK members and the armed forces constituted a clearly recognizable elite. \n\nThe working class was a negligible factor because of the evacuation of the urban areas and the idling of most of the country's few factories. The one important working class group in pre-revolutionary Cambodia—labourers on large rubber plantations—traditionally had consisted mostly of Vietnamese emigrants and thus was politically suspect.\n\nThe number of people, including refugees, living in the urban areas on the eve of the communist victory probably was somewhat more than 3 million, out of the total population of roughly 8 million. As mentioned, despite their rural origins, the refugees were considered \"new people\"—that is, people unsympathetic to Democratic Kampuchea. Some doubtless passed as \"old people\" after returning to their native villages, but the Khmer Rouge seem to have been extremely vigilant in recording and keeping track of the movements of families and of individuals.\n\nThe lowest unit of social control, the \"krom\" (group), consisted of ten to fifteen nuclear families whose activities were closely supervised by a three-person committee. The committee chairman was selected by the CPK. This grass roots leadership was required to note the social origin of each family under its jurisdiction and to report it to persons higher up in the Angkar hierarchy. The number of \"new people\" may initially have been as high as 2.5 million.\n\nThe \"new people\" were treated as forced labourers. They were constantly moved, were forced to do the hardest physical labour, and worked in the most inhospitable, fever-ridden parts of the country, such as forests, upland areas, and swamps. \"New people\" were segregated from \"old people\", enjoyed little or no privacy, and received the smallest rice rations. When the country experienced food shortages in 1977, the \"new people\" suffered the most.\n\nThe medical care available to them was primitive or nonexistent. Families often were separated because people were divided into work brigades according to age and sex and sent to different parts of the country. \"New people\" were subjected to unending political indoctrination and could be executed without trial.\n\nThe situation of the \"old people\" under Khmer Rouge rule was more ambiguous. Refugee interviews reveal cases in which villagers were treated as harshly as the \"new people\", enduring forced labour, indoctrination, the separation of children from parents, and executions; however, they were generally allowed to remain in their native villages.\n\nBecause of their age-old resentment of the urban and rural elites, many of the poorest peasants probably were sympathetic to Khmer Rouge goals. In the early 1980s, visiting Western journalists found that the issue of peasant support for the Khmer Rouge was an extremely sensitive subject that officials of the People's Republic of Kampuchea were not inclined to discuss.\n\nAlthough the Southwestern Zone was one original centre of power of the Khmer Rouge, and cadres administered it with strict discipline, random executions were relatively rare, and \"new people\" were not persecuted if they had a cooperative attitude. In the Western Zone and in the Northwestern Zone, conditions were harsh. Starvation was general in the latter zone because cadres sent rice to Phnom Penh rather than distributing it to the local population. In the Northern Zone and in the Central Zone, there seem to have been more executions than there were victims of starvation. Little reliable information emerged on conditions in the Northeastern Zone, one of the most isolated parts of Cambodia.\n\nOn the surface, society in Democratic Kampuchea was strictly egalitarian. The Khmer language, like many in Southeast Asia, has a complex system of usages to define speakers' rank and social status. These usages were abandoned. People were encouraged to call each other \"friend\", or \"comrade\" (in Khmer, មិត្ដ mitt), and to avoid traditional signs of deference such as bowing or folding the hands in salutation.\n\nLanguage was transformed in other ways. The Khmer Rouge invented new terms. People were told they must \"forge\" (\"lot dam\") a new revolutionary character, that they were the \"instruments\" (\"opokar\") of the Angkar, and that nostalgia for pre-revolutionary times (\"chheu satek arom\", or \"memory sickness\") could result in their receiving Angkar's \"invitation\" to be deindustrialised and to live in a concentration camp.\n\nMembers and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar, and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living than the rest of the population. Refugees agree that, even during times of severe food shortage, members of the grass-roots elite had adequate, if not luxurious, supplies of food. One refugee wrote that \"pretty new bamboo houses\" were built for Khmer Rouge cadres along the river in Phnom Penh.\n\nAccording to Craig Etcheson, an authority on Democratic Kampuchea, members of the revolutionary army lived in self-contained colonies, and they had a \"distinctive warrior-caste ethos.\" Armed forces units personally loyal to Pol Pot, known as the \"Unconditional Divisions\", were a privileged group within the military.\n\nAlthough their revolutionary ideology was extreme, the highest ranks of the Khmer Rouge leadership had a tendency to nepotism similar of the Sihanouk-era elite. Pol Pot's wife, Khieu Ponnary, was head of the Association of Democratic Khmer Women and her younger sister, Khieu Thirith, served as minister of social action. These two women were considered among the half-dozen most powerful personalities in Democratic Kampuchea. Son Sen's wife, Yun Yat, served as minister for culture, education and learning.\n\nSeveral of Pol Pot's nephews and nieces were given jobs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of Ieng Sary's daughters was appointed head of the Calmette Hospital although she had not graduated from secondary school. A niece of Ieng Sary was given a job as English translator for Radio Phnom Penh although her fluency in the language was relative.\n\nFamily ties were important, both because of the culture and because of the leadership's intense secretiveness and distrust of outsiders, especially of pro-Vietnamese communists. Different ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, were controlled and exploited by powerful Khmer Rouge families. Administering the diplomatic corps was regarded as an especially profitable fiefdom.\n\nDemocratic Kampuchea's economic policy was similar to, and possibly inspired by, China's radical Great Leap Forward that carried out immediate collectivisation of the Chinese countryside in 1958. During the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge established \"mutual assistance groups\" in the areas they occupied.\n\nAfter 1973, these were organised into \"low-level cooperatives\" in which land and agricultural implements were lent by peasants to the community but remained their private property. \"High-level cooperatives\", in which private property was abolished and the harvest became the collective property of the peasants, appeared in 1974. \"Communities\", introduced in early 1976, were a more advanced form of high-level cooperative in which communal dining was instituted. State-owned farms also were established.\n\nFar more than the Chinese communists, the Khmer Rouge pursued the ideal of economic self-sufficiency, specifically the version that Khieu Samphan had outlined in his 1959 doctoral dissertation. Currency was abolished, and domestic trade or commerce could be conducted only through barter. Rice, measured in tins, became the most important medium of exchange, although people also bartered gold, jewelry, and other personal possessions.\n\nForeign trade was almost completely halted, though there was a limited revival in late 1976 and early 1977. China was the most important trading partner, but commerce amounting to a few million dollars was also conducted with France, the United Kingdom, and with the United States through a Hong Kong intermediary.\n\nFrom the Khmer Rouge perspective, the country was free of foreign economic domination for the first time in its 2,000-year history. By mobilising the people into work brigades organised in a military fashion, the Khmer Rouge hoped to unleash the masses' productive forces.\n\nThere was an \"Angkorian\" component to economic policy. That ancient kingdom had grown rich and powerful because it controlled extensive irrigation systems that produced surpluses of rice. Agriculture in modern Cambodia depended, for the most part, on seasonal rains.\n\nBy building a nationwide system of irrigation canals, dams, and reservoirs, the leadership believed it would be possible to produce rice on a year-round basis. It was the \"new people\" who suffered and sacrificed the most to complete these ambitious projects.\n\nAlthough the Khmer Rouge implemented an \"agriculture first\" policy in order to achieve self-sufficiency, they were not, as some observers have argued, \"back-to-nature\" primitivists. Although the 1970–75 war and the evacuation of the cities had destroyed or idled most industry, small contingents of workers were allowed to return to the urban areas to reopen some plants.\n\nLike their Chinese counterparts, the Cambodian communists had great faith in the inventive power and the technical aptitude of the masses, and they constantly published reports of peasants' adapting old mechanical parts to new uses. Similarly to Mao's regime, which had attempted unsuccessfully to build a new steel industry based on backyard furnaces during the Great Leap Forward, the Khmer Rouge sought to move industry to the countryside. Significantly, the seal of Democratic Kampuchea displayed not only sheaves of rice and irrigation sluices, but also a factory with smokestacks.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge regarded traditional education with undiluted hostility. After the fall of Phnom Penh, they executed thousands of teachers. Those who had been educators prior to 1975 survived by hiding their identities.\n\nAside from teaching basic mathematical skills and literacy, the major goal of the new educational system was to instill revolutionary values in the young. For a regime at war with most of Cambodia's traditional values, this meant that it was necessary to create a gap between the values of the young and the values of the nonrevolutionary old.\n\nThe regime recruited children to spy on adults. The pliancy of the younger generation made them, in the Angkar's words, the \"dictatorial instrument of the party.\" In 1962 the communists had created a special secret organisation, the Democratic Youth League, that, in the early 1970s, changed its name to the Communist Youth League of Kampuchea. Pol Pot considered Youth League alumni as his most loyal and reliable supporters, and used them to gain control of the central and of the regional CPK apparatus. The powerful Khieu Thirith, minister of social action, was responsible for directing the youth movement.\n\nHardened young cadres, many little more than twelve years of age, were enthusiastic accomplices in some of the regime's worst atrocities. Sihanouk, who was kept under virtual house arrest in Phnom Penh between 1976 and 1978, wrote in \"War and Hope\" that his youthful guards, having been separated from their families and given a thorough indoctrination, were encouraged to play cruel games involving the torture of animals. Having lost parents, siblings, and friends in the war and lacking the Buddhist values of their elders, the Khmer Rouge youth also lacked the inhibitions that would have dampened their zeal for revolutionary terror.\n\nHealth facilities in the years 1975 to 1978 were abysmally poor. Many physicians either were executed or were prohibited from practicing. It appears that the party and the armed forces elite had access to Western medicine and to a system of hospitals that offered reasonable treatment, but ordinary people, especially \"new people\", were expected to use traditional plant and herbal remedies that were of debatable usefulness. Some bartered their rice rations and personal possessions to obtain aspirin and other simple drugs.\n\nThe deportations were one of the markers of the beginning of the Khmer Rouge rule. They demanded and then forced the people to leave the cities and live in the countryside. Phnom Penh—populated by 2.5 million people —was soon nearly empty. The roads out of the city were clogged with evacuees. Similar evacuations occurred throughout the nation.\n\nThe conditions of the evacuation and the treatment of the people involved depended often on which military units and commanders were conducting the specific operations. Pol Pot's brother – Chhay, who worked as a Republican journalist in the capital – was reported to have died during the evacuation of Phnom Penh.\n\nEven Phnom Penh's hospitals were emptied of their patients. The Khmer Rouge provided transportation for some of the aged and the disabled, and they set up stockpiles of food outside the city for the refugees; however, the supplies were inadequate to sustain the hundreds of thousands of people on the road. Even seriously injured hospital patients, many without any means of conveyance, were summarily forced to leave regardless of their condition.\n\nThe foreign community, about 800 people, was quarantined in the French embassy compound, and by the end of the month the foreigners were taken by truck to the Thai border. Khmer women who were married to foreigners were allowed to accompany their husbands, but Khmer men were not permitted to leave with their foreign wives.\n\nWestern historians claim that the motives were political, based on deep-rooted resentment of the cities. The Khmer Rouge was determined to turn the country into a nation of peasants in which the corruption and \"parasitism\" of city life would be completely uprooted. In addition, Pol Pot wanted to break up the \"enemy spy organisations\" that allegedly were based in the urban areas. Finally, it seems that Pol Pot and his hard-line associates on the CPK Political Bureau used the forced evacuations to gain control of the city's population and to weaken the position of their factional rivals within the communist party.\n\nA security apparatus called Santebal was part of the Khmer Rouge organizational structure well before April 17, 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took control over Cambodia. Son Sen, later the Deputy Prime Minister for Defense of Democratic Kampuchea, was in charge of the Santebal, and in that capacity he appointed Comrade Duch to run its security apparatus. When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, Duch moved his headquarters to Phnom Penh and reported directly to Son Sen. At that time, a small chapel in the capital was used to incarcerate the regime's prisoners, who totaled fewer than two hundred. In May 1976, Duch moved his headquarters to its final location, a former high school known as Tuol Sleng, which could hold up to 1,500 prisoners.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge government arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed \"enemies\":\n\nThrough the 1970s, and especially after mid-1975, the party was also shaken by factional struggles. There were even armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. The resultant purges reached a crest in 1977 and 1978 when thousands, including some important KCP leaders, were executed.\n\nToday, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as \"Comrade Duch\".\n\nThe torture system at Tuol Sleng was designed to make prisoners confess to whatever crimes they were charged with by their captors. In their confessions, the prisoners were asked to describe their personal background. If they were party members, they had to say when they joined the revolution and describe their work assignments in DK. Then the prisoners would relate their supposed treasonous activities in chronological order. The third section of the confession text described prisoners' thwarted conspiracies and supposed treasonous conversations. At the end, the confessions would list a string of traitors who were the prisoners' friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Some lists contained over a hundred names. People whose names were in the confession list were often called in for interrogation.\nTypical confessions ran into thousands of words in which the prisoner would interweave true events in their lives with imaginary accounts of their espionage activities for the CIA, the KGB, or Vietnam.\n\nSome 17,000 people passed through Tuol Sleng Centre (also known as S-21) before they were taken to sites (also known as The Killing Fields), outside Phnom Penh such as Choeung Ek where most were executed (mainly by pickaxes to save bullets) and buried in mass graves. Of the thousands who entered Tuol Sleng only twelve are known to have survived.\n\nModern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era throughout Cambodia. The analysis of mass graves revealed the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution. Detailed demographic study demonstrates that the total population loss in Cambodia was 1.671 and 1.871 million people from 1975 to 1979, or 21 to 24 percent of Cambodia's 1975 population. An additional 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980, largely as a result of the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policy.\n\nArticle 20 of the 1976 Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea guaranteed religious freedom, but it also declared that \"all reactionary religions that are detrimental to Democratic Kampuchea and the Kampuchean People are strictly forbidden.\" About 85 percent of the population follows the Theravada school of Buddhism. The country's 40,000 to 60,000 Buddhist monks, regarded by the regime as social parasites, were defrocked and forced into labour brigades.\n\nMany monks were executed; temples and pagodas were destroyed or turned into storehouses or gaols. Images of the Buddha were defaced and dumped into rivers and lakes. People who were discovered praying or expressing religious sentiments were often killed. The Christian and Muslim communities also were even more persecuted, as they were labelled as part of a pro-Western cosmopolitan sphere, hindering Cambodian culture and society.\n\nThe Roman Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh was completely razed. The Khmer Rouge forced Muslims to eat pork, which they regard as forbidden \"(ḥarām).\" Many of those who refused were killed. Christian clergy and Muslim imams were executed. One hundred and thirty Cham mosques were destroyed.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge banned by decree the existence of ethnic Chinese, Vietnamese, Muslim Cham, and 20 other minorities, which altogether constituted 15% of the population at the beginning of the Khmer Rouge's rule.\n\nTens of thousands of Vietnamese were raped, mutilated, and murdered in regime-organised massacres. Most of the survivors fled to Vietnam.\n\nThe Cham, a Muslim minority who are the descendants of migrants from the old state of Champa, were forced to adopt the Khmer language and customs. Their communities, which traditionally had existed apart from Khmer villages, were broken up. Forty thousand Cham were killed in two districts of Kampong Cham Province alone. Thai minorities living near the Thai border also were persecuted.\n\nThe state of the Chinese Cambodians was described as \"the worst disaster ever to befall any ethnic Chinese community in Southeast Asia\". Cambodians of Chinese descent were massacred by the Khmer Rouge under the justification that they \"used to exploit the Cambodian people\". The Chinese were stereotyped as traders and moneylenders, and therefore were associated with capitalism. Among the Khmer, the Chinese were also resented for their lighter skin color and cultural differences. Hundreds of Chinese families were rounded up in 1978 and told that they were to be resettled, but were actually executed. At the beginning of the Khmer Rouge's rule in 1975, there were 425,000 ethnic Chinese in Cambodia; by the end in 1979, there were 200,000. In addition to being a proscribed ethnic group by the government, the Chinese were predominantly city-dwellers, making them vulnerable to the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary ruralism. The government of the People's Republic of China did not protest the killings of ethnic Chinese in Cambodia.\nThe policies of the Khmer Rouge towards Sino-Cambodians seems puzzling in light of the fact that the two most powerful people in the regime and presumably the originators of the racist doctrine, Pol Pot and Nuon Chea, both had mixed Chinese-Cambodian ancestry. Other senior figures in the Khmer Rouge state apparatus such as Son Sen and Ta Mok also had Chinese ethnic heritage.\n\nIn the late 1980s, little was known of Khmer Rouge policies toward the tribal peoples of the northeast, the Khmer Loeu. Pol Pot established an insurgent base in the tribal areas of Ratanakiri Province in the early 1960s, and he may have had a substantial Khmer Loeu following. Predominantly animist peoples, with few ties to the Buddhist culture of the lowland Khmers, the Khmer Loeu had resented Sihanouk's attempts to \"civilise\" them.\n\nThe 'Democratic Kampuchea' regime had closer ties with China (its main backer) and to a lesser extent with North Korea. In 1977, in a message congratulating the Cambodian comrades on the 17th anniversary of the CKP, Kim Jong-Il congratulated the Cambodian people for having \"wiped out [...] counterrevolutionary group of spies who had committed subversive activities and sabotage\" Only China, North Korea, Egypt, Albania, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam (until December 1977), Romania and Yugoslavia had diplomatic missions in Phnom Penh.\n\nNot content with ruling Cambodia, the KR leaders also dreamed of reviving the Angkorian empire of a thousand years earlier, which ruled over large parts of what today are Thailand and Vietnam. This involved launching military attacks into southern Vietnam in which thousands of unarmed villagers were massacred.\n\nImmediately following the Khmer Rouge victory in 1975, there were skirmishes between their troops and Vietnamese forces. A number of incidents occurred in May 1975. The Cambodians launched attacks on the Vietnamese islands of Phú Quốc and Thổ Chu causing the death of over 500 civilians and intruded into Vietnamese border provinces. In late May, at about the same time that the United States launched an air strike against the oil refinery at Kompong Som, following the \"Mayagüez\" incident, Vietnamese forces seized the Cambodian island of Poulo Wai. According to Republic of Vietnam, the island of Poulo Wai was a part of Vietnam since the 18th century and the island was under Cambodian administrative management in 1939 in accordance with decisions of French conlonists. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has recognized the island of Poulo Wai as part of Cambodia since 1976, and the recognition is seen as a sign of goodwill by Vietnam to preserve its relationship with Cambodia.\n\nThe following month, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary visited Hanoi. They proposed a friendship treaty between the two countries, an idea that met with a cool reception from Vietnam's leaders. Although the Vietnamese evacuated Poulo Wai in August, incidents continued along Cambodia's northeastern border. At the instigation of the Phnom Penh regime, thousands of Vietnamese also were driven out of Cambodia.\n\nRelations between Cambodia and Vietnam improved in 1976, in part because of Pol Pot's preoccupation with intraparty challenges. In May Cambodian and Vietnamese representatives met in Phnom Penh in order to establish a commission to resolve border disagreements.\n\nThe Vietnamese, however, refused to recognize the \"Brévié Line\"—the colonial-era demarcation of maritime borders between the two countries—and the negotiations broke down. In late September, however, a few days before Pol Pot was forced to resign as prime minister, air links were established between Phnom Penh and Hanoi.\n\nWith Pol Pot back in the forefront of the regime in 1977, the situation rapidly deteriorated. Incidents escalated along all of Cambodia's borders. Khmer Rouge forces attacked villages in the border areas of Thailand near Aranyaprathet. Brutal murders of Thai villagers, including women and children, were the first widely reported concrete evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities. There were also incidents along the Laos border.\n\nAt approximately the same time, villages in Vietnam's border areas underwent renewed attacks. In turn, Vietnam launched air strikes against Cambodia. From April 18 to 30, 1975, Cambodian troops, after invading Vietnamese province of An Giang, carried out the Ba Chúc massacre causing 3,157 civilian death in province of Tây Ninh, Vietnam. In September, border fighting resulted in as many as 1,000 Vietnamese civilian casualties. The following month, the Vietnamese counter-attacked in a campaign involving a force of 20,000 personnel.\n\nVietnamese defense minister General Võ Nguyên Giáp underestimated the tenacity of the Khmer Rouge, however, and was obliged to commit an additional 58,000 reinforcements in December. On January 6, 1978, Giap's forces began an orderly withdrawal from Cambodian territory. The Vietnamese apparently believed they had \"taught a lesson\" to the Cambodians, but Pol Pot proclaimed this a \"victory\" even greater than that of April 17, 1975. For several years, the Vietnamese government sought in vain to establish peaceful relations with the KR regime. But the KR leaders were intent on war. Behind this seeming insanity clearly lay the assumption that China would support the KR militarily in such a conflict.\n\nFaced with growing Khmer Rouge belligerence, the Vietnamese leadership decided in early 1978 to support internal resistance to the Pol Pot regime, with the result that the Eastern Zone became a focus of insurrection. War hysteria reached bizarre levels within Democratic Kampuchea. In May 1978, on the eve of So Phim's Eastern Zone uprising, Radio Phnom Penh declared that if each Cambodian soldier killed thirty Vietnamese, only 2 million troops would be needed to eliminate the entire Vietnamese population of 50 million. It appears that the leadership in Phnom Penh was seized with immense territorial ambitions, i.e., to recover Kampuchea Krom, the Mekong Delta region, which they regarded as Khmer territory.\n\nMassacres of ethnic Vietnamese and of their sympathizers by the Khmer Rouge intensified in the Eastern Zone after the May revolt. In November, Vorn Vet led an unsuccessful coup d'état. There were now tens of thousands of Cambodian and Vietnamese exiles on Vietnamese territory.\n\nOn December 3, 1978, Radio Hanoi announced the formation of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (KNUFNS). This was a heterogeneous group of communist and noncommunist exiles who shared an antipathy to the Pol Pot regime and a virtually total dependence on Vietnamese backing and protection. The KNUFNS provided the semblance, if not the reality, of legitimacy for Vietnam's invasion of Democratic Kampuchea and for its subsequent establishment of a satellite regime in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn the meantime, as 1978 wore on, Cambodian bellicosity in the border areas surpassed Hanoi's threshold of tolerance. Vietnamese policy makers opted for a military solution and, on December 22, Vietnam launched its offensive with the intent of overthrowing Democratic Kampuchea. A force of 120,000, consisting of combined armor and infantry units with strong artillery support, drove west into the level countryside of Cambodia's southeastern provinces. Together, the Vietnamese army and the National Salvation Front struck at the KR on December 25.\n\nAfter a seventeen-day campaign, Phnom Penh fell to the advancing Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. Pol Pot and the main leaders initially took refuge near the border with Thailand. After making deals with several governments, they were able to use Thailand as a safe staging area for the construction and operation of new redoubts in the mountain and jungle fastness of Cambodia's periphery, Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders regrouped their units, issued a new call to arms, and reignited a stubborn insurgency against the regime in power as they had done in the late 1960s.\n\nFor the moment, however, the Vietnamese invasion had accomplished its purpose of deposing an unlamented and particularly violent dictatorship. A new administration of ex-Khmer Rouge fighters under the control of Hanoi was quickly established (who are ruling till present), and it set about competing, both domestically and internationally, with the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia.\n\nPeace still eluded the war-ravaged nation, however, and although the insurgency set in motion by the Khmer Rouge proved unable to topple the new Vietnamese-controlled regime in Phnom Penh, it did nonetheless keep the country in a permanent state of insecurity. The new administration was propped up by a substantial Vietnamese military force and civilian advisory effort.\n\nAs events in the 1980s progressed, the main preoccupations of the new regime were survival, restoring the economy, and combating the Khmer Rouge insurgency by military and by political means. The fostering of activity to meet these imperatives and the building of institutions are described in subsequent articles in the History of Cambodia series.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a margin of 71 to 35 for the KR to retain their seat at the UN, with 34 abstentions and 12 absentees. The seat was occupied by Thiounn Prasith, an old cadre of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary from their student days in Paris and one of the 21 attendees at the 1960 KPRP Second Congress. The seat was retained under the name 'Democratic Kampuchea' until 1982 and then 'Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea' until 1993.\n\nAccording to journalist Elizabeth Becker, former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski said that in 1979, \"I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot. Pol Pot was an abomination. We could never support him, but China could.\" Brzezinski has denied this, writing that the Chinese were aiding Pol Pot \"without any help or encouragement from the United States.\"\n\nChina, the U.S., and other Western countries opposed an expansion of Vietnamese and Soviet influence in Indochina, and refused to recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea as the legitimate government of Cambodia, claiming that it was a puppet state propped up by Vietnamese forces. China funneled military aid to the Khmer Rouge, which in the 1980s proved to be the most capable insurgent force, while the U.S. publicly supported a non-Communist alternative to the PRK; in 1985, the Reagan administration approved $5 million in aid to the republican KPNLF, led by former prime minister Son Sann, and the ANS, the armed wing of the pro-Sihanouk FUNCINPEC party.\n\nThe KPNLF, while lacking in military strength compared to the Khmer Rouge, commanded a sizable civilian following (up to 250,000) amongst refugees near the Thai-Cambodian border that had fled the KR regime. Funcinpec had the benefit of traditional peasant Khmer loyalty to the crown and Sihanouk's widespread popularity in the countryside.\n\nIn practice, the military strength of the non-KR groups within Cambodia was minimal, though their funding and civilian support was often greater than the KR. The Thatcher and Reagan administrations both supported the non-KR insurgents covertly, with weapons, and military advisors in the form of Green Berets and Special Air Service units, who taught sabotage techniques in camps just inside Thailand.\n\nA UN-led peacekeeping mission that took place from 1991–95 sought to end violence in the country and establish a democratic system of government through new elections. The 1990s saw a marked decline in insurgent activity, though the Khmer Rouge later renewed their attacks against the government. As Vietnam disengaged from direct involvement in Cambodia, the government was able to begin to split the KR movement by making peace offers to lower level officials. The Khmer Rouge was the only member of the CGDK to continue fighting following the reconciliation process. The other two political organizations that made up the CGDK alliance ended armed resistance and became a part of the political process that began with elections in 1993.\n\nIn 1997, Pol Pot ordered the execution of his right-hand man Son Sen for attempting peace negotiations with the Cambodian government. In 1998, Pol Pot himself died, and other key KR leaders Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary surrendered to the government of Hun Sen in exchange for immunity from prosecution, leaving Ta Mok as the sole commander of the Khmer Rouge forces; he was detained in 1999 for \"crimes against humanity.\" The organization essentially ceased to exist.\n\nSince 1990 Cambodia has gradually recovered, demographically and economically, from the Khmer Rouge regime, although the psychological scars affect many Cambodian families and émigré communities. The current government teaches little about Khmer Rouge atrocities in schools. Cambodia has a very young population and by 2005 three-quarters of Cambodians were too young to remember the Khmer Rouge years. The younger generations would only know the Khmer Rouge through word-of-mouth from parents and elders.\n\nIn 1997, Cambodia established a Khmer Rouge Trial Task Force to create a legal and judicial structure to try the remaining leaders for war crimes and other crimes against humanity, but progress was slow, mainly because the Cambodian government of ex-Khmer Rouge Cadre Hun Sen, despite its origins in the Vietnamese-backed regime of the 1980s, was reluctant to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial.\n\nFunding shortfalls plagued the operation, and the government said that due to the poor economy and other financial commitments, it could only afford limited funding for the tribunal. Several countries, including India and Japan, came forward with extra funds, but by January 2006, the full balance of funding was not yet in place.\n\nNonetheless, the task force began its work and took possession of two buildings on the grounds of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) High Command headquarters in Kandal province just on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The tribunal task force expects to spend the rest of 2006 training the judges and other tribunal members before the actual trial is to take place. In March 2006 the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, nominated seven judges for a trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders.\n\nIn May 2006, Justice Minister Ang Vong Vathana announced that Cambodia's highest judicial body approved 30 Cambodian and U.N. judges to preside over the genocide tribunal for some surviving Khmer Rouge leaders. The chief Khmer Rouge torturer Kang Kek Iew – known as Duch and ex-commandant of the notorious S-21 prison – went on trial for crimes against humanity on February 17, 2009. It is the first case involving a senior Pol Pot cadre three decades after the end of a regime blamed for 1.7 million deaths in Cambodia.\n\nWhile the events in Cambodia are widely considered to be a genocide or democide and referred to as such, Steven Rosefielde argues that the deaths in Cambodia fail to meet the definition of genocide in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Rosefielde states that there is \"no evidence Pol Pot sought to exterminate the Khmer people, or even the Cham and religious minorities.\" Instead, he defines Khmer Rouge killings as \"dystopicide\": \"The no-prisoners-taken pursuit of badly implemented, poorly conceived communist utopia-building.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "176796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176796", "title": "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi", "text": "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi (born Mahesh Prasad Varma, 12 January 1918 – 5 February 2008) was an Indian guru, known for developing the Transcendental Meditation technique and for being the leader and guru of a worldwide organization that has been characterized in multiple ways including as a new religious movement and as non-religious. He became known as \"Maharishi\" (meaning \"great seer\") and \"Yogi\" as an adult.\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi became a disciple and assistant of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of Jyotirmath in the Indian Himalayas. The Maharishi credits Brahmananda Saraswati with inspiring his teachings. In 1955, the Maharishi began to introduce his Transcendental Deep Meditation (later renamed Transcendental Meditation) to India and the world. His first global tour began in 1958. His devotees referred to him as \"His Holiness\", and because he often laughed in TV interviews he was sometimes referred to as the \"giggling guru\".\n\nThe Maharishi is reported to have trained more than 40,000 TM teachers, taught the Transcendental Meditation technique to \"more than five million people\" and founded thousands of teaching centres and hundreds of colleges, universities and schools, while TM websites report tens of thousands learned the TM-Sidhi programme. His initiatives include schools and universities with campuses in several countries including India, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The Maharishi, his family and close associates created charitable organisations and for-profit businesses including health clinics, mail-order health supplements and organic farms. The reported value of the Maharishi's organization has ranged from the millions to billions of U.S. dollars and in 2008, the organization placed the value of their United States assets at about $300 million.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Maharishi achieved fame as the guru to the Beatles, the Beach Boys and other celebrities. In the late 1970s, he started the TM-Sidhi programme that claimed to offer practitioners the ability to levitate and to create world peace. The Maharishi's Natural Law Party was founded in 1992, and ran campaigns in dozens of countries. He moved to near Vlodrop, the Netherlands, in the same year. In 2000, he created the Global Country of World Peace, a non-profit organization, and appointed its leaders. In 2008, the Maharishi announced his retirement from all administrative activities and went into silence until his death three weeks later.\n\nThe birth name, birth date, and caste of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi are not known with certainty, in part because of the tradition of ascetics and monks to relinquish family connections. Many accounts say he was born Mahesh Prasad Varma () into a Kayastha family living in the Central Provinces of British India. A different name appears in the Allahabad University list of distinguished alumni, where he is listed as M.C. Srivastava. and an obituary says his name was \"Mahesh Srivastava\".\n\nVarious accounts give the year of his birth as 1911, 1917 or 1918. Authors Paul Mason and William Jefferson say that he was born 12 January 1917 in Jabalpur, Central Provinces, British India (now Madhya Pradesh, India). The place of birth given in his passport is \"Pounalulla\", India, and his birth date 12 January 1918. Mahesh came from an upper-caste family, being a member of the Kayastha caste, a high-status caste whose traditional profession is writing.\n\nMahesh studied physics at Allahabad University and earned a degree in 1942. While a few sources say that he worked at Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur for some time, most report that in 1941, he became an administrative secretary to the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev) and took a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh. Coplin refers to \"bala brahmachari\" as both a title and a name, and considers that it \"identified him as a fully dedicated student of spiritual knowledge and life-long celibate ascetic.\" The Maharishi recalls how it took about two and a half years to attune himself to the thinking of Brahmananda Saraswati and to gain \"a very genuine feeling of complete oneness\". At first Brahmachari Mahesh performed common chores but gained trust and became Guru Dev's \"personal secretary\" and \"favored pupil\". He was trusted to take care of the bulk of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati's correspondence without direction, and was also sent out to give public speeches on Vedic (scriptural) themes.\n\nBrahmachari Mahesh remained with Swami Brahmananda Saraswati until the latter died in 1953, when he moved to Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas. Although Brahmachari Mahesh was a close disciple, he could not be the Shankaracharya's spiritual successor because he was not of the Brahmin caste. The Shankaracharya, at the end of his life, charged him with the responsibility of travelling and teaching meditation to the masses, while he named Swami Shantananda Saraswati as his successor.\n\nIn 1955, Brahmachari Mahesh left Uttarkashi and began publicly teaching what he stated was a traditional meditation technique learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati, and that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation. Later the technique was renamed Transcendental Meditation. It was also then that he was first publicly known with the name \"Maharishi\" an honorific title meaning \"great sage\" after the title was given to him according to some sources from \"Indian Pundits\" and according to another source the honorific was given along with Yogi by followers in India. Later in the west the title was retained as a name.\n\nHe traveled around India for two years interacting with his \"Hindu audiences\" in an \"Indian context\". At that time, he called his movement the Spiritual Development Movement, but renamed it the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in 1957, in Madras, India, on the concluding day of the Seminar of Spiritual Luminaries. According to Coplin, in his visits to southern India, the Maharishi spoke English rather than the Hindi spoken in his home area to avoid provoking resistance among those seeking linguistic self-determination, and to appeal to the \"learned classes\".\n\nAccording to author William Jefferson, in 1958, the Maharishi went to Madras to address a large crowd of people who had gathered to celebrate the memory of Guru Dev. It was there that he spontaneously announced that he planned to spread the teaching of TM throughout the world. Hundreds of people immediately asked to learn TM. In 1959, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began his first world tour, writing: \"I had one thing in mind, that I know something which is useful to every man\".\n\nThe Maharishi's 1986 book, \"Thirty Years Around the World\", gives a detailed account of his world tours, as do two biographies, \"The Story of the Maharishi\", by William Jefferson, and \"The Maharishi\" by Paul Mason. The first world tour began in Rangoon, Burma (now Myanmar) and included the countries of Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii. He arrived in Hawaii in the spring of 1959 and the \"Honolulu Star Bulletin\" reported: \"He has no money, he asks for nothing. His worldly possessions can be carried in one hand. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is on a world odyssey. He carries a message that he says will rid the world of all unhappiness and discontent.\" In 1959, the Maharishi lectured and taught the Transcendental Meditation technique in Honolulu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York and London. While in Los Angeles the Maharishi stayed at the home of author Helena Olson, and during this period he developed a three-year plan to propagate Transcendental Meditation to the whole world. Though most of his audience consisted of average middle class individuals, he also attracted a few celebrities, such as Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Nancy Cooke de Herrera and Doris Duke.\nWhen the Maharishi came to the U.S. in 1959, his Spiritual Regeneration Movement was called Transcendental Meditation. That same year he began the International Meditation Society and other organizations to propagate his teachings, establishing centres in San Francisco and London. For years, the sole teacher of Transcendental Meditation in America was a San Diego woman named Beulah Smith.\n\nIn 1960, the Maharishi travelled to many cities in India, France, Switzerland, England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.\n\nWhile in Manchester, England, the Maharishi gave a television interview and was featured in many English newspapers such as the \"Birmingham Post\", the \"Oxford Mail\" and the \"Cambridge Daily News\". This was also the year in which the Maharishi trained Henry Nyburg to be the first Transcendental Meditation teacher in Europe.\n\nIn 1961, the Maharishi visited the United States, Austria, Sweden, France, Italy, Greece, India, Kenya, England, and Canada. While in England, he appeared on BBC television and gave a lecture to 5,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In April 1961, the Maharishi conducted his first Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training Course in Rishikesh, India, with sixty participants from various countries. Teachers continued to be trained as time progressed. During the course, the Maharishi began to introduce additional knowledge regarding the development of human potential, and began writing his translation and commentary on the first six chapters of the ancient Vedic text, the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nHis 1962 world tour included visits to Europe, India, Australia and New Zealand. In Britain, he founded a branch of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement. The year concluded in California where the Maharishi began dictating his book \"The Science of Being and Art of Living\". In Rishikesh, India, beginning on 20 April 1962, a forty-day course was held for \"sadhus, sanyasis, and brahmacharis\" to introduce TM to \"religious preachers and spiritual masters in India\".\n\nThe Maharishi toured cities in Europe, Asia, North America and India in 1963, and also addressed ministers of the Indian Parliament. According to his memoirs, twenty-one members of parliament then issued a public statement endorsing the Maharishi's goals and meditation technique. His Canadian tour was also well covered by the press.\n\nThe Maharishi's fifth world tour, in 1964, consisted of visits to many cities in North America, Europe and India. During his visit to England, he appeared with the Abbot of Downside, Abbot Butler, on a BBC television show called \"The Viewpoint\". In October of that year, in California, the Maharishi began teaching the first Advanced Technique of Transcendental Meditation to some experienced meditators. While travelling in America, the Maharishi met with Robert Maynard Hutchins, the head of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations. During this same year, the Maharishi finished his book \"The Science of Being and Art of Living\", which sold more than a million copies and was published in fifteen languages.\n\nIn 1966, the Maharishi founded the Students' International Meditation Society (\"SIMS\"), which \"The Los Angeles Times\" later characterised as a \"phenomenal success\". In the 1970s, SIMS centres were established at \"over one thousand campuses\", including Harvard University, Yale University, and UCLA.\n\nIn 1967, the Maharishi gave a lecture at Caxton Hall in London which was attended by Pattie Boyd, George Harrison's wife, as well as Leon MacLaren, the founder and leader of the School of Economic Science (SES). He also lectured at UCLA, Harvard, Yale and Berkeley. That year, an article in \"Time\" magazine reported that the Maharishi \"has been sharply criticised by other Indian sages, who complain that his programme for spiritual peace without either penance or asceticism contravenes every traditional Hindu belief\". Religion and culture scholar Sean McCloud also reported that traditional Indian sages and gurus were critical of the Maharishi, for teaching a simple technique and making it available to everyone, and for abandoning traditional concepts of suffering and concentration as paths to enlightenment. At the end of 1968, the Maharishi said that after ten years of teaching and world tours, he would return to India.\n\nIn 1967, the Maharishi's fame increased and his movement gained greater prominence when he became the \"spiritual advisor to the Beatles\", though he was already well known among young people in the UK and had already had numerous public appearances that brought him to the band's attention. Following the Beatles' endorsement of TM, during 1967 and 1968 the Maharishi appeared on American magazine covers such as \"Life\", \"Newsweek\", \"Time\" and many others. He gave lectures to capacity crowds at the Felt Forum in New York City and Harvard's Sanders Hall. He also appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" and the \"Today\" TV shows.\n\nHe and the Beatles met in London in August 1967 and the band members went to study with the Maharishi in Bangor, Wales, before travelling to Rishikesh, India, in February 1968 to \"devote themselves fully to his instruction\". Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen left after ten days, Paul McCartney and Jane Asher left after five weeks; the group's most dedicated students, George Harrison and John Lennon, departed with their wives sixteen days later. During their stay, the Beatles heard that the Maharishi had allegedly made sexual advances towards Mia Farrow. On June 15, 1968, in London, the Beatles formally renounced their association with the Maharishi as a \"public mistake\". \"Sexy Sadie\" is the name of a song by the Beatles, written by Lennon in India and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Lennon originally wanted to title the song \"Maharishi\", but changed the title at Harrison's request. Harrison commented years later, \"Now, historically, there's the story that something went on that shouldn't have done – but nothing did.\" In 1992, Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, \"We were very young\" and \"It's probably in the history books that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' – but it's bullshit, total bullshit.\" Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she \"hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi\". Asked if he forgave the Beatles, the Maharishi replied, \"I could never be upset with angels.\" McCartney took his daughter, Stella, to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship.[46][188] The \"New York Times\" and \"The Independent\" reported that the influence of the Maharishi, and the journey to Rishikesh to meditate, weaned the Beatles from LSD and inspired them to write many new songs. In 2009, McCartney commented that Transcendental Meditation was a gift the Beatles had received from the Maharishi at a time when they were looking for something to stabilise them. The Beatles' visit to the Maharishi's ashram coincided with a thirty-participant Transcendental Meditation teacher training course that was ongoing when they arrived. Graduates of the course included Prudence Farrow and Mike Love.\n\nAlthough the Rishakesh ashram had thrived in its early days it was eventually abandoned in 2001. By 2016, some of it had been reclaimed with building repairs, cleared paths, a small photo museum, murals, a cafe and charges for visitors although the site remains essentially a ruin.\n\nIn 1968, the Maharishi announced that he would stop his public activities and instead begin the training of TM teachers at his new global headquarters in Seelisberg, Switzerland. In 1969, he inaugurated a course in his Science of Creative Intelligence at Stanford University, which was then offered at 25 other American universities.\n\nIn 1970, the Maharishi held a TM teacher training course at a Victorian hotel in Poland Springs, Maine, with 1,200 participants. Later that year, he held a similar four-week course with 1500 participants at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California. In 1970, after having trouble with Indian tax authorities, he moved his headquarters to Italy, returning to India in the late 1970s. That same year, the City of Hope Foundation in Los Angeles gave the Maharishi their \"Man of Hope\" award.\n\nBy 1971, the Maharishi had completed 13 world tours, visited 50 countries, and held a press conference with American inventor Buckminster Fuller at his first International Symposium on SCI at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts. From 1970 to 1973, about 10,000 people attended the Maharishi sponsored symposia on his modern interpretation of Vedanta philosophy called Science of Creative Intelligence. During these conferences, held at universities, the Maharishi spoke with \"leading thinkers\" of the day such as Hans Selye, Marshall McLuhan, and Jonas Salk.\n\nThe Maharishi announced his World Plan in 1972, the goal of which was to establish 3,600 TM centres around the world. That year, a TM training course was given by the Maharishi at Queen's University and was attended by 1,000 young people from the USA and Canada. At the start of the course, the Maharishi encouraged the attendees to improve their appearance by getting haircuts and wearing ties. He also persuaded the U.S. Army to offer courses in TM to its soldiers and made videotaped recordings of what was thought to be the West's first comprehensive recitation of the Rig Veda.\n\nIn March 1973, the Maharishi addressed the legislature of the state of Illinois. That same year, the legislature passed a resolution in support of the use of Maharishi's Science of Creative Intelligence in Illinois public schools. Later that year he organized a world conference of mayors in Switzerland. In that same year, he also addressed 3000 educators at an American Association of Higher Education (AAHE) conference on quality of life and higher education.\n\nIn 1974, the Maharishi International University was founded. In October 1975, the Maharishi was pictured on the front cover of \"Time\" magazine. He made his last visit to the Spiritual Regeneration Movement centre in Los Angeles in 1975, according to film director David Lynch, who met him for the first time there.\n\nIn 1975, the Maharishi embarked on a five-continent trip to inaugurate what he called \"the Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment\". The Maharishi said the purpose of the inaugural tour was to \"go around the country and give a gentle whisper to the population\". He visited Ottawa during this tour and had a private meeting with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, during which he spoke about the principles of TM and \"the possibility of structuring an ideal society\". That same year, the Pittsburgh Press reported that \"The Maharishi has been criticised by other Eastern yogis for simplifying their ancient art.\" The Maharishi appeared as a guest on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" in 1975 and again in 1977, and this resulted in \"tens of thousands of new practitioners\" around the USA.\nIn the mid 1970s, the Maharishi's U.S. movement was operating 370 TM centres manned by 6,000 TM teachers. At that time, the Maharishi also began approaching the business community via an organisation called the American Foundation for SCI (AFSCI), whose objective was to eliminate stress for business professionals. His TM movement came to be increasingly structured along the lines of a multinational corporation.\n\nThe teaching of TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence in a New Jersey public school was stopped when a US court, in 1977, declared the movement to be religious, and ruled adoption of TM by public organisations in breach of the separation of church and state (First Amendment).\n\nDuring the 1980s, the organisation continued to expand and his meditation technique continued to attract celebrities despite its \"outlandish claims\" and accusations of fraud from disaffected former disciples. The TM organization made a number of property investments, buying a former Rothschild mansion in England, Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, Roydon Hall in Maidstone, Swythamley Park in the Peak District, and a Georgian rectory in Suffolk. In the United States, resorts and hotels, many in city centres, were purchased to be used as TM training centres. Doug Henning and the Maharishi planned a magical Vedic amusement park, Vedaland, and bought large tracts of land near Orlando, Florida, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, to host the park. The theme park was supposed to be a gateway into understanding the mysteries of the universe. According to the Maharishi's official Vedic city website, \"Entering Veda Land through a secret cave on a windswept plateau high in the Himalayas the adventure starts as one travels through a waterfall that leads to a forest where an ancient Vedic civilization awaits to reveal the deepest secrets of the universe (sic)\". These plans were never executed and, for Niagara Falls, Veda Land turned out to be just another theme park proposal that never materialized, joining an eclectic list that includes the Worlds of Jules Verne, the Ancient Chinese City and even Canada's Wonderland when it was first being planned. The Maharishi commissioned plans from a prominent architect for the world's tallest building, a Vedic-style pyramid to be built in São Paulo, Brazil, and to be filled with Yogic Flyers and other TM endeavours. The Maharishi founded Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a self-described educational institution located in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1982. The institution reports that it has trained 50,000 pundits in traditional Vedic recitation. In 1983, the Maharishi invited government leaders to interact with his organization called \"World Government\".\n\nIn January 1988, offices at the Maharishinagar complex in New Delhi were raided by Indian tax authorities and the Maharishi and his organisation were accused of falsifying expenses. Reports on the value of stocks, fixed-deposit notes, cash and jewels confiscated, vary from source to source. The Maharishi, who was \"headquartered in Switzerland\" at the time, reportedly moved to the Netherlands \"after the Indian government accused him of tax fraud\".) Following an earthquake in Armenia, the Maharishi trained Russian TM teachers and set up a Maharishi Ayurveda training centre in the Urals region. Beginning in 1989, the Maharishi's movement began incorporating the term \"Maharishi\" into the names of their new and existing entities, concepts and programmes.\n\nIn 1990, the Maharishi relocated his headquarters from Seelisberg, Switzerland, to a former Franciscan monastery in Vlodrop, the Netherlands, which became known as MERU, Holland, on account of the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) campus there. During his time in Vlodrop, he communicated to the public mainly via video and the internet. He also created a subscription-based, satellite TV channel, called Veda Vision, which broadcast content in 22 languages and 144 countries.\n\nIn 1991, the Maharishi called Washington D.C. a \"pool of mud\" after a decade of attempts to lower the rate of crime in the city, which had the second-largest TM community in the US. He told his followers to leave and save themselves from its \"criminal atmosphere\". The Maharishi is believed to have made his final public appearance in 1991, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Deepak Chopra, described as \"one of the Maharishi's top assistants before he launched his own career\", wrote that the Maharishi collapsed in 1991 with kidney and pancreas failure, that the illness was kept secret by the Maharishi's family and that he tended to Maharishi during a year-long recovery. According to Chopra, the Maharishi accused him, in July 1993, of trying to compete for the position of guru and asked him to stop travelling and writing books, which led to Chopra's decision to leave the movement in January 1994.\n\nAs part of a world plan for peace, the Maharishi inaugurated the Natural Law Party (NLP) and calling it a \"natural government\". His adherents founded the NLP in 1992. It was active in forty-two countries. John Hagelin, the NLP's three-time candidate for U.S. president, denied any formal connection between the Maharishi and the party. According to spokesman Bob Roth, \"The Maharishi has said the party has to grow to encompass everyone\". Critics charged that the party was an effort to recruit people for Transcendental Meditation, and that it resembled \"the political arm of an international corporation\" more than a \"home-grown political creation\". The Indian arm of the NLP, the Ajeya Bharat Party, achieved electoral success, winning one seat in a state assembly in 1998. The Maharishi shut down the political effort in 2004, saying, \"I had to get into politics to know what is wrong there.\"\n\nIn 1992, the Maharishi began to send groups of Yogic Flyers to countries like India, Brazil, China and America in an effort to promote world peace through \"coherent world consciousness\". In 1993 and 2003, he decided to raise the fees for learning the TM technique.\n\nIn 1997 the Maharishi's organization built the largest wooden structure in the Netherlands without using any nails. The building was the Maharishi's residence for the last two decades of his life. In later years, the Maharishi rarely left his two-room quarters in order to preserve his health and energy. He used videoconferencing to communicate with the world and with his advisors. Built to Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architectural standards, the structure, according to the Maharishi, is said to have helped him infuse \"the light of Total Knowledge\" into \"the destiny of the human race\".\n\nIn 2000, the Maharishi founded the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) \"to create global world peace by unifying all nations in happiness, prosperity, invincibility and perfect health, while supporting the rich diversity of our world family\". The Maharishi crowned Tony Nader, a physician and MIT-trained neuroscientist, as the king or Maharaja of the GCWP in 2000. The GCWP unsuccessfully attempted to establish a sovereign micronation when it offered US$1.3 billion to the President of Suriname for a 200-year lease of of land and in 2002, attempted to choose a king for the Talamanca, a \"remote Indian reservation\" in Costa Rica.\n\nIn 2001, followers of the Maharishi founded Maharishi Vedic City a few miles north of Fairfield, Iowa, in the United States. This new city requires that the construction of its homes and buildings be done according to the Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles of \"harmony with nature\".\n\nIn a 2002 appearance on the CNN show, \"Larry King Live\", the first time in twenty-five years that the Maharishi had appeared in the mainstream media, he said \"Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results\". It was occasioned by the reissue of the Maharishi's book \"The Science of Being and Art of Living\". That same year, the Maharishi Global Financing Research Foundation issued the \"Raam\" as a currency \"dedicated to financing peace promoting projects\".\n\nIn 2003, David Lynch began a fundraising project to raise US$1 billion \"on behalf of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\" to build a meditation centre large enough to hold 8,000 skilled practitioners.\n\nThe Maharishi ordered a suspension of TM training in Britain in 2005 due to his opposition to prime minister Tony Blair's decision to support the Iraq War. The Maharishi said that he did not want to waste the \"beautiful nectar\" of TM on a \"scorpion nation\". He lifted the ban after Blair's resignation in 2007. During this period, skeptics were critical of some of the Maharishi's programmes, such as a $10 trillion plan to end poverty through organic farming in poor countries and a $1 billion plan to use meditation groups to end conflict.\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, concerned about his health, became increasingly secluded in two rooms of his residence. During this period he rarely had in-person meetings and instead communicated with his followers almost exclusively by closed-circuit television.\n\nOn 12 January 2008, his ninetieth birthday, the Maharishi declared: \"It has been my pleasure at the feet of Guru Dev (Brahmananda Saraswati), to take the light of Guru Dev and pass it on in my environment. Now today, I am closing my designed duty to Guru Dev. And I can only say, 'Live long the world in peace, happiness, prosperity, and freedom from suffering.'\"\n\nA week before his death, the Maharishi said that he was \"stepping down as leader of the TM movement\" and \"retreating into silence\" and that he planned to spend his remaining time studying \"the ancient Indian texts\". The Maharishi died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes on 5 February 2008 at his residence in Vlodrop, Netherlands. The cremation and funeral rites were conducted at the Maharishi's Allahabad ashram in India, overlooking the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.\n\nThe funeral, with state honours, was carried by Sadhana TV station and was presided over by one of the claimants to the seat of Shankaracharya of the North, Swami Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj. Indian officials who attended the funeral included central minister Subodh Kant Sahay; Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Ashok Singhal; and former Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker and state BJP leader Keshri Nath Tripathi, as well as top local officials. Also in attendance were thirty-five rajas of the Global Country of World Peace, one-time disciple Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and David Lynch. A troop of uniformed policemen lowered their arms in salute. The funeral received its status as a state funeral because the Maharishi was a recognised master in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta founded by Shankara.\n\nThe Maharishi is survived by a brother and \"a number of nephews\". One nephew, Girish Chandra Varma, is chairman of the Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools Group and a \"senior functionary of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in India.\" Other nephews include Prakash Shrivastav, president of Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools and Anand Shrivastava, chairman of the Maharishi Group.\n\nIn its obituary, BBC News reported that the Maharishi's master had bequeathed him \"the task of keeping the tradition of Transcendental Meditation alive\" and that \"the Maharishi's commercial mantras drew criticism from stricter Hindus, but his promises of better health, stress relief and spiritual enlightenment drew devotees from all over the world\". Paul McCartney commented saying that \"Whilst I am deeply saddened by his passing, my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity.\"\n\nThe Maharishi left a legacy that includes the revival of India's ancient spiritual tradition of meditation, which he made available to everyone. He is considered responsible for the popularisation of meditation in the west, something he accomplished by teaching Transcendental Meditation worldwide through a highly effective organization of his own development. The Maharishi is also credited with \"the proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology\" and the application of scientific studies to research on the physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation and the development of higher states of consciousness, areas previously relegated to mysticism. Partly because of this, \"Newsweek\" credited him with helping to launch \"a legitimate new field of neuroscience\". According to the \"Times of India\" his \"unique and enduring contribution to humankind was his deep understanding of – and mechanics of experiencing – pure consciousness\". A memorial building, the Maharishi Smarak, was inaugurated at Allahabad in February 2013.\n\nThe Maharishi had come out to teach with the \"avowed intention\" to change \"the course of human history\". When he first began teaching he had three main aims: to revive the spiritual tradition in India, to show that meditation was for everyone and not just for recluses, and to show that Vedanta is compatible with science. The Maharishi had a message of happiness, writing in 1967 that \"being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness. Under all circumstances be happy. Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss\". His philosophy featured the concept that \"within everyone is an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness\". He emphasised the naturalness of his meditation technique as a simple way of developing this potential.\n\nBeginning in 1962, the Maharishi began to recommend the daily practice of yoga exercises or asanas to further accelerate growth.\n\nHe also taught that practising Transcendental Meditation twice a day would create inner peace and that \"mass meditation sessions\" could create outer peace by reducing violence and war. According to a TM website, the performance of yagyas by 7,000 pandits in India, plus hundreds of Yogic Flyers in Germany, brought \"coherence and unity in the collective consciousness of Germany\" and caused the fall of the Berlin Wall. One religion scholar, Michael York, considers the Maharishi to have been the most articulate spokesman for the spiritual argument that a critical mass of people becoming enlightened through the practice of \"meditation and yogic discipline\" will trigger the New Age movement's hoped-for period of postmillennial \"peace, harmony, and collective consciousness\". Religious studies scholar Carl Olson writes that the TM technique was based on \"a neo-Vedanta metaphysical philosophy in which an unchanging reality is opposed to an ever-changing phenomenal world\" and that the Maharishi says it is not necessary to renounce worldly activities to gain enlightenment, unlike other ascetic traditions.\n\nAccording to author Jack Forem, the Maharishi stated that the experience of transcendence, which resulted in a naturally increasing refinement of mind and body, enabled people to naturally behave in more correct ways. Thus, behavioral guidelines did not need to be issued, and were best left to the teachings of various religions: \"It is much easier to raise a man's consciousness than to get him to act righteously\" the Maharishi said.\n\nSome religious studies scholars have further said that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is one of a number of Indian gurus who brought neo-Hindu adaptations of Vedantic Hinduism to the west. Author Meera Nanda calls neo-Hinduism \"the brand of Hinduism that is taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Deepak Chopra, and their clones\". J. R. Coplin, a sociologist and MIU graduate, says that the Maharishi saw his own purpose as \"the 'revival' of the knowledge of an integrated life based upon Vedic principles and Vedantist reality\".\n\nAuthor Barry Miles writes that, in spite of the media's scepticism for the Maharishi's spiritual message, they seized upon him because young people seemed to listen to his pro-establishment, anti-drug message with one TM participant saying the Maharishi \"signaled the beginning of the post-acid generation\".\n\nDuring a CNN interview in 2002, the Maharishi said \"Transcendental meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results\". His movement offered in-residence style TM advanced courses. By the time of his death, there were nearly 1,000 TM training centres around the world.\n\nThe Maharishi is credited as having contributed to the western world a meditation technique that is both simple and systematic as well as introducing the scientific study of meditation.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the Maharishi began the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying, as an additional option for those who had been practising the Transcendental Meditation technique for some time. According to Coplin, this new aspect of knowledge emphasised not only the individual, but also the collective benefits created by group practice of this advanced programme. This new programme gave rise to a new principle called the \"Maharishi Effect\", which is said to \"create coherence in the collective consciousness\" and to suppress crime, violence, and accidents.\n\n Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the ancient Vedic texts based on his master, Brahmananda Saraswati's teachings. MVS aims to put forward traditional Vedic literature in the light of Western traditions of knowledge and understanding. According to Roy Ascott, MVS also explains the potential for every human being to experience the infinite nature of transcendental consciousness, also defined as Being or Self, while engaged in normal activities of daily life. Once this state is fully established an individual is no longer influenced by outer aspects of existence and perceives pure consciousness in everything. MVS includes two aspects, the practical aspect of the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi programme, as well as the theoretical aspect of how MVS is applied to day to day living. These applications include programmes in: Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH); Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, a mathematical system for the design and construction of buildings; Maharishi Gandharva Veda, a form of classical Indian music; Maharishi Jyotish (also known as Maharishi Vedic Astrology), a system claiming the evaluation of life tendencies of an individual; Maharishi Vedic Agriculture, a trademarked process for producing fresh, organic food; and Consciousness-Based Education. According to educator James Grant, a former Maharishi University of Management Associate Professor of Education and the former Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Maharishi brought out a \"full revival of the Vedic tradition of knowledge from India\" and demonstrated its relevance in many areas including education, business, medicine and government.\n\nThe Maharishi wrote more than twenty books on the Transcendental Meditation technique and Maharishi Vedic Science.\n\nIn 1955, the organisers of the Great Spiritual Development Conference of Kerala published \"The Beacon Light of the Himalayas\", a transcribed 170-page \"souvenir\" of the conference. Authors Chryssides, Humes and Forsthoefel, Miller, and Russel cite this as the Maharishi's first published book on Transcendental Meditation, although Transcendental Meditation is not mentioned in the text of the book. The book is dedicated to Maharshi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh Yogi Rajaram by his devotees of Kerala and contains photographs, letters and lectures by numerous authors which appear in various languages such as English, Hindi and Sanskrit.\n\nIn 1963, the Maharishi audiotaped the text of the book \"Science of Being and Art of Living\", which was later transcribed and published in fifteen languages. \nK.T. Weidmann describes the book as the Maharishi's fundamental philosophical treatise, one in which its author provides an illustration of the ancient Vedic traditions of India in terms that can be easily interpreted and understood by the scientific thinking of the western world. In the \"Science of Being\", the Maharishi illustrates the concepts of relative existence as the experience of everyday reality through one's senses, and absolute reality as the origin of being, and the source of all creative intelligence. The Maharishi describes this absolute reality, or Being, as unchanging, omnipresent, and eternal. He also identifies it with bliss consciousness. The two aspects of reality, the relative and the absolute, are like an ocean with many waves. The waves represent the relative, and the ocean beneath is the foundation of everything, or Being. Establishing oneself in the field of Being, or unchanging reality, ensures stability.\n\nIn his \"Science of Being\" the Maharishi introduced an additional concept: that of fulfillment viewed as something to be obtained not through exertion or self effort, but through the progressive settling of the mind during the practice of TM. This was the first full systematic description of the principles underlying the Maharishi's teachings.\n\nIn his 1967 publication, \"Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary\", the Maharishi describes the Bhagavad Gita as \"the Scripture of Yoga\". He says that \"its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level.\" According to Peter Russell, the Bhagavad-Gita deals with the concept of loss of knowledge and subsequent revival, and this is brought out by the Maharishi himself in the introduction. In the Preface, the Maharishi writes: \"The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also.\"\n\nA second concept, that of freedom, presented as the antithesis of fear, is also prevalent in the book, according to Jack Forem. Forem states that in his interpretation of the Gita, the Maharishi expressed several times that as man gains greater awareness through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, he gradually establishes a level of contentment which remain increasingly grounded within him and in which the mind does not waver and is not affected by either attachment or fear.\n\nThe Maharishi was reported to be a vegetarian, an entrepreneur, a monk and \"a spiritual man who sought a world stage from which to espouse the joys of inner happiness\". He was described as an abstemious man with tremendous energy who took a weekly day of silence while sleeping only two hours per night. He did not present himself as a guru or claim his teachings as his own. Instead he taught \"in the name of his guru Brahmananda Saraswati\" and paid tribute to him by placing a picture of Saraswati behind him when he spoke. He was on a mission to bring the ancient techniques of TM to the world. Scientist and futurist Buckminster Fuller spent two days with the Maharishi at a symposium at the University of Massachusetts in 1971 and said, \"You could not meet with Maharishi without recognizing instantly his integrity.\" Authors Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley write that the Maharishi did not claim any \"special divine revelation nor supernatural personal qualities\". Still others said he helped to \"inspire the anti-materialism of the late 60s\" and received good publicity because he \"opposed drugs\". According to author Chryssides, \"The Maharishi tended to emphasize the positive aspects of humanity, focusing on the good that exists in everyone.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Times\" the Maharishi attracted scepticism because of his involvement with wealthy celebrities, his business acumen, and his love of luxury, including touring in a Rolls-Royce. A reporter for \"The Economist\" calls this a \"misconception\" saying: \"He did not use his money for sinister ends. He neither drank, nor smoked, nor took drugs. ... He did not accumulate scores of Rolls-Royces, like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh; his biggest self-indulgence was a helicopter. \" When some observers questioned how his organisation's money was being used, the Maharishi said, \"It goes to support the centres, it does not go on me. I have nothing.\"\n\nHe was often referred to as the \"Giggling Guru\" because of his habit of laughing during television interviews. Diminutive at a little over five feet tall, the Maharishi often wore a traditional cotton or silk, white dhoti while carrying or wearing flowers. He often sat cross-legged on a deerskin and had a \"grayish-white beard, mustache and long, dark, stringy hair\". Barry Miles described the Maharishi as having \"liquid eyes, twinkling but inscrutable with the wisdom from the East\". Miles said the Maharishi in his seventies looked much younger than his age. He had a high pitched voice and in the words of Merv Griffin, \"a long flowing beard and a distinctive, high pitched laugh that I loved to provoke\".\n\nBiographer Paul Mason's web site says that Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, is \"an outspoken critic\" of the Maharishi. According to Swaroopananda, the Maharishi \"was responsible for the controversy over Shankaracharyas\" because he gave Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand encouragement and assistance in fighting the court case which challenged Shantanand's inheritance of the title. In a review of the documentary film \"David Wants to Fly\", \"Variety\" magazine reported Swaroopananda's assertion that \"as a member of the trader class\" the Maharishi \"has no right to give mantras or teach meditation\". According to religious scholar Cynthia Humes, enlightened individuals of any caste may \"teach brahmavidya\" and author Patricia Drake writes that \"when Guru Dev was about to die he charged Maharishi with teaching laymen ... to meditate\". Mason says Shantanand \"publicly commended the practice of the Maharishi's meditation\" and sociologist J.R. Coplin says that Shantanand's successor, Swami Vishnudevanand, also \"speaks highly of the Maharishi\".\n\nThe British satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" ridiculed him as \"Veririchi Lotsamoney Yogi Bear\". The Maharishi was also parodied by comedians Bill Dana and Joey Forman in the 1968 comedy album \"The Mashuganishi Yogi\", by comedian Mike Myers in the film The Love Guru, and in the BBC sketch show \"Goodness Gracious Me\". He was portrayed by actor Gerry Bednob in the 2007 film \"\".\nHe was also the subject of The Beatles' song Sexy Sadie. In an episode of the popular BBC Radio 4 fictional comedy show Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge a comment is made about Yogi when Partridge is interviewing a spiritual man comparing him to Buddha, Dalai Lama, Uri Geller and \"that man The Beatles went to see...\"\n\nMaharishi International University (renamed Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in 1995), the first university the Maharishi founded, began classes in Santa Barbara, California, in 1973. In 1974 the university moved to Fairfield, Iowa, where it remains today. The university houses a library of the Maharishi's taped lectures and writings, including the thirty-three-lesson Science of Creative Intelligence course, originally a series of lectures given by the Maharishi in Fiuggi, Italy, in 1972. Described in the MUM university catalogue as combining modern science and Vedic science, the course also defines certain higher states of consciousness, and gives guidance on how to attain these states. Though the university claims to grant PhDs, including in neuroscience and psychology, the university is not accredited by either the America Psychological Association (APA) or the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\nThe Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools (MVMS), an educational system established in sixteen Indian states and affiliated with the New Delhi Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), was founded in 1995 by the Maharishi. It has 148 branches in 118 cities with 90,000 to 100,000 students and 5,500 teaching and support staff.\n\nIn 1998, Maharishi Open University was founded by the Maharishi. It was accessible via a network of eight satellites broadcasting to every country in the world, and via the Internet.\n\nThe Maharishi also introduced theories of management, defence, and government programmes designed to alleviate poverty, and introduced a new economic development currency called the Raam. In 2000, the Maharishi began building administrative and teaching centres called \"Peace Palaces\" around the world, and by 2008 at least eight had been constructed in the US alone. The Maharishi Institute, an African university that is part of a group of schools around the world that are named after him, was founded in 2007 and uses his Transcendental Meditation technique in their teaching.\n\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, in his farewell message on 11 January 2008, announced the establishment of the Brahmananda Saraswati Trust (BST), named in honour of his teacher, to support large groups totalling more than 30,000 peace-creating Vedic Pandits in perpetuity across India. The Patron of the Brahmanand Saraswati Trust is the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math.\n\nThe Maharishi is credited with heading charitable organisations, for-profit businesses, and real estate investments whose total value has been estimated at various times, to range from 2 to 5 billion. The real estate alone was valued in 2003 at between $3.6 and $5 billion. Holdings in the United States, estimated at $250 million in 2008, include dozens of hotels, commercial buildings and undeveloped land. The Maharishi \"amassed a personal fortune that his spokesman told one reporter may exceed $1 billion\". According to a 2008 article in \"The Times\", the Maharishi \"was reported to have an income of six million pounds\". The Maharishi's movement is said to be funded through donations, course fees for Transcendental Meditation and various real estate transactions.\n\nIn his biography of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, The Story of the Maharishi (published 1976), William Jefferson suggests that the financial aspect of the TM organisation was one of the greatest controversies it faced. Questions were raised about the Maharishi's mission, comments from leaders of the movement at that time, and fees and charges the TM organisation levied on followers. Jefferson says that the concerns with money came from journalists more than those who have learned to meditate.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

One of the most influential voices in the interwar period of the Galician women's movement leadership, she published articles in various periodicals. As a member of the Polish Sejm between 1928 and 1935, she brought issues of suppression by government authorities to the world stage, including the Polish regime's efforts to repress the culture of minority Ukrainians and the Soviet regime's denial of starvation in Ukraine during the famine of 1932-1933. With the Soviet and Nazi occupations of Ukraine, Rudnytska fled the country and remained an exile for the remainder of her days, publishing books and articles as she moved throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nMilena Rudnytska was born on 15 July 1892 in Zboriv, Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to Olga (née Ida Spiegel) and Ivan Rudnytsky. The third child and only daughter in the family of intellectuals. Rudnytska's father descended from the Ukrainian gentry and after finishing a law degree at Lviv University, worked as a notary in western Ukraine. Her mother, was from a Galician Jewish family of merchants. Their union had been opposed by both of their families and the couple delayed marrying for almost a decade, because one could not marry before age twenty-four without parental consent. When Ida left home, converted to Christianity and changed her name to Olga, the two finally married and subsequently had five children: (1889–1975), a philologist; Volodymyr (1891–1975), a lawyer; Milena; (1896–1995) a publicist and essayist; and Antin (1902–1975) composer and conductor of the Kiev opera.\n\nRudnytska's family spoke Polish at home and her mother never gained a proficiency with Ukrainian, though she raised her children as Ukraininan nationals. Close to her father, Rudnytska was profoundly affected by his death in 1906, which precipitated the family move to Lviv. She undertook her primary lessons at home, but then attended the Classical Gymnasium of Lviv and then in 1910 entered Lviv University to study philosophy, later graduating with a teaching degree in philosophy and mathematics. During World War I the family lived in Vienna, where Rudnytska studied at the University of Vienna until 1917 receiving a degree in pedagogy and though she began work on a doctoral program, she did not complete it.\n\nRudnytska began working as a journalist on the biweekly editorial \"Наша Мета\" (Our goal) in 1918. The following year, she married a lawyer politician who had also studied at Lviv and was living in Austria. By the end of the year, the couple had their only child, and their home quickly became a gathering place for leaders of the Ukrainian intellectual community living in Vienna. Back home in Galicia the Polish–Ukrainian War had resulted in a territorial transfer to the Polish state and adoption of policies to suppress minority populations. Though Rudnytska supported the Ukrainian national movement, she felt that women had been assigned inferior roles. She began to focus her attention on organizing women and involving them in raising the civic consciousness of a Ukrainian Nation. Returning to Lviv in 1920, Rudnytska and her husband soon separated. Her son, raised among her family, subsequently adopted her surname as his own.\n\nRudnytska became one of the leading activists of the Ukrainian Women's Union (), which she helped found in 1920 and along with other members of the leadership, including , Iryna Sichynska, and others, organized women's journals, conferences, and cooperatives. Around the same time, in 1921 she began working in the Teacher's Seminary and later worked at the Higher Pedagogical Institute, both in Lviv, but in 1928, she stopped teaching and turned her focus entirely to social and political issues. Having joined the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance, Rudnytska was elected to serve in the Polish Sejm in 1928 as a party representative, serving through 1935. That same year, she was elected as president of the Woman's Union and served in that capacity until 1939. Until 1939, she continued her journalistic endeavors as well publishing with several feminist journals like, \"Woman\" (), \"Woman-citizen\" (), \"Ukrainian Woman\" () and edited the woman's page of the Ukrainian daily newspaper \"Action\" ().\n\nIn Parliament, Rudnytska was a staunch advocate for Ukraine and criticized the Polish authorities for suppressing Ukrainian culture including their schools and religious institutions. Serving on committees for education and foreign affairs, she gave many speeches and was known as a charismatic orator. In 1931, she was one of three delegates from Ukraine to present the case against the Polish officials to the League of Nations, calling the suppression a \"pacification campaign\" to silence the Ukrainian minority population. She was also invited to speak on the issue at the British House Of Commons. During the 1932-1933 famine she was elected vice chair of the Public Rescue Committee, and organized meetings including politicians, scientists, and educators to address the issue and provide famine relief. Through her international ties with women's organizations, Rudnytska was selected to seek international aid support and bring the situation to the attention of the League of Nations.\nOn 29 September 1933, in Geneva 14 countries met and Rudnytska along with the other members of the Ukrainian delegation presented their findings about the famine and the need for international assistance. After several hours, the League decision was that the famine was an internal problem of the USSR, which was not a member of the League and therefore no help would be forthcoming. The delegation then turned toward the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) with a plea for help. ICRC officials contacted Soviet officials to gain approval for the Red Cross to organize international aid for Ukraine, but the head of the Soviet Red Crescent Society, Avel Yenukidze denied that there was any famine in Ukraine. Rudnytska spoke at another international conference held in Vienna in December 1933 urging that the international community pressure the Stalinist regime to admit there was a crisis and allow aid. Denial continued and information about the nature and scope of the famine was suppressed. In 1958, Rudnytska's book, \"Боротьба за правду про Великий Голод\" (Fighting for the truth about the Great Famine) took the stance that the famine was a result of organized pressure by the Kremlin to \"fracture Ukrainian peasants using collectivization to curb the rebellious Ukrainian people\".\n\nIn the interwar period, Rudnytska was one of the strongest voices in the Ukrainian women's movement. When Hitler came to power in 1933, she evaluated the changes which almost immediately were made restricting women's lives. Laws passed by the Third Reich barred women from employment in the civil service, enacted quotas for the number of women who had access to higher education, refused women admittance to the legal profession, among other changes. In response to these actions, Rudnytska wrote a satirical article which appeared in the magazine \"Women's Voice\" characterizing the regime's view of women as monsters, who had no purpose other than to cook, clean and bear children. At a time when Ukrainian women had developed a premise that the ideal woman was one committed to political awareness and social enterprise, who made a conscious choice when or if motherhood should occur, the German view caused serious reservations and attempts to organize motherhood schools in German-occupied territories were resisted. Rudnytska helped organize the First Ukrainian Women's Congress in 1934 which was held in Stanyslaviv and then in 1937 was elected as president of the World Union of Ukrainian Women. During the late 1930s, the Polish government closely watched members of the Women's Union, arresting some of the leadership and trying to ban the organization entirely.\n\nIn 1939, during the Soviet invasion of Poland, the regime annexed Galicia forcing national-oriented activists to flee. Fearful of repressions by the Soviet regime Rudnytska moved to Nazi-occupied Kraków. Later, in 1940, she moved on to Berlin, where her son was finishing his studied, begun already in Lviv. In 1943, she arrived in Prague, where she published her book, \"Zakhidna Ukraina pid bolshevykamy\" (Western Ukraine under the Bolsheviks) in 1944. Continuing to write in exile, she moved to Berlin and then directed the Ukrainian Relief Committee in Geneva between 1945 and 1950. In 1950 moved to New York City, where she remained for eight years, before returning to Europe, first moving to Rome and finally settling in Munich. Some of her most known publications include: \"\"Ukraïns’ka diisnist’ i zavdannia zhinochoho rukhu\" (The Ukrainian Reality and the Tasks of the Women's Movement, 1934), \"Don Bosko: Liudyna, pedahoh, sviatyi\" (Don Bosco: Man, Pedagogue, and Saint, 1963), and \"Nevydymi styhmaty\" (The Invisible Stigmata, 1971)\".\n\nRudnytska died on 29 March 1979 in Munich. Her remains were reburied in Lviv in 1993 in the Lychakiv Cemetery, beside other family members. In 1994, Irene Martyniuk published a book, \"Milena Rudnytska and Ukrainian Feminism: The Art of the Possible\", evaluating Rudnytska's role in the women's movement in Ukraine. In 1998, \"Мілена Рудницька. Статті. Листи, документи\" (Milena Rudnytska. Articles. Letters, documents) were edited by Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Miroslava Dyadyuk and Jaroslav Pelensky and published with the support of the Union of Ukrainian Americans.\n\n"}

{"id": "3657318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3657318", "title": "Nature study", "text": "Nature study\n\nThe nature study movement (alternatively, Nature Study or nature-study) was a popular education movement in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Nature study attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world. Led by progressive educators and naturalists such as Anna Botsford Comstock, Liberty Hyde Bailey, Louis Agassiz and Wilbur S. Jackman, nature study changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra \"study nature, not books\".\n\nThe movement popularized scientific study outside of the classroom as well, and has proven highly influential for figures involved in the modern environmental movement, such as Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, a growing concern for the state of the environment began to take shape. In 1864, American diplomat George Perkins Marsh published the groundbreaking book \"Man and Nature\". Highlighting people's responsibility to the natural world, the work marked the beginning of the conservation movement.\n\nBefore the 1890s, the idea of nature study existed, but the \"efforts had been sporadic and piecemeal\". Naturalist Louis Agassiz wanted to capture \"learners in studying the natural world\". His students, who were influenced by this philosophy, went on to provide the nature study knowledge in public schools. It was Agassiz who coined the phrase, \"Study nature, not books.\"\n\nNature study can be described as \"conceiving of the movement as a loose coalition of communities composed of individuals, societies, and institutions able to find some common ground in the study and appreciation of the natural world\". In \"Leaflet I: What Is Nature-Study?\" from a 1904 collection nature study lessons, Liberty Hyde Bailey presented the following description of nature study:\n\nNATURE-STUDY, as a process, is seeing the things that one looks at, and the drawing of proper conclusions from what one sees. Its purpose is to educate the child in terms of his environment, to the end that his life may be fuller and richer. Nature-study is not the study of a science, as of botany, entomology, geology, and the like. That is, it takes the things at hand and endeavors to understand them, without reference primarily to the systematic order or relationships of objects. It is informal, as are the objects which one sees. It is entirely divorced from mere definitions, or from formal explanations in books. It is therefore supremely natural. It trains the eye and the mind to see and to comprehend the common things of life; and the result is not directly the acquiring of science but the establishing of a living sympathy with everything that is.\n\nAnna Comstock defined the idea extensively in her book, \"Handbook of Nature Study\": \"Nature Study is for the comprehension of the Individual life of the bird, insect or plant that is nearest at hand.\" Comstock continued that nature study aided \"both discernment and in expression of things as they are\". The movement came at a time when society was concerned with the future of the next generation and with nature conservation itself, and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations. Though many efforts had come before 1890 by some naturalist and scientists to teach and expand the movement, the nature-study movement really did not gain momentum with the public until the late 19th century, early 20th century. The Nature Study changed the curriculum for children in many of areas of the country, and it also affected the way young and teenage girls were able to learn and find job placement. The movement was often related to creating a less extensive or formal science training for females. \n\nMany scientists, teachers, and leaders throughout the United States agreed on the value of nature study, and the subject became an important part of how the natural world was examined in many areas of the country by the early 20th century. Scientists gave public support to the philosophy and added to the creation of a curriculum and courses. The movement was particularly popular in the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest. The South also found some use for the idea of natural science in their agriculture schools, as well as at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now Tuskegee University) and Hampton Institute in Virginia (now Hampton University). Nature Study could be found in both urbanized, highly populated cities and in rural school systems because of the involvement of scientists in designing and implementing curriculum. For example, Wilbur Jackman created an outline of nature study with \"life and its phenomena\" which examined how the study of plants and animals would consist of zoology and botany (under biology), physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, geography, geology, and mineralogy.\n\nLucretia Crocker along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a \"Teachers' School of Science\" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society. Along with a Ellen Swallow Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers. Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.\n\nThe American Nature Study Society was founded in 1908, and still exists today. The society was an important aspect as well in helping to bring about the Nature-Study movement. Anna Botsford Comstock is one of the society' past presidents. It is considered to be America's oldest organization for environment.\n\nAnna Botsford Comstock studied and worked as the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University with her husband, John Henry Comstock. Cornell University was considered to be a major hub for the Nature Study movement. She wrote the \"Handbook of Nature Study\", which includes sections on how to teach the subject and how to teach the courses to children, and also includes sections from different species of animals and plants to even the skies.\n\nSciences were expanding in colleges and universities, and scientists felt \"that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools\". Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself. Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required numbers of hours and days per year in the school system. With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to \"share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world\". The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world. This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and educators in the country.\n\nAnna Botsford Comstock, stated in her book \"Handbook of Nature Study\", \"nature-study cultivates the child's imagination, since there are so many wonderful and true stories that he may read with his own eyes, which affect his imagination as much as does fairy lore, at the same time nature study cultivates in him a perception and a regard for what is true, and the power to express it...Nature study gives the child practical and helpful knowledge. It makes him familiar with nature's ways and forces, so that he is not so helpless in the presence of natural misfortune and disasters.\" Comstock also felt that the nature study did not begin with books, but through the observations of life and form from the first naturalists. The point of the system being to \"give pupils an outlook over all the forms of life and their relation one to another\".\n\nBecause of the importance placed on the new generation, the surrounding public watched the schools carefully with high expectations of the students in the late 19th century.\n\nA study in Kim Tolley's the \"Science Education of American Girls\" showed that of 127 public school systems, 49% offered Nature-study in all grades, 25% offered in at least six grades, 11% in at least four grades, 5% in three grades or lower, and 10% did not offer it at all in 1925.\n\nWomen played many roles in this movement within American society. Some were able to find supervisory jobs, or jobs as professor in natural history at school districts, or institutions of higher learning. Some women helped to create the movement itself, like Anna Botsford Comstock, and also teachers were able to \"[implement] nature study to varying degrees in their classrooms and occasionally modified the curriculum created by male professionals so that it favored the life sciences\".\n\nOver the four years from 1915–16 to 1919–20 in the state of Wisconsin, the percentage of women high school biology teachers increased from 50% to 67%. The number of women physics teachers increased from 3% in 1915–16 to 7% in 1919–20.\n\nThe nature study movement gave a new outlook to the education of young women in the United States. In the later 20th century, opinions started to change about the movement, and it declined. Some male critics saw it as \"romantic\" or \"sentimental\". This created a gender issue that was forcibly imposed on the nature-study movement. By the beginning of the 20th century, many young women were attracted to the natural history movement.\n\nThe Science Education of American Girls by Kim Tolley gives an explanation of high schools in America for females. \"Higher schools for females served as important centers for the dissemination of the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, institutions commonly located in small towns and in rural, rather than urban, areas. The ideology prevailed in antebellum southern institutions serving elite girls who never expected to work for wages outside the home, in northern schools that explicitly south to prepare teachers for the nation's growing common schools, and in Catholic academies on the western front.\"\n\nOthers, such as Susanna Moodie, and her daughter Agnes Chamberlin who made nature studies to support her family, and Catharine Parr Traill investigated nature to describe the new territories where they found themselves in nineteenth century Canada.\n\n"}

Editor Don Share said of Abramson's \"What I Have,\" \"The poem absorbs certain details but doesn't fasten upon them the way poets are tempted to do; it's not adjectival, it's not descriptive, it's not painting a kind of canvas with scenery on it, and yet those details are really fascinating.\"\n\nAbramson, with the poet Jesse Damiani, has been series co-editor of the annual anthology of innovative verse, \"Best American Experimental Writing\", since its inception with Omnidawn in 2012. The series was picked up by Wesleyan University Press in 2014. Guest editors for the series have included Cole Swensen (2014), Douglas Kearney (2015), Charles Bernstein and Tracie Morris (2016), Myung Mi Kim (2018), and Carmen Maria Machado and Joyelle McSweeney (2019).\n\nIn 2018, \"The Rumpus\" called the anthology \"meaty, daring, and beautiful.\" Nicole Rudick, managing editor of \"The Paris Review\", has called the series \"just my kind of rabbit hole.\"\n\nAfter the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Abramson received widespread attention for his tweets alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. By synthesizing reporting from major news outlets, Abramson has documented repeated contacts between multiple members of the Trump campaign and the political network surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on the timing, publicly known content, and personnel involved in those meetings, Abramson suggests that, through intermediaries, Trump and Putin came to an understanding in 2013 that Trump would run for president and push for an end to U.S. sanctions against Russia, and that Putin would in return greenlight a multibillion dollar Trump Tower Moscow deal and other potential Trump ventures in Russia while using Russian capabilities to aid the Trump campaign.\n\nWriters at several media publications – including \"The New Republic\", \"The Atlantic\", and \"Deadspin\" – have described Abramson as a conspiracy theorist. While Ben Mathis-Lilley of \"Slate\" argues that Abramson is \"not making things up, per se; he's just recycling information you could find on any news site and adding sinister what-if hypotheticals to create conclusions that he refers to, quite seriously, as 'investigatory analyses.'\" \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" also contests the moniker, noting that Abramson \"feuds with anti-Trump conspiracy theorists whom he sees linking to dubious sources and making claims without evidence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Virginia Heffernan writes in \"Politico\" that Abramson's \"theory-testing\" is \"urgently important.\" \"Der Spiegel\" calls Abramson \"a quintessential American figure: an underdog who became an involuntary hero.\" \"The New York Observer\" writes that \"events like Trump's 2013 trip to Russia for Miss Universe were covered extensively on Abramson's feed prior to the mainstream media catching on, a fact that has given him a reputation for being early to connect events within the broader Russia story.\"\n\nAccording to Avi Selk of \"The Washington Post\", Abramson \"has become virally popular by reframing a complex tangle of public reporting on the Russia scandal into a story so simple it can be laid out in daily tweets.\" But Selk notes that facts tend to be \"sprinkled into [Abramson's] threads with more fantastic sounding claims,\" and \"Abramson's tweets link copiously to sources, but they range in quality from investigative news articles to off-the-wall Facebook posts and tweets from Tom Arnold.\"\n\nAbramson authors \"The MFA Research Project\" (MRP), a website that publishes indexes of creative writing Master of Fine Arts (MFA) programs based on surveys and hard-data research. Indexes appearing on the MRP include ordered listings of program popularity, funding, selectivity, fellowship placement, job placement, student-faculty ratio, application cost, application response times, application and curriculum requirements, and foundation dates. The MRP also publishes surveys of current MFA applicants, and of various creative writing programs. Writing for \"The Cambridge Companion to American Poetry Since 1945\", Hank Lazer described Abramson's project as \"a daring and data-rich endeavor.\" \"The Missouri Review\" observed that Abramson, along with novelist Tom Kealey, \"had done a tremendous amount of work to peel back the layers of MFA programs and get applicants to make informed decisions.\"\n\nData from the MRP has been regularly published by \"Poets & Writers\" since 2009. \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" has termed the \"Poets & Writers\" national assessment methodology \"comprehensive\" and \"the only MFA ranking regime.\" The data is not without its critics. In September 2011, a critical open letter signed by professors from undergraduate and graduate creative writing programs was published. In their response, \"Poets & Writers\" asserted that it adhered to the highest journalistic standards. The magazine's Editorial Director Mary Gannon said of Abramson, the rankings' primary researcher, that he \"has been collecting data about applicants' preferences and about MFA programs for five years, and we stand behind his integrity.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Abramson was criticised for his \"Huffington Post\" piece \"Last Words for Elliot Rodger\", a \"remix\" of words taken from the final YouTube video of the perpetrator of the Isla Vista killings, which Abramson published less than two days after they took place. Both the reuse of Rodger's words and the timing of the poem caused offense. Although Abramson called the work \"a vehicle for amity and compassion\", Omnidawn, Abramson's publisher at the time, issued a statement saying that it was \"dismayed, disheartened, distressed\", adding that \"his actions in this matter are not in alignment with our principles.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

SEM focuses on what is best for students' success while increasing enrollment numbers and stabilizing institutional revenues. A student's success, according to an enrollment manager, is often based on the institution's graduation and retention rates. This means that students are often recruited based on the likelihood of them graduating. While this practice is acceptable for many privately run selective institutions, it is not a common practice of most public institutions such as community colleges. A real strategic enrollment management approach looks at the entire student cycle, from entry through graduation. \n\nAccording to Thomas Williams enrollment management refers to the traditional task of “setting and meeting the goal of assembling a student body that comprises a predetermined and advantageous mix of students in terms of quality, number, and diversity in all its forms.” strategic enrollment management is a broader, more dynamic task that begins with an understanding of the world around us, anticipates changes, probes institutional mission and goals, modifying them if necessary, and coordinates “campus-wide efforts in such areas as marketing, student recruitment and retention, tuition pricing, financial aid, academic and career counseling, and curriculum reform.”\n\nOften, SEM is understood to be focused on a college or university's traditional undergraduate students, and mobilized to meet the needs of the traditional college student. An additional area of SEM has been developed to apply these principles to the graduate student lifecycle: Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM). SEM focuses on the unique services and facilities needs specific to the adult graduate student.\n\nSome of the components of strategic enrollment management include: \n\nThe Evolution of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) resulted from the work of a number of people and organizations since schools started being concerned with this area in the early 1970s. Boston College (through the work of Jack Maguire in 1976) and Northwestern University (through the work of William Ihlanfeldt)[2] began to use research and specific communication strategies to increase enrollment at their schools. The idea of research and using the data to target communication and marketing efforts resulted in positive enrollment numbers and drew several entrepreneurs into the field of managing enrollments. Jack Maguire subsequently created and named the first enrollment management model for recruitment and retention of students.\n\nIn 1975, Stuart Weiner and Drs. Ron and Dori Ingersoll formed one of the earliest teams that addressed enrollment issues from the point of view of the total enrollment effort. Gradually, the Ingersolls and others made enrollment efforts more effective by strategically addressing schools, data, academic offerings, and student services—and included retention in the overall effort.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the practice of Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) was born. Since that time, organizations such as Noel-Levitz, Williams and Associates, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) have continued to refine the concept.\n\nBut it wasn’t until 1990 that AACRAO established the term, “Strategic Enrollment Management”, and started the first annual SEM conference, specifically focused on pressing issues and effective practices in Strategic Enrollment Management. Beginning in 2009, AACRAO developed the first SEM Award of Excellence to recognize outstanding achievement and visionary leadership in Strategic Enrollment Management.\n\nDr. Bob Bontrager, Sr. Director of AACRAO Consulting and SEM Initiatives edited some of the first books on SEM: \n\nIn 2012, Dr. Ron Ingersoll and Dr. Dori Ingersoll, with Dr. Bob Bontrager, co-edited the book \"Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education\". This SEM compendium was published for the higher education profession by AACRAO. EMAS Pro then initiated the industry’s first monthly Strategic Enrollment Management webinar series, as a companion to the \"Strategic Enrollment Management: Transforming Higher Education\" book. The Ingersolls serve as primary SEMinar session co-presenters.\n\nIn recent years, AACRAO has published additional books on SEM that include:\n\nAs enrollment moved from a focus on marketing to including the whole institution, the need grew for software that offered better ways to communicate and work with students and parents. In the mid-1980s, the Ingersoll Group and Tom Williams developed the first software to effectively manage the process for students from inquiry to enrollment. This was The Enrollment Management Action System (EMAS™).\n\nNoel-Levitz had developed Dialogue, a Telecounseling software designed for higher education. When Noel-Levitz merged with Williams Crockett, the telecounseling package was merged into EMAS to create EMAS\"Plus\"—a software system that addressed recruitment.\n\nIn 1998, Education Systems Inc. purchased EMAS products to add to software they developed for work with financial aid. At this point, the emphasis was still primarily on marketing and communication efforts. Education Systems, Inc. (doing business as EMAS™ Pro) expanded the original higher-education CRM software into a resource to address the total commitment of schools to manage their enrollment from a strategic point of view. Since then, a number of vendors serving Higher Education have emerged with CRM systems such as Hobsons, Jenzabar, Talisma and Target X.\n\nStudent CRM by Data Harvesting is also a growing popular choice for a student recruitment solution for universities and colleges.\n\nAccording to Bontrager and Kerlin , common misconceptions and sometimes barriers to implementing or moving strategic enrollment management forward within an institution are that strategic enrollment management is:\n\n"}

It is part of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The school was founded in 1880 as the Ann Arbor School of Music, and it was later incorporated into the University of Michigan.\n\nWith the exception of the Department of Dance, the School is located on the University of Michigan's North Campus, which is also home to the College of Engineering, the School of Information, and the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.\n\nThe school was founded in 1880. Previous administrators include Charles Sink, Earl V. Moore, James B. Wallace, Allen Britton, Paul Boylan, Karen Wolff (2000–05), Christopher Kendall (2005–15), and Aaron Dworkin (since 2015). The school was originally independent of the university.\n\nWell known alumni include playwright Arthur Miller, actors James Earl Jones, Gavin Creel, Darren Criss, David Alan Grier and Lucy Liu, musicians Jessye Norman, Alexander Frey, David Daniels, Chip Davis, Colin Stetson, and Michael Fabiano, as well as the pop star Madonna.\n\nSee also the list of list of University of Michigan arts alumni.\n\nThe University puts on more than a dozen main stage productions and concerts every year. Besides its main stage productions, the school also offers performance opportunities through studio productions and student-run groups.\n\nMain stage and studio productions staged by the university every year include:\n\nMusicians have the opportunity to perform in many ensembles in connection with the university. These include choral ensembles, orchestras, wind bands, historical music ensembles, jazz ensembles, electronic and new music ensembles, chamber music groups, and world music ensembles.\n\nThe school is home to one of the longest-established Javanese gamelan ensembles in the United States. This group of instruments, known formally as \"Kyai Telaga Madu\" (Venerable Lake of Honey), has been at the university since 1966, when its purchase was negotiated and organized by Bill Malm. From 1968 until 2002, the ensemble was under the direction of faculty ethnomusicologist Judith Becker. The ensemble is currently directed by Susan Walton.\n\nWind ensembles, under the University Bands, provide a central performance and training opportunity for students at the school. The wind ensembles provide a primary training opportunity for most instrumentalists at the school, who may audition to perform in one of the two top ensembles, the Symphony Band and Concert Band. The Michigan Marching Band is also a component of the University Bands and provides music and entertainment at university athletic events.\n\nStudents also receive training in large orchestral ensembles.\n\nStudent organizations through the university include:\n\nThe school's facilities are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On the University of Michigan north campus, these include the Earl V. Moore Building, the Stearns Building, the Walgreen Drama Center, and the Lurie Carillon. Specific north campus facilities include studios in the James and Anne Duderstadt Center, as well as the Arthur Miller Theater and the Stamps Auditorium (both in the Walgreen Drama Center). The Miller Theater is the only theater given permission by the estate of Arthur Miller to bear the playwright's name. On central campus, the school's facilities include Hill Auditorium, the Power Center, the Dance Building, and Burton Memorial Tower, which houses the Charles Baird Carillon. The university's south campus is home to William D. Revelli Hall, which houses offices and rehearsal space for the University of Michigan Marching Band.\n\nThe majority of the school's teaching spaces, faculty offices, and music library, are located in the Earl V. Moore Building. This building is named after a previous dean of the school, and was designed in a mid-century modern style by architect Eero Saarinen. Saarinen was commissioned to design the master plan for the University of Michigan’s North Campus, he requested to design the music school building (now the Earl V. Moore Building).\n\nThe original scheme called for an L-shaped building and a circular concert hall. Completed in 1964, the result was a five-level pavilion with flanking wings. Saarinen envisioned a building in harmony with nature, and so designed the building to be built into a hill overlooking a pond. The brick-clad concrete structure has narrow vertical windows that contrast with the horizontal brick patterns, thought to represent the alternating colors of piano keys. The brick color is known as “Cranbrook Buff” for its reference to the color of the buildings on the campus of the Cranbrook Education Community. The style of this building has influenced almost all of the later construction on North Campus.\n\nThe building contains 2 rehearsal/concert halls, 45 performance teaching studios, 18 classrooms, 40 offices, a large library, 120 practice rooms, including 12 organ practice rooms, and other special facilities for piano, harp, harpsichord and percussion practice. The construction of this building allowed for the first increase in enrollment since 1946.\n\nDuring construction of the building, Saarinen was diagnosed with a brain tumor, but he was able to watch the progress of the building from his room at University Hospital.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman announced an $8-million gift from William K. Brehm and Delores S. Brehm, a major contribution toward the cost of renovating and expanding the Moore Building. Of the total cost, another $14 million is allocated from the university, with the remaining balance to come from additional fundraising, including a gift from Glenn E. Watkins, emeritus professor of musicology. Construction for the project commenced in early 2014 and was finished in the fall of 2015. The renovation, which cost 29.5 million and added 34,000 square feet, includes a rehearsal with the footprint of Hill Auditorium, revamping of the McIntosh Theater, a lecture hall, an entrance and lobby, and new practice and teaching rooms.\n\nThe School of Music, Theatre & Dance offers degrees from the bachelors to the doctoral level. Fifteen departments make up the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, each offering several degree programs. They include:\n\n\nMichigan Performance Outreach Workshop\n\nThe Gershwin Initiative\n\nUniversity of Michigan Javanese Gamelan\nEXCEL Program\n\n"}
