{"id": "45687070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45687070", "title": "Academic careerism", "text": "Academic careerism\n\nAcademic careerism is the tendency of academics (professors specifically and intellectuals generally) to pursue their own enrichment and self-advancement at the expense of honest inquiry, unbiased research and dissemination of truth to their students and society. Such careerism has been criticized by thinkers from Socrates in ancient Athens to Russell Jacoby in the present.\n\nIn Xenophon's \"Memorabilia\", Socrates draws a comparison between the proper and honorable way to bestow beauty and the proper and honorable way to bestow wisdom. Those who offer beauty for sale on the market are called prostitutes, and are held in disrepute by the Athenians. Those who offer wisdom for sale, on the other hand, are highly respected. Socrates believes this is an error. The Sophists should be seen for what they are, prostitutors of wisdom.\n\nIn Plato's \"Protagoras\", Socrates draws an analogy between peddlers of unhealthy food and peddlers of false and deceptive wisdom. Food peddlers advertise their wares as healthy without offering solid evidence to back up their claims, leading those who trust them to succumb to an unhealthy diet. Peddlers of knowledge try to persuade impressionable young minds that what they teach is salutary and true, again without offering solid arguments to back up their claims. They mislead young minds on paths not conducive to intellectual flourishing.\n\nNineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer contrasts the genuine philosopher, who earnestly pursues truth and offers its fruits to all who will listen, to the \"businessmen of the chair\", the academics of his day who have debased the pursuit of knowledge into a means of livelihood no more dignified than the practice of business or law. The motto of the academic opportunists is \"primum vivere deinde philosophari\"—first live, afterwards philosophize. The bourgeois sentiment that someone who earns his living by a profession must know something about it makes those who hold the academic chairs immune from criticism. They make their living from philosophy, the public reasons, so they must know philosophy. The philosophy taught in the universities, Schopenhauer claims, is really no more than a superficial rationalization for the institutionalized religion, the intentions of the government, and the prevailing views of the times.\n\nFrench scholar Julien Benda (1867–1956) observes that in the past intellectuals have adopted two poses toward politics. The first was Plato's doctrine that morality must decide politics. The second was Machiavelli's, which said that politics has nothing do to with morality. Benda accuses the generation of intellectuals influential in France in the 1920s of adopting a third, far more pernicious, pose: that politics must be allowed to decide morality. The cause of this \"divinizing of politics\" is that the intellectuals (French \"clercs\") of his era have abandoned the ideal of disinterestedness, and now consider themselves to be ordinary citizens, subject to the same incentives as ordinary citizens.\n\nThe pursuit of personal advantage by purveying knowledge, Benda explains, has been held in disrepute since antiquity. But in his generation, this view of intellectual work has begun to seem obsolete, replaced by a kind of institutionalized careerism in which intellectuals were driven by the same petty desires for personal advantage as businessmen and lawyers.\n\nHistorian Russell Jacoby, writing in the 1970s, observes that intellectual production has succumbed to the same pattern of planned obsolescence used by manufacturing enterprises to generate renewed demand for their products.\n\nJacoby laments the demise of the radical critical theory of the previous generation, which sought to understand and articulate the contradictions inherent in bourgeois and liberal democratic ideologies. The new generation of theories, in contrast, seek to allow the contradictory elements of the ideology to coexist by isolating them, assigning them to separate departments in the university. This division of intellectual labor in the service of the prevailing ideology, Jacoby says, \"severs the life nerve of dialectical thought.\"\n\nJacoby ends his 1987 book \"The Last Intellectuals\" on a despairing note, observing that even radical Marxist intellectuals aren't immune to the pressure to achieve tenure, and have begun to alter their research methods in conformity to pressure from university administrators.\n\nLiterature professor Edward Said, in his 1983 book \"The World, the Text, and the Critic\", accuses literary theorists of his generation of succumbing to the free-market ideology of the Reagan era. The previous generation of critical theorists, Said explains, did not allow itself to be constrained by the conventional separation of academic fiefdoms. It maintained an insurrectionary relationship with the society in which it lived. The generation of critical theorists influential in the 1980s, however, began to betray these ideals, and timorously succumbed to the prevailing societal ethic of specialization and professionalism.\n\nWriting in 1991, \"dissident feminist\" scholar Camille Paglia finds in David Halperin's work a prototypical example of rampant careerism in the humanities. Paglia observes that Halperin's generation of academics is prone to a \"contemporary parochialism\" that eagerly cites hot-off-the-press articles without attempting to critically assess their objective merit in light of the intellectual tradition. Paglia accuses Halperin of assembling a pastiche of the latest faddish opinions and marketing it as a book, not for the sake of advancing the cause of truth, but with no other aim than career advancement. She compares such scholarship to junk bonds, a highly volatile investment. \n\nPaglia characterizes contemporary academic discourse influenced by French theorists such as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault as the academic equivalent of name brand consumerism. \"Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault,\" she says, \"are the academic equivalents of BMW, Rolex, and Cuisinart.\" Under the inspiration of the latest academic fashions, academics manufacture insipid prose with no objective merit for the same reason fashion designers come out with new fashions each season. Academics peddle the latest fashionable theories to replace perfectly good older theories, made obsolete not by genuine progress, but only by incessant changes in fashion, changes deliberately contrived to create consumer demand in a credulous public. The self-seeking of the latest generation of scholars is, for Paglia, symptomatic of an era iconically represented by junk bond traders on Wall Street, concerned not with creating a quality product, but only with making a quick buck. She takes Halperin's essay \"Why is Diatoma a Woman?\" as an example, calling it \"one of the great junk bonds of the fast-track academic era, whose unbridled greed for fame and power was intimately in sync with parallel developments on Wall Street.\"\n\nAs a remedy for rampant careerism in academia, Paglia prescribes a return to the ancient ascetic roots of the academic tradition.\n\nPaglia advises the graduate students of the next generation to return to the gentlemanly and ascetic traditions of past academics, avoiding faddish subjects or methods of interpretation, refusing to seek material reward from their work, and pursuing instead a lofty ideal of scholarship in which work follows \"its own organic rhythm\" rather than chasing the latest trends to win approval from contemporaries.\n\n"}

The style of the film has been described as being influenced by Austrian director Michael Haneke.\n\nRoberto (Hernán Mendoza) is depressed after his wife Lucía dies in a road accident. He decides to leave Puerto Vallarta and live in Mexico City with his 17-year-old daughter, Alejandra (Tessa Ía González Norvind). Settling into her new school, Alejandra goes to a party one night with her classmates. At the party, she has sex with José, who films the encounter on his phone. The next day the footage has been circulated around the school, with Alejandra getting text messages calling her a slut. This incident provides a reason for the students in the school to bully and sexually harass Alejandra. She does not speak of these incidents of bullying or sexual harassment to anyone. \n\nThe school organises a trip to Veracruz which all the students must attend. At the resort, each room has to be shared in groups of four. Alejandra is bullied again into going into the shower by her female roommates. They then block the door of the bathroom from outside, thus locking her in. At night, the rest of the students enjoy a party in the main room. The boys in the room take turns and rape her. Alejandra is helpless in the locked bathroom with the bullies in the room drinking while she is being raped.\n\nThe students then all go to the beach to continue the party. When the party ends, Alejandra is asleep on the beach as one of the male students urinates on her. One of the female students suggests she should go into the sea to wash herself. The rest of them join her and they have fun in the water. Alejandra disappears from the group and the rest of them become anxious about what repercussions now might happen. The next morning, the teachers discover that Alejandra is missing and alert her father. He discovers what has been going on with the bullying and is frustrated when the police cannot help him, as the crimes have been committed by minors.\n\nUnbeknown to everyone, Alejandra is in fact safe and enters a building to sleep. Meanwhile, her father follows a car driven by José's father and he kidnaps José after his father has parked his car. He ties his hands behind his back and gags him. He drives to the coast where he hires a boat and takes José out to sea where he throws him overboard, before starting the engine again and continuing to ride in the sea.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27894271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27894271", "title": "Currere", "text": "Currere\n\nThe \"Method of Currere\" is an approach to education based on post-modern philosophy and psychoanalytical technique, first described in a 1975 paper by William Pinar.\n\nCurrere encourages educators and learners to undertake an autobiographical examination of themselves.\n\nPinar suggests that the term \"currere\", the infinitive form of curriculum, implies the framework for the autobiographical reflection on educational experiences that ultimately shape an individual's self-understanding in our democratic society. In relation to curriculum Pinar states, \"The method of currere reconceptualized curriculum from course objectives to complicated conversation with oneself (as a 'private' intellectual), an ongoing project of self-understanding in which one becomes mobilized for engaged pedagogical action — as a private-and-public intellectual – with others in the social reconstruction of the public sphere\".\n\nPinar proposes a framework for the method of currere requiring those involved in education to reflect upon their life experiences thus far. The framework includes four steps or benchmarks to be followed. The steps are: the regressive, the progressive, the analytical, and the synthetic. Pinar uses the four steps as a framework to reflect on curriculum theory and public education. The framework's purpose is as follows, \"This four step process includes retelling the story of one's educational experiences, imagining future possibilities for self-understanding and educational practice; analysis of the relationships between past, present and future life history and practice; and new ways of thinking about education\".\n\nStep one: The regressive step encourages learner/educators to remember particular educational experiences and how the past experiences have guided them in the development of their own personal attitude or beliefs about education. This allows them to understand how the past has not only affected them, but the people surrounding them. Pinar says one's past is \"shared, each in his or her own way, by us all.\" They may remember past experiences and how they overcame struggles as a young person in society. John Dewey describes experience through trial and error. He states, \"We simply do something, and when it fails, we do something else, and keep on trying till we hit upon something which works, and then we adopt that method as a rule of thumb measure in subsequent procedure\".\n\nStep two: The progressive step offers an opportunity to think about the future.\n\nStep three: The analytical step involves analyzing the here and now and creates a subjective space of freedom from the present. Students and teachers may see the moments of right here and now as a \"historical moment in which we lived, in which others have lived, and in which our descendants will someday live\".\n\nStep four: The final step is the synthetic step which involves analyzing the present in light of the knowledge and understanding gained from steps 1, 2, and 3. Many educators may use the first three steps to visualize and analyze their journey of becoming an educator. When they ultimately begin affecting others' lives and working with curriculum, educators find themselves in the synthetic stage of becoming. \"One utilizes insights from past, present and future to create transformed educational environments\".\n\nJames G. Henderson and Rosie Gornik use currere in Transformative Curriculum Leadership as they present educators a particular type of curriculum judgment. They use a paradigm called curriculum wisdom problem solving while envisioning curriculum as a journey. Just as Pinar presents our process of becoming a journey, Henderson and Gornik use currere throughout their writing with the purpose of allowing the reader insights into firsthand accounts of educators' experiences. They work closely with teaching for 3S Understanding—\"referring to the integration of Subject matter understanding with democratic Self and Social understanding and undertaking a personal journey of understanding\". Within Transformative Curriculum Leadership we find Gornik's deep self-understanding in regard to 3S Understanding through her currere. She presents the reader with various autobiographical narratives and vignettes written to inspire the reader to delve into their own currere and examine their own self-understanding.\n\nHenderson and Gornik (2007) say they incorporate the currere method in their book because they \"acknowledge that educators who choose to facilitate their students' personalized journeys of understanding cannot do so without undertaking a similar journey of understanding\". Educators have many responsibilities including presenting their students with opportunities or ideas of how to become active members in today's democratic society. The purpose of the book is to encourage the reader to become a \"connoisseur\" of democratic education with an understanding of educational growth in societies with democratic values.\n"}

He studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating as a civil engineer at age 19. He then worked for two years in the Geological Survey of New York, and shortly after he had reached his majority he became an instructor in mathematics and the sciences at the Albany Female Academy, where he taught for four years, after which he resumed his studies in Germany with Justus von Liebig. On returning to the United States, Horsford was appointed the Rumford Professor and Lecturer on the Application of Science to the Useful Arts at Harvard in 1847. He taught chemistry and conducted research at the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard for 16 years, and published articles in major scientific publications on such topics as phosphates, condensed milk, fermentation, and emergency rations.\n\nEben Horsford probably is best remembered today for reformulating baking powder. Previously, baking powder had contained baking soda and cream of tartar. Horsford replaced the cream of tartar with the more reliable calcium biphosphate (also known as calcium acid phosphate and many other names). He did this a little earlier than August Oetker. In 1854, Horsford, with partner George Wilson, formed the Rumford Chemical Works. They named it after the title of Horsford's position at Harvard. It was in that enterprise that Horsford created his commercially successful baking powder. Horsford's development of baking powder was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2006.\n\nA generous supporter of higher education for women, Horsford became president of the board of visitors of Wellesley College, and donated money for books, scientific apparatus, and a pension fund to the college. He enjoyed remarkable success through his development of processes for manufacturing baking powder and condensed milk. In seeking patents for his inventions, Horsford was assisted by Charles Grafton Page, a patent solicitor who had previously worked at the US Patent Office.\n\nProfessor Eben Norton Horsford created the Shelter Island Public Library in Shelter Island, New York in 1885. He donated 280 volumes for the first library, which was initially housed in a closet in the Old Store, a building that functioned as a post office, telegraph station, and local meeting place. After the store burned down in 1891, a new library for more books donated by Professor Horsford was built on a nearby lot donated by his daughter Lilian, and his daughter Cornelia became the library’s first president. \n\nHorsford became interested in the theory that the Vikings, specifically Leif Ericson, had visited North America, and set out to prove it. He connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas, invented Old Norse etymologies for Algonquian place-names like Naumkeag, Namskaket, and Amoskeag, and 'discovered' Viking archaeological remains. Horsford had a plaque documenting all this placed on Memorial Drive near Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A few miles upstream, at the mouth of Stony Brook, he had Norumbega Tower built marking the supposed location of Norumbega, a Viking fort and city, complete with its Althing and America's first Christian bishop. He also commissioned a statue of Leif Ericson that stands on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. The professor wrote a series of books, articles, and pamphlets about the Vikings' visits to Massachusetts. After his death, his daughter Cornelia Horsford took up the cause. Their work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.\n\nIn honor of Horsford's generous donations to Wellesley College, a building named Norumbega Hall was dedicated in 1886 and celebrated by a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The external examiner system originated in 1832 with the establishment of the University of Durham, the first in England since Cambridge was founded 600 years earlier. Durham used Oxford examiners to assure the public that its degrees were a similar standard to Oxford's. The establishment of more universities in England from the 1880s was accompanied by a requirement that examinations be conducted by internal and external examiners. It is also found in countries whose higher education systems were developed from United Kingdom practice, or strongly influenced by it, after its introduction, including New Zealand, and India. It is one of the oldest systems of quality control within higher education.\n\nIt is a requirement for all degree level examinations at British universities, and in countries operating a similar system, that at least one member of the examining board should be from a university other than the one awarding the degree (and should have no recent affiliation with it). This applies both to undergraduate examinations, where there may be hundreds or even thousands of candidates, and to postgraduate examinations including those for the PhD where a special board is convened for each candidate.\n\nWhile the role of the external examiner varies with the level of examination, the purpose of the system remains the same: to ensure that standards are kept the same across universities, and to provide an assurance of fair play given that internal examiners might be prejudiced for or against a candidate. In consequence, (by convention and often by regulation) if examiners disagree, the view of the external examiner takes precedence.\n\nIn undergraduate examinations, external examiners typically see, and have to approve, draft examination questions before the papers are set; and they will mark the work, or review the marks, of at least a sample of candidates. They are often asked to adjudicate when candidates are on borderlines or when internal examiners have disagreed about a candidate's marks. Externals are expected to make a report both to the department and also to the university authorities; they have wide licence to comment on all aspects of the degree programme, including its staffing and teaching, not just on the examination process. Where \"viva voce\" examinations are still held as part of the final degree assessment, it is common for external examiners to take part in them. Students may have the right to ask for their work to be considered by the external examiner. External examiners are typically appointed for a period of three or four years, and it is common to consult them about changes to the programme that are being introduced during their period of office. In the case of undergraduate examinations in broad disciplines, there are commonly several external examiners with different areas of expertise on a board of examiners.\n\nIn PhD examinations within the British system, there are normally only two or three examiners, and the external examiner usually takes the lead in questioning the candidate in the \"viva voce\" examination which is the key stage of the assessment. In some other countries, e.g. Australia, New Zealand and India, externals commonly send their opinions by post, though there may also be a \"local\" external examiner who is present at the \"viva\".\n\nWhatever the level of examination, it is normal to appoint as externals senior academics of acknowledged expertise – though in the case of PhD exams, expertise takes priority over seniority if the two criteria cannot both be met, as is often the case with highly specialised subjects. An invitation to serve as an external examiner is therefore usually seen as something of an honour, though often an inconvenient one: although a fee is paid to external examiners, it is usually small, and a considerable amount of work is involved, often at the busiest time of the academic year.\n\nWhile the external examiner in the form described here (and the use of the title \"External examiner\") is specific to British or British-influenced higher education, the use of examiners from other universities (and often other countries) is widespread in other countries, especially for PhD examinations.\n"}

It was first conceived by clinicians as a way for junior colleagues to round on patients. The patient was traditionally present for the round and would answer questions; grand rounds have evolved with most sessions rarely having a patient present and being more like lectures. An actor portrays the patient in some instances.\nGrand rounds help doctors and other healthcare professionals keep up to date in important evolving areas which may be outside of their core practice. Most departments at major teaching hospitals will have their own specialized, often weekly, grand rounds. Attending grand rounds is also an important supplement to medical school and on-the-job resident training. Grand rounds can also be distinguished from rounds which is the (typically) daily visit by the attending physician and team to all that physician's patients on the ward. Rounding with an attending physician is an important part of medical on-the-job training and education, but its primary focus is immediate care for the patients on the ward. Grand rounds tends to present the bigger picture, including experience with patients over many years, and the newest research and treatments in an area. Grand rounds tend to be open to the entire medical professional community, whereas rounds are specific to individual attending physicians and their teams.\n\nA 1966 report in the Australian journal \"Clinical Pediatrics\" called into question the sometimes inconsiderate behavior of practitioners who treated patients who were featured cases of grand rounds.\n\nMany teaching and research hospitals have started providing streaming video of their grand rounds presentations for free over the Internet. This is an opportunity for medical professionals and students to improve their knowledge, and builds on one of the core values of the Hippocratic Oath – that medical education should be provided for free, and that doctors should actively and openly share their knowledge without compensation in order to improve patient care.\n\nMany of these organizations provide an archive of several years of recent grand rounds presentations and as such offer a tremendous resource for increasing medical knowledge and improving patient care.\n\n"}

He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, and gained an exhibition 1715-18. He proceeded to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated MA on 30 April 1720. He was DCL in 1727.\n\nBrooke, then a fellow of Oriel, was made headmaster of Manchester Grammar School in September 1727. He obtained a mandamus from the crown to elect him a fellow of the collegiate church, and was elected in 1728, in spite of Tory opposition. He appears to have been on good terms with John Byrom, but he was unsuccessful as a master, and the feoffees of the school reduced his salary from £200 to £10.\n\nIn 1730 he received the Oriel College living of Tortworth in Gloucestershire. Here he lived, after resigning the mastership of the school in 1749, until his death on 21 August 1757. He was married, and had one daughter. Brooke left his library for the use of his successors at Tortworth.

He was born into a family with Midwestern roots that trace back to \"Mayflower\" passengers, Love Brewster, a founder of the town of Bridgewater, Massachusetts; Elder William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony; and William Bradford, Governor of the Plymouth Colony and the second signer and primary architect of the Mayflower Compact in Provincetown Harbor. He was also a descendant of Martha Wadsworth Brewster, a notable 18th-century American poet and writer.\n\nHe was the only son and the second child of George Henry Perkins and the grandson of Frederick Perkins and Harriet Olmstead. Henry's father was a noted American educator, naturalist and Professor of Geology and kindred sciences at the University of Vermont. His father served as Dean of Arts and Sciences, vice president and was appointed interim president of the University of Vermont during World War I. He was also the state geologist of Vermont from 1898 to 1933. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale University, class of 1867; received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Yale in 1869.\n\nHis mother was Mary Judd Farnham, an 1863 graduate of Knox College, and a daughter of Eli Farnham and Jerusha Brewster Loomis. She attended the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas at Knox College on October 7, 1858. It was said of her that she was a woman of superior mental endowments. She was the president of the Vermont Chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and was active in her church and philanthropic work. Her first cousin was Dr. George Trumbull Ladd an American philosopher, educator and psychologist.\n\nMary's parents had emigrated to Illinois in 1836 and were the among the founders and pioneers of Galesburg, Illinois. They built a temporary cabin in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, the settlers having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits. They were also instrumental in the founding of Knox College. Eli Farnham served as secretary of the Board of Trustees for nearly forty years and also the first school teacher in Galesburg.\n\nHe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Vermont, Burlington in 1898, received his M.Sc in 1899 and was awarded his PhD in Zoology at Johns Hopkins University in 1902. The title of his doctoral thesis was \"The Development of Gonionema Murbachii\", which was on the development and life cycle of Gonionema murbachii (a type of jellyfish). After receiving his doctorate, he joined the faculty of UVM where he remained until his retirement.\n\nHe married on June 11, 1903 at Baltimore, Baltimore County, Maryland, Mary Edmunds, born at Baltimore, Maryland on October 18, 1874 the daughter of James Richard Edmunds and Anna Smith Keyser. She was the sister of Dr. Charles Keyser Edmunds, one of his fellow graduate students at Johns Hopkins. He was president of Canton Christian College in Canton, Kwangtung Province, China and the fifth president of Pomona College in Claremont, California. Another brother was James Richard Edmunds, Jr., a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, and a notable Architect in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nShe was a descendant of John Howland, (c. 1599–1673) who was one of the Pilgrims who travelled from England to North America on the Mayflower, signed the Mayflower Compact, and helped found Plymouth Colony. She was also the great great granddaughter of Thomas Hurst Hughes, the founder and owner of the Congress Hall Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey, and a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey.\n\nHenry and Mary were the parents of two children, Anna Keyser Perkins-Middlebrook, who married as her second husband, Stanwood Wollaston and Harriet Perkins.\n\nIn 1903, he was appointed associate professor of Zoology at University of Vermont, Burlington. He taught biology, entomology, anatomy and physiology, and embryology during the first half of his career. In 1911 was promoted to full professor and served as chairman of the Zoology Department. His sporadic research projects involved field studies in the rapidly fading naturalist tradition: studies of birds, game fish, and marine invertebrates. He retired in 1945 and remained active in the UVM Alumni Association until his death in 1956.\n\nHis interest in eugenics began shortly after the end of World War I. It was after World War I that he learned of a study by the U.S. Army which was used as part of the draft process. The results from the Army study showed that men from Vermont had an inordinately high rate of \"defects\" (such as diabetes, epilepsy, \"deformities\" and \"mental deficiency\"). Perkins saw this as a problem that needed to be fixed. He went about trying to \"fix\" this through investigation and social reform. This reform, as denounced by historian Nancy Gallagher in her research titled \"Breeding better Vermonters\", also targeted French Canadians and American natives in Vermont state, considered \"insane invasion\" to eliminate.\n\nAround the same time, he revamped his Zoology curriculum and began teaching courses specifically on Heredity and Evolution. His heredity class provided the first known venue for eugenics education at UVM and the inspiration for a \"Eugenics Survey\"—a field station to study Vermonters.\n\nHe died on November 24, 1956 in Burlington, Vermont. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11904058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11904058", "title": "Intensive interaction", "text": "Intensive interaction\n\nIntensive interaction is an approach for teaching communication skills to children and adults who have autism, severe learning difficulties and profound and multiple learning difficulties who are still at early stages of development. The approach focuses on teaching the Fundamentals of Communication – the communication concepts and performances that precede speech development, though it may include many people who have some speech and language development.\n\nIntensive interaction was developed during the 1980s by teachers working in schools in long-stay hospitals in southern England. The development of the approach came about partly as a result of practitioners questing for effective teaching approaches and partly as a reaction to and move away from the dominance of behavioural psychology in the field. A psychologist, the late Geraint Ephraim, working at Leavesden Mental Hospital, propounded the original formulation of techniques known then as ‘Augmented Mothering’. The detailed development work carried out at Harperbury Hospital School resulted in the first research projects and publications by Melanie Nind and Dave Hewett.\n\nThe techniques of teaching borrow from understandings as to how infants in the first two years carry out the learning of these highly complicated, critical concepts and abilities. The mass of research on babies learning in interactions with adults that has arisen since the mid-1970s, allows some simple pedagogical insights. Babies gradually accrue these complex performances by taking part in many successive, cumulative interactions with the adults around them. The main learning motivation for both participants is the mutual enjoyment of the interaction. The natural adult style is to construct the interaction basically, mostly, by allowing the baby to lead with her behaviour, with the adult building the content and a flow by responding to the behaviour of the baby. It is usually observed that the most frequently seen adult response is to imitate what the baby does. Thus the teaching is highly responsive and by process, rather than directive and driving to an objective.\n\nFor the developers of intensive interaction, it seemed a logical step to borrow from these processes in order to ignite the communication learning of many people who can frequently be considered ‘communicatively difficult to reach’, often living with some, or extensive, social isolation. Thus, intensive interaction activities are literally highly interactive, with the teacher enjoyably working from the behaviour of the learner. The activities can operate at many levels of intensity; they can be active and physical, but also quietly intense and contemplative. For good progress to occur, the activities should happen frequently (daily, day after day), with the repetition of successful activities within sessions providing the basis for the gradual expanding in duration, content, sophistication and complexity of those activities.\n\nThe gradual dissemination of intensive interaction since the late 1980s has been a completely practitioner-led initiative. Intensive interaction is now common practice in special schools and adult services all over the United Kingdom. Interest worldwide is growing and developing. There are a range of books and other materials now available and a burgeoning community of intensive interaction practitioners.\n\nIntensive interaction is intended to address the needs of:\n\nThe \"fundamentals of communication\" are typically referred to as being attainments such as:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6877531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6877531", "title": "Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space", "text": "Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space\n\nInvestigations in Numbers, Data, and Space is a K–5 mathematics curriculum, developed at TERC in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The curriculum is often referred to as \"Investigations\" or simply \"TERC\". Patterned after the NCTM standards for mathematics, it is among the most widely used of the new reform mathematics curricula. As opposed to referring to textbooks and having teachers impose methods for solving arithmetic problems, the TERC program uses a constructivist approach that encourages students to develop their own understanding of mathematics. The curriculum underwent a major revision in 2005–2007.\n\n\"Investigations\" was developed between 1990 to 1998. It was just one of a number of reform mathematics curricula initially funded by a National Science Foundation grant. The goals of the project raised opposition to the curriculum from critics (both parents and mathematics teachers) who objected to the emphasis on conceptual learning instead of instruction in more recognized specific methods for basic arithmetic.\n\nThe goal of the \"Investigations\" curriculum is to help all children understand the fundamental ideas of number and arithmetic, geometry, data, measurement and early algebra. Unlike traditional methods, the original edition did not provide student textbooks to describe standard methods or provide solved examples. Instead, students were guided to develop their own invented algorithms through working with concrete representations of number such as manipulatives and drawings as well as more traditional number sentences. Additional activities include journaling, cutting and pasting, interviewing (for data collection) and playing conceptual games.\n\n\"Investigations\" released its second edition for 2006 that continues its focus on the core value of teaching for understanding. The revised version has further emphasis on basic skills and computation to complement the development of place value concepts and number sense. It is also easier for teachers to use since the format is more user friendly, though some districts have failed to carefully implement the second edition as well, and moved back to textbooks that teach traditional arithmetic methods.\n\nA systematic review of research into Investigations was conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences and published as part of the What Works Clearinghouse in February 2013. This found \"potentially positive effects\" on mathematics achievement, supported by a \"medium to large\" evidence base.\n\nA variety of measures of student achievement and learning including state-mandated standardized tests, research-based interview protocols, items from research studies published in peer-reviewed journals and specially constructed paper-and-pencil tests have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of \"Investigations\"\n\nResearch featured at the TERC website states that students who use \"Investigations\", among other things, \"do as well or better than students using other curricula.\" To support the assertion that children do better when they are not taught traditional arithmetic, Anne Goodrow, in her PhD thesis at Tufts University, compared subtraction strategies of students taught traditional methods with those who used constructivist methods with \"Investigations curriculum\". Although negative numbers are not taught in the 2nd grade, \"constructivist\" student subtracting 9 from 28 explains that \"8 minus 9 equals negative 1\" and then argues that \"-1 plus 20 is the same as 20-1 and equals 19.\" On the basis of this, and of the average score of this group of 10 students, the author concluded that \"although they did not receive instruction in the use of the standard algorithms, the children in the Constructivist group were the most successful at both two-digit addition and subtraction.\" Many research reports demonstrating the success of the program are criticized by opponents of this curriculum as having poor methodology or for being conducted by the publisher. NSF-sponsored curricula are required to conduct and report such studies, something that is not required of traditional mathematics textbooks. See also a recent study conducted with the revised edition, for more evidence of efficacy.\n\nSome school districts report their own data about success with the program.\n\n\"Investigations\" initially was commercially successful. But parents and math educators have criticized its lack of traditional arithmetic content, of decimal math, of multiplication tables, of division and multiplication of fractions, or even of addition and subtraction of ordinary fractions apart from a small subset, its emphasis on \"kindergarten activities\" (cutting, folding, taping, etc.) in class and homework, its lack of a traditional textbook; its incompatibility with high-school and international mathematics methods; its non-traditional homework assignments; its high cost (a concern mainly of home-schooling parents); and other factors.\n\nA common complaint is that the curriculum does not teach any of traditional arithmetic methods familiar to those taught in other nations and to parents with as little as an elementary-school education. The critics assert that \"the TERC computational methods are cumbersome, inefficient, and only work for carefully selected simple problems\" and that \"conscious thought is regularly required for both TERC method selection and TERC method execution\" even at the simplest levels, thus precluding automaticity and the ability to focus conscious thought on higher-level cognitive tasks later on. TERC defenders' response is that the traditional arithmetic methods familiar to Americans are not necessarily those used in other nations. Research has shown that students are capable of developing algorithms that are as correct, efficient, and generalizable as the \"standard\" algorithms.\n\nA common parent complaint is that there is no recognizable arithmetic and that homework is frequent and very time-consuming, with some tasks requiring help from family members and cutting, pasting, and coloring, whereas a traditional worksheet may take little time. Other critics claim that there is not enough homework, and children should simply be given a procedure and told to practice it on a large number of exercises.\n\n\nThe textbook series has been parodied by the on-line cartoon series \"Weapons of Math Destruction\", including one panel of a student declaring that he can't finish his homework because they have run out of glue, or writing two different ways to determine if 2 is even or odd, and explaining the answer.\n\nAn incomplete listing of school districts that have adopted TERC materials\n\nThis list is indeed incomplete; there are hundreds of districts using this curriculum.\n\n"}

Sheldon (pen names, Richard Hackstaff, Stanley Norris, Grace Shirley; April 11, 1862 – June 11, 1945) was an American author of novels, poems, and short stories, as well as a newspaper editor. Her published work amounted to over one million words. She claimed to have earned her living in fifteen different and totally dissimilar lines of business, including bookkeeping, business management, journalism, work in a chemical laboratory, buying dry goods, and writing stories. She was a suffrage activist, and she opposed prohibition.\n\nSheldon was the first poetess in the United States to use her talents for the birth control movement. So many of Sheldon's poems appeared on the editorial page of \"The New York Times\" that her name became closely associated with that paper. She is also remembered for her \"Marion Marlowe\" dime novel series including \"My Queen\", which was an exception to the romance stories of the day where the heroine married at the end of the novel, leaving no compelling reason to write a sequel.\n\nA medical education, coupled with opportunity for wide observation of the poor, gave Sheldon knowledge along sociological lines. One of her achievements was a sociological lecture in verse, entitled \"The Alien,\" which was heard in New York and elsewhere in 1915. One poem of this lecture, \"The Night Court,\" was widely read and copied. Sheldon was the author of several novels and serial stories, many short stories and special articles, and more than one thousand poems, the latter having appeared in nearly every magazine and paper of prominence in the U.S. For many years, she also wrote a large number of the unsigned verses. Though without funds at the beginning of her career, she met every expense that she ever incurred without once asking for an \"extension of time\" or credit.\n\nLurana Waterhouse Sheldon was born April 11, 1862, at Hadlyme, Connecticut, the daughter of Asa Sheldon and Christiana F. (Waterhouse) Sheldon. She was of New England origin, her mother being a descendant of early Cape Cod settlers and her father the great grandchild of Jonathan Edwards, an eminent divine of the eighteenth century.\n\nSheldon received the best education that a public and private school could give her. In the fall of 1882, she matriculated with the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. During her first year in college, Sheldon boarded at the New York Bible and Fruit Mission, and in her visits with that organization to Blackwells Island, Harts Island, Wards Island, and others, where the cities' paupers, lunatics, imbeciles, incurables and convicts were quartered, she saw enough to convince her that no such being as a God could exist and that the question of existence had only a physical basis. After spending six years in the study and practice of medicine, she was obliged to abandon it because of threatened nervous prostration.\n\nSheldon spent two years at the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary, and nearly seven years in hospitals, helping the physicians in many ways. Concerning her work in the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane, Dr. James M. Kenniston wrote about her in the \"Portland Express-Advertiser\", the largest paper in Maine:—\nSheldon started earning her own living at the age of seventeen. She began writing verses at the age of ten years, but it was not until she was twenty-five that she placed a monetary value upon her written work. From that time, she began filling in odd hours with her writing. Like many another prominent authors of her day, Sheldon's first successes were made through the columns of the \"New York Mercury\". Sheldon's poem entitled \"The Medical Student's Dream,\" together with some prose work, was requested for the exhibit of New York State literature by the Board of Managers at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.\n\nBy 1900, her published stories amounted to over two hundred and her humorous verses were known to every editor of a Sunday newspaper and pictorial weekly in the United States. From 1900-02, she worked under contract with one of the large publishing houses of New York City. In one year alone (1900), Sheldon's published work amounted to over one million words, and not a week passed without a story from her pen appearing upon the bookstands. In 1901, Sheldon spent six months at Saratoga Springs, New York before returning to New York City, having benefitted by the change of air and long-continued rest.\n\nSheldon wrote war poetry for \"The New York Times\", the \"New York Times Current History Magazine\", and \"Munsey's Magazine\". Perhaps the best efforts of Sheldon were the occasional serious articles which appeared in various periodicals for advanced thought, for they demonstrated the writer to be not only an essayer of fiction, but also a writer of that mental calibre which was attained through profound thought and careful investigation.\n\nSheldon published the greater part of her work under assumed names, or no name at all, partly through her own desire and partly through the injustice of editors. Her range of literary work extended from short Freethought articles for various liberal magazines, humor for Sunday newspapers, ghost stories and pathos for various monthlies, to thrilling tales of adventure for boys. Sheldon's affection for animals amounted almost to mania, and she declared in more than forcible language that \"if she were possessed of great wealth, she would spend a large portion of it in trying to punish two classes of people—first, the class who neglect or ill-treat animals, and, second, the men and women who bring children into the world without a clean bill of health, morals or temperament, to say nothing of sufficient wealth to insure them against hardship.\"\n\nHer published work consisted of seven novels, about two hundred short stories, more than one thousand poems, and many articles on scientific and sociological subjects.\n\nSheldon was brought up an orthodox Congregationalist, but her doubts ripened early and reaped their harvest. The God of the Bible soon became in her eyes not only a \"moral monstrosity\" but an \"inconceivable hypothesis,\" and she saw no shadow of reason in the \"vicarious atonement.\" A God who creates beings with an \"inclination\" toward evil furnishes the temptation for the committing of said evil, and then punishes his own creatures for acting out the impulses of their natures, was a being whom she could not and would not worship. In early life, she read Dodd, Drummond, and John Stuart Mill, and studied the Bible with a concordance, besides spending many hours praying for enlightenment on these subjects, but the only knowledge which she could glean that in any way satisfied her common sense and reason came later in the study of Ludwig Büchner, Aldous Huxley, Charles Darwin, and Herbert Spencer, and in company with such intellects as these she soon realized that she was beyond the need of faith in the undemonstrable vagaries of superstition.\n\nWhen she asked for suitable employment for a woman of her intelligence at the Woman's Christian Association, she was requested to tell her family history, declare her faith in God and give up a percentage of her earnings for a servant's position. She declined with thanks and went her own way. It was another argument in favor of the utter worthlessness of Christian teachings. Whether Sheldon's religious infidelity was a reaction of Edward Jonathan's piety, she did not know, but if this was the case, to quote her own words, \"the bigotry of the pious gentleman with the ten children was not in vain, it resulted in freeing at least one brain from the thraldom of inherent superstition.\"\n\nShe struggled to \"keep her head above water\" in a large city like New York, without money in her pocket. It was the injustice of human nature, what she considered to be the so-called handiwork of God, that prompted her to an occasional effort in the Freethought direction, \"not but that people are welcome to any faith they choose but because a God that one could respect must be a welcome innovation.\" Such a God she found in \"science\". \"Faith\", \"hope\", and \"love\" represented nothing to her but the highest possible achievement of the physical organism, yet they lost nothing of their value springing from a source that was both reasonable and demonstrable. The little help and favors which she received through life did not come from churches, home missions or Christians. For years, she visited the outcasts of New York City with the members of some so-called \"mission\" or other, but the spectacle of some hypocrite, exhorting an honest sinner to \"be good,\" was too much of a strain for a candid nature. Said Sheldon: \"I have found the happiness of life in the companionship of books, animals and an occasional true frienc' and the satisfaction in dividing a dollar with one more destitute than myself. The rest is only a panorama of injustice and folly, a farce in which serious things, like child-bearing, are treated indifferently, and absurd matters like the salvation of a soul, which we do not know exists, are carried to the extreme of bloodshed and torture.\"\n\nThough Sheldon was troubled by poor health, she traveled in the United States, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. She felt that no woman was ever contented with less of the world's goods than she was, and felt that the bitterness of life lay in unrewarded merit. She lived alone in a flat and shunned society for the reason that \"the only people whom she ever agrees with are found in books, and she is tired of coming in contact with their ignorant maligners.\" She had no desire to pose as a reformer, but it was a constant source of irritation to her that people who were in position to do so did not avail themselves of the opportunity to improve existing conditions a little.\n\nOf her hardships, Sheldon refused to talk, on the grounds that a \"tale of woe\" was never interesting to anyone but the teller. To quote her own words, she was \"endowed with an inheritance of poverty, poor health and ambition, which prove, under any environments, a damnable mixture.\" With this handicap, she was forced to begin the struggle of life and, to add to her difficulties, she declared further she \"was born with a spirit which could not tolerate rebuke and a mettle which would yield to no discipline whatever. I felt that I bad been wronged from the hour of my conception,\" she said, \"and a feeling of resentment was the first sentiment of my nature.\" With this sentiment predominating, Sheldon could not and would not tread the only paths which were open to women in her position; she was determined to travel on the plane of her own inclinations or not travel at all, and her course was marked at every step with the bruises of collision with obstacles which a more acquiscent nature would not have encountered.\n\nSheldon was a prominent suffragist. In 1916 in Maine, she founded the Women's Defense Club with a purpose to \"instruct American women to shoot, and shoot straight\".\n\nOn November 20, 1904, (or November 20, 1903) she married Judge Isaac F. Ferris of York County, Maine, who had been a journalist in his early career. Childless, she died in Maine on June 11, 1945.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father and two of his brothers later changed their last names to make them seem only children in order to escape military service in the Imperial Russian Army; and so, while one brother retained the name Rambam, her father changed his to Ramberg, another of his brothers went to Rambert, and the last changed his name to Warszawski. She changed her name to Myriam Ramberg, and finally left it in the French form \"Marie Rambert\". In later years she was known to friends and dancers as Mim.\n\nHer father, Yakov Ramberg (1855–1928), born in Vištytis, a small town in Suwałki Governorate (nowadays in Lithuania), was a learned merchant and Hebrew publisher and lexicographer, and a Zionist. Her mother, Eiga Ramberg née Lap, born in the town of Suchowola (nowadays in north-east Poland), daughter of Rabbi Elhanan Tzvi Lap, was a community worker.\n\nRambert was the fourth of seven children. The eldest child, Rakhel, was the wife of Hebrew writer Micha Josef Berdyczewski. The second, Ewa Ramberg-Figulla, was a Slavist, the wife of German Hittitologist Hugo Heinrich Figull and mother of physicist Johannes Figulla (father-in-law of German writer Christoph Hein and grandfather of German writer Jakob Hein).\n\nRambert met her husband Ashley Dukes, a soldier on leave, at a dinner party in 1917. In Rambert's autobiography she says \"after four days of personal meetings, and seven months of correspondence we were married on 3 March 1918.\" This was done partly as a joke so that Dukes could get four weeks of extended leave instead of two days. Their marriage lasted 41 years, until he died in 1959; the couple had two daughters, Angela (1920–2006) and Helena. The poet, Aidan Andrew Dun, is her grandson.\n\nRambert began her dance training in her schooling early on. Subjects like foreign languages and history seemed to come easy; however she was a restless child and ended up getting bad marks because of her endless movements during class. At one point in her early training her dance instructor stated that 'In her, was the true spirit of dance.' She was unimpressed with the structure and performance of ballet, and was not drawn into dance as a passion until she became enthralled by Isadora Duncan when she attended one of Duncan's performances, and was 'profoundly moved by the beauty of Duncan's dance.'\n\nIn 1905, after becoming active in political riots, and the tragic day of May Day, Rambert's parents urged her at one point to move to Paris and take up medicine while safely living with her aunt and uncle who were also doctors. She attended a party where she danced a mazurka and danced it with such liveliness that there was applause afterwards; this was her first performance, whether she thought it or not. She met Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora, at this same party, who congratulated her on a wonderful performance, and again she was back into her passion for dance. She studied with Madame Rat from the Paris Opera, and later studied with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, at Dalcroze College who introduced her to eurhythmics.\n\nOne day at the Dalcroze College, Sergei Diaghilev, watched a class and then asked her to come back to Berlin and study with him in the Ballets Russes. There, Rambert aided them with figuring out Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" with Vaslav Nijinsky. She hesitantly accepted and collaborated with the Ballets Russes led by Diaghilev from 1912–1913. In Ballet Russes she was in the corps de ballet for ballet performances such as \"Swan Lake\", \"Giselle\", and \"Scheherazade\". After a tour with Nijinsky and Ballet Russes, Rambert's contract was not continued and she decided it was time for a new chapter. In 1914 she moved to the United Kingdom, and studied under Enrico Cecchetti.\n\nAfter studying with Cecchetti, she went back to study with Madame Rat at the Paris Opera, and took her studies quite seriously. She began teaching more ballet classes in 1919 and later founded her own ballet school in Bedford Gardens. In 1926 she created her own company, originally named Ballet Club. It has been through many name changes, much like Rambert herself. The company began performing at night revues in London. The first informal show was performed in \"Riverside Nights\" at the Lyric Theatre, and continued with the nightly revues for a while. She began finding new and promising dancers and choreographers in numerous places, such as Frederick Ashton, to be a part of her company and gave them a chance to grow. From Marie Rambert Dancers, the company changed to Ballet Rambert , later Rambert Dance Company, and from 2014 just named Rambert, a contemporary dance company which tours internationally. It dates its birth to the first performance of Frederick Ashton's \"A Tragedy of Fashion\" (1926), making it the first ballet company in Britain.\n\nAshley Dukes, Marie's husband, renovated a building and made it into Mercury Theatre, where the majority of Ballet Rambert's performance occurred. It was said that 'Notting Hill Gate, where the Mercury Theatre stood, was on the slopes of Olympus'. Ballet Rambert has performed such ballets as \"Coppelia\", as well as Balanchine's \"Night Shadow\". \n\nRambert was adamant about finding new and upcoming choreographers. Some of her students and later her colleagues included Ashton, Antony Tudor, and Agnes de Mille, to name a few. In 1965 Rambert, with the help of \"Norman Morrice, her newest discovery, completely reorganized the company to stress modern dance\". The repertoire of the company eventually came back to more contemporary ballets, but still has a vast list of pieces that the company has performed throughout the years. She cooperated with Millicent Hodson to restore Nijinsky's choreography of \"The Rite of Spring\" in 1979. The restoration of choreography was completed in 1987. Rambert is known for helping to create and keep the ballet community strong in Britain. \"The creation of Ballet in Britain is one of the grandest achievements in the artistic annals of our century. It is owed absolutely to the idealism which fired Rambert and Ninette de Valois\", the founder of The Royal Ballet. She was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1962 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate.\n\nShe died on 12 June 1982 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 17 June. Her ashes are within the Cloister Walk in section B.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After dancing with the Original Ballet Russe and the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, she and her husband settled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where in 1956 they founded the Tulsa Ballet and its associated school. It became a major regional company in the American Southwest and made its New York City debut in 1983. She is portrayed in the mural \"Flight of Spirit\" displayed in the Rotunda of the Oklahoma State Capitol building.\n\nEdna Moscelyne Larkin was born in Miami, Oklahoma in 1925, the only daughter of Eva Matlagova-Larkin, a young dancer from Russia, and Rueben Francis Larkin (1893–1974), an Eastern Shawnee-Peoria Indian. Her mother trained her in ballet until the girl was old enough to move to New York City to further her studies. There she studied under Vincenzo Celli, Mikhail Mordkin, and Anatole Vilzak-Shollar.\n\nIn 1941, at age 15, Larkin joined Colonel Wassily de Basil's Original Ballet Russe. She performed with the company in Europe and the Americas. While dancing with the company, Larkin met her future husband Roman Jasinski, a \"premier danseur\" from Poland.\n\nIn 1948, she achieved the rank of ballerina; she and her husband had both moved to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, directed by Serge Denham. Radio City Music Hall often showcased her as a prima ballerina. In 1954 Larkin toured Asia, performing in Alexandra Danilova's \"Great Movements in Dance\". She excelled in comical roles as a \"soubrette\". She played the can-can dancer in \"Gaîté Parisienne\". Agnes de Mille, the choreographer and dancer, admired Larkin's performance as the Cowgirl in Aaron Copland's \"Rodeo\", a role which was premiered by de Mille.\n\nLarkin married Roman Jasinski in 1943. After they had a son, Roman Larkin Jasinski, on February 21, 1954, they decided to retire from performing. They moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they created a ballet school and founded the Tulsa Civic Ballet (later known as the Tulsa Ballet). It became a major company in the Southwest and made its premier in New York in 1983. Larkin introduced area schoolchildren to ballet and also taught ballet to higher level students at the University of Tulsa.\n\nIn 1967, Quapaw-Cherokee composer Louis Ballard wrote the music for the ballet, \"The Four Moons\", for the Oklahoma Indian Ballerina Festival.

The first national competition was held in Washington, D.C. on November 5–6, 2009. More than $100,000 in prize money is awarded each year.\n\nThe National Bible Bee is sponsored by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation. Shelby Kennedy, who died of cancer at the age of 23, spent her life studying the Bible and proclaiming Christ. After her death, The Shelby Kennedy Foundation, was established as a non-profit in her name to encouraging children and youth to memorize Scripture.\n\nThe National Bible Bee promises large cash prizes for nine of the top-place finalists. Both the local and national competition involve oral and written tests. The goal of the Bible Bee is to encourage young people in the Christian faith, by becoming more biblically literate. Their vision is \"To know God's Word and make Him known.\"\n\nCompetition is divided into local and national levels. The local competition is not administrated directly by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, but rather by separate entities known as Hosts. Though these groups are not legally related to the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, they are the only source of finalists for the national competition.

All contestants participate in a preliminary round featuring both a written exam and an oral recitation round. The semi-finals feature the top 15 contestants from each division competing in a single-elimination recitation format for five spots in the final challenge round. The format for finals changed from the format used in previous years. Round 1 featured each of the 5 finalists reciting a passage from memory, with points deducted for errors. The maximum points for round 1 was 3,000 points. Rounds 2-5 were open-ended Bible knowledge questions where contestants were given 30 seconds to write their answer on an iPad tablet. Each question was worth 1,000 points. Round 6 again required contestants to recite a passage from memory worth 3,000 points. The total possible points for the final challenge round was 10,000 points, with winners being determined by their cumulative scores from all 6 rounds.

Its main focus is on primary schools. The company was started by seven professional friends and adopted its first schools in Lahore in 2010. Its chief executive officer is Omar Khayyam Sheikh.\n\nProgressive Education Network was founded by a group of seven friends, professionals, businessmen, and educators, who wanted to improve public education in Pakistan as a means of assisting people from the lower end of society. They decided to adopt existing schools rather than building their own, and studied models such as BRAC, Citizens Foundation and CARE. They incorporated the company as a non-profit with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984; it has been certified by the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy as adhering to best practices for non-profits. \n\nIn 2010 the company adopted its first schools, in Lahore, with a total of more than 6,000 students. Initially the founders and their friends funded it themselves; subsequently they developed sponsorship relationships with for-profit companies, including a Good Neighbor Program through which a company sponsors assistance to schools in its locality. They have declared a goal of improving the education of 1 million children throughout Pakistan by 2025. By January 2014, it had expanded to schools totaling almost 11,000 students in a number of locations in Pakistan, including Karachi, Gujrat and Muzaffargarh. , it had adopted 89 schools with almost 23,500 students and had signed an agreement to adopt 50 schools in Punjab.\n\nProgressive Education Network adopts state schools through a public-private partnership; it is one of several groups using this method to improve education in Pakistan.

This model assumes that a reader must learn to read in a hierarchical manner such that one skill must be mastered before learning the next skill (e.g., a child might be expected to learn the names of the letters in the alphabet in the correct order before being taught how to read his or her name). This approach often led to teaching sub-skills of reading in a decontextualized manner. This style of teaching made it difficult for children to master these early skills, and as a result, did not advance to more advanced literacy instruction and often continued to receive age-inappropriate instruction (e.g., singing the alphabet song).\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1970s, the education system shifted to targeting functional skills that were age appropriate for people with special needs. This led to teaching sight words that were viewed as necessary for participation in the school and community (e.g., \"exit\", \"danger\", \"poison\", \"go\"). This approach was an improvement to previous practices, but it limited the range of literacy skills that people with special needs developed.\n\nA newer model for reading development, specifically with regard to early reading development, is emergent literacy, sometimes referred to as early literacy, model. This model purports that children begin reading from birth, and that learning to read is an interactive process based on children’s exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered to be able to learn to read. Note that there is limited research regarding reading in special needs, but this article attempts to represent the most current evidence on this topic.\n\nLiteracy refers to both reading and writing skills, writing being the symbolic representation of language, and reading the cognitive process of decoding and understanding the written symbol system. These are very broad and basic definitions as the definitions of these terms often vary based on the model or approach.\n\nThere are multiple models and approaches of reading. A few are discussed below.\n\nThe Simple View of Reading was originally described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986 and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990. The Simple View suggests that the ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good listening comprehension (e.g., your ability to understand oral language). This model predicts four categories of readers. Readers with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved listening comprehension skills would be considered readers who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. Readers with poor listening comprehension skills are referred to as readers who are poor comprehenders. Readers with poor decoding skills and poor listening comprehension skills are considered poor readers, or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor readers. Readers who have good decoding and listening comprehension skills are considered typical readers.\n\nConnectionist models have emphasized an interconnected and interactive system of mappings between printed words (orthography), spoken sounds/words (phonology), and word meanings (semantics). The computation of these three codes (orthographic, phonologic, and semantic) is required for reading. According to Seidenberg and McClelland, one mechanism is involved in reading (including reading regular words, exception words, and nonwords). Through development, experience with meaningful words and spelling-sound correspondences allow one’s representation of semantics, orthography, and phonology to be modified. Developing representations of orthography, phonology, and semantics is an interactive process where development of one component influences and is influenced by the other components.\n\nThe dual-route approach suggests that two separate mechanisms, or routes, can be used in word reading. Words that follow spelling-sound rules (including regular words and nonwords that follow letter-to-sound rules) are processed through the nonlexical route. The nonlexical route follows a system of rules specifying the relationship between letters and sounds to process words. Conversely, exception words, or irregular words, that do not follow the spelling-sound rules are processed through the lexical route. The lexical route can be thought of as a dictionary lookup procedure.\n\nReading is a linguistic act. With this, some have applied the whole language philosophy to reading instruction. In the early 1990s, a movement for whole language encouraged educators to view learning to read as being similar to learning to talk. This philosophy emphasizes learning language and reading skills through meaningful experiences instead of through decontextualized rule teaching. Some other terms for this approach of reading instruction include literature-based instruction and guided reading.\n\nTo meet the recommendations of breadth and depth of literacy instruction set by the National Reading Panel (2000), many literacy programs incorporate four main components: guided reading, which focuses on comprehension skills though exposure to a wide range of literature experiences; word study, which incorporates phonics, phonemic awareness, and vocabulary instruction; self-selected reading, which provides children daily experiences in independent reading time; and writing, which focuses on both the mechanics of composition and on communicating effectively for multiple purposes (Foley & Stables, 2007).\n\nChildren with language difficulties are at increased risk for reading disorders or difficulties that can occur early on in preschool and continue on throughout development. This population includes children with language abilities that fall below expectations for their chronological age, at a clinical level or with weaknesses in language that are not severe enough to meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a language disorder.\nChildren with other disabilities can also have language impairments that can cause an increase risk of developing reading problems. Such disabilities include (but are not restricted to): Specific language impairment, phonological disorder, Language disorder, Developmental disability, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, Fragile x syndrome, and Cerebral palsy.\n\nPeople with severe speech difficulties can use Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. The importance and positive outcomes of literacy for people with language difficulties and AAC users are endless. As with everyone literacy opens doors to education, employment, and allows “individuals to exchange information, maintain interpersonal communication, to convey needs and wants and to develop channels of personal expression\". . However, for the AAC user literacy skills may be of even greater importance as reading and writing “allows individuals with severe speech impairments the opportunity to initiate topics, to develop ideas, to provide clarification, to communicate independently, to interact with a diverse audience, and to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings.” Unfortunately, even given the importance of literacy skills people who use AAC are often not given “authentic learning opportunities“ to learn literacy skills. . More research is needed on how to increase literacy instruction to people with severe speech difficulties and users of AAC.\n\nClassroom teachers are expected to provide the primary source of reading instruction for most students. Special education teachers may supplement the classroom instruction in reading and writing skills based on the independent performance of their students. Other professionals including a reading specialist, a speech-language pathologist, an educational or school psychologist, and an occupational therapist may also provide reading and writing support to individuals with reading and writing difficulties.\n\nIn general terms, individuals who have challenges in decoding are referred to as poor decoders. Dyslexia is a more specific disability where individuals demonstrate difficulty with decoding. Poor decoders have not acquired the basic knowledge of sound-letter correspondence rules, specifically phonological skills (skills that include identifying and manipulation of words, syllables, onsets, rimes, and phonemes -individual sounds). In addition, language abilities often evidence poor morphological and syntactic knowledge. Interventions that target decoding abilities may include instruction in phonics, phonological awareness, and phonemic awareness (also see Dyslexia intervention).\n\nSome individuals may have difficulty with reading rate, where they have accurate word recognition and often normal comprehension abilities, but reading speed that is typically one and a half years below grade level.\nStrategies that may improve reading rate include: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000;).\n\nIndividuals may also have trouble with reading fluency, or accurate, smooth, and appropriately paced reading with accurate expression.\nStrategies: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000).\n\nSome individuals may have skills within the normal range on the above factors but may still have trouble with reading comprehension. These individuals are often referred to as poor comprehenders, or individuals with a specific comprehension deficit. \nStrategies that can be used to improve reading comprehension include: building oral and auditory language skills, including skills in: vocabulary knowledge, narratives, listening comprehension, and figurative language. Additionally, when working toward increasing reading comprehension for specific texts, one can preteach vocabulary words and discuss prior knowledge on a topic related to the text before reading. (Also see reading comprehension for more strategies and information.)\n\nChildren can have difficulties in more than one of the areas previously listed.\n\nReading difficulties in special populations such as Downs syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy follow similar patterns of reading development and reading difficulty as described in the subgroups of reading problems section.\n\nIt has been found true for children with intellectual disabilities, such as children with Down syndrome, that phonological awareness skills are often deficient and require targeted teaching. For example, studies have found that children with Down syndrome show deficits in phonological awareness, and though they can develop such skills, often rely on sight word vocabulary knowledge rather than phonological awareness skills to decode words. Given this, it is recommended that phonological awareness skills be taught in a systematic manner with explicit instruction of how to use these skills when reading.\n\nChildren with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been identified as having particular difficulties with reading comprehension despite normal decoding abilities. Historically, those individuals who are especially good at decoding but have poor comprehension are considered to have hyperlexia. Not all individuals with autism, however, are poor comprehenders as there is a wide range of abilities in children on the spectrum. Despite the type of reader an individual with autism might be, individuals should be given the opportunity to learn to read.\nVery few studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions for reading for individuals with ASD.\nUsing computer-assisted instruction to implement programs for individuals with ASD that target skills in decoding could be an effective way to help improve these skills in these individuals. Procedural facilitation tasks such as prereading questions, anaphoric cuing, or a cloze task helped to improve reading comprehension with the anaphoric cuing task being the most effective task.\n\nChildren with cerebral palsy (CP) may or may not have motor speech impairments and/or language impairments, which can lead to reading difficulties. Often children with CP can be classified as having severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), but children with other disorders can fall into this category as well. Children with SSPI can be at increased risk for reading difficulties not only because they may have language impairments, but also because they can have limited literary experiences and limited reading instruction. Additionally, parents and teachers may have low expectations of the child’s ability to become a reader, which may influence experiences with text and impact literacy instruction. Assistive technology (also Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices; AAC) can be used to overcome physical barriers to manipulating books, and to augment speech motor and language difficulties (e.g., type, or select symbols to identify rhyming words), and cognitive impairments (to provide needed support required for target skill acquisition) (Copeland & Keef, 2007, see chapter 9). Of course, access to assistive devices is not sufficient for reading development. Appropriate reading instruction is required (e.g., instruction in phonological awareness skills, phonemic awareness skills, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, text comprehension, and book conventions), regularly conducted story reading sessions, constructive AT/AAC use to target literacy skills, high expectations of student literacy achievement, and text-rich environments have been found to be important for developing literacy skills in children with CP.\n\n^ Anderson, Mark, \"The WordPen Learning System\", Spring 2004\n"}

{"id": "53621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53621", "title": "Robert Venturi", "text": "Robert Venturi\n\nRobert Charles Venturi Jr. (June 25, 1925 – September 18, 2018) was an American architect, founding principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, and one of the major architectural figures of the twentieth century.\n\nTogether with his wife and partner, Denise Scott Brown, he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American-built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.\n\nVenturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so. Venturi is also known for having coined the maxim \"Less is a bore\", a postmodern antidote to Mies van der Rohe's famous modernist dictum \"Less is more\". Venturi lived in Philadelphia with Denise Scott Brown. He was the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.\n\nVenturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (née Luizi) Venturi and was raised as a Quaker. Venturi attended school at the Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Princeton University in 1947 where he was a member-elect of Phi Beta Kappa and won the D'Amato Prize in Architecture. He received his M.F.A. from Princeton in 1950. The educational program at Princeton under Professor Jean Labatut, who offered provocative design studios within a Beaux-Arts pedagogical framework, was a key factor in Venturi's development of an approach to architectural theory and design that drew from architectural history and commercial architecture in analytical, as opposed to stylistic, terms. In 1951 he briefly worked under Eero Saarinen in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and later for Louis Kahn in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Rome Prize Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner Denise Scott Brown. Venturi taught later at the Yale School of Architecture and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design.\n\nA controversial critic of the blithely functionalist and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was considered a counterrevolutionary. He published his \"gentle manifesto\", \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\" in 1966; in its introduction, Vincent Scully called it \"probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le Corbusier's \"Vers Une Architecture\" of 1923.\" The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing vernacular as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar (Michelangelo, Alvar Aalto) and then-forgotten (Frank Furness, Edwin Lutyens). He made a case for \"the difficult whole\" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples — both built and unrealized — of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.\n\nImmediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the Yale School of Architecture in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with Steven Izenour, led a team of students to document and analyze the Las Vegas Strip, perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable. In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, \"A Significance for A&P Parking Lots, or Learning from Las Vegas.\" It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as \"Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form\". This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes. The book coined the terms \"Duck\" and \"Decorated Shed,\" descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and John Rauch adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple \"decorated sheds\" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to the most influential.\n\nThe architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city. Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This \"inclusive\" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured—and possibly less functional and more simplistic—work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with \"impure\" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).\nVenturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married Denise Scott Brown on July 23, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in Manayunk, Philadelphia, was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1985. The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, Toulouse, and Japan.\n\nVenturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms. The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M. Stern, Rem Koolhaas, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Graham Gund and James Stirling, among others.\n\nVenturi was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects, The American Academy of Arts and Letters and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.\n\nVenturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He was 93.\n\nIn the wake of Venturi's death, Michael Kimmelman, the current architecture critic for the \"New York Times\", tweeted...\"RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time\".\n\nVenturi's notable students include Amy Weinstein and Peter Corrigan.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Upon graduation in 1940, he entered the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University to study bacteriology. He changed his mind, and decided to study medicine, later specializing in neuroscience. He applied for a summer fellowship during his first year of medical school and was accepted into the laboratory of Ernst and Berta Scharrer, where Palay carried out his first investigations. Palay's professional and personal association with the Scharrers continued throughout his career.\n\nAfter completing his M.D. degree in 1943, Palay spent a year as an intern at New Haven Hospital, while in the evenings continuing his research into neurosecretion at the Department of Anatomy at Yale University. At the end of his internship, he returned to Case Western Reserve, with appointments as a research and teaching fellow.\n\nErnst Scharrer suggested that Palay consider going to the Rockefeller Institute to work with Albert Claude, an early researcher into cell biology. However Palay was called up to serve with the Army Medical Corps in occupied Japan. This interrupted his scientific career, but he began a lifelong interest in Japanese art and culture.\n\nOn his return from the forces, Palay took Ernst Scharrer's advice and went to the Rockefeller Institute to work with Albert Claude. They spent a year examining salivary gland chromosomes by electron microscopy, using formvar replicas. This was one of the few means available at that time for examining biological specimens by electron microscopy.\n\nEventually Palay returned to Yale, where he was appointed first as an Instructor and then as an Assistant Professor of Anatomy, where he remained until his appointment as Chief of Neurocytology at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Later, he was promoted to the position of Chief of the Laboratory of Neuroanatomical Science, and while he was at the NIH, he continued his work on the ultrastructure of synapses, as well as studying neurosecretion and neuroglia.\n\nIn 1961, Palay accepted an invitation to become the Bullard Professor of Neuroanatomy at Harvard Medical School. A dominant figure in the field of the fine structure of the nervous system, Palay and his colleagues improved the quality of preservation of central nervous tissue by the introduction of a method to fix central nervous tissue by perfusion with osmic acid.\n\nHe and his wife Victoria Chan-Palay carried out detailed analyses of the cerebellum, and this work culminated in the publication of their book\n\"Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization\" (published in 1974). In 1970, he co-authored \"The Fine Structure of the Nervous System\" (with Alan Peters and Harry Webster) to serve as a guide in the analysis of electron micrographs of the nervous system; three editions have been published, the last one in 1991.\n\nAfter his retirement from Harvard, Palay accepted a position as Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence in the Department of Biology at Boston College. Even when his health began to decline, Palay taught until the spring of 2002; his students visiting his home for their seminars. He also served on several graduate student thesis committees during this period, and shared his expertise in neurocytology with the Biology Faculty at Boston College.\n\nIn 1980, he agreed to become the Editor-in-Chief of the \"Journal of Comparative Neurology\", which he edited for fourteen years; even after his retirement from Harvard in 1989, he continued as Editor-in-Chief, doing his work in the basement of his home in Concord.\n\nHe also served on the editorial boards of scientific\npublications as the \"Journal of Neurocytology\", the \"Journal of Cell Biology\", \"Neuroscience\",\n\"Brain Research\", \"Experimental Brain Research\", \n\"Experimental Neurology\" and \"Ultrastructural Research\".\n\n\n"}

To be legally defensible in the US, in particular for high-stakes assessments, and meet the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, a cutscore cannot be arbitrarily determined; it must be empirically justified. For example, the organization cannot merely decide that the cutscore will be 70% correct. Instead, a study is conducted to determine what score best differentiates the classifications of examinees, such as competent vs. incompetent. Such studies require quite an amount of resources, involving a number of professionals, in particular with psychometric background. Standard-setting studies are for that reason impractical for regular class room situations, yet in every layer of education, standard setting is performed and multiple methods exist.\n\nStandard-setting studies are typically performed using focus groups of 5-15 subject matter experts that represent key stakeholders for the test. For example, in setting cut scores for educational testing, experts might be instructors familiar with the capabilities of the student population for the test.\n\nStandard-setting studies fall into two categories, item-centered and person-centered. Examples of item-centered methods include the Angoff, Ebel, Nedelsky, and Bookmark methods, while examples of person-centered methods include the Borderline Survey and Contrasting Groups approaches. These are so categorized by the focus of the analysis; in item-centered studies, the organization evaluates items with respect to a given population of persons, and vice versa for person-centered studies.\n\nItem-centered studies are related to criterion-referenced tests and to norm-referenced tests.\n\n\nRather than the items that distinguish competent candidates, person-centered studies evaluate the examinees themselves. While this might seem more appropriate, it is often more difficult because examinees are not a captive population, as is a list of items.\nFor example, if a new test comes out regarding new content (as often happens in information technology tests), the test could be given to an initial sample called a beta sample, along with a survey of professional characteristics. The testing organization could then analyze and evaluate the relationship between the test scores and important statistics, such as skills, education, and experience. The cutscore could be set as the score that best differentiates between those examinees characterized as \"passing\" and those as \"failing.\"\n\n"}

It was originally a palace outbuilding called Taemyon (태묜).\n\nIn 1089, under the reign of King Munjong new official buildings were constructed.\n\nIts name was changed to Seonggyungam (성균감) in 1298.\n\nIn 1304 it was reestablished by Neo-Confucian scholar An Hyang who is considered the founder of Neo-Confucianism in Korea.\n\nThe name was changed to Seonggyungwan in 1308 under reign of King Chungnyeol.\n\nThe name was changed back to Gukjagam in 1358 during the reign of King Gongmin.\n\nIn 1362 the name was changed back to Seonggyungwan.\n\nAfter the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, King Taejo decided to relocate Sungkyunkwan to Hanyang, modern day Seoul, and also founded 360 Hyanggyos nationwide in July 1398, establishing a national education system.\n\nSungkyunkwan was established in Hanyang on September 25, 1398.\n\nA fire destroyed some buildings in 1400 which were rebuilt in 1407.\n\nIn 1418 King Taejong initiated a tradition for royal princes to enter Sungkyunkwan.\n\nDuring the reign of the tyrannical King Yeongsangun, Sungkyunkwan was turned into a personal pleasure ground. When he was deposed, it was restored to its former status.\n\nSungkyunkwan was rebuilt again in 1601 after many buildings were burnt down including the Munmyo area during the Japanese invasions (1592 - 1598).\n\nIn 1784, Byeokipjae (벽입재, 闢入齋) was destroyed by a fire. It is no longer present on the current campus grounds.\n\nIn 1869 there was a major renovation/restoration of the old campus.\n\nIn 1894 the Gabo Reform occurred which abolished the national state examinations during the reign of King Gojong.\n\nIn 1895, Sungkyunkwan was reformed into a modern three-year university.\n\nDuring the Colonial Era between 1910–1945, royal Sungkyunkwan was demoted to a private institution and renamed Gyunghakwon (경학원, 經學院), while Korean education was prohibited and Japanese education was forced nationwide.\n\nAfter Korea gained independence in 1945, Gyeonghakwon was renamed to Sungkyunkwan and with funding from Yurim (Confucians) nationwide, Sungkyunkwan University was established.\n\nDuring the Korean War (June 25, 1950 – July 27, 1953), much of the campus was destroyed. Daeseongjeon, however, remained.\n\nIn 1954 Gyeseongsa (계성사, 啓聖祠) was removed. Gyeseongsa was the shrine for the parents of the Confucian sages. It used to house the spirit tablets of the important family members of Confucian scholars.\n\nThe latest renovation/restoration occurred in 1988.\n\nThere was Japanese-style landscaping throughout the old campus left over from the Colonial Era that was eventually removed over the most recent decades to restore Sungkyunkwan to its original Joseon Era form.\n\n\nThere are also some buildings, structures, and features that were removed:\nThe institution's administrator had a government rank of sampum (삼품), with lower-ranking officials of Jwaeju (좨주), Akjeong (악정), Jikgang (직강), Baksa (박사), Hakjeong (학정), Haknok (학록), and Hagyu (학유) as supporting staff.\n\nThe old campus was designed based on geomancy. Sungkyunkwan was built with the mountains behind it to the north and the front facing south towards water (한강, Hangang, The Han River, and Bansu (반수), the creek that used to run around the front of the campus). This was based on superstition as well as function. The sunlight and wind patterns were considered most ideal when the buildings were arranged this way.\n\nThe buildings are constructed of red pine which was considered very special in the Joseon Dynasty and laypeople were forbidden from logging them. Korean aristocrats believed red pine represented the Confucian virtues of “fidelity” and “fortitude”. Today red pine is even mentioned in the South Korean national anthem “Aegukga” (애국가, 愛國歌).\n\nThe windows were made using window paper (한지, 韓紙, Hanji). The paper used was handmade from the inner bark of Paper mulberry which grows on rocky Korean mountainsides (닥). This was combined with the mucilage that oozes from the roots of Abelmoschus manihot which helps suspend the individual fibers in water. The hanji is made in laminated sheets using the we bal (외 발) sheet formation method allowing for a multi-directional grain. The finished sheets are then pounded using a method called dochim (도침) to compact the fibers and lessen ink bleed.\n\nThe stone platforms (기단, Gidan) used for several of Sungkyunkwan’s buildings are made of rectangular granite slabs fit together into a rectangular structure. The height of the platforms symbolizes the importance of the buildings. Much of the stonework from the original construction of the buildings remains exposed. There is also a sizeable percentage that is still present but has been buried beneath the structures due to time and renovations/reconstructions.\n\nPlatform stones (주춧돌, Juchutdol) are stones in which pillars rest on. They block humidity from the ground as well as bear the load of the pillars in order to efficiently redistribute the weight of the building to the ground.\n\nThe timber framed structures contain such components as:\nThe different types of pillars (기둥, Gidung) used are:\nThe types of wooden flooring are:\nThe floors of many of the buildings were equipped with ondol traditional radiant floor heating.\n\nThe buildings are painted based on the Korean art of painting buildings which is called Dancheong (단청) which means “red and green”. The incorporation of the five elements epitomizes ancient Korean’s desire for stability and peace in the present life and a rewarding afterlife. The brightly colored paint on buildings is not only for decoration, it is also for protecting the buildings from weather, rot, vermin, and evil spirits as well as emphasize the authority of their residents. The red-colored paint on Sungkyunkwan's buildings symbolizes nobility. Only the most important buildings are painted red. There are five basic colors: blue, red, black, white, and yellow which symbolize the five traditional elements. Blue means east, dragon, spring, and wood. Red means south, birds, summer, and fire. White means west, tiger, fall, and gold. Black means north, hyeonmu, winter, and water. Yellow means center, the periods between seasons, and Earth.\n\nThe roofs (Jibung, 지붕) are made of clay tiles (기와, Giwa) and are decorated with figurines called japsang (잡상). There is always an odd number of the smaller japsang. The most a building can have is 11. The purpose of the roof decorations goes back to the Korean shamanic religion and they are intended to chase away evil spirits and misfortune as well as show the dignity and grandeur of a building. The first few japsang on a roof are usually characters from the Chinese classic Journey to the West. The types of japsang are:\nThere are four types of roofs in Joseon Era architecture used at Sungkyunkwan which are matbae (맞배, gable), ujingak (우진각, hipped), paljak (팔작, hip-and-gable), and samo (사모, pyramid).\n\nCourtyards (안마당, Anmadang) were an important aspect of Joseon Dynasty architecture. They served a practical purpose of allowing large groups to congregate for meetings and activities. Beyond this, they fulfilled the Joseon aesthetic principle of the pure beauty of empty space. Korean buildings were designed to be in close harmony with nature which is reflected in many ways, none more so than in the use of courtyards, complete with trees and vegetation, within the walled-in areas.\n\nThe name signboards on structures (간판, Ganpan) are large wooden signs written in Hanja and served to identify them as well as display their importance. More important buildings had special names and their signs were larger and more decorative.\n\nThe windows (창문, Changmun) were made of wooden frames lined with hanji paper allowing for natural air to penetrate through the windows as well natural light to enter the room. The height and size of windows was based on the standard height and shoulder width of an adult person. The height of window frames was designed to be low enough to rest an elbow on but high enough to conceal a person lying down.\n\nThe primary written language of Sungkyunkwan was hanja. Although hangul was invented in 1443, it did not become the primary language of study because the literary elite believed that the difficult hanja was more sophisticated. Hangul was invented to solve the widespread illiteracy of the common people at the time, but it was considered a threat by many in the upper class to their status as literary scholars, leading them to resist its implementation. As a result, hanja remained the written language used at Sungkyunkwan requiring anyone who wished to rise to the top levels of the government to be capable of reading and writing the characters.\n\nSungkyunkwan's teachings were mainly Confucian-related, and were primarily aimed at preparing students for government service. Students also studied law, medicine, interpretation, accounting, archery, mathematics, music, and etiquette.\n\nThe main goal was for the students to pass the higher national civil-service examinations (\"gwageo\"). Like their Chinese counterpart, these examinations were on writing ability, knowledge of the Confucian classics, and proposals of management of the state (governance). Technical subjects were also included to appoint experts in medicine, interpretation, accounting, and law.\n\nPoetry was a big part of both the students’ studies and communication. It was viewed as noble and proof of the students’ high-born lineage. They were heavily encouraged to read and compose poetry.\n\nThe students were required to write lengthy essays on a regular basis that were subject to strict criticism from their instructors. The middle ten days of every month were dedicated to literary exercises. There were regular tests every 10 days and there were also daily quizzes.\n\nThe original set number of students was 150 when Sungkyunkwan was founded, which was raised to 200 in 1429. All of the students were male and women were forbidden from entering the campus.\n\nBooks on Buddhism and Taoism were banned.\n\nJoseon Era students attended Seodang from ages 5 or 6 where they learned rudimentary penmanship, basic essential skills, and the Chinese classics. The students’ education began with reading the \"Thousand Character Classic\". The teaching methodology emphasized rote learning by reading and memorizing an assigned passed each day. Once a student read something more than one hundred times, they would recite it to their teacher (훈장, Hunjang). At age 15 or 16 students entered hyanggyo or seowon (서원, 書院, Private primary school) for advanced studies targeted on passing examinations. They would study there for five or six years.\n\nEntrance examinations for Sungkyunkwan were extremely harsh and were only allowed for the sons of yangban, the Joseon Era upper class or royalty. There were two ways to be accepted into Sungkyunkwan. Either the students had to pass the two admission exams, Saeng-wonsi (생원시) and Jinsasi (진사시), or take the other two examinations, Seungbo (승보) and Eumseo (음서). If they passed these examinations, they were given the opportunity to be accepted.\n\nStudents lived very comfortably on full scholarship and were waited on by servants.\n\nStudents were informed of the time throughout the day by drum beats. One beat indicated the time to get up (6:00 AM every day), two beats meant it was time to dress neatly and read, and three beats meant it is meal time.\n\nIn the early morning, when the drum was sounded signaling the start of the day, students would prostrate themselves once before entering Myeongnyundang to receive a lecture on Confucianism.\n\nClasses were held at the Lecture Hall from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\n\nThe students were divided into 2 classes based on academic abilities\n\nIf students received low marks they were punished and publicly humiliated.\n\nStudents would sneak out after 10:00 PM to study more.\n\nStudents would sometimes appeal to the king about unjust decisions and if they were rejected they would stage political demonstrations, fast, or boycott classes.\n\nThe 8th and 23rd days of each month were washing days for the student’s clothing.\n\nThe students' uniforms were originally red then changed to sky blue to symbolize the endless spring of knowledge.\n\nThroughout the Joseon Era the students were divided into multiple political factions (붕당, 朋黨, Bungdang) that influenced the national politics and the study of Neo-Confucianism. Originally the Hungu faction was the most dominant and the more radical Sarim faction was often subject to violent purges to eliminate political opponents. Eventurally the Sarim became the dominant faction. The Sarim, however, split many times into smaller factions over the following centuries due to political in-fighting. The students at Sungkyunkwan would often play important roles in these political conflicts.\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty the highest aspiration those in the upper class could have was to be a seonbi (선비, Virtuous Scholar). They believed that the more important way to improve oneself was through continuious study while adhering to the principles of Confucianism. Much of this can still be seen in modern Korean culture's emphasis on the importance of education and respect for one's elders or superiors.\n\nThe requirements for graduation included:\n\nThe king, as a disciple before Confucius, would take off his royal robes and wear plain clothes before stepping into the courtyard of the Confucian Shrine. The kings would usually never set foot on the ground outside of the palaces anywhere but Sungkyunkwan.\n\nThe path between Sinsammun and Daeseongjeon was originally considered sacred and only for the spirits. People were not allowed to step on it or face punishment. Even today the Confucian keepers of the shrine bow before stepping on it.\n\nStudents were not allowed to have pets.\n\nAlcohol consumption was allowed within reason and students were sometimes given liquor or wine as a present.\n\nThe worst offense a student could commit, resulting in them not being allowed to take the state exams was not showing instructors proper respect or making disparaging remarks about them.\n\nThe students had the right to protest which they often did for various academic and political reasons.\n\nYi I, a famous Joseon scholar and politician is an alumnus and is featured on the 5,000 won bill.\n\nKing Sejong is an alumnus and is featured on the 10,000 won bill.\n\nShin Saimdang, Yi I's mother, is on the 50,000 won bill.\n\nChojip (초집) were how-to guide booklets used by cheaters.\n\nThe sodu (소두) was the chairman of a committee who would put forth appeals to the king.\n\nThe students' class list was called the cheonggeum nok (청금곡, 靑矜錄, Blue Robe Book).\n\nSungkyunkwan was featured prominently in the popular Korean drama \"Sunkyunkwan Scandal\".\n\n\n\n"}

Rancière uses the example of Joseph Jacotot, a French teacher in the late 18th century who taught in Belgium without knowledge of their language (Flemish), to explain the role of liberation after Marxism. The work expresses Rousseauist ideas, e.g. in the state of nature humans are morally good, and emphasizes that individual change precipitates societal change. Its arguments draw heavily from the French socialist party's debates on education during the 1980s. It was translated to English in 1991 by Kristin Ross.\n\nRancière's philosophy informs his writing style. Rancière tells the story of 18th century French teacher Joseph Jacotot without explicit commentary. Translator Kristin Ross sees the book as uniting Rancière's archival-narrative and polemical styles (xxiii). She considers that the book may be a satirical polemic against modern sociology, targeting specifically the sociologists Pierre Bourdieu, Rancière's teacher Louis Althusser, and Jean-Claude Milner (xxiii). The book is a historical moment intervening politically in the present; this is effected by Rancière blurring his voice with that of Jacotot (xxi-ii). Rancière's choice to write the book as a story reflects his rejection of explication, teaching and writing which presumes an intellectual inequality between the writer and reader (xxii). Translator Kristen Ross writes: \"The very act of storytelling, an act that presumes in its interlocutor an equality of intelligence rather than an inequality of knowledge, posits equality, just as the act of explication posits inequality\" (xxii). The book is equally relevant to history as to philosophy of education; in the U.S. Rancière is best known among historians (xxi).\n\nStultifying Master vs. Emancipatory Master\nThe explicator, \"having thrown a veil of ignorance over everything that is to be learned, he appoints himself to the task of lifting it\" (6-7). Only by concealing knowledge from the student is the explicator able to teach it. This makes the student dependent on the master.\nRanciere also calls this \"Enforced stultification\" (7). The emancipatory master, on the other hand, teaches students only that he has nothing to teach them. This emancipates students from their dependence on explicators. However, this does not mean no master is necessary (12). What is emancipation? \"We will call the known and maintained difference of the two relations-- the act of an intelligence obeying only itself even while the will obeys another will-- emancipation\" (13). In other words, the student's intelligence is not reliant on the master's, but the master's will strengthens the student's will, the student's self-confidence, to learn independently. \"To emancipate an ignorant person, one must be, and one need only be, emancipated oneself, that is to say, conscious of the true power of the human mind\" (15).\n\nLearned Master vs. Ignorant (School) Master\n\"It goes without saying that a scientist might do science without explicating it. But how can we admit that an ignorant person might induce science in another?\" (14). While exiled in Belgium, the French-speaking Jacotot taught Flemish-speaking students about the Télémaque using a bilingual French-Flemish translation (1-2). His students learned to intelligently read and write about the Télémaque in French, despite having no prior French instruction (2). Later, Jacotot taught other subjects that he didn't know anything about, including painting and the piano (15).\n\nThe Circle of Power\nA circle of powerlessness ties the student to the explicator of the old method (15). \"The circle of power, on the other hand, an only take effect by being made public\" (15). To break the circle of powerlessness, Ranciere argues that \"the circle of emancipation must be \"begun\"\" (16). This, for Rancière, calls for a return to original \"universal teaching,\" meaning learning something without any means of having it explained. \"In reality, universal teaching has existed since the beginning of the world, alongside all the explicative methods. This teaching, by oneself, has, in reality, been what has formed all great men\" (16).\n\nUniversal teaching\nJacotot's method \"was not a method for instructing the people; it was a benefit to be announced to the poor; they could do everything any man could. It sufficed only to announce it\" (18). Thus, for Rancière, emancipation becomes a political act of affirming and awakening the equal intelligence of all people. He writes: \"All men have equal intelligence\" (18)\n\nA review in \"French Studies\" wrote that the book would have a small audience outside France due to the specificity of its themes, the resurgence of right-wing politics, and growing unemployment in which few would have the leisure to pursue the inward dialogue Rancière recommends.\n\n"}

It was produced for the State of Connecticut Department of Americanization by the Worcester Film Corp., a company founded in 1918 in Worcester, Massachusetts.The film was rediscovered and preserved by Northeast Historic Film (NHF) a regional moving image archive in New England.\n\nAn enterprising young Italian who comes to America is forced to take a position as a day laborer, which is far below his ability and standard of living, solely because he cannot speak English. Even a laborer, however, must know the language of the country where he is employed, as Pete soon found to his cost. An unattended freight elevator, a sign in English that he could not read, a struggle of an instant, and then the hospital. It was a sadder and wiser man who came out a few weeks later. When he passed the post office, and a saw a sign in several languages calling upon foreigners to learn English, and to attend night school, he was prepared for the message that was destined to change the entire course of his life. Night school for Pete was the result. Anyone familiar with such work will experience anew the keen realization of what it means to the newcomer, the crowded roomful of eager listeners, trying so hard, following so patiently and docilely, the enthusiastic teacher's efforts, in short, the making of Pete. He now is able to secure a suitable position and rises rapidly.\n\n\nVintage Connecticut government reports on the making of the film and its dissemination, indicate that the film was shown to more than 112,500 people the year it was made, and that copies were sold to other states interested in Americanization programs. The film was targeted to industrial workers and contains location filming at the Hartford Rubber Works Company. The film was lost until 1999 when Alan Kattelle donated a film copy among a collection of other reels to Northeast Historic Film. The Kattelle print was on 28mm film stock, an extremely rare format that was primarily used for educational film distribution from 1913 to 1923.\n\nIn 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32160", "title": "University for Peace", "text": "University for Peace\n\nThe University for Peace (UPEACE) is an intergovernmental organization with university status, established by treaty in 1980 and having its main campus in Costa Rica. Its stated mission is \"to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations.\" The current Rector of UPEACE is Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena.\n\nThe creation of the University for Peace was set in motion by a treaty and endorsed by resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 of the United Nations General Assembly. By this Resolution, the UN General Assembly established an international commission which, in collaboration with the Government of Costa Rica, was requested to prepare the organization, structure and setting in motion of the University for Peace. Thereafter, by Resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980, the UN General Assembly endorsed the treaty establishing the University for Peace by adopting the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace (UPEACE) along with the Charter of the University for Peace. The University has the unique status of not only being a dedicated institution for higher education in Peace and Conflict studies, but also an international treaty body organization mandated by the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIt offers master's degree and doctoral programmes at its main headquarters in San José, Costa Rica, and carries out various activities related to the international peace and security objectives of the United Nations (UN) through centres and offices located in Addis Ababa, Geneva, New York, The Hague, and South Korea, and through partnership arrangements with numerous other institutions worldwide.\n\nThe University for Peace is part of the academic wing of the UN system, and has observer status at the UN General Assembly, while maintaining its independence in academic, financial and management matters. The UN Secretary-General is the Honorary President of UPEACE. The UN General Assembly maintains a constant interest in the activities of UPEACE, and in periodic resolutions calls on the UN Secretary-General to report to it on its activities. Accordingly, the UN Secretary-General reports to the General Assembly of the UN periodically on the progress of UPEACE. The Council of the University for Peace is the supreme authority of the University. It is composed of five \"ex-officio\" members viz. the Rector, two representatives designated by the UN Secretary-General and by the Director-General of the UNESCO, the Rector of the United Nations University, two representatives designated by the Government of the host country and the Chancellor of UPEACE. In addition, the Council comprises ten representatives of the academic community or other persons eminent in the field of peace and security appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN in consultation with the Director-General of the UNESCO.\n\nThe University has \"unique world-wide authorization to award academic degrees, recognized by all countries which are members of the General Assembly\". In addition, its MA programs in the Department of Environment, Peace and Development, received official accreditation from SINAES (the national Costa Rican accreditation body) in 2014. Similarly, the MA programme in International Law and Human Rights, and the MA programme in International Law and the Settlement of Disputes received accreditation from SINAES in June 2016. On the other hand, the fact that UPEACE offers unique MA programs that cannot be found anywhere else in the world means that it is the best and only choice for those who want to study the specific fields of Peace Education; Gender and Peacebuilding; Media, Peace and Conflict Studies; Responsible Management and Sustainable Development; etc.\n\nThe University for Peace has its headquarters in Costa Rica, a country distinguished by a long tradition of democracy. Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, H.E. Oscar Arias Sánchez was awarded The Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation - not to mention the friendly locals. The main campus of the University - the Rodrigo Carazo Campus - is located 30 km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.\n\nThe closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is Ciudad Colon. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.\n\nThe Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its Masters programmes and its recently announced Doctoral programme are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly multi-cultural environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished faculty, that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an academic calendar that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering distance education courses, including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.\n\nThe University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The UPEACE Centre for Executive Education delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.\n\nThe University has also established the UPEACE Human Rights Centre which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of universal human rights. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.\n\nThe Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the Earth Charter Initiative, whose stated mission is \"to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, universal human rights, respect for diversity, economic justice, democracy, and a culture of peace.\" This mission is carried out using 'The Earth Charter' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter. The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.\n\nIn addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.\n\nAfrica\n\nAs a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.\n\nThe University for Peace (UPEACE) established its Africa Programme in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa.
