{"id": "10232105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10232105", "title": "Aplia", "text": "Aplia\n\nAplia Inc. is an educational technology company founded in 2000 by Stanford University professor Paul Romer that offers online homework products geared toward college-level courses. In March 2007 Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired Aplia Inc. Aplia was based in Belmont, California until March 2014, when it relocated to Cengage Learning's new Mission Bay, San Francisco office.\n\nIn 1998, Romer created an online experiment system for use in his economics courses at Stanford University so his students would come to class better prepared and become more engaged with the course material. After other professors expressed interest in his approach, Romer decided to turn this system into the basis for a new company. He raised $10 million in venture capital to start Aplia, an online learning system. Since 2000, it has been used by over 4,300 professors, 1,200,000 students, at 1,300 colleges and universities worldwide.\n\nAplia’s basic product includes online homework assignments that professors can assign to students in accounting, business communication, business law, developmental reading, economics, finance, marketing, philosophy, statistics, and taxation. While the basic premise behind each course is the same, course materials vary; in many cases, Aplia problem sets are designed to complement specific textbook from a variety of publishers.\n\nAplia support representatives set up and edit courses per the professor's schedule. Assignment types include problem sets, news analyses, tutorials, and (for economics) interactive market experiments.\n\nAplia is often integrated with textbooks from different publishers. Aplia's questions are written by content experts in their respective fields and the problem sets match the tone, difficulty level, style, of the textbook. Aplia works with publishers, authors, and contributors, and many users believe the quality is decent.\n\nIn terms of pricing, many of Aplia's products have a low-cost digital textbook as well as Aplia. In the Friday, May 9 issue of \"The Washington Post\", author Steven Pearlstein writes: \"Aplia also paves the way for the textbook industry to ditch a lousy business model in which it has to charge ridiculously high prices for new books because it cannot collect anything from the students who buy them on the used-book market. Instead, publishers could move to a more sustainable model in which the textbook is priced close to the cost of printing and shipping (say, $20), while all students are charged a reasonable fee (say, $60) for what really matters, which is the content of the textbook, the labs and homework exercises.\"\n\nResearch has also shown Aplia to be less effective in the classroom for students who require an indepth relationship with the teacher. Studies are surfacing to find online learning to be another challenge that students must overcome in order to learn a subject they might be unfamiliar with. Some anecdotal evidence has been found that schools administration have found value in the micromanagement software features that Aplia offers, especially with keeping students on track with their assignments and increasing engagement and participation in the classroom.\n\nChapter assignments (or problem sets)--groups of questions based on each chapter of a textbook—are automatically graded and provide students with explanations for every question. All problems are randomized and written by a team of subject matter experts. Most assignments use \"Grade It Now\" technology. Students are given three attempts on each problem; if they don't like their score after their first attempt, they may try a second time; if they don’t like their score after two, they may try a third; they don't have to use all three attempts. Scores are averaged.\n\nIn economics and finance, Aplia regularly features economics and finance articles from new sources. Each story includes a summary and follow-up questions.\n\nFor economics, Aplia offers real-time, online market experiments to help students understand what the real market environment is like. Each experiment is supported by assignments that prepare students for this and help them analyze their results. These experiments have had proven success in the classroom as well—according to research, Aplia's methods provide college students with means to truly learn the material.\n\nAll of Aplia's courses use multimedia to pique students' interest. Developmental Reading, for instance, uses audio so students can hear how vocabulary words are pronounced; Logic uses interactive Venn diagrams, truth tables, and natural deduction proofs so students keep learning the material hands-on.\n\nAplia keeps instructors informed about student participation, progress, and real-time graphical reports. Instructors can download, save, manipulate, print, import, and export student grades. Gradebook Analytics allow instructors to monitor and address performance on a student-by-student and topic-by-topic basis.\n\nInstructors can post announcements, upload course materials, host student discussions, e-mail students, and manage their gradebook with Aplia’s course management system. Aplia works independently or in conjunction with other course management systems.\n\nStudents are charged (per course) additional registration fees on top of their home institutions tuition or per unit fees. This may amount to more than the parent institution's total cost for the entire course when including materials fees. This has been regarded by some to be a \"troubling lack of transparency regarding the total net costs associated with getting a college degree.\"\n\nIn 2015 several employees were asked to gather in the main conference room where a tactic of \"psychological divide and conquer\" separated the employees into the first of many days and weeks of learning that not only was their job being sent overseas that they would be shadowed by their replacement whom they would train.\n\nOne employee told Computer World \"The employees were warned that speaking to the news media meant loss of severance\" Once the story broke the company ignored media contacts and plowed ahead on a double down strategy of cutting costs and pressuring employees vs focusing on a total quality management strategy that was recommended by members of the Board and its Founder.\n"}

She is an active member of the Tulsa community, volunteering to tutor homeless children, distribute food, and work with women in crisis. Brown founded The Chloe House in 2006, a transition home for women that provides housing, training for employment, and resources to help them re-enter society. She is also a licensed minister and was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nChloe L. Brown was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and grew up in the historic Greenwood District. The church played a large role during her childhood, as her father was a minister and would host church services in their home. Brown's mother highly valued education and insured that her children value the institution equally. From this early influence, Brown was determined to become and educator and developed an early passion for the profession. The first school Brown attended was John Burroughs Elementary. Brown's was the first class to integrate John Burroughs, though she does not have explicit negative memories of strained race relations. Brown eventually graduated from Booker T. Washington High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in education from Langston University in 1975. Brown was the first in her family to graduate from college.\n\nBrown also holds a master's degree in Elementary Education Administration from Northeastern State University.\n\nBrown taught her first class at Cooper Elementary School with Dr. Joann Bell. Later, Brown was the first African-American teacher at Eliot Elementary School in Tulsa, one of the elementary schools that fed into Cascia Hall and Monte Cassino. After spending several years at Eliot, Brown moved for a brief time to North Dallas and taught there for three years. Upon returning to Tulsa, Brown was promoted to the administrative level, but soon after she happily returned to the classroom after her brief time in administration and teaches at McClure Elementary School.\n\nOutside of the classroom, Brown found a passion for helping the homeless and more specifically, rehabilitating incarcerated women. Brown and her husband created the Chloe House in 2006, a transition home that aided the reintegration of incarcerated women into society by providing housing and training for employment. She is also a member of the Greenwood Christian Center and is a licensed minister.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, Chloe L. Brown officially launched her campaign for Tulsa Public Schools Board District 2, vowing to bring her 44 years of experience from a lifelong career educating Tulsa children and empowering them to become lifelong learners. “Right now our children and educators need leadership on our school board from experienced teachers. During the span of my 44 year career in public education, I have taught in a variety of schools all over Tulsa. I know firsthand the basic needs of our children, as well as the essential tools our educators need to empower them to succeed,” said Brown. “I will fight for our children and teachers every day.” Election day is Tuesday, February 14, 2017.\n\n"}

It uses a \"value-added\" outcome model to examine a college or university's contribution to student learning which relies on the institution, rather than the individual student, as the primary unit of analysis. The CLA measures are designed to test for critical thinking, analytic reasoning, problem solving, and written communication skills. The assessment consists of open-ended questions, is administered to students online, and controls for incoming academic ability. An institution's average score on the CLA measures correlates highly with the institution's average SAT score (r = 0.90). Institutional results are not published.\n\nThe CLA was first launched in 2000 by the Council for Aid to Education (CAE), a national nonprofit organization based in New York City. Rather than testing for specific content knowledge gained in particular courses or majors, the intent was to assess “the collective and cumulative result of what takes place or does not take place over the four to six years of undergraduate education in and out of the classroom. Of the entire test, the most well-developed and sophisticated part is its performance task component, in which students are given ninety minutes to respond to a writing prompt that is associated with a set of background documents. The testing materials, including the documents, are accessed through a computer. CAE has published several examples of representative performance tasks, one of which is described below (from Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses):\n\nCAE also publishes its scoring rubric. The design of both the prompts and the criteria for evaluation demonstrates the CLA's focus on complex, holistic, real-world problem-solving as a measurement of high level learning. As a result, the argument goes, institutions that attempt to “teach to the test” will be schools that teach students “to think critically, reason analytically, solve problems, and communicate clearly.\"\n\nAgain according to \"Academically Adrift\", there are four primary criticisms of the CLA. Two criticisms relate to the validity of the instrument:\n\n\nTwo other criticisms relate to the normative implications of the CLA:\n\n\nVoluntary System of Accountability—an initiative developed by American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) and the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC) for 4-year public colleges and universities. The VSA endorses the use of the CLA for reporting out student learning outcomes through the College Portrait.\n\n"}

The Agency’s mission is to help member countries improve the quality and effectiveness of their inclusive provision for all learners.\n\nAll European countries are committed to working towards ensuring more inclusive education systems. They do so in different ways, depending on their past and current contexts and histories. Inclusive education systems are seen as a vital component within the wider aspiration of more socially inclusive societies that all countries align themselves with, both ethically and politically.\n\nThe ultimate vision for inclusive education systems is to ensure that all learners of any age are provided with meaningful, high-quality educational opportunities in their local community, alongside their friends and peers.\n\nThe Agency has a mandate from its member countries to facilitate collaboration regarding country priorities that are in line with the European Council priorities as identified in the ET 2020 strategy and in accordance with international agreements, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe Agency was established in 1996 as an initiative of the Danish Ministry of Education. The Agency Secretariat is based in Odense, Denmark and the Agency has an office in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThrough its activities the Agency facilitates the collection, processing and transfer of European level and country specific information in the area of inclusive education, and it provides opportunities for sharing different types of knowledge and experiences. \n\nAt present the Agency has 31 member countries: Austria, Belgium (Flemish and French speaking communities), Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). \n\nAgency activities work towards the ET 2020 strategic objective ‘promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship’. In line with this objective, the main focus of the Agency’s work is upon inclusive education and the characteristics of provision for all learners, in particular those who are vulnerable to marginalisation and exclusion, such as students with disabilities and/or special educational needs.\n\nBy analysing and identifying key factors that hinder or support positive developments, the Agency provides member countries with recommendations and guidelines for policy and practice and then shares information about the reality of inclusive education across Europe.\n\nIn its activities, the Agency focuses on priorities established by member countries within the framework of its annual and multi-annual work programmes. Annual reports presenting an overview of annual activities are available online.\n\nAll thematic projects focus upon issues of common concern for policy makers for special needs and inclusive education. The topics to be examined within thematic projects are identified via a systemic collection of information on the priorities countries have.\n\nPriority topics include early childhood intervention, assessment in inclusive settings, teacher education for inclusion, vocational education and training, ICT for inclusion, information accessibility and data collection in the field on SNE.\n\nThis is a list of Agency projects categorised under thematic sub-groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation from project activities is summarised on the Agency website and in printed form in various formats such as final project reports, summary flyers, country reports and study visit reports. Main project outcomes are translated in all the Agency official languages, a total of 25 languages. All materials on the Agency website are free to download.\n\nDetailed information on each Agency member country’s legal system, financing, the identification of special educational needs, special needs education within the education system, and teacher training is summarised in the National Organisation of Provision section of the Agency website.\n\nIn addition to thematic projects, the Agency organises special events, dissemination conferences, round table discussions, thematic sessions and other events. These events are an opportunity to raise awareness, share information on priority areas and facilitate networking for participants.\n\nTwo of the four Parliament Hearings for young people took place in the European Parliament in 2003 and in 2011, and one in the Portuguese Parliament in 2007. The last Hearing from October 2015 entitled ‘Inclusive Education: Take Action! Luxembourg Recommendations’ was an official event of the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union. \n\nThese events were organised for young people with and without disabilities in order to provide them an opportunity to express their views about inclusive education and to reach policy-makers. Results from the Hearings have been presented to key decision makers at both national and European levels for their consideration and further action.\n\nThe Agency was established in 1996 as an initiative of the Danish Ministry of Education, at the end of the EC programme Helios II. Representatives from the ministries of education from the 15 member countries of the European Union, as well as Norway and Iceland, supported the initiative as a means of furthering their co-operation in the field of special needs and inclusive education.\n\nThe first phase of the Agency’s existence was a three-year trial period that ran until the end of July 1999 and was largely funded by the Danish authorities. The Secretariat was therefore established in Odense, Denmark. The European Commission, through the Directorate General for Education, provided financial support to projects.\n\nMinistries of education of the member countries ensured that the work of the Agency was beneficial for that country through the nomination of appropriate people appointed to work with the Agency. These are the Representative Board member, the National Co-ordinator and national experts.\nStarting August 1999 all the member countries took an equal governance of the Agency. In 1999 another Agency office was established in Brussels.\nThe European Commission continued to support concrete Agency activities aimed at analysing and disseminating key information in the field of special needs education across Europe as well as supporting and disseminating information relating to the Socrates programme.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2001 the Agency’s work focused on creating a platform for co-operation at European level through the national networks built up in all countries as well as through its website.\n\nIncreased budgetary support during 2002, mainly via the budget line approved by the European Parliament, facilitated more stable and long-term development of the Agency’s activities. The Agency benefited from an operating grant from 2002 until 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the Agency was included in the Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, this decision provided a legal basis for the Agency and ensured the provision of an operating grant until 2006.\n\nBy this time the work was focused on firmly consolidating and strengthening the Agency’s position as the platform for co-operation at European level. Co-operation activities took place with European and international organisations. The Agency website was expanded and national networks were extended in all countries through the involvement of nominated national experts participating in the Agency projects.\n\nThe Agency now has 30 member countries. Since 2007 it has welcomed Slovenia and the Slovak Republic as member countries. The newest member is Bulgaria, who joined in 2017.\n\nSince 2007 the Agency has been one of six European institutions supported with an operating grant under the Jean Monnet initiative within the EU Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and similarly under the Jean Monnet initiative within the new EU Erasmus+ education programme (2014-2020).\n\nIn terms of thinking, implementation and language usage, the concept ‘special needs education’ has shifted towards ‘inclusive education’. Similarly, the way of thinking about learners’ needs has moved from the concept of ‘special educational needs’ towards ‘additional needs’.\n\nIn 2014 the Agency changed its name from \"European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education\" to European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, as member country representatives believe that the new name represents better the Agency’s views and mission.\n\nThe Agency maintains active working relationships with other specialist European organisations working in the field of inclusive and special needs education as well as with key international bodies and organisations in the education sector, such as UNESCO and its institutes (International Bureau of Education /IBE, and International Institute for Information Technologies in Education/ITTE), the UNICEF CEE/CIS regional office, the OECD, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank.\n\n"}

FSU has operating a broad curriculum program in Panama City of the Republic of Panama for over 50 years. The campus, located by the Miraflores Locks of the Panama Canal, provides students with many facilities, including the largest English-language library in the Republic of Panama, computer facilities, research facilities, student housing, and athletic facilities. The student population is generally international and comes from the United States, the Republic of Panama and other countries.\n\nThe first campus was established in 1957 and served as an academic institution where U.S. military and Zonians located in the Panama Canal Zone could continue their education while staying in Panama.\n\nIn the 1990s, the university was located in the Albrook 808 Building in a former U.S. Army Air Force station. Courses on international affairs, computer science, psychology, and economics were given. Most of the students were U.S. citizens or relatives. After Albrook was reverted to the Panamanian state, FSU moved to the Chino Panameno School, giving classes at night for people who worked from 1997-1999.\n\nThe campus had various locations in Panama City, but was for many years located in \"La Boca\" (The Mouth), near the mouth of the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal.\n\nIn summer 2009, the campus relocated to the \"Ciudad del Saber\" or the City of Knowledge, a reverted area which was previously a U.S. Army base, Fort Clayton, but was closed in 1999 per the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.\n\nIn fall 2013, the satellite campus began offering a master's degree in International Affairs.\n\nMany students take part in FSU's \"2+2\" program, whereby after completing two years of study at FSU Panama, they can receive in-state tuition at the main campus in Tallahassee.\n\nThere are a few degrees which can be completed fully at FSU Panama:\n\n\nThese programs are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).\n\nFSU Panama has its own student government association as well as its own student newspaper, the \"FSU Pananole\". There are many other clubs and groups, such as the Mandarin Club and the Environmental Club.\n\n\n"}

It was a fort surrounded by almost 1000 telephone poles in the style of a fort from the Old West. Outdoor education was delivered there and Fort Roosevelt became a nationally-recognized model for environmental education in schools. The fort included a wildlife rehabilitation center that served the entire San Joaquin Valley. As a tourist attraction, it drew 30,000 visitors a year. The facility was started by then-principal Jim Parks beginning in the late 1960s. Heidi Arroues was the fort's facilitator from 1983 to 2005. \n\nIn 2005, the Hanford Elementary School District's board of trustees decided not to make needed repairs to Fort Roosevelt and the fort was demolished despite public opposition. The board was actually \"strong armed\" into destruction of the beloved Fort by Rebecca Presley, the Superintendent of the elementary school district at the time. She waged an unscrupulous heavy handed campaign involving attorneys and land developers which ultimately doomed the Fort. If it had not been for the historical classification of the train station that had been part of the Fort, it also would have been destroyed at her whim. Immediately after the demolition of the Fort, Ms. Presley, having been investigated no less than three times by the CA Grand Jury, retired and moved to Seattle, WA; ostensibly to be close to her children.\n\nA film called \"Fort Roosevelt Requiem\" has been made by filmmaker David Dibble who had experienced the fort as a child.\n\n"}
{"id": "8294130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8294130", "title": "Freedom and Culture", "text": "Freedom and Culture\n\nFreedom and Culture is a book by John Dewey. Published in 1939, the book is an analytical defense of democracy written in a time when democratic regimes had recently been replaced by non-democratic ones, and at a time when Marxism was considered a powerful political force.\n\nAccording to Dewey, human nature is the result of many forces, many of which are culturally determined. Attempts have been made to explain human behavior as being primarily motivated by love of freedom, or by pursuit of self-interest, or by the pursuit of power, or being primarily determined by economic conditions. All of these are products of their times and their inevitable falsification results in a backlash, de-emphasizing the formerly over-emphasized factor.\n\nAccording to Dewey, freedom had been associated with individuality by some people and with rationality, or law, by others. It has also been associated with the farming class by some people and with capitalists by others. Individualism (or liberty) and social control (or law) have been proposed as two extremes between which freedom has to navigate. In reality, the individual and the social forces interact in various ways, rather than being two distinct extremes.\n\nTherefore, for individuals to be free, appropriate social conditions must exist. Democratic conditions do not automatically maintain themselves and they cannot be mechanically prescribed in a constitution. Dictatorships exist not only through coercion but also by appealing to certain idealistic elements in people, such as solidarity or the appeal of sharing in the creation of a new system.\n\nPublic education and press free from government control can be as much a tool for totalitarianism as they are a tool for democracy. They surround the citizens, who in a modern state do not have direct contact with the events that affect them, with \"ready made intellectual goods\", making them susceptible to propaganda.\n\nAccording to Dewey, the leaders of the American rebellion against the British were motivated by restrictions placed on industry and trade and by high taxation. This was rationalized into the idea that all government not self-imposed is foreign to human nature and human rights. This simple theory of democracy was a product of the simple conditions under which it was formulated: There is a widespread desire in human nature for personal freedom - release from dominion over personal beliefs and conduct. The main threat to freedom is the tendency of government officials to extend their power. Therefore, guarantees against abuse of government power are enough to guarantee freedom. This idea is very influential in the U.S.\n\nA view that economic development is having an anti-democratic effect and should be controlled by government is more modern and its existence is an indication that conditions have changed dramatically. Conditions have become more complex, and impersonal forces have been set in motion on unprecedented scale, resulting in loss of personal control over the personal situation. Modern conditions have rendered the assumed harmony between liberty and equality invalid. Also, the tendency toward organization by both labor and capital, that is inherent in economic development, was seen in the original democratic theory as an anti-democratic force.\n\nThe loss of control motivates both the working class and the capitalists to embrace totalitarian means in the hope of improving security, and distrust of organized labor and capital pushes the public to give more power, as a counterbalance, to a would-be dictator. Can existing institutions be used to cope with modern problems? Socialists who favor non-revolutionary means suggest regulation of industry or ownership of industry by government. Theory and practice, however, do not show that the resulting situation is essentially different from that of capitalism, leaving the question of how to reconcile modern conditions with democracy open.\n\nThis chapter is a critique of monistic Marxist theory in vogue at the time the book was written. Marxism asserts that social activities and relations are determined solely by economic conditions, rejecting other factors, associated with human behavior, as having any influence. Original Marxist qualification to this position, allowing that existing social structures can have influence on subsequent events, is removed.\n\nBeyond economic determinism, Marxism states that all social change is the result of class warfare, which moves the workers toward liberation from past subjugation, and finally creates a classless society. This law is an economic paraphrase of the Hegelian dialectic idealism, in which conflict between ideas results in synthesis and harmony.\n\nMarxist theory was a creature of its time, a time when intellectual thought was dealing with social development (or \"evolution\"), causal necessity, Hegelian philosophy, economically based ideologies and the search for social theories. Marxism is dated by its search for unifying causality, since while the idea of unifying causality was typical of mid 19th century science, it was abandoned in later scientific thought, to be replaced by the idea of invariance, which describes how different phenomena relate to each other, rather than ascribe a single cause for all phenomena.\n\n\"The inherent theoretical weakness of Marxism is that it supposed a generalization that was made at a particular date and place (and made even then only by bringing observed facts under a premise drawn from a metaphysical source) can for continued resort to observation, and to continual revision of generalizations in their office of working hypotheses.\"\n\nAcceptance of Marxism was supported by its discussion of contemporary social phenomena - the struggle between capitalists and factory workers, and economic cycles and concentration. In both its structure and in its attraction based on addressing pressing social issues, Marxism is similar to a religious ideology.\n\nIn the USSR, monistic Marxist theory has been accompanied by the anti-scientific devices of one party control of all communications and persecution of dissenters. Power has been given to a small group to apply the theory in specific cases, giving that group absolute coercive power derived from the absolute principle.\n\nThis occurrence demonstrates that popular representation, multiple parties and constant criticism of government encourage freedom. Despite the influence of economic factors in politics, these formal devices allow interplay of various tendencies whose result is greatly better than that of a monistic idea.\n\n\"We cannot continue the idea that human nature when left to itself, when freed from external arbitrary restrictions, will tend to the production of democratic institutions that work successfully... We have to see that democracy means the belief that humanistic culture \"should\" prevail; we should be frank and open in our recognition that the proposition is a moral one- like any idea that concerns what \"should\" be.\"\n\n\"Science through its physical and technological consequences is now determining the relations between human beings. If it is incapable of developing moral techniques which will also determine these relations, the split in modern culture goes so deep that not only democracy but all civilized values are doomed. A culture that permits science to destroy traditional values but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself.\"\n"}
{"id": "764313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=764313", "title": "Georges Canguilhem", "text": "Georges Canguilhem\n\nGeorges Canguilhem (; ; 4 June 1904 – 11 September 1995) was a French philosopher and physician who specialized in epistemology and the philosophy of science (in particular, biology).\n\nCanguilhem entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1924 as part of a class that included Jean-Paul Sartre, Raymond Aron and Paul Nizan. He aggregated in 1927 and then taught in lycées throughout France, taking up the study of medicine while teaching in Toulouse.\n\nHe took up a post at the Clermont-Ferrand based University of Strasbourg in 1941, and received his medical doctorate in 1943, in the middle of World War II. Using the pseudonym \"Lafont\" Canguilhem became active in the French Resistance, serving as a doctor in Auvergne.\n\nBy 1948 he was the French equivalent of department chair in philosophy at Strasbourg as well. Seven years later, he was named a professor at the Sorbonne and succeeded Gaston Bachelard as the director of the Institut d'histoire des sciences, a post he occupied until 1971, at which time he undertook an active emeritus career.\n\nIn 1983 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. In 1987 he received the \"médaille d'or\", awarded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS).\n\nCanguilhem's principal work in philosophy of science is presented in two books, \"Le Normal et le pathologique\", first published in 1943 and then expanded in 1968, and \"La Connaissance de la vie\" (1952). \"Le Normal et la pathologique\" is an extended exploration into the nature and meaning of normality in medicine and biology, the production and institutionalization of medical knowledge. It is still a seminal work in medical anthropology and the history of ideas, and is widely influential in part thanks to Canguilhem's influence on Michel Foucault. \"La Connaissance de la vie\" is an extended study of the specificity of biology as a science, the historical and conceptual significance of vitalism, and the possibility of conceiving organisms not on the basis of mechanical and technical models that would reduce the organism to a machine, but rather on the basis of the organism's relation to the milieu in which it lives, its successful survival in this milieu, and its status as something greater than \"the sum of its parts.\" Canguilhem argued strongly for these positions, criticising 18th and 19th century vitalism (and its politics) but also cautioning against the reduction of biology to a \"physical science.\" He believed such a reduction deprived biology of a proper field of study, ideologically transforming living beings into mechanical structures serving a chemical/physical equilibrium that cannot account for the particularity of organisms or for the complexity of life. He furthered and altered these critiques in a later book, \"Ideology and Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences\".\n\nCanguilhem was originally hostile to the ideas of Henri Bergson and vitalism but was later influenced by them and developed his own \"idiosyncratic brand of vitalism.\"\n\nMore than just a great theoretician, Canguilhem was one of the few philosophers of the 20th century to develop an approach that was shaped by a medical education. He helped define a method of studying the history of science which was practical and rigorous. His work focused on the one hand on the concepts of \"normal\" and \"pathological\" and, on the other, a critical history of the formation of concepts such as \"reflex\" in the history of science. Canguilhem was also a mentor to several French scholars, most notably Foucault, for whom he served as a sponsor in the presentation of \"Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique\" (\"History of Madness\") for the \"Doctorat d'État\" and whose work he followed throughout the latter's life.\n\nAs Inspector General and then President of the Jury d'Agrégation in philosophy, Canguilhem had a tremendous and direct influence over philosophical instruction in France in the latter half of the twentieth century and was known to more than a generation of French academic philosophers as a demanding and exacting evaluator who, as Louis Althusser remarked, believed he could correct the philosophical understanding of teachers by bawling them out. This belief did not prevent him from being regarded with considerable affection by the generation of intellectuals that came to the fore in the 1960s, including Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, and Jacques Lacan. Althusser once wrote to his English translator that \"my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable\" (italics in the original, from \"Economy and Society\" 27, page 171). Likewise, Foucault, in his introduction to Canguilhem's \"The Normal and the Pathological\", wrote:\n\nTake away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as Bourdieu, Castel, Passeron and what marks them so strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the movement of '68, it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.\n\nDerrida recalled that Canguilhem advised him early in his career that he would have to distinguish himself as a serious scholar before he could exhibit professionally the particular philosophical sense of humour for which he is at turns famous and notorious, advice which Derrida seemed to have taken in earnest.\n\nAfter years of neglect, a great deal of Canguilhem's writings have been translated into English. Among them are a collection of essays entitled \"A Vital Rationalist\" and his most celebrated work, \"The Normal and the Pathological\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7179708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7179708", "title": "Grade inflation", "text": "Grade inflation\n\nGrade inflation is used in two senses: (1) grading leniency: the awarding of higher grades than students deserve, which yields a higher average grade given to students (2) the tendency to award progressively higher academic grades for work that would have received lower grades in the past.\n\nThis article is about grade inflation in the second sense. Higher grades in themselves do not prove grade inflation and many believe there is no such problem. It is also necessary to demonstrate that the grades are not deserved.\n\nGrade inflation is frequently discussed in relation to education in the United States, and to GCSEs and A levels in England and Wales. It is also an issue in many other nations, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, South Korea and India.\n\nLouis Goldman, professor at Wichita State University, states that an increase of .404 points was reported from a survey in 134 colleges from 1965 to 1973. A second study in 180 colleges, showed a .432 GPA increase from 1960 to 1974, both indicating grade inflation. \nStuart Rojstaczer, a retired geophysics professor at Duke University, has collected historical data from over 400 four-year schools, in some cases dating back to the 1920s, showing evidence of nationwide grade inflation over time, and regular differences between classes of schools and departments.\n\nHarvey Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard University, argues that just denying the existence of grading inflation at Harvard proves that the problem is serious. He states that students are given easy grades by some professors to be popular, and these professors will be forgotten; only the ones challenging students will be remembered.\n\nMain historical trends identified include:\nThe average at private schools is currently 3.3, while at public schools it is 3.0. This difference is partly but not entirely attributed to differences in quality of student body, as measured by standardized test scores or selectivity. After correcting for these factors, private schools grade on average 0.1 or 0.2 points higher than comparable public schools, depending on which measure is used.\n\nThere is significant variation in grading between different schools, and across disciplines. Between classes of schools, engineering schools grade lower by an average of 0.15 points, while public flagship schools grade somewhat higher. Across disciplines, science departments grade on average 0.4 points below humanities and 0.2 points below social sciences. While engineering \"schools\" grade lower on average, engineering \"departments\" grade comparably to social sciences departments, about 0.2 points above science departments. These differences between disciplines have been present for at least 40 years, and sparse earlier data suggests that they date back 70 years or more.\n\nUntil recently, the evidence for grade inflation in the US has been sparse, largely anecdotal, and sometimes even contradictory; firm data on this issue was not abundant, nor was it easily attainable or amenable for analysis. National surveys in the 1990s generally showed rising grades at American colleges and universities, but a survey of college transcripts by a senior research analyst in the U.S. Department of Education found that grades declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s. Data for American high schools were lacking.\n\nRecent data leave little doubt that grades are rising at American colleges, universities and high schools. An evaluation of grading practices in US colleges and universities written in 2003, shows that since the 1960s, grades in the US have risen at a rate of 0.15 per decade on a 4.0 scale. The study included over 80 institutions with a combined enrollment of over 1,000,000 students. An annual national survey of college freshmen indicates that students are studying less in high school, yet an increasing number report high school grades of A− or better. Studies are being made in order to figure out who is more likely to inflate grades, and why an instructor would inflate a grade.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the grade inflation prevalent at many top US institutions, Princeton began in the autumn of 2004 to employ guidelines for grading distributions across departments. Under the new guidelines, departments have been encouraged to re-evaluate and clarify their grading policies. The administration suggests that, averaged over the course of several years in an individual department, A-range grades should constitute 35% of grades in classroom work, and 55% of grades in independent work such as Senior Theses. These guidelines are enforced by the academic departments. Since the policy's inception, A-range grades have declined significantly in Humanities departments, while remaining nearly constant in the Natural Science departments, which were typically at or near the 35% guideline already.\n\nIn 2009, it was confirmed that the policy implemented in 2004 had brought undergraduate grades within the ranges targeted by the initiative. In 2008–09, A grades (A+, A, A−) accounted for 39.7% of grades in undergraduate courses across the University, the first time that A grades have fallen below 40% since the policy was approved. The results were in marked contrast to those from 2002–03, when As accounted for a high of 47.9% of all grades.\n\nDeflation has varied by division, with the social sciences and natural sciences largely holding steady for the last four years. During that period, A grades have ranged from 37.1 to 37.9% in the social sciences and from 35.1 to 35.9% in the natural sciences. In the humanities and engineering, where deflation has been slower, 2008–09 brought significant movement. A's accounted for 42.5% of grades in the humanities last year and 40.6% of grades in engineering, both down two percentage points compared to 2007–08. In the period from fall 2006 through spring 2009, the most recent three-year period under the new grading policy, A's accounted for 40.1% of grades in undergraduate courses, down from 47.0% in 2001–04, the three years before the faculty adopted the policy. The 2006–09 results also mark continued deflation from those reported a year ago, when A's accounted for 40.4% of undergraduate grades in the 2005–08 period. In humanities departments, A's accounted for 44.1% of the grades in undergraduate courses in 2006–09, down from 55.6% in 2001–04. In the social sciences, there were 37.7% A grades in 2006–09, down from 43.3% in 2001–04. In the natural sciences, there were 35.6% A grades in 2006–09, compared to 37.2% in 2001–04. In engineering, the figures were 41.7% A's in 2006–09, down from 50.2% in 2001–04.\n\nGrade inflation is often equated with lax academic standards. For example, the following quote about lax standards from a Harvard University report in 1894 has been used to claim that grade inflation has been a longstanding issue: \"Grades A and B are sometimes given too readily—Grade A for work of no very high merit, and Grade B for work not far above mediocrity. ... insincere students gain passable grades by sham work.\" Issues of standards in American education have been longstanding. However, rising grades did not become a major issue in American education until the 1960s. For example, in 1890 Harvard's average GPA was 2.27. In 1950, its average GPA was 2.55. By 2004, its GPA, as a result of dramatic rises in the 1960s and gradual rises since, had risen to 3.48.\n\nHarvard graduate and professor Harvey Mansfield is a longtime vocal opponent of grade inflation at his alma mater. In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that \"the most frequent grade is an A\", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, \"I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade\". In response, Nathaniel Stein published a satirical \"leaked\" grading rubric in \"The New York Times\", which included such grades as an A++ and A+++, or \"A+ with garlands\". In his 2001 article in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", Mansfield blames grade inflation on affirmative action and unqualified African American students: \"I said that when grade inflation got started, in the late 60's and early 70's, white professors, imbibing the spirit of affirmative action, stopped giving low or average grades to black students and, to justify or conceal it, stopped giving those grades to white students as well.\" He also claimed that he did not have figures to back up his claims, but he is convinced that grade inflation began with African American students getting grades which were too high. \"Because I have no access to the figures, I have to rely on what I saw and heard at the time. Although it is not so now, it was then utterly commonplace for white professors to overgrade black students. Any professor who did not overgrade black students either felt the impulse to do so or saw others doing it. From that, I inferred a motive for overgrading white students, too.\"\n\nThe University of Alabama has been cited as a recent case of grade inflation. In 2003, Robert Witt, president of the university, responded to criticism that his administration encouraged grade inflation on campus by shutting down access to the records of the Office of Institutional Research, which, until that year, had made grade distribution data freely available. It is however, still available on the Greek Affairs website. The Alabama Scholars Organization, and its newspaper, the \"Alabama Observer\", had been instrumental in exposing the situation and recommending that the Witt administration adopt public accountability measures. The paper had revealed that several departments awarded more than 50 percent \"A\"s in introductory courses and that one department, Women's Studies, handed out 90 percent \"A\"s (the vast majority of those being \"A+\"). Grades had grown consistently higher during the period examined, from 1973 to 2003.\n\nUC Berkeley has a reputation for rigorous grading policies. UC Berkeley College of Engineering departmental guidelines state that no more than 17% of the students in any given class may be awarded A grades, and that the class GPA should be in the range of 2.7 to 2.9 out of a maximum of 4.0 grade points. Some departments, however, are not adhering to such strict guidelines, as data from the UCB's Office of Student Research indicates that the average overall undergraduate GPA was about 3.25 in 2006. Other campuses have stricter grading policies. For example, the average undergraduate GPA of UC San Diego is 3.05, and fewer students have GPA > 3.5 in science majors. UC Irvine's average GPA is 3.01.\n\nA small liberal arts college in New Hampshire, Saint Anselm College has received national attention and recognition for attempting to buck the trend of grade inflation seen on the campuses of many American colleges and universities. At Saint Anselm, the top 25% of the class has a 3.1 GPA; the median grade at the college is around a 2.50 GPA. Some professors and administrators believe that inflating grades makes it harder for students to realize their academic strengths and weaknesses and may encourage students to take classes based on grade expectation. The practice also makes it harder for parents and students to determine whether or not the grade was earned. Because of this, at Saint Anselm College, a curriculum committee was set up in 1980 to meet with the academic dean and review the grading policies on a monthly basis. This committee fights the practice of inflation by joining the administration and faculty in an effort to mend them into a working force against grade inflation. The former president of the college, Father Jonathan DeFelice, is quoted as saying, \"I cannot speak for everyone, but if I'm headed for the operating room, I will take the surgeon who earned his or her \"A\" the honest way,\" in support of Saint Anselm's stringent grading system.\n\nOther colleges such as Washington and Lee University, University of Rochester, Middlebury College, The College of William and Mary, Fordham University, Swarthmore College, Bates College, Cornell University, the University of Chicago and Boston University are also known for their rigorous grading practices. However, data indicate that even schools known for their traditionally rigorous grading practices have experienced grade inflation and these claims may now be overstated. Washington and Lee had an average GPA of 3.27 in 2006 and Swarthmore's graduates had a mean GPA of 3.24 in 1997. At some schools there are concerns about different grading practices in different departments; engineering and science departments at schools such as Northwestern University are reputed to have more rigorous standards than departments in other disciplines. To clarify the grades on its graduates' transcripts, Reed College includes a card, the current edition of which reports that \"The average GPA for all students in 2013–14 was 3.15 on a 4.00 scale. This figure has increased by less than 0.2 of a grade point in the past 30 years. During that period, only eleven students have graduated from Reed with perfect 4.00 grade averages.\" Wellesley College implemented a maximum per-class grade cap of 3.33 in 2004, though professors could award a higher average grade by filing a written explanation. Grades lowered to comply with the cap, and student evaluations of professors also lowered. The number of students majoring in economics increased and other social sciences decreased though this may have been part of larger general trends at the time.\n\nA January 7, 2009 article in the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" used the term \"grade inflation\" to describe how some people viewed a grading policy in the Pittsburgh public school district. According to the article, the policy sets 50% as the minimum score that a student can get on any given school assignment. The article also stated that some students said they would rather get a score of 50% than do the school work.\nA March 2, 2009 follow-up article in the same newspaper said that the policy had been amended so that students who refuse to do the work will receive a grade of zero, and that the minimum grade of 50% will only apply to students who make a \"good-faith effort\". A March 3, 2009, article in the same newspaper quoted Bill Hileman, a Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers staff representative, as saying, \"The No. 1 problem with the 50 percent minimum was the negative impact on student behavior.\" The same article also said that the school district was planning to adopt a new grading scale in at least two schools by the end of the month. The article stated that under the original grading scale, the minimum scores required to earn an A, B, C, D, or F, were, respectively, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 0%. Under the new 5-point grading scale, the minimum scores required to earn an A, B, C, D, or F would be changed, respectively, to 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.\n\nJames Côté and Anton L. Allahar, both professors of sociology at the University of Western Ontario conducted a rigorous empirical study of grade inflation in Canada, particularly of the province of Ontario. Up until the 1960s, grading in Ontario had been borne out of the British system, in which no more than 5% of students were given As, and 30% given Bs. In the 1960s, average performers in Ontario were C-students, while A-students were considered exceptional. As of 2007, 90% of Ontario students have a B average or above. In Ontario, high school grades began to rise with the abolition of province-wide standardized exams in 1967.\n\nThe abolition of province-wide exams meant that student marks were entirely assigned by individual teachers. In 1983, 38% of students registering in universities had an average that was higher than 80%. By 1992, this figure was 44%. According to the Council of Ontario Universities, 52.6% of high school graduates applying to Ontario universities in 1995 had an A average. In 2004, this figure had risen 61%. In 1995, 9.4 percent of high school graduates reported an A+ average. In 2003, this figure had risen to a high of 14.9%. The average grade of university applicants was 80% in 1997, and this percentage has steadily increased each year since.\n\nIn 2004, Quebec's McGill University admitted that students from Ontario were given a higher cutoff grade than students from other provinces, because of concerns about grade inflation originating from the fact that Ontario does not have standardized provincial testing as a key component of high school graduation requirements.\n\nIn 2007, the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies released a report on grade inflation in Atlantic Canada. Mathematics scores in New Brunswick francophone high schools indicate that teacher-assigned marks are inflated in relation to marks achieved on provincial exams. It was found that the average school marks and the average provincial exam were discordant. When looking at marks for school years 2001–2002 to 2003–2004, it was found that school marks in all 21 high schools were higher than the provincial exam marks. The provincial average for school marks is 73.7% while the average for provincial exams marks is 60.1% over the three years. School marks in all 21 high schools were higher than the provincial exam marks.\n\nIn the context of provincial exams and teacher assigned grades, grade inflation is defined as the difference between the teacher-assigned marks and the results on a provincial exam for that particular course. It was found that higher grade inflation points to lower provincial exam results. Of the 21 high schools, École Marie-Gaëtane had the highest grade inflation, at 24.7%. With a provincial exam average of 52.3% this school is also the least achieving school in the province. In contrast, schools Polyvalente Louis-J-Robichaud, Polyvalente Mathieu-Martin, École Grande-Rivière and Polyvalente Roland-Pépin had the lowest grade inflation with values ranging from −0.7% to 9.3%. They were the four top performing schools on the grade 11 mathematics provincial exams. Similar results were found for Anglophone New Brunswick high schools, as well as for Newfoundland and Labrador schools. Despite the high marks assigned by teachers, Atlantic Canadian high school students have consistently ranked poorly in pan Canadian and international assessments.\n\nIn 2008, in British Columbia, the University of Victoria (UVic) and the University of British Columbia (UBC) reduced the number of Grade 12 provincial exams that high school students were required to write in order to gain admission to those universities. Prior to 2008, high school students applying to UVic and UBC were required to write 4 provincial exams, including Grade 12 English. In 2008, this standard was reduced so that students were only required to write the provincial exam for Grade 12 English. A UVic administrator claimed that the rationale for this reduction in standards is that it allows the university to better compete with central Canadian universities (i.e. Ontario and Québec universities) for students, and prevent enrollment from falling. Universities in central Canada do not require high school students to write provincial exams, and can offer early admission based on class marks alone. A Vancouver high school principal criticized the change in requirements by charging that it would become difficult to detect grade inflation. The president of the University Presidents' Council of British Columbia also criticized the move and said the provincial exams are \"the great equalizer\". The British Columbia Teachers Federation supported the change because in the past some students avoided certain subjects for fear that poor marks on provincial exams would bring down their average.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Simon Fraser University (SFU) changed its requirements so that high school students only need to pass the English 12 provincial exam. Previously, students were required to pass 4 provincial exams, including English 12, in order to apply. This change brought SFU into line with UVic and UBC. Administrators claimed that this reduction of standards was necessary so that SFU could better compete with UBC and UVic for students. The change was criticized on the ground that it leads to \"a race to the bottom\".\n\nAs of 2007, 40% of Ontario high school graduates leave with A averages – 8 times as many as would be awarded in the traditional British system. In Alberta, as of 2007, just over 20% of high school graduates leave with an A average. This discrepancy may be explained that all Alberta high school students must write province-wide standardized exams, Diploma exams, in core subjects, in order to graduate.\n\nThe Alberta Diploma exams are given in grade 12, covering core subjects such as biology, chemistry, English, math, physics and social studies. The exams are worth 30 percent of a grade 12 student's final mark. Quebec also requires its students to write Diploma Exams for graduating students. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia have similar tests. British Columbia has a mandatory English proficiency test in grade 12, provincial tests in other subjects are optional.\n\nAlberta's focus on standardized exams keeps grade inflation in check, but can put Albertan high school students at a disadvantage relative to students in other provinces. However, Alberta has the highest standards in Canada and produces students who are among the best in international comparisons. By preventing grade inflation, Albertan high schools have been able to greatly ameliorate the problem of compressing students with different abilities into the same category (i.e. inflating grades so that a student in the 98th percentile, for example, cannot be distinguished from one in the 82nd percentile).\n\nIn relation to grade inflation at the university level, the research of the aforementioned Professors Côté and Allahar concluded that: \"We find significant evidence of grade inflation in Canadian universities in both historical and comparative terms, as well as evidence that it is continuing beyond those levels at some universities so as to be comparable with levels found in some American universities. It is also apparent that the inflated grades at Canadian universities are now taken for granted as normal, or as non-inflated, by many people, including professors who never knew the traditional system, have forgotten it, or are in denial\".\n\nA 2000 study of grade patterns over 20 years at seven Ontario universities (Brock, Guelph, McMaster, Ottawa, Trent, Wilfrid Laurier and Windsor) found that grade point averages rose in 11 of 12 arts and sciences courses between 1973–74 and 1993–94. In addition, it was found that a higher percentage of students received As and Bs and fewer got Cs, Ds and Fs.\n\nA 2006 study by the Canadian Undergraduate Survey Consortium released earlier in 2007 found students at the University of Toronto Scarborough got lower marks on average than their counterparts at Carleton and Ryerson. Marking, not ability, was determined to be the reason.\n\nIn 2009 a presentation by Greg Mayer on \"Grade Inflation at the University of Waterloo\" reported that grade inflation was occurring there. The study initially stated that there was \"no consensus on how Grade Inflation is defined ... I will define GI as an increase in grades in one or more academic departments over time\".\nFrom 1988/89 to 2006/07 it was determined that there had been an 11.02% increase in undergraduate A grades, with the rate of increase being 0.656% per year.\nIn 100 level Math for the year 2006/07, the grade distribution of 11,042 assigned grades was: 31.9% A, 22.0% B, 18%C, 16.3% D, 11.8% F. In 400 level Fine Arts courses for 2006/07, the distribution of 50 assigned grades was: 100% A.\nIn relation to increased scores in first-year mathematics, there was no evidence of better preparedness of UW students. A possible source of grade inflation may have been pressure from administrators to raise grades. A case was documented in which a math dean adjusted grades without the consent or authorization of the instructor.\n\nWhen comparing the 1988–1993 school years with that of the years from 2002–2007, it was discovered that the percentage of As assigned in 400 levels in the Faculty of Arts had risen as follows for every department (first figure is percentage of As for 1988–1993 years, second is percentage of As for 2002–2007 years): Music 65%/93%, Fine Art 51%/84%, Sociology 54%/73%, History 66%/71%, Philosophy 63%/69%, Anthropology 63%/68%, Drama 39%/63%, Political Science 46%/57%, English 43%/57%, French 39%/56%, Economics 36%/51%, Business 28%/47%, Psychology 80%/81%. It is important to note that this study examined only 400-level courses and conclusions regarding grade inflation should not be generalized to courses at other levels.\n\nAnnual grade inflation has been a continuing feature of the UK public examination system for several decades. In April 2012 Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual, the UK public examinations regulator, acknowledged its presence and announced a series of measures to restrict further grade devaluation.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium the percentage of pupils obtaining 5 or more good GCSEs has increased by about 30%, while independent tests performed as part of the OECD PISA and IES TIMSS studies have reported Literacy, Maths and Science scores in England and Wales having fallen by about 6%, based on their own tests\n\nIn September 2009 and June 2012, \"The Daily Mail\" and \"The Telegraph\" respectively reported that teenagers' maths skills are no better than 30 years ago, despite soaring GCSE passes. The articles are based on a 2009 paper by Jeremy Hodgen, of King's College London, who compared the results of 3,000 fourteen-year-olds sitting a mathematics paper containing questions identical to one set in 1976. He found similar overall levels of attainment between the two cohorts. The articles suggest rising GCSE scores owe more to 'teaching to the test' and grade inflation than to real gains in mathematical understanding.\n\nBetween 1975, with the introduction of the national alphabetic grades to the O-Level, and the replacement of both the O-Level and CSE with the GCSE, in 1988, approximately 36% of pupils entered for a Mathematics exam sat the O-Level and 64% the CSE paper. With grades allocated on a normative basis with approximately ~53% (10% A, 15% B, 25–30% C) obtaining a C or above at O-Level, and 10% the O-Level C equivalent Grade 1 CSE; a proportion being entered for neither paper. The percentage of the population obtaining at least a grade \"C\" or equivalent in maths, at O-level, remained fixed in 22–26% band.\n\nNote: Historically an:\n\nWith the replacement of the previous exams with the GCSE and a move from a normative to a criterion referencing grade system, reliant on examiner judgement, the percentage obtaining at least a grade C, in mathematics, has risen to 58.4%, in 2012.\n\nAn analysis of the GCSE awards to pupils achieving the average YELLIS ability test score of 45, between 1996–2006, identified a general increase in awards over the 10 years, ranging from 0.2 (Science) to 0.8 (Maths) of a GCSE grade.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the incorporation of GCSE awards into school league tables, and the setting of School level targets, at above national average levels of attainment, may be a driver of GCSE grade inflation. At the time of introduction the E grade was intended to equivalent to the CSE grade 4, and so obtainable by a candidate of average/median ability; Sir Keith Joseph set Schools a target to have 90% of their pupil obtain a minimum of a grade F (which was the 'average' grade achieved in 1988), the target was achieved nationally in summer of 2005. David Blunkett went further and set schools the goal of ensuring 50% of 16-year olds gained 5 GCSEs or equivalent at grade C and above, requiring schools to device a means for 50% of their pupils to achieve the grades previously only obtained by the top 30%, this was achieved by the summer of 2004 with the help of equivalent and largely vocational qualifications. Labelling Schools failing if they are unable to achieve at least 5 Cs, including English and Maths at GCSE, for 40% of their pupils has also been criticised, as it essentially requires 40% of each intake to achieve the grades only obtained by the top 20% at the time of the qualifications introduction.\n\nA number of reports have also suggested the licensing of competing commercial entities to award GCSEs may be contributing to the increasing pass rates, with schools that aggressively switch providers appearing to obtain an advantage in exam pass rates.\n\nIn response to allegations of grade inflation, a number of schools have switched to other exams, such as the International GCSE, or the International Baccalaureate middle years programme.\nSource: Joint Council for General Qualifications via Brian Stubbs.\n\nNote:\nNote:\n\nSources: Hansard, DfEGender and education: the evidence on pupils in England, Brian Stubbs, Expanding Higher Education in the UK, Comparing Educational Performance, by C Banford and T Schuller, School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA 1996a) GCSE Results Analysis: an analysis of the 1995 GCSE results and trends over time\n\nBetween 1963 and 1986 A-Level grades were awarded according to norm-referenced percentile quotas (A <= 10%, B = 15%, C = 10%, D = 15%, E = 20%, O/N = 20%, F/U >= 10% of candidates). The validity of this system was questioned in the early 1980s because, rather than reflecting a standard, norm referencing might have simply maintained a specific proportion of candidates at each grade. In small cohorts this could lead to grades which only indicated a candidate's relative performance against others sitting that particular paper, and so not be comparable between cohorts (e.g., if one year, only 11 candidates were entered for A-Level English nationally, and the next year only 12, this would raise doubt whether the single A awarded in year one was equivalent to the single A awarded in year two). In 1984 the Secondary Examinations Council decided to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, wherein grades would be awarded on \"examiner judgement\". The criteria referencing scheme came into effect in June 1987, and since its introduction examiner judgment, along with the merger of the E and O/N grades and a change to a resitable modular format from June 2002, has increased the percentage of A grade awards from 10 to >25%, and the A-E awards from 70 to >98%.\n\nIn 2007 Robert Coe, of Durham University, published a report analysing the historic A-Level awards to candidates who'd obtained the average norm-referenced ALIS TDA/ITDA test scores, he noted:\n\nThis suggests that a candidate rejected with a U classification in mathematics in 1988 would likely be awarded a B/C grade in 2012, while in all subjects a 1980s C candidate would now be awarded an A*/A.\n\nThe OECD noted in 2012, that the same competing commercial entities are licensed to award A-Levels as GCSEs (see above).\n\nAn educationalist at Buckingham University thinks grades inflate when examiners check scripts that lie on boundaries between grades. Every year some are pushed up but virtually none down, resulting in a subtle year-on-year shift.\nSources: JCQ statistics for: 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007,\n2006, 2005/4 and BBC News,a, also the Guardian, and , and \n\nNote: norm* – June 1963 – 1986 grades allocated per the norm-referenced percentile quotas described above.\n\nThe Higher Education Statistics Agency gathers and publishes annual statistics relating to the higher qualifications awarded in the UK. The Students and Qualifiers data sets indicate that the percentage of \"GOOD\" first degree classifications have increased annually since 1995. For example, 7% of all first-degree students who graduated in the academic year 1995/96 achieved first class honours; by 2008/09 this had risen to 14%.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2011, the proportion of upper second class honours awarded for first degree courses increased from 40.42% to 48.38%, whilst lower second class honours dropped from 34.97% to 28.9%. The number of third class honours, \"ordinary\" (i.e. pass), and unclassified awards dropped substantially during the same period.\nDuring this time, the total number of first degrees awarded in the UK increased by 56%, from 212,000 to 331,000.\n\nGrade inflation in UK universities appears to be caused by administrators wishing to improve their league table standings, a desire to attract non-European students who can be charged full fees, academics who fear receiving unfavourable course evaluations from students, the breakdown of the external examiner system, and a growing indifference towards academic dishonesty and plagiarism.\n\nNote: The doubling of institutions and quadrupling of student numbers, following the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, makes any direct comparison of pre and post 1995 awards non trivial, if not meaningless.\nSource: ,\nSource: Sunday Times Good University Guide, 1983–4 (1st Ed), 1984–5 (2nd Ed), 2006, 2008, 2012\n\nSource: Higher Education Statistics AgencyUniversities' Statistical Record, 1972/73-1993/94 : Undergraduate Records\n\nBetween 2005 and 2016 the proportion of students receiving an honor in the general baccalauréat doubled.\n\nIn CBSE, a 95 per cent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent today as it was in 2004, and a 90 per cent close to nine times as prevalent. In the ISC Board, a 95 per cent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012. CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue “artificial spiking of marks”. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 per cent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more — 10 times higher than in 2004 — and almost 6 per cent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.\n\n\n\n\nGrade inflation is a specific instance of a broader phenomena of ratings or reputation inflation where rating decisions are made by individuals. This has been occurring in peer-to-peer services such as Uber.\n\n\n\n"}

GSA does this by creating peer-to-peer forums, exchanging resources, offering original programs and curriculum, and connecting youth to nature. The sustainability coordinators that participate in the network are composed of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and other school decision makers.\n\nThe GSA was formed in October 2007 as a result of Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg’s PlaNYC and related challenge to all NYC facilities to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2050, with support from the NYC Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI), Consolidated Edison, National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and National Business Officers Association (NBOA).\n\nThe Allen-Stevenson School in NYC hosted the first GSA planning session that convened schools to address climate change and \"what schools can do about it\", and review the GSA Commitment. With additional guidance from the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), Second Nature and AASHE, the GSA primary and secondary school climate dommitment was further refined. In November 2007, with a signatory group of 40 schools, the GSA was launched to the public at the US Green Building Council annual GreenBuild Conference when President Bill Clinton highlighted the GSA in his keynote speech. It is currently listed as one of the organizations committed to the Climate Education and Literacy Initiative launched by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)\n\nThe 501c3 nonprofit organization now connects more than 9,000 schools, districts, and organizations worldwide, representing more than 5 million students in 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 88 countries. Schools are participating individually or and as entire school districts to share sustainability best practices and reduce their environmental footprint. In January 2016, 21 school districts formed the Green Schools Alliance District Collaborativewhich will harness the collective power of schools to support greener, more efficient solutions. These districts will build and share best practices, leverage their combined purchasing power to increase access to sustainable alternatives, promote market transformation, and influence policy decisions. Charter members of the District Collaborative affect the lives of 3.6 million children in 5,726 schools with more than 550 million square feet of building area.\n\nMembership to the GSA's online community is free. Schools and districts can also pledge the Sustainability Leadership where princials, heads of school, and superintendents pledge to take action in these areas: Reduce Our Climate & Ecological Impact, Educate & Engage Our Community, and Transform Our Culture.\n\nGSA programs integrate education and action and aggregate and quantify progress. Using the building and campus as a teaching tool, students work alongside faculty and staff on projects from recycling, weatherizing, conducting energy audits, changing lights and replacing old boilers to improving science and technology education, restoring wetlands and planting green roofs. Best practices ripple outward from schools to families, to the workplace. GSA programs include:\n\n\n"}

This document is the legitimate successor of the International Charter of Physical Education and Sport, originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO.\n\nThe original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that “the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all”.\nBased on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.\n\nIn twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development.\n\nThe revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.\n\nUNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova said: “The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.” \n\nThe International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport contains a preamble and 12 articles. These are the main values defended by the Charter:\n\nArticle 1 - The practice of physical education, physical activity and sport is a fundamental right for all\n\nArticle 2 - Physical education, physical activity and sport can yield a wide range of benefits to individuals, communities and society at large\n\nArticle 11 - Physical education, physical activity and sport can play an important role in the realization of development, peace and post-conflict and post-disaster objectives\n\nArticle 4 - Physical education, physical activity and sport programmes must inspire lifelong participation.\n\nArticle 5 – All stakeholders must ensure that their activities are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.\n\nArticle 6 - Research, evidence and evaluation are indispensable components for the development of physical education, physical activity and sport.\n\nArticle 7 - Teaching, coaching and administration of physical education, physical activity and sport must be performed by qualified personnel.\n\nArticle 8 - Adequate and safe spaces, facilities and equipment are essential to quality physical education, physical activity and sport.\n\nArticle 9 - Safety and the management of risk are necessary conditions of quality provision.\n\nArticle 10 - Protection and promotion of the integrity and ethical values of physical education, physical activity and sport must be a constant concern for all\n\nArticle 3 – All stakeholders must participate in creating a strategic vision, identifying policy potions and priorities.\n\nArticle 12 – International cooperation is a prerequisite for enhancing the scope and impact of physical education, physical activity and sport.\n\nThe Quality Physical Education Policy Project illustrates how principles and recommendations stipulated in the Charter can be translated into indicators, benchmarks and tools.\n\nThe revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs.

These aims are achieved by education and grants, planning participation, membership and fundraising.\n\nNotable achievements of the Irish Georgian Society include, among others, the saving of threatened great buildings such as Castletown House, County Kildare; Damer House, County Tipperary; Doneraile Court, County Cork; Roundwood, Co. Laois; Tailors’ Hall, Dublin and 13 Henrietta Street, Dublin. \n\nRecent projects include the restoration of mid-eighteenth century panelled rooms at Ledwithstown, County Longford; the repair of the early nineteenth-century south tower roof at Barmeath Castle, Co. Louth; the restoration of the pavilion cupolas of Kilshannig, Co. Cork, built in the 1760s to the designs of the Italian architect Davis Ducart; and, in association with the Department of the Environment, Heritage & Local Government, the World Monuments Fund and the Headfort Trust, the restoration of the superb Robert Adam decorative schemes at Headfort, County Meath. \n\nThese conservation efforts are funded by the members’ participation in the Society’s events programme, the fundraising of our chapters, by donations and bequests and by sales from the Society’s online book and gift shop.\n\nThe current project (2011- ) is the restoration of Dublin's 1760s City Assembly House in South William Street. This was the first purpose-built public exhibition gallery in Britain or Ireland. From 1809 it was the debating chamber of Dublin Corporation for nearly a century, and was the scene of many famous speeches by Daniel O'Connell.\n\nThe Society is a membership organisation whose purpose is to promote awareness and the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage and decorative arts. The Society was founded in 1958 by the Hon. Desmond Guinness and his late wife Mariga and since that time many buildings of significant architectural merit have been saved through their work and the work of members and supporters. The next President of the Society was Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin, who died in 2011, followed by Patrick Guinness.\n\nIn 2006 the Hon. Desmond Guinness was awarded a Europa Nostra prize for the Society's preservation activities.\n\nA fully illustrated book by Robert O'Byrne on the society's first 50 years was published in 2008.\n\nIn June 2015 a summer school is planned, with the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society, entitled Conservation without frontiers: Historic buildings of Armagh and Monaghan in context.\n\nMuch of the Society's income comes from supporters outside Ireland. In the USA they were registered in 1968 as Irish Georgian Society Inc., and in the UK as the \"Irish Georgian Trust\". The Society's work within the Republic of Ireland is managed by the Irish-registered Irish Georgian Foundation, registered in 1970.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23479237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23479237", "title": "Jefferson Scholars Foundation", "text": "Jefferson Scholars Foundation\n\nThe Jefferson Scholars Foundation provides a full scholarship program benefiting select undergraduate and graduate students at The University of Virginia and has been named as one of the two leading scholarship programs in the country. Named after Thomas Jefferson, the university's founder and visionary, the foundation aims to \"identify, attract, and nurture individuals of extraordinary intellectual range and depth who possess the highest qualities of leadership, scholarship, and citizenship.\" In addition to funding tuition and fees, the scholarship program provides undergraduates with extensive programming including an introductory outdoor weekend, international travel, a summer leadership and citizenship institute, internships and an extensive speaker series. \n\nFounded in the 1980–1981 academic year by the board of managers of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation was a product of the \"board’s desire to put in place a tangible program that would reflect the educational ideals of Thomas Jefferson.\" The first class yielded twelve scholars who graduated in 1985. \n\nIn time, the foundation worked to increase the size of incoming Jefferson Scholar classes. The regional competitions increased from just a few to the 50 that presently exist. The number of nominees has grown to over 1,800 each year, and volunteer committee participation utilizes roughly 800 U.Va. alumni and faculty who participate in the nomination and selection process.\n\nFor aspiring Jefferson Scholars, the selection process can be quite rigorous. Students attending one of the more than 4,000 eligible secondary schools in the US must be nominated by their respective institution. Each secondary school is assigned to one of 53 regional areas across the United States which serve to select finalists in the competition. The regional selection process, executed by committees of UVA alumni, varies and can include three levels of selection (an application and up to two interviews) to determine any finalists. These individuals are then brought to Charlottesville for the finalist selection weekend. Students not attending an eligible secondary school or students living outside one of the established regions (including international students) are automatically considered for the finalist weekend based on their UVA application and selected by a separate panel. All finalist expenses for the selection weekend, including travel, are paid for by the foundation.\n\nIn 2016, 1825 student nominations were made by secondary schools; 120 of these students were selected for the finalist weekend, and 34 were awarded Jefferson Scholarships. \n\nUsually taking place in March, the finalist weekend is actually an exhaustive four-day experience allowing students the opportunity to exhibit their strengths. While some time is dedicated to informative activities concerning UVA and a specialized tour of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, the majority of the weekend is spent on activities where individual merits may be judged. Judges utilize a math & logic exam, a written essay, two sets of faculty moderated panel discussions based on readings provided before the weekend, and a final interview with a panel of judges to select a class. Of the finalists, a class of around 30 students is selected, representing less than 2% of those originally nominated. \n\nThe university has seen success in retaining students nominated for (but not awarded) the Jefferson Scholarship. In recent years, approximately nine percent of the incoming first year class were nominees from their respective secondary school.\n\nThe class spends three days at an outdoor/high-ropes course in Charlottesville. The event is utilized to encourage team building among the class as they camp, cook meals, and participate in numerous activities including high and low ropes courses.\n\nClass participates in a Leadership and Citizenship Institute. Because leadership and citizenship are two pillars of the scholarship program, the foundation focuses on emphasizing these qualities through a specialized two-week program. Occurring in August before a scholar's second year, the class is housed on grounds at the university and participates in many different activities. These activities vary slightly by year but generally include numerous speakers and workshops, a service project, team building activities, and public speaking exercises. The weekend between weeks is left open for scholars to plan class activities.\n\nThe international travel experience occurs during the summer before third year. The international travel program is broken into structured and independent portions. \n\nThe structured program offers three different trips for third year scholars. The two oldest trips take place in Tuscany and London and have existed for many years. A trip taking students throughout the European Union existed previously but was replaced in 2007 by a new itinerary to focus on Asia. Scholars are asked to rank their trip preferences in December of their second year and the foundation then assigns scholars to one of the three trips.\n\nEach trip focuses on a specific topic to appeal to the different interests of scholars.\n\nEntitled, \"Civilization in Tuscany: A Case Study of Creativity, Continuity, and Change,\" this trip takes place at the Erasmus Institute in Capitignano and is led by Michael Aeschlimann. This trip focuses on art and architecture and takes students to many of the Tuscan towns and museums to study. \n\nEntitled, “The Culture of London: Past and Present,” this trip takes place at Regent's College in London. This program's subject is the city of London itself and its interdisciplinary approach combines English literature, history, and urban culture. The program is taught by UVA English professors Michael Levenson and Clare Kinney.\n\nEntitled, \"China: Four Corners,\" this trip takes place in one or more countries in Asia and is designed and led by a senior UVA faculty member. Started in 2007 and led by Economics professor Bruce Reynolds, the trip started in Osaka, Japan and included a several night stay in a Shingon Buddhist Temple atop Mount Koya. In addition, the group traveled to Kyoto, Japan and then to Beijing. After a night of camping and hiking on the Great Wall of China, students boarded the Lhasa Railway for the 48-hour trip to Tibet upon the highest altitude train track in the world. After a stay in Lhasa and seeing the Jokang Temple and Potala Palace, scholars camped and hiked to remote Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. The final stop for the trip was in Shanghai. Recently, the trip has been designed and overseen by UVA politics professor Brantly Womack. Since then the Japan portion of the trip has been removed and replaced with additional cities in China including Xi'an and Hong Kong, while many other portions of the trip in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai remain the same.\n\nThe second portion of the international travel program is an independent study. In the spring semester of a scholar's second year, each student proposes a project to the foundation for their study. The guidelines for these projects are purposefully flexible and state that each scholar must choose a topic that cannot be fully explored from a computer and requires that they leave the country.\n\nEach project is unique; some scholars choose to focus on subjects diverting from strict academia while others choose to do academically significant research. While many scholars choose to do their independent in Europe as they are already there from their structured program, others have been known to do their studies in other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nEarly on, the Jefferson Scholars competition was overseen by the Alumni Association, with university clubs funding several of the scholars. By the mid-1980s, however, private support from individuals became the main focus of funding efforts. \n\nThe foundation’s endowment in 2016 stood at just over $359 million.\n\nFor the 2015–16 academic year, the in-state monetary award for scholars exceeded $31,000. The out-of-state award exceeded $61,000. This money is used to cover the full cost of attending UVA which includes tuition, board, books, etc. The stipend for Jefferson Graduate Fellows is $30,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "54072404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54072404", "title": "Jock Turcot", "text": "Jock Turcot\n\nFrancis James \"Jock\" Turcot (5 October 1943 – 25 December 1965) was President of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa (then known as the Students' Union of the University of Ottawa) in 1965 and a leading figure of the Canadian student movement in the 1960s.\n\nTurcot was born on 5 October 1943 in Kenora. He was the eldest of 11 children.\n\nFluent in English and French, he came to the University of Ottawa to study civil law. His first notable post within the SUUO was when he became Publications Commissioner in April 1964.\n\nAs Publications Commissioner, he also created a commission with the goal of creating a charter for both the student papers.\n\nIn the 1960s, the relationship between the student government and the university was marked by a battle for autonomy on the part of the student government. The university often interfered in the SUUO's affairs and threatened several times to expel student leaders for their activism, while the faculty associations repeatedly threatened to separate from the SUUO and the SUUO struggled financially. In late 1964, those tensions climaxed when SUUO President Robert Campbell attacked the university, accusing it of ignoring students and wasting their time, and stating that the SUUO would do whatever it took to gain independence. The SUUO's Grand Council, however, used that letter as a pretext to impeach Campbell, at which point the rest of the SUUO exec resigned in solidarity with Campbell.\n\nIn the special election that followed, Turcot quickly emerged as the compromise candidate, seeing as he had not been particularly involved with any of the political factions on campus. On 17 January 1965, he was elected President of the SUUO for the remainder of the 1964-65 year.\n\nOn becoming President, he soon released a long-term plan for the SUUO, based on a Students' Charter, a study of the SUUO structure, a new SUUO Constitution, incorporation of the SUUO and the construction of a student centre for campus. He also quickly undertook consultations and meetings with all of the faculty associations on campus and began a practice of holding weekly press conferences to update students on SUUO affairs.\n\nIn March 1965, he was re-elected as President for the 1965–1966 term.\n\nIn November 1965, the SUUO led a march of over 800 students on Parliament Hill to demonstrate in favour of free tuition. As President, he also helped organise SUUO participation in the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, highlighted the situation of international students on campus for the first time, lobbied for the introduction of a reading week in the winter semester, and oversaw the creation of a charter for the SUUO Student Court. He also helped formulate the SUUO's response to the Commission on the Financing of Higher Education in Canada led by Vincent Bladen, which rejected calls for free tuition.\n\nIn November 1964, Turcot attended the founding meeting of the UGEQ, the new national students' union in Québec. One of his goals was to negotiate membership of the SUUO, given the SUUO's bilingual nature and the high proportion of francophone students at the University of Ottawa. He came back from the meeting concerned about the future of the UGEQ, saying that the union was too dogmatic and had chosen to be a union for Québecois and not for French-Canadian students. Turcot was also a supporter of Canadian federalism, which ran contrary to rising Québec nationalism.\n\nAt the September 1965 annual conference of the Canadian Union of Students held at Bishop's University, Turcot took a leading role in proposing new policy, and was consequently offered the position of CUS President. He declined the post, stating that he wanted to concentrate on SUUO affairs. At that conference, the CUS adopted a number of policies, including support for free tuition, lowering the voting age to 18 and abolishing the death penalty.\n\nIn 1965, Turcot also got the CUS to adopt his Declaration on the Canadian Student which called for students to form autonomous and democratic student governments, for students to have a greater say in university affairs and for students to take the lead in campaigning for social justice movements.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1965, Turcot died in a car accident while driving home to his family in St-Charles-de-Mandeville from the uOttawa campus. He has stayed on campus for the Christmas Eve supper for international students, and was only planning to have a short break, so that he could finish the new SUUO Constitution before the end of the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe university held a remembrance ceremony for him on 11 January in the Church du Sacré-Coeur on campus, and cancelled all classes during the ceremony to encourage students to attend.\n\nThe SUUO then created the Jock Turcot Memorial Fund to collect money for the construction of a student centre. In March 1966, students voted by a 2/3rds majority in favour of a 10 $ levy per student per year to go towards the construction of the student centre. The building opened in 1973, and was named after Turcot. His brother, Mark Turcot, was SFUO President when the student centre was opened.\n\nThe work he did on the structures of the SUUO had a major impact on the workings of the SUUO for decades, and the SUUO was incorporated a few years after his death (at which point it switched its name back to the SFUO). His advocacy at the national level of the Canadian student movement also had an impact for decades, as he was one of the first to gain recognition for wider social justice activism in the student movement, and the Turcot Declaration on the Canadian Student was a landmark document. The SFUO, however, failed to maintain a presence within the Québec student movement, which continued to build its own identity away from the student movement in the rest of Canada.\n\nJock Turcot did, however, face some criticism during his term as President. Notably, he was accused multiple times of being too close to the university administration and of having a weak and too conservative policy on incorporation. He was also sometimes accused of gaining support based on his good looks, and not based on merit.\n"}

As of February 5, 2009, it is out of business.\n\nJuicyCampus described itself as an enabler of \"online anonymous free speech on college campuses\". Through strict privacy policies, it allowed users to post messages and comments without having to worry about identification. Readers were able to vote on which posts they found \"juiciest\", or most provocative. As of March 16, 2008 the site contained rumors for 59 colleges and universities. By October 2008, JuicyCampus had expanded to over 500 college campuses. Much of its content was related to fraternities and sororities.\n\nThe creator of JuicyCampus, identified in an article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" as a Duke University alumnus named Matt Ivester, described the website as within a trend of \"gossip 2.0\", which he sees as \"pretty entertaining\". Timothy Chester, chief information officer of Pepperdine University, described the purpose of JuicyCampus in a letter written to Google as to create a \"'virtual bathroom wall' for abusive, degrading, and hateful speech\".\n\nThe website began operation in August 2007, and was closed indefinitely on February 5, 2009 due to lack of revenue.\n\nIt was initially launched on just seven campuses (Duke University, Loyola Marymount University, UNC, USC, Pepperdine, UCLA and College of Charleston).\n\nOn December 8, 2007 from a computer at Loyola Marymount University, a student allegedly posted a threat to shoot random students on the campus' \"Alumni Mall\". The quote read, \"I am going to shoot and kill as many people as I can until which time I am incapacitated or killed by the police.\" The Los Angeles Police Department apprehended the suspect. The police released the suspect without filing charges. The message was originally posted on the website 4chan.\n\nJuicyCampus has received much media attention for not censoring the content posted by its users. CNN released an article documenting the anonymous rumors on the website and the panic felt by students.\n\nMatt Ivester, the site's creator, has done numerous interviews defending the website. Larry Moneta, the vice president for student affairs at Duke University said that when he asked Ivester to moderate the website Ivester refused and indicated that he believes moderation is an unnecessary step toward censorship. \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" said that \"the site revels in the publicity it gets\" and that the website keeps a list of websites, including those that are critical of \"JuicyCampus\" in a blog. Ivester, a 2005 Duke graduate, said on his website's official blog that \"Hate isn't juicy\", encouraging users to think carefully about what they were writing and whether their posts were entertaining or just plain mean.\n\nIn December 2007, Randolph-Macon College blocked students from accessing juicy campus on the campus network claiming that the site had no intellectual contribution to society.\n\nIn January 2008 the undergraduate student government at Pepperdine University passed a resolution asking for a block on the site. The administration did not enact the block. Austin Maness, a Pepperdine senior who wrote the resolution, said that he felt that the move was \"a mistake\" as it increased awareness of the website. The administration of Pepperdine complained to Google; Daniel Rubin, a Google spokesman, said that Google removed \"JuicyCampus\" from its advertising network due to \"excessive profanity\". By January 2008, \"JuicyCampus\" moved to another advertising network. Texas Christian University students asked advertisers to not buy space on the website. In November 2008, officials at High Point University requested that the website remove the school from its servers. When JuicyCampus refused, the University blocked the site from its campus network. During the same month Tennessee State University (TSU) blocked JuicyCampus. Ivester criticized the decision and compared it to the People's Republic of China's censoring of the internet. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the decision. JuicyCampus filed a lawsuit against TSU and asked students to join the suit.\n\nIn March 2008, the office of the Attorney General of New Jersey, Anne Milgram, started an investigation into the website. Milgram said that because the site promises to block offensive content, but does not have a mechanism for reporting such content, it may be in violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. In March 2008 the office subpoenaed the website. JuicyCampus criticized the actions of the office, calling them \"absurd.\"\n\nIn October 2008, The GW Patriot and \"The Colonialist\", two student-run publications at The George Washington University, called for students to spam the university's JuicyCampus page in order to fill the site with irrelevant material. Their goal was to reduce the forum's popularity on campus. \"The Purchase Independent\", a student newspaper of the State University of New York at Purchase, published a pro-Juicy Campus editorial and an anti-Juicy Campus editorial. The pro-JC one argued that it helped contain \"moronic\" discussion and students to a single website.\n\nJuicycampus ceased operations on February 5, 2009 because of financial problems, specifically an inability to turn a profit.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3124327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3124327", "title": "Literary estate", "text": "Literary estate\n\nThe literary estate of a deceased author consists mainly of the copyright and other intellectual property rights of published works, including film, translation rights, original manuscripts of published work, unpublished or partially completed work, and papers of intrinsic literary interest such as correspondence or personal diaries and records. In academia, the German term \"Nachlass\" for the legacy of papers is often used.\n\nA literary executor is a person acting on behalf of beneficiaries (e.g. family members, a designated charity, a research library or archive) under the author's will. The executor is responsible for entering into contracts with publishers, collecting royalties, maintaining copyrights, and (where appropriate) arranging for the deposit of letters. According to \"Wills, Administration and Taxation: a practical guide\" (1990, UK) \"A will may appoint different executors to deal with different parts of the estate. One example of this is the appointment of a literary executor to deal with literary effects [...]\".\n\nSince the literary estate is a legacy to the author's heirs, the management of it in financial terms is a responsibility of trust. The position of literary executor extends beyond the monetary aspect, though: appointment to such a position, perhaps informally, is often a matter of the author's choice during his or her lifetime.\n\nIf a sympathetic and understanding friend is in the position of literary executor, there can be conflict: what is to be managed is not just a portfolio of intellectual property but a posthumous reputation. Wishes of the deceased author may have been clearly expressed but are not always respected. Family members often express strong feelings about privacy of the dead. For example, biographical writing is likely to be of a quite different authority if it is carried out with access to private papers. The literary executor then becomes a gatekeeper.\n\nExamples of literary executors include Sir Edward Marsh for Rupert Brooke, Robert Baldwin Ross for Oscar Wilde, Robert Hayward Barlow for H. P. Lovecraft, Rush Rhees for Ludwig Wittgenstein, Otto Nathan for Albert Einstein, and Regine Olsen for Søren Kierkegaard.\n\nA particularly notorious example is Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche for Friedrich Nietzsche, as she resorted to fraud to make her brother's \"Nachlass\" more compatible with Nazi ideology. An exceptionally productive example is that of Rudolf Steiner. Although he did not originally intend that the stenographs of his thousands of lectures be published, he relented and named his second wife, Marie Steiner-von Sivers, to direct his \"Nachlass\", which has produced more than three hundred volumes since his death in 1925.\n\nOlder examples of such appointments, such as Kenelm Digby for Ben Jonson, are essentially editorial rather than legal. A contemporary case is Christopher Tolkien's work on J. R. R. Tolkien's papers.\n\nA notable example is the case of Franz Kafka, who left no will. His friend Max Brod assumed the function of literary executor, though most of the literary estate was legally owned by Marianne Steiner and Věra Saudková.\n\n"}

It is a public institution with a public personality and financial autonomy. It is under the technical supervision of the Ministry of Public Service and Administrative Reform.\n\nThe original name at creation is the Cameroon School of Administration (ECA). This school is the main crucible of administrators of the Cameroonian civil service since the independence of Cameroon on May 1, 1960. In 1961, the school opens a special cycle to prepare for the entrance examination to the normal cycles of candidates from the under-educated regions. Cameroon has two official national languages since independence and reunification. As a result, in 1963, a preparatory cycle for the entrance examination to Cycle A and B for English-speaking candidates were launched. The major change came in 1964: The Cameroon School of Administration (ECA) became the Normal School of Administration and Magistracy (ENAM). The main mission also changed. It is now necessary to train the civil and financial personnel of the State, as well as the magistrates of the judiciary. In 1985, ENAM became part of the National Center for Administration and Magistracy (CENAM) with the Higher Institute of Public Management (ISMP) and the Institute of Administrative and Financial Techniques (ITAF). 1995 marks the reopening of cycles A and B for the training of civil and financial service personnel. This year also marks the creation of the Research and Documentation Center for administrative problems. 2010 marks the opening of admission to the Judicial Division to graduates of Computer Science and Economics of Higher Education. Since 2012, graduates in computer science and economics of higher education compete for admission to the Division of the Judiciary and Transplants.\n\nThe decrees of the Minister of Public Service and Administrative Reform, opening the competition, set the uniform conditions for all candidates. The number of eligible places is prorated according to the requests of administrations. The competitions take place in the unique center of Yaounde. Access modes in the first year are identical for the competition internally and externally.\n\n\nThe exam period is between April and June. The exam fees are unique and amount to 15,000 FCFA. The duration of the training depends on the cycle chosen. It consists of two years of training for cycles A and clerk and one year of training for cycle B. The competition is held at the unique center which is the political capital Yaoundé. The subjects on which we compete are the following:\nENAM provides its students with a two-year continuing education program. According to the divisions the teachings are as follows:\n\n\nENAM students are integrated directly into the civil service and become public servants. They are classified as A1 for those in Cycle B and A2 for those in Cycle A.\n\nThe entry examination to ENAM is generally tainted with controversies that challenge the objective and transparent character of eligibility.\n\nIn 2004, eighty-eight (88) candidates in the ENAM competition received a three-year suspension, all examinations in all university courses for \"fraud\" and \"attempted fraud\".\n\nIn February 2006, Benjamin Amama Amam, then Minister of Public Service and Vocational Training, ordered the cancellation of the ENAM results competitions for the 2005-2006 session, following a January 2006 report denounces exam fraud. He later reversed his decision by order of Jules Doret Ndongo, then Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nIn October 2009, Dr. Shanda Tomne, then Chairperson of the Independent Commission Against Corruption and Discrimination (COMICODI), sends a letter of denunciation of the results of the first-year entrance examination of the Judicial Division, Judicial Section, to the Director General of ENAM.\n\nIn 2012, Prime Minister Philemon Yang instructed the Director General of ENAM, Linus Toussaint Mendjana, the exclusion of six students who were admitted on the sole instruction of the Speaker of the National Assembly Cavaye Yeguié Djibril, and not by competition.\n"}

PPSMI was then fully implemented to all secondary students in 2007, and to all primary students in 2008.\n\nAccording to the statement regarding PPSMI in the Ministry of Education's website:\n\nWhen proposing the policy, Tun Dr. Mahathir was in the opinion that Malaysia's progress is declining in the age of globalisation, and he had hoped that this policy gives a competitive edge to the nation, following the footsteps of Singapore and India which are moving forward because of their utilisation of the English language.\n\nPPSMI was implemented for the 2003 school session students enrolling in Year 1 and Form 1 in primary and secondary schools respectively. Students of other grades are not affected, and continued to study Mathematics and Science in the mother tongue. PPSMI learning materials were offered in the form of packages consisting of these components:\n\nAs for the implementation in Chinese schools, after a protest was made by the nation's union of Chinese schools Dong Jiao Zong, a compromise was reached where the teaching of Science and Mathematics was made done both in English and Mandarin.\n"}
{"id": "3609555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3609555", "title": "Peer support", "text": "Peer support\n\nPeer support occurs when people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help to each other. It commonly refers to an initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as peer mentoring, reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or counseling. Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.\n\nPeer support is distinct from other forms of social support in that the source of support is a \"peer\", a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has \"been there, done that\" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as peer support specialists and peer counselors receive special training and are required to obtain Continuing Education Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders.\n\nThe effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of psychosocial processes described best by Mark Salzer in 2002: social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory and the helper-therapy principle.\n\n\nPeer mentoring takes place in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student. Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace as a means of orienting new employees. New employees who are paired with a peer mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.\n\nThis form of peer support is widely used within schools. Peer supporters are trained, normally from within schools or universities, or sometimes by outside organizations, such as Childline's CHIPS (Childline In Partnership With Schools) program, to be \"active listeners\". Within schools, peer supporters are normally available at break or lunch times.\n\nPeer mediation is a means of handling incidents of bullying by bringing the victim and the bully together under mediation by one of their peers.\n\nA peer helper in sports works with young adults in sports such as football, soccer, track, volleyball, baseball, cheerleading, swimming, and basketball. They may provide help with game tactics (e.g. keeping your eye on the ball), emotional support, training support, and social support.\n\nPeer support can occur within, outside or around traditional mental health services and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the recovery approach and in consumer-operated services programs. Consumers/clients of mental health programs have also formed non-profit self-help organizations, and serve to support each other and to challenge associated stigma and discrimination. The role of peer workers in mental health services was the subject of a conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the Centre for Mental Health and the NHS Confederation. Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced self-esteem and social functioning. There is considerable variety in the ways that peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services. In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by psychiatric survivors, in peer support as an approach to building relationships that are genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.\n\nIn Canada, the LEAF \"(Living Effectively with Anxiety and Fear)\" Program is a peer-led support group for cognitive-behavioral therapy of persons with mild to moderate panic disorders.\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions were found to improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be comparable to those of group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that peer support reduces fear during stressful situations such as combat and domestic violence and may mitigate Posttraumatic stress disorder. The 1982 Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey showed that PTSD was highest in those men and women who lacked positive social support from family, friends, and society in general.\n\nPeer support programs have also been implemented to address stress and psychological trauma among law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders. Peer support is an important component of the critical incident stress management program used to alleviate stress and trauma among disaster first responders.\n\nPeer support has been used to help survivors of trauma, such as refugees, cope with stress and deal with difficult living conditions. Peer support is integral to the services provided by the National Center for Trauma-Informed Care. Other programs have been designed for female victims of domestic violence and for women in prison.\n\nSurvivor Corps defines peer support for trauma survivors as \"Encouragement and assistance provided by a colleague who has overcome similar difficulties to engender self-confidence and autonomy and to enable the survivor to make his or her own decisions and implement them.\" Peer support is a fundamental strategy in the rehabilitation of landmine survivors in Afghanistan, Bosnia, El Salvador and Vietnam. A study of 470 amputee survivors of war-related violence in six countries showed that nearly one hundred percent said they had benefited from peer support.\n\nA peer support program operated by the \"Centre d’Encadrement et de Développement des Anciens Combattants\" in Burundi with support from the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery and Action on Armed Violence has assisted survivors of war-related violence, including women with disabilities, and female ex-combatants since 2010. A similar program in Rwanda works with survivors of the Rwandan genocide. Peer support has been recommended as a fundamental part of victim assistance programs for survivors of war-related violence.\n\nA 1984 study on the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of domestic violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models. A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered to be at risk for domestic violence showed that peer support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence.\n\nPandora's Aquarium, an online support group operating as part of Pandora's Project, offers peer support to survivors of rape and sexual abuse and their friends and family.\n\nTwelve-step programs for overcoming substance misuse and other addiction recovery groups are often based on peer support. Since the 1930s Alcoholics Anonymous has promoted peer support between new members and their sponsors: \"The process of sponsorship is this: an alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery program shares that experience on a continuous, individual basis with another alcoholic who is attempting to attain or maintain sobriety through AA.\" Other addiction recovery programs rely on peer support without following the twelve-step model.\n\nPeer support has been beneficial for many people living with diabetes. Diabetes encompasses all aspects of people's lives, often for decades. Support from peers can offer emotional, social, and practical assistance that helps people do the things they need to do to stay healthy. Peer support groups for diabetics complement and enhance other health care services. J.F. Caro is the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of one of such groups named Peer for Progress.\n\nPeer support has also been provided for people with cancer and HIV. The Breast Cancer Network of Strength trains peer counselors to work with breast cancer survivors.\n\nPeer support is considered to be a key component of the independent living movement and has been widely used by organizations that work with people with disabilities, including the Amputee Coalition of America (ACA) and Survivor Corps. Since 1998 the ACA has operated a National Peer Network for survivors of limb loss. The Blinded Veterans Association has recently launched Operation Peer Support (OPS), a program designed to support men and women returning to the US blinded or experiencing significant visual impairment in connection with their military service. Peer support has also benefited survivors of traumatic brain injury and their families. There is also FacingDisability for Families Facing Spinal Cord Injuries , which has a peer counseling program in addition to 1,000 videos drawn from interviews of people with spinal cord injuries, their families, caregivers and experts.\n\nSeveral programs exist that provide peer support for military veterans in the US and Canada. In 2010 the Military Women to Women Peer Support Group was established in Helena, MT.\n\nThe Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) provides peer support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources for families of members of the US military. Operation Peer Support (OPS) is a program for US military veterans who were blinded or have significant visual impairment.\n\nIn January 2013 Senator Patty Murray, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, sponsored an amendment of the National Defense Authorization Act (S.3254) that would require peer counseling as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention program for US veterans.\n\nResearchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD reviewed the literature on peer interventions for PTSD and found that studies fell into three broad categories, referred to as \"peer outreach for those exposed to traumatic events;” “paraprofessional peer delivery of a trauma-focused intervention” and “peer support for recovery from PTSD\". Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event as a means of connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as Psychological First Aid) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel. Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.\n\nA further review of existing literature found that carefully recruited, trained, supervised, and supported paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions effectively, and may be valuable in communities with fewer resources for mental healthcare.\n\nResearchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD also conducted focus groups at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Trauma Recovery Programs, a PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Program, and a Women's Trauma Recovery Program to determine veteran and staff perceptions of informal peer support interventions already in place. Four themes were identified, including \"peer support contributing to a feeling of social connectedness,\" \"positive role modeling by the peer support provider,\" \"peer support augmenting care offered by professional providers,\" and \"peer supporter acting as a 'culture broker' and orienting recipients to mental health treatment.\"\n\nThese findings have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system.\n\nThe peer support program has been operational since 2012 with over 268 unique veterans seen between 2012 and 2015. The two peer support providers involved in the program are veterans of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively, and after having recovered from their own mental health disorders utilize their experiences to help their fellow veterans. The two providers have been responsible for leading between 5 and 7 groups each week as well as conducting telephone outreach and one-on-one engagement visits These services have successfully helped to augment the often overburdened mental health treatment teams at the central valley outpatient VA clinics.\n\nThe peer support program has been described in several publications. A personal story of success was featured in Stanford Medicine magazine and the collaborative nature of the program was described in the recently published book, Partnerships for Mental Health.\n\nSeveral peer based organisations exist for sex workers. The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7266353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7266353", "title": "Project Hope (Palestine)", "text": "Project Hope (Palestine)\n\nProject Hope Palestine (Humanitarian Opportunities for Peace and Education) is a UK registered non-governmental organisation providing free educational and recreational programmes for children in and around the city of Nablus, in the northern part of the State of Palestine, some 63km north of Jerusalem. It is thought to be the largest organisation of its kind in the West Bank.\n\nProject Hope was established in 2003 at the height of the Second Palestinian Intifada. It was co-founded by three Nablus-born locals, Hakim Sabbah, Salem Hantoli and Samah Atout, together with Canadian Jeremy Wildeman who while volunteering in West Bank education in 2002 was caught up in the violence. He returned to Nablus in 2003 to help address the humanitarian crisis in his own way, by addressing the severe educational and opportunity deficiencies youth faced there. As Wildeman later told the Toronto Star, he returned with nothing more than an idea, and a group of volunteers. His idea was to provide educational opportunities to children who because of the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict were being denied their basic rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 to 'learn, thrive and grow' in a safe and supportive environment. He teamed up with three Nablus residents to fulfil this aim according to their shared vision. Samah Atout spent her formative years as a university student enduring the horrors of the Second Intifada and wanted to do something for her community - led \"by the community\" rather than by donors with often conflicting political agendas. Hakim Sabeh emphasised the cultural aspects of educational work in Nablus, as well as providing classes open to as many communities as possible in the Nablus Governate, including the refugee camps and villages surrounding Nablus. According to Project Hope's mission statement their aim is to support and empower Palestinian youth through learning, the same principle that guides the work today.\n\nIn 2013 Project Hope hosted 144 international volunteers from 19 countries, the majority from the United States, France and Britain. This represents a 57% increase over 2011. Volunteers are required to contribute to the cost of shared accommodation in houses belonging to the charity. All volunteers undergo induction before teaching or setting up workshops and summer camps. Local volunteers are key to supporting overseas teams in the classroom and other activities. \n\nThe charity, led by co-founder and Director Hakim Sabeh, is said to be the largest non-governmental organisation of its kind in the West Bank. It employs locally engaged staff to manage and administer the programmes. Depending on demand, classes and workshops typically focus on languages (English and French), information technology and the arts, including drama and photography. They take place in community settings in partnership with schools, community centres and village halls. In 2013 there were 69 such local partners. \n\nProject Hope is funded by overseas grants and donations.\n\n\nIn 2013, Project Hope Palestine entered into partnership with the Scottish-registered charity Firefly International, which supports a locally-run educational project similar to Project Hope - Svitac, meaning firefly - in the northeast of Bosnia. Both projects work with large numbers of children in war-torn areas, on modest budgets. Jeremy Wildeman was appointed interim Director of Firefly International in June 2014. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "18680159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18680159", "title": "Remedial education", "text": "Remedial education\n\nRemedial education (also known as developmental education, basic skills education, compensatory education, preparatory education, and academic upgrading) is assigned to assist students in order to achieve expected competencies in core academic skills such as literacy and numeracy.\n\nWhereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of lack of preparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high intelligence can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by internal displacement during civil disorder or a war. \n\nIn Canada, the process whereby mature students take secondary school courses so that they can qualify to take post-secondary education is called academic upgrading. The Workers' Compensation Board of Nova Scotia defines academic upgrading as \"programs offered to adult learners who require the academic pre-requisites needed for entry into many occupational programs.\" The Alberta Ministry of Enterprise and Advanced Education advises that academic upgrading can be pursued through a post-secondary institution, a school board program such as a storefront school, or via distance learning.\n\nPostsecondary remediation is delivered on both 2-year community college and 4-year university campuses in the U.S. The bulk of remedial courses focus on advancing underprepared students' literacy skills (English and reading) or math skills. However, remedial courses can also be offered for other subjects such as science or study skills.\n\nMany students are placed into remedial courses through placement tests such as the ACT, SAT, ACCUPLACER, or COMPASS assessments. Often, each college or university sets its own score thresholds for determining whether a student must enroll in remedial courses. However, some states are moving toward a uniform standard for remedial placement cut scores. Students are required to enroll in remedial courses before advancing to a college level course in that subject. Colleges review a student's score by subject - math, English, science, etc. - and compare that score to the school's cutoff. For example, a college might use a score of 19 on the ACT math section as the threshold for determining whether a student must enroll in a remedial math course or college-level math course.\n\nParticularly at community colleges – which are open enrollment to any student with a high school degree or GED – multiple semesters of remedial coursework may be available to and required of students that enter with low placement test scores.\n\nWhether placement tests are the most effective method of placing students is an open debate across the US. Some colleges and states are experimenting with using high school GPA \"and\" placement test scores to determine student course referral. A study of placement tests by the Community College Research Center in 2012 found:\"\" \n\nUsing GPA with standardized test scores may also improve the accuracy of remedial placement and limit the likelihood of placing students into additional remedial courses they may not need. North Carolina recently implemented a statewide policy that allows two-year colleges to use both placement test scores and high school GPA to place students.\n\nEstimates on the portion of students in higher education taking remedial courses vary. At two-year colleges the percentage reported of students taking at least 1 remedial course varies from 41% to as high as 60%. Students from low-income households, African American students and Hispanic students are more likely to enroll in remedial courses. National estimates show that among two-year college students, students age 17-19 are most likely to enroll in remedial courses followed by students age 20-24 and then students age 25+.\n\nThe likelihood of remedial placement varies among states because of high school preparation, student demographics and state policies for assessing and placing students in remedial courses. Previous proportions of recent high school graduates enrolling in remedial courses at two-year colleges range from over 70% in Tennessee to 31% in North Carolina. The proportion of students enrolling in remedial courses on public, four-year college campuses is generally lower ranging from 35% in South Dakota to 5% in Washington state.\n\nThe state of Colorado issued a 2012 report on remedial placement showing that 40% of recent high school students enrolled in remedial courses at both two-year and 4- year colleges. Sixty-six (66%)of students enrolled in a two-year college and 24% of students at a four-year institution needed remediation.\n\nEducators and researchers also question whether many of the students directed into remediation ultimately need the course work, and some studies have found that the current method of using placement tests to assign students to remedial courses may be related to over placement.\n\nThere is an active debate on how remedial courses should be delivered to students. Students that are placed into remedial courses hold differing skill levels and needs for support. There is an active debate on whether students that are on the upper end of the skill spectrum may be most successful bypassing remedial coursework and enrolling in college-level courses with additional tutoring (see National Efforts to Strengthen Remediation). In contrast, students with larger skill deficiencies may require substantial math and English instruction before they can succeed academically. Researchers continue to investigate and make recommendations for effective remedial education models.\n\nCurrently, remedial education courses are delivered many ways across the United States: \n\nIn 2011, a nonprofit did a review of studies on remedial education delivery and found that, \"programs that show the greatest benefits with relatively rigorous documentation either mainstream developmental students into college-level courses with additional supports, provide modularized or compressed courses to allow remedial students to more quickly complete their developmental work, or offer contextualized remedial education within occupational and vocational programs.\"\n\nAccelerating the pace at which students progress through remedial courses is a reform now regularly highlighted in academic research and advocacy as effective for increasing student success. Often, remedial courses do not count toward a student's graduation requirements and taking many semesters of remedial education can lengthen a student's path to graduation and take up much needed financial aid. The Community College Research Center has found that accelerating a student's remedial English requirements resulted a higher likelihood of students completing their remedial sequences, a higher likelihood of enrolling in college-level English courses and a higher likelihood of students receiving a 'C' or better in the college-level course.\n\nOnline Courses: Some colleges have explored the use of providing remedial education courses online for students; however, evidence indicates that completion of online remedial courses is lower across almost every group of students compared to in-person remedial instruction. There is also evidence that students enrolling in online remedial education are less likely than their in-person counterparts to continue on to college-level coursework in the same subject.\n\nThe methods for delivering remedial education and whether to deliver remedial education are active debates in the U.S. As Bahr (Bahr 2008a, pp. 420–421) explains, \"On one hand, it fills an important niche in U.S. higher education by providing opportunities to rectify disparities generated in primary education and secondary schooling, to develop the minimum skills deemed necessary for functional participation in the economy and the democracy, and to acquire the prerequisite competencies that are crucial for negotiating college-level coursework. On the other hand, critics argue that taxpayers should not be required to pay twice for the same educational opportunities, that remediation diminishes academic standards and devalues post-secondary credentials, and that the large number of underprepared students entering colleges and universities demoralizes faculty. Following from these critiques, some have argued for a major restructuring of remediation or even the elimination of remedial programs altogether.\"\n\nDepending on their skill level upon entering college, students can spend from 1 to multiple semesters working to fulfill remedial requirements before advancing to college level courses required for their degree. An example of a full sequence of math remedial courses for low-skill students might include: 1) Pre-Collegiate Math, 2) Basic Algebra, and 3) Intermediate Algebra. There are many questions about how this structure both benefits students by increasing their preparation and harms students by increasing the courses required and time needed to complete college. Thomas Bailey from the Community College Research Center describes this in a 2010 report:\"\" \n\nComplete College America, a national non-profit working on remedial education reform, reports that among remedial students at two-year colleges 62% complete their remedial course and 23% complete associated college-level courses in that subject within 2 year (for example, complete math remediation and the college-level math requirements for their degree). On 4-year college campuses, 74% of students in remedial courses complete the course, and 37% complete remediation and an associated college-level course in that subject within 2 years. The same report projects that 9.5% of two-year college students starting in remediation will graduate within 3 years, and 35.1% of 4-year college students starting in remedial courses will graduate within 6 years.\n\nSimilarly, a nationwide study of two year college students participating in remedial education found 46% of students referred to remedial reading and 33% of students in math remediation completed their remedial sequence. A substantial portion of these non-completing students – 29% in math and 16% in reading – did so because they did not pass their remedial course. Another 11% of math students and 9% of reading students exited college without ever having failed or completed a remedial course. Students that enrolled in college and were placed into a sequence of 3 or more remedial courses were the least likely to persist to a college-level course. Like in all education pathways, there are many different points at which remedial students can step out of education. Research from the Community College Research Center at Colombia University suggests that many students do not complete their remedial sequences or do not enroll in the first college-level course in that subject.\n\nOver the last several years, a large amount of philanthropic and research attention has been directed at remedial education programs. Often, focus on remedial education is directed at 1) increasing the successful completion of remedial sequences 2) increasing the overall number of students with college degrees and certificates in the US and 3) decreasing the cost of remedial education to colleges and states.\n\nA national non-profit organization, Complete College America (CCA), was established in 2009 and looks at paths to improving higher education outcomes for all students. The organization has provided large amounts of national data on the proportion of students enrolled in remedial courses across demographic groups. The organization has also worked with states to set goals for increasing college completion and making adjustments to higher education policies. Currently, CCA heavily promotes enrolling more students directly into college-level courses even though they would traditionally test into remedial courses. The organization also heavily promotes better aligning remedial courses with college-level courses, and using diverse measures of student academic standing for remedial placement.\n\nOriginally an initiative led by the Lumina Foundation, Achieving the Dream focuses on increasing the success of college students – particularly students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. Starting in 2004 the project funded promising, data driven approaches to strengthening remedial education coursework. Today, Achieving the Dream is its own, national organization with the same driving mission: \"Achieving the Dream is a national reform network dedicated to community college student success and completion; focused primarily on helping low-income students and students of color complete their education and obtain market-valued credentials.\" The organization continues to fund positive interventions that move underprepared students through remediation with greater success and features a list of best practices and exemplary colleges from which other higher education administrators can learn. Achieving the Dream promotes many different promising interventions that can increase the success of students including: first-year student success courses that provide students with the skills to navigate college expectations/academics more effectively, accelerated remedial courses in math and English, student mentoring and coaching, mandatory orientations for new students and supplementary computer tutoring for remedial students. Achieving the Dream also takes an active role in state policy advocacy and is currently working in 15 states to strengthen student remedial success.\n\nIn December 2012, The Dana Center at the University of Texas, Complete College America, Education Commission of the States, and Jobs for the Future released \"Core Principles for Transforming Remedial Education: A Joint Statement\" with 7 key principles for strengthening community college remedial programs. The statement's principles included: aligning remedial courses with a student's long-term area of study at the college, using multiple measures to placement students in remedial courses, requiring all students –including under-prepared students– to pick a program of study when they enter college, integrating academic support services into pre college-level coursework, creating accelerated course models with students with larger skill deficiencies, and measuring completion of remedial courses.\n\nStrategies that accelerate students through remedial coursework and on to college-level (also called gatekeeper) courses are widely promoted as one path to increasing the success of under-prepared students.\n\nIn 2012, North Carolina underwent a wide scale redesign of their remedial education programs. Branded as 'Success NC', the program's Developmental Education Initiative takes steps to redesign math and reading curricula, move students through remedial courses faster and better assess and place students. NC colleges can now incorporate high school grades into their course placement decisions. Additionally, starting in 2014, all colleges will deliver remedial reading & English in 3 shorter, 8 week modules for some students while allowing higher level remedial students to enroll in college-level English courses with required supplementary English instruction.\n\nIn 2009 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation appropriated $16.5 million to 15 colleges in 5 states to promote promising interventions in the remedial education. Fueled by the broader goal of increasing the number of college graduates nationwide, the Gates Foundation promoted remedial interventions that proved successful, particularly low-income students and students of color, through the Lumina Foundation's \"Achieving the Dream Initiative\". A host of findings, recommendations and best practices —-including 25 Steps to Effective Remedial Education—-from the Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation investments are now available through the Development Education Initiative through Achieving the Dream.\n\nWhile remedial programmes are common in the United States, they are less common in Europe. Nevertheless, several European higher education institutes have started to offer remedial education programmes as well. One of the reasons why European universities are starting to develop remedial courses is the different situation in the two continents. In the United States, a common assumption is that remediation attracts underprepared students of low socioeconomic status. Inadequate academic preparation is no longer a barrier to college access. In contrast, in Europe, a large part of the transitional problems are caused by differences among national secondary educational programmes, which are determined on a national level. Therefore, these students are hindered to effectively start a bachelor or master programme. Remedial or developmental courses can help to bridge the gap.\n\nTo be able to compare and assess various preparatory courses in Europe, a European framework of transitional courses is necessary. By developing European Framework for Transitional Preparatory Courses (EFTPC), teachers around Europe can see how their design of their courses fit with the framework. In addition, potential improvements are identified and can be extended with the insights from the field. By using the WIKI technology, each teacher can add his/her suggestions to the EFTPC. This Framework is being developed in frame of European project STEP (Studies on Transitional Electronic Programmes).\n\nRemedial education, also known as \"buxiban\" (, lit. \"remedial education classes\") are cram schools in Taiwan and Mainland China.\n\nIt is a prevalent belief that parents should send their children to all kinds of cram schools in order for their children to remain competitive with their peers of the same age. As a result, many children of school-going age in Mainland China or Taiwan have schedules packed with all sorts of remediation from cram school.\n\n\"Buxiban\" teach a variety of subjects, including math, Chinese characters, and English as a foreign language. Studying at several \"buxiban\" is widely perceived as necessary to get a high-enough college entrance exam score to attend prestigious universities.\n\nSome \"buxiban\" are located in English-speaking countries. Most of those in North America are operated by the local communities. There, they are equivalent to \"hoshū jugyō kō\" (\"hoshūkō\") in ethnic Japanese communities and \"hagwon\" in ethnic Korean communities. \"Buxiban\" began appearing in North America in the 1880s.\n\nThe question that rises is whether successful completion of a remedial course guarantees students' success in college. The literature provides limited evidence for the effectiveness of remedial courses on outcomes such as: persistence to graduation, quality of performance in subsequent courses, drop-out, and grade point average. Many researchers claim that very little research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of remedial or developmental education and that research concerning the effectiveness of remedial education programs has been sporadic, underfunded, and inconclusive and has serious methodological flaws. Recently, efforts have been made to use more rigorous research designs (e.g. regression discontinuity design) to evaluate remedial effectiveness and suggest that post-remediation classroom composition (e.g., concentrated underpreparedness) moderates developmental education effectiveness efforts.\n\nOne way of measuring the effectiveness of a developmental/remedial program is to investigate whether the enrolled students actually complete the remedial courses successfully. Several research studies have found that underprepared students who completed remedial coursework achieve greater academic success than underprepared students who did not complete remedial coursework or students who started college academically prepared. Such findings support McCabe's statement that successfully-remediated students perform well in standard college work.\n\nDespite the claim that a number of rigorous studies using a regression discontinuity design have found underprepared students who score near placement test cut off scores and enroll in remedial education perform no better than similarly scoring students who place directly into college level courses, several studies have demonstrated developmental education programs provide benefit.\n\nThis may in part be due to the \"leakage\" that often occurs from the beginning of a developmental program to its end. Research from the Community College Research Center indicates that even students who successfully complete a developmental class often drop out of school before entering credit programs \n\nAcceleration Programs in Developmental Education\n\nThis has led to Acceleration in Developmental Education with The Community College of Baltimore County and the California Completion Project perhaps the two leading proponents. These programs merge (in different ways) developmental classes with credit classes.\n\nKozeracki (2002) distinguishes seven commonly cited elements that are associated with student success in developmental programs:\n\n\nOther research suggests that \"bridge\" programs that integrate basic skills and remedial education with higher-level content or technical training can produce substantially better results than traditional remedial programs.\n\nOnline remedial education is defined as an instruction method using Information and communication technologies (ICT) which helps students to provide knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in university. This way, foreign students can study in their home country, which reduces their costs while at the same time offering flexibility to develop their knowledge and skills. ICT has the power to support independent learning as well as to learn irrespective of time and geographical constraints with the widespread implementation of internet.\n\nAdvantages and possibilities:\n\nDisadvantages and problems:\n\nIn order to provide a positive experience and to ensure the effectiveness of online remedial courses, the tutor's roles in designing and organizing the learning experience, providing technical advice and support, encouraging and facilitating discussion, encouraging participation, using a variety of forms of instruction, and resolving communication problems are crucial.\n\nA recent development in collaborative working and learning is the use of synchronous tools like web-videoconferences whereby learners meet online at a fixed time (synchronous) in an online classroom. While web-videoconferencing is not a new phenomenon, tools like Skype, MSN Web Messenger and Adobe Acrobat Connect allow learners to efficiently communicate using free or low cost technology such as a simple desktop computer. Until recently, such basic technology would only allow for asynchronous learning, as for example in discussion groups.\n\n\n\n"}

The Fellowship was incorporated and granted a Royal Charter on 17 May 1983 and became the Royal Academy of Engineering on 16 March 1992. It is governed according to the Charter and associated Statutes and Regulations (as amended from time to time).\n\nConceived in the late 1960s, during the Apollo space programme and Harold Wilson’s espousal of ‘white heat of technology’, the Fellowship of Engineering was born in the year of Concorde’s first commercial flight.\n\nThe Fellowship's first meeting, at Buckingham Palace on 11 June 1976, enrolled 126 of the UK’s leading engineers. The first fellows included Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle, the jet engine genius,the structural engineer Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George MacFarlane, the inventor of the bouncing bomb, Sir Barnes Wallis, father of the UK computer industry Sir Maurice Wilkes. The Fellowship’s first President, Lord Hinton, had driven the UK’s supremacy in nuclear power.\n\nThe Fellowship focused on championing excellence in all fields of engineering. Activities began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the Distinction lecture series, now known as the Hinton lectures. The Fellowship was asked to advise the Department of Industry for the first time and the Academy became host and presenter of the MacRobert Award.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Fellowship received its own Royal Charter along with its first government grant-in-aid. At the same time it also received significant industrial funding, initiated its research programme to build bridges between academia and industry and opened its doors to International and Honorary Fellows.\n\nIn 1990, the Academy launched its first major initiative in education, Engineering Education Continuum, which evolved into the BEST Programme and Shape the Future and Tomorrow's Engineers.\n\nThe Academy’s increasing level of influence – in policy, research and education – was recognised when it was granted a royal title and became The Royal Academy of Engineering in 1992.\n\nThe Academy’s current logo is inspired by the Neolithic hand-axe, humans' first technological advance, which was taken to be a symbol appropriate to the Academy, supposedly representative of the ever-changing relationship between humanity and technology.\n\nThe Academy's premises, 3-4 Carlton House Terrace, are in a Grade I listed building overlooking St James’s Park, designed by celebrated architect John Nash and owned by the Crown Estates. The Academy shares the Terrace with two of its sister academies, the British Academy and the Royal Society as well as other institutes.\n\nThe building was renamed Prince Philip House,<ref[http://www.princephiliphouse.com/</ref> in honour of the Senior Fellow, after renovation works were completed in 2012. Prince Philip House is also available for venue hire for meetings or events.\n\nThe President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the elected officer of the Academy, presides over meetings of the Council. The President is elected for a single term of not more than five years.\n\nThe Fellowship currently includes over 1,500 engineers from all sectors and disciplines of engineering. The Fellows, distinguished by the title Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering and the postnominal designation FREng, lead, guide and contribute to the Academy’s work and provide expertise.\n\nUp to 60 engineers are elected each year by their peers. Honorary and International Fellows who have made exceptional contributions to engineering are also elected and are entitled to use respectively the designatory letters HonFREng and FREng after their name.\n\nThe criteria for election are stated in the charter, statutes, and regulations document. The essential attributes of excellence in engineering \ninclude:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current President of the Academy is Professor Dame Ann Dowling OM, DBE, FREng, FRS, the first woman to hold the office. The Immediate Past President is Sir John Parker GBE FREng. \n\nThe Royal Fellows of the Academy comprise Prince Philip, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and Anne, Princess Royal.\n\nThe Academy is instrumental in two policy alliances set up in 2009 to provide coherent advice on engineering education and policy across the profession: Education for Engineering and \"Engineering the Future\".\n\nThe Academy is one of four agencies that receives funding from the UK's Department for Business Innovation & Skills for activities that support government policy on public understanding of science and engineering.\n\nAs part of its programme to communicate the benefits and value of engineering to society, the Academy publishes a quarterly magazine, Ingenia. The Academy says that Ingenia is written for a non-specialist audience and is \"aimed at all those with an interest in engineering, whether working in business and industry, government, academia or the financial community\". The Academy also makes Ingenia available to A-Level students in 3,000 schools in the UK. \n\nThe Academy strives to ensure that the pool of candidates for election to The Fellowship better reflects the diverse make-up of society as a whole. It set up the Proactive Membership Committee in 2008 to identify and support the nomination of candidates from underrepresented areas, with the aim of boosting the number of women candidates, engineers from industry and Small and Medium Enterprises, those from emerging technologies and ethnically diverse backgrounds.\n\n\n"}

Founded by renowned social entrepreneurs Florian Hoffmann and Katherin Kirschenmann in 2013, the DO School runs around 40 programs in over 27 countries for 7,000 participants. Since its inception The DO School has created more than 100 new products and services across multiple industries, impacting more than 3,000,000 lives. Clients include BMW, H&M, Unilever, Covestro, Osram, Google, Hong Kong Jockey Club, the United Nations, and the City of New York.\n\nThe DO School offers different training programs for emerging social entrepreneurs as well as established organizations. The programs vary in length, focus and target group.\n\nThe DO School’s Entrepreneurship for Good Program empowers social entrepreneurs to launch their own social ventures. Students (known as Fellows in the context of the Entrepreneurship for Good Program) spend 10 weeks on a DO School campus completing a Challenge set by an organization while working through a curriculum built around the DO School Method for creating and implementing innovation. Previous challengers have included, among others, Messe Berlin and H&M Germany. Challenges focus on areas central to good business and innovation, e.g. sustainability, professional development or bottom billion business. By the end of the 10-week period, the Fellows present a solution to the given Challenge that should be ready to implement. In addition, they should have refined their venture idea and business plan. In the following 10 months of the program, Fellows work on setting up their social enterprises in their home countries, with guidance and support from the DO School team. The school currently accepts up to 80 students per year over four different programs.\n\nThe Innovation Program is a three-week, on-campus program which invites aspiring social entrepreneurs to work on an innovation Challenge set by an organization. Using the DO School Method, Challenge participants co-create a concrete, hands-on solution, with or without involvement from the organizations’ employees. Unlike the Entrepreneurship for Good Program, this compact Challenge format does not involve a venture component during which participants work on launching their own start-up.\n\nThe DO Camp is an intensive 5-day workshop during which participants learn to use the DO School Method to take them from ideation to implementation. As of 2016, DO Camps have been announced for New York City, Phnom Penh and Singapore\n\nThe Intrapreneurship Program is a four-month training program for organizations and their employees. It combines theoretical training sessions with practical work an internal Challenge set by that organization. The Intrapreneurship Program aims to teach employees the entrepreneurial and innovation skills they need to drive innovation within their companies while they simultaneously work on devising a concrete solution to the Challenge.\n\nLeading for Impact is offered to university students committed to the topic of social impact. The two-phase Program trains students in self-development and entrepreneurial skill. The first edition of Leading for Impact was offered exclusively to University of Oxford students by Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship at the Saïd Business School and the DO School. As of 2016, Leading for Impact has also branched out to Tsinghua University in China.\n\nInnovate NYC brings together students from 10 universities in New York City. For the program’s first edition, which runs from January 2016 to July 2016, students are asked to find concrete answers to the city’s shortage of workspaces for start-ups and entrepreneurs. Beyond that, the aim of the program consists in equipping students with transferable skills in entrepreneurship and innovation as well as to increase retention rates for at-risk students. The program is offered in collaboration with the Center for Economic Transformation at NYCEDC.\n\nThe DO School holds partnerships with a variety of organizations.\n\nAmongst the DO School’s partners are Newman's Own Foundation, H&M Germany, Messe Berlin, Covestro and the Westerwelle Foundation.\n\n"}

The participating students come from a diverse set of educational systems (countries or regional jurisdictions of countries) in terms of economic development, geographical location, and population size. In each of the participating educational systems, a minimum of 4,500 to 5,000 students is evaluated. Contextual data about the conditions in which participating students learn mathematics and science are collected from the students and their teachers, their principals, and their parents via questionnaires.\n\nTIMSS is one of the studies established by IEA aimed at allowing educational systems worldwide to compare students' educational achievement and learn from the experiences of others in designing effective education policy. This assessment was first conducted in 1995, and has been administered every four years thereafter. Therefore, some of the participating educational systems have trend data across assessments from 1995 to 2015. TIMSS assesses 4th and 8th grade students, while TIMSS Advanced assesses students in the final year of secondary school in advanced mathematics and physics. \n\nA precursor to TIMSS was the First International Mathematics Study (FIMS) performed in 1964 in 11 countries for students aged 13 and in the final year of secondary education (FS) under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). This was followed in 1970-71 by the First International Science Study (FISS) for students aged 10, 14, and FS. Fourteen countries tested 10-year olds; 16 countries tested the older two groups. These were replicated between 1980 and 1984.\n\nThese early studies were revised and combined by the IEA to create TIMSS, which was first administered in 1995. It was the largest international student assessment study of its time and evaluated students in five grades. In the second cycle (1999) only eighth-grade students were tested. In the next cycles (2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015) both 4th and 8th grade students were assessed. The 2011 cycle was performed in the same year as the IEA's Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), offering a comprehensive assessment of mathematics, science and reading for the countries participating in both studies. The sixth cycle was conducted in 2015, and the results were released in 2016; the data set was published in February 2017. TIMSS 2015 included data collected from parents for the first time. TIMSS Advanced, previously conducted in 1995 and 2008, was also conducted in 2015, and assessed final-year secondary students' achievement in advanced mathematics and physics. Policy-relevant data about curriculum emphasis, technology use, and teacher preparation and training accompanies the TIMSS Advanced results.\n\nAlong with the overall students’ achievement data, TIMSS comprehensive assessments include data on student performance in various mathematics and science domains (algebra, geometry, biology, chemistry, etc.) and on performance in the problem solving challenges in each of these contexts. In addition, TIMSS provides contextual data on crucial curricular, instructional, and resource-related factors that can impact the teaching and learning process. These data are gathered using student, teacher, school, and curriculum (national) questionnaires filled out by students, teachers, school principals and National Research Coordinators, respectively.\n\nAccording to the TIMSS 2011 international results in mathematics, “The TIMSS mathematics achievement scales were established in TIMSS 1995 based on the achievement distribution across all participating countries, treating each country equally. At each grade level, the scale center point of 500 was set to correspond to the mean of the overall achievement distribution, and 100 points on the scale was set to correspond to the standard deviation. Achievement data from subsequent TIMSS assessment cycles were linked to these scales so that increases or decreases in average achievement may be monitored across assessments. TIMSS uses the scale center point as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment”.\n\nBecause TIMSS is administered in four-year cycles, it enables participating counties to use the results between the fourth and eighth grades to track the changes in achievement and certain background factors from an earlier study. For example, results of the fourth grade in TIMSS 1995 can be compared with the results of the eighth grade in TIMSS 1999, as fourth graders had become eighth graders in the next cycle of study.\n\nThe collected information is presented in different formats. For example, for TIMSS 2015 the results are presented as TIMSS International Results in Science TIMSS International Results in Science and TIMSS International Results in Mathematics. The TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia provides an overview of how mathematics and science are taught in each participating country. Methods and Procedures in TIMSS 2015 documents the development of the TIMSS assessments and questionnaires, and describes the methods used. The TIMSS 2015 User Guide for the International Database describes the content and format of the data in the TIMSS 2015 International Database. The fully documented TIMSS 2015 international database can be downloaded.\n\nThe IEA has developed an application for working with data from TIMSS and other IEA large-scale assessments called the . This application allows researchers to combine data files and facilitates some types of statistical analysis (such as computing means, percentages, percentiles, correlations, and estimating single level multiple linear regression). The application takes into account the complex sample structure of the databases when calculating the statistics and their standard errors. It also allows researchers to estimate achievement scores and their standard errors.\n\nFor an overview of the IEA study results and interpretation of information, the IEA's can come in handy.\n\nIn TIMSS 1995, there were 41 educational systems in five grades (third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and the final year of secondary school). In 1999, TIMSS only focused on the eighth grade in 38 educational systems; there was no study done for the fourth grade in that year. In TIMSS 2003, there were 26 educational systems for the fourth grade and 48 for the eighth grade. In TIMSS 2007, 44 educational systems participated in the fourth grade and 57 educational systems in the eighth grade. TIMSS 2011 had 52 participating educational systems for the fourth grade and 45 for the eighth grade.\n\nIn TIMSS 2015, nationally representative samples of students in 57 countries and 7 benchmarking entities participated in the fourth grade assessment, the eighth grade assessment, or both. \n\nTIMSS 2019 will be the seventh cycle of TIMSS, reporting overall achievement as well as results according to international benchmarks, by major content domains (number, algebra, and geometry in mathematics, and earth science, biology, and chemistry in science), and by cognitive domains (knowing, applying, and reasoning). Like the previous TIMSS assessments (conducted in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015), the study will collect detailed information about curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources. TIMSS 2019 is focusing on converting to a digital format (eTIMSS 2019). Fourth-grade students can interact with geometric shapes and patterns to demonstrate their mastery of fractions and symmetry, or arrange square flower boxes to explore the relationship between perimeter and area. Eighth-grade students can help to design a storage building by calculating its dimensions, or plan a plant growth experiment and see the results. Other tasks will assess students’ knowledge in areas covered by the TIMSS frameworks, including algebra, data and chance, physics, and chemistry.\neTIMSS will continue all the benefits of TIMSS, enabling countries to measure how effective they are in teaching mathematics and science. \n\nThe TIMSS 1999 Video Study was a study of eighth-grade mathematics and science teaching in seven countries. The study involved videotaping and analyzing teaching practices in more than one thousand classrooms. In conjunction with the IEA, the study was conducted by the US National Center for Education Statistics, and the US Department of Education under a contract with LessonLab, Inc. of Los Angeles, California.\n\nTIMSS depends on the collaboration of a large number of individuals and organizations around the world including the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, IEA's offices in Amsterdam and Hamburg, Statistics Canada, and Educational Testing Service (ETS). In the United States, TIMSS is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education. Data for US students is further tracked for ethnic and racial groups. TIMSS is mainly funded by the participating countries. Also, the US National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education and the World Bank provide major support funding for the assessments.\n\n\nHanushek and Woessmann developed a methodology to rescale 14 different international comparisons of math and / or science achievement to make them comparable. This includes the FIMS, FISS, and PISA, mentioned above, with TIMSS.\n\n"}

On September 20, 2002, it was seen by the 30 millionth viewer.\n\nAs museum orientation films go, \"Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot\" is a landmark, both because of its high production values and structure.\n\nIt was filmed in May 1956 at Colonial Williamsburg. Whereas the usual 35mm flat-screen 1.33:1 ratio cinematography would have been considered extravagant for an orientation film, \"Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot\" was filmed and exhibited in VistaVision, a high definition widescreen process with approximately the same negative size as 35mm still photography. It was a unique VistaVision film in that it was shown with six-channel stereo sound, whereas most films in that process were either shown in mono or in Perspecta sound. The music for the film was composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann, who was at the time best known for scoring several Alfred Hitchcock films.\n\nMoreover, where previous museum orientation films (and many present day examples) are simple travelogues, with little or no narrative content, \"Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot\" told the story of Virginia's role in American Independence (up to the point of voting to propose independence at the Second Continental Congress), from the point of view of John Fry (played by a young Jack Lord), a fictional Virginia planter elected to the House of Burgesses. While it was filmed almost entirely in and around the Colonial Williamsburg Historic Area, and points out a number of the historic buildings by name, it is overwhelmingly a dramatization of history, rather than a travelogue.\n\nA pair of specially-designed theaters each seating 250 persons were built for showing the film, as part of the new visitors center being built at the time. It was previewed for an audience including the Governor of Virginia and members of the Virginia General Assembly on the evening of March 30, and formally opened March 31, 1957.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the film was translated into several languages for personal speakers that could be used by international visitors.\n\nBy the 1990s, the film was showing its age, with severe fading problems in the original negatives, and differing shrinkage rates in the separation masters that had been made as a backup. As a result, even new prints looked no better than a 16mm orientation film would have looked.\n\nIn 2001, an extensive digital restoration effort was begun, the result of which debuted (in relatively conventional 70mm DTS prints) in 2004. This is generally regarded as coming as close as present-day technology permits to replicate the clarity of the film as originally shown in the late 1950s. It is estimated that despite the 35 minute running-time of this film, the restoration required enough digital storage to hold several feature-length films.\n\nAs of 2007, \"Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot\" has been released on DVD, available from the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.\n\n\n"}
